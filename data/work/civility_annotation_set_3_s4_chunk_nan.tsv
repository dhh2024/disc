The boy was lazy, couldn’t make it through college, couldn’t hold a job very long, and finally was divorced by his wife after years of carrying all the load while he took pills and basically didn’t contribute. About five years after he got divorced, he ended up dying of an accidental drug overdose and leaving his two children without a dad all because he was entitled, spoiled, and lazy. Meanwhile his sister who wasn’t fawned over has succeeded in her field and makes bank, and is enjoying her grandchildren. The females in this family are going to have much more productive lives, but I can see the sons marrying and expecting their poor wives to wait on them hand and foot. The mother is creating helpless males. She probably was raised this way, but it’s time for her to butt out and let her kids become functioning adults.	46	0

You receive a service, and you're allowed to post a review regarding that service. If this lady didn't think your nails/her work was crap, she wouldn't have a issue with your post.

It's time to update your post to say you don't recommend this lady or her work, and she has since contacted you and insulted you, your nails and stated she did a crap job because of the ""state of your nails"".

As others have stated, a good professional in this field can work with any length nails. She's rude and unprofessional, and you should advice people of her attitude and professional limitations.	239	0

My four year old has just helped me pick out presents for 2 of her friends and expressed an interest in using each of them 'first'. Quick reminder that these were for 'X' and 'Y', never mentioned again. She's even helped me wrap them and is excited to give them away. Both are things she's put on her Christmas list. If a 4 year old can get it and a 9 year old can't, then those parents need to develop a spine. NTA	1	0

He doesn't think you can have guy friends or even speak to a guy because you will cheat. If there is no trust there is no relationship. 

Flip it round. Can he have a friend that is a woman? Can he talk to women? In your eyes of course he can! Because men are just mindless sex robots and unfaithful. You trust him. He doesn't trust you. And maybe that is because he wouldn't trust himself in your shoes and he would cheat. 

I know he says it is because of his past. But he hasn't moved past it and now believes that anyone would act like his ex. You, or him. How do you even know what he has said about his ex is true with the level of control and shame he is trying to put on you.	3	0

Vegans don't hold a monopoly on the right to not eat things. The processed fake meat many vegans eat makes some unsuspecting people just as ill as meat makes them.	0	1

Giving her a piece of heirloom jewelry from his family is showing her she’s important. That’s saying he wants her to be a part of his family. It also shows trust because he is giving something that is part of his history and he is entrusting her with it. 

She doesn’t have to explain anything, she doesn’t have to tell anyone she’s engaged until she gets the ring they shop together for. She can simply say they are going to go pick out rings next weekend.	0	0

And they have medicine that can help with it now. Its awful because my abdomen can be in actual pain from how much I've eaten, while my body SCREAMS to me that it needs more food. Other times I'm so hungry that even the abdominal discomfort doesnt happen but I eat 3x as much as I would normally because it feels like an empty hole in my stomach and nothing will fill it. Point being, lots of pain and very difficult to stop eating.

I didnt find out what was wrong until a few years after I became diabetic and mentioned it to a doctor, but my whole life I've had this issue. My family nickname was hungry, I heard the hi hungry I'm dad jokes plenty (which is not funny when you're in actual pain from needing food and your dad is making idiotic jokes), and my mom once had cps called from the school because I was always complaining that I was hungry. She had to show them full cupboards and accessable snacks to show I wasnt being starved.	5	0

My mother just drank and shopped until they had an ugly ass divorce a couple years ago. I responded by being so incredibly irresponsible that I have a record now (that I’m thankfully expunging most of) and a prior drug habit. But after I grew up a lot and my son’s death he stepped up, took me in, and is helping me piece together my life so that I can have the future I should’ve had 5 years ago. OP needs to take responsibility for how he raised his children to have their habits and reactions. It didn’t come from nowhere.	6	0
