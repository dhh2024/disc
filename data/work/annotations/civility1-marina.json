    "selftext": "EDIT #2: \n\n\nGreat talk folks. This did not change my view, but it DID enlighten me as to why my view is comparatively rare---clearly folks think that, if you have a physical advantage over someone, you should give them leeway, and that if you have to hit them, it should be with a bias towards 'lightness.\n\n\nI don't agree with either of those, but I do believe a rational person could hold those opinions. \n\n\nThanks, this was easily the biggest thread I've ever started on here. Some bright folks that I respect, in a sub that has a phenomenal culture, but I retire. \n\n\nAgree to disagree\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis has been fascinating. I think this sub is full of very reasonable ppl. So far, I no one has moved me, and it may not occur, but I admire the reasoned debate.\n\n\nMost responses have hinged on \"proportionate response\"---the idea that maybe he should have hit her softer. I've said it numerous times in here, but I think that is an unreasonable standard based on gendered rules and hindsight---he should have hit her hard enough to stop her but not hard enough to hurt her(?), or maybe just restrained her because he's so strong. Keep in mind---The only way we now know that she is no match for him is because he knocked her out. That could not have been known beforehand to a level that lets us know that he should've hit her 46% less hard. \n\n\nIt's in the moment, she's aggressive and escalating, and he still took multiple hits before retaliating, and only hit her once.  YOU ARE NOT BEING REALISTIC IF YOU THINK HE SHOULD HAVE RESTRAINED HER LIKE A 3 YEAR OLD. She is stronger than a 3 year old, and the other bar patrons wouldn't have allowed it. He would be vulnerable. The goal of a fight is to end a fight, and the threat to yourself, not to make sure the other combatant is definitely not hurt. \n\n\nAn easy to test your argument for this sort of unrealistic gender accommodation and bias: Replace the lady with Michael Cera. \n\n\nShould Mixon restrain Michael Cera, who grabs his neck and hits his face?\n\n\nShould Mixon tap Michael Cera and hope he is chastened and willingly retreats?\n\n\nMichael Cera would not be being treated like a victim here because he's an adult, and would've been the aggressor, even though he's likely closer in strength to this lady than he is to a D1 running back. \n\n\nFrom now on, I will be responding to gendered arguments with Michael Cera substitutions, to save time. \n\n---——\n\n\nThis is prompted by a recent video released that shows college running back Joe Mixon in a confrontation with a woman. \n\n\nThe video shows them standing, then the woman pushes Mixon with both hands, then he \"pump fakes\" at her (presumably a threat), then she grabs him by the throat and hits him in the face, then he strikes her head and she is knocked out of frame. After that, He immediately leaves. \n\n\nHe was suspended, he apologized, etc. She is suing, and is referred to as \"the victim\".\n\n\nI believe he did nothing wrong. I believe he is the victim. \n\n\nThis is an example of a gendered rule that I think is commonly applied in the U.S., At least: men are expected to never hit women. I think this rule is unfair, unsafe, and unrealistic.\n\n\nI don't think men should hit women, but nor should women hit men. \n\n\nI don't think there is a rule about hitting that should only go one way.  \n\n\nDon't beat your wife...or husband. \n\n\nNo one should be allowed to hit a woman....or man. \n\n\nAnd conversely\n\n\nYou have a right to defend yourself, no matter your gender...or the gender of your attacker. \n\n\nMixon was punished, and some say it was not enough.\n\n\nI would consider my view changed if someone could describe an instance where it's ok for a woman to hit, or not ok for a man to hit, where gender is a determining factor (where you could say \"he was wrong to hit her\" but not \"that person was wrong to hit that person\"). I'm looking for a moral\/philosophical pov, rather than a \"holding the door, standing when a woman leaves the table\" chivalry pov. \n\n\nHolding the door for women doesn't ruin men's careers or send them to jail, but in our society, defending yourself from physical abuse might, if you're a man and your attacker is a woman. \n\n\nCmv",

    "ancestor_text": "Tisarwat @ 2016-12-22 15:24:29 :\n\nThere should be a rule about *proportionate retaliation*.\n\n**Strength against weakness**\n\nIf someone who was 4 ft and had a degenerative muscular illness slapped a 6ft wrestler, the wrestler would not be justified in responding with full force. This is an extreme example but demonstrates the disparity in strength without mentioning gender. \n\n**Strength against strength** \n\nIf two people around the same height got into a scrap, with similar body types, then incapacitating force would be acceptable. Note that I don't say equal force- we can't calculate that in the split second, and the first instinct is self defence. There would also have to be a reasonable margin of error because again, exact calculations are difficult and the defender may overestimate their attacker's strength. \n\n\n**Gender and Averages**\n\nHow this relates to gender: as many people point out, women tend to be physically smaller and weaker than men. This isn't always the case- there's a lot of overlap, as we would expect with such large groups. \n\nThe problem is that in the past it has been generalised to mean that all women are weak, and all men are strong, so a violent response from a man is never proportionate. Instead it should be judged contextually- this woman was strong and fit, or particularly vicious, or that man was a bodybuilder, or had a disability that made him vulnerable. \n\nThat means that gender won't be directly used as a metric. But because of the general fact that women are physically smaller and weaker, there will still be a correlation that physical retaliation should be minimised against women. It absolutely should not be framed like that since it leads to this kind of absolute rule that is detrimental. But it will have a milder correlative force. \n\n\n**The purpose of a violent response**\n\nLast point: the reason for limiting retaliation is not 'this person can weather the damage', it's this person could, unless limited, deal out disproportionate harm. So it's not saying that men (or strong people, if my example is being followed) can never retaliate. It's saying they shouldn't do it at full strength because that's punitive rather than defensive. That's why so far I've ignored weapons- they totally change a strength dynamic. A weak person with a knife poses a much greater that against an unarmed yet strong opponent than without one. Guns even more so. In such a situation them retaliation could be much stronger- not because it's suddenly okay to hurt weak people but because the danger faced is greatly increased, so it is reasonable to respond to disarm the threat.\n\n**Regarding the video**\n\nthe issue is disproportionate response. Ignoring what might have been said, she was relatively small and did not seem to include much force in her attack. He was clearly very strong, and appeared to knock her out. The retaliation was much greater than the threat, to the point where it seemed retributive rather than defensive. \n\n**Tl;Dr** it's not okay for women to hurt men but bad vice versa. It's an issue of proportionate response to violence based on strength\/ danger. In a situation where all parties are unarmed, this will tend to fall along gendered lines. The important thing is not to generalise this to mean ALL men or ALL women, but to judge based on context.  \n--------------------------------\n\nDocGrey187000 @ 2016-12-22 15:40:34 :\n\nThis is a well-reasoned response. \n\n\nFew things: \n\n\nShe did not appear to be alone. \n\n\nHe did appear to be alone (at least he left alone).\n\n\nThey're in a restaurant full of knives, in a country full of guns. \n\n\nHe's not a cop or ju jitsu master, he's just some 19 yr old. \n\n\nI agree all the way that you use proportionate force, but let's not operate with perfect hindsight: a common philosophy is to end a fight ASAP, once it can't be avoided. \n\n\nHe hit her once. \n\n\nHe left. \n\n\nHe didn't gloat, stand over her, kick her. \n\n\nI think that, within range, he did the minimum to end the fight. He doesn't have cuffs, or a Vulcan neck pinch at his disposal. Any one in that bar could hit him over the head with a bottle, or shoot him as he wrestles to restrain his smaller enemy. \n\n\nHe shut her off, and left. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nZoidbergluver @ 2016-12-22 18:19:05 :\n\nWhy does him being alone matter?\n\nWhy does being \"in a country full of guns\" matter? Did she have a weapon on her person or directly accessible? No. So your logic is faulty. Being in the same country as a gun does not mean he can respond as if she has a weapon. He would need to have reasonable suspicion that she *actually* had a weapon. \n\nHe isn't \"just a 19 year old\". He plays college football, a sport where his entire job is hitting others. You don't play college football as an average 19 year old. He is a massive man. \n\nHe left. He didn't call the cops, didn't make sure she was okay, he left her to die (for all he knew). \n\nAnd again, was his degree of violence proportionate? She slapped his face and he knocked her out, breaking bones in her face. Does that seem right to you? Regardless of gender?",

The Harlem Renaissance is an important part of black American history and identity, and it flies in the face of this anti-intellectual stereotype.

Martin Luther King was a doctor, and nobody accuses him of acting white because of his education. If you visit an African American history museum I doubt you'll find any exhibits documenting anti-intellectualism as a significant philosophy among black Americans.",

    "selftext": "Preface: I am a white 27 male from USA, and I mastered in sociology with emphasis on race relations. My stepdad is a black Muslim and the amount of racism I have experienced by association is appalling. So understand that while yes, I have a white background with undeniable privilege, I also empathize deeply for black  people and the daily pain they endure. I can never understand truly what I means to be black. And I admit that. This post is not about calling black people \"wrong\", or that black culture is \"bad\". So please do not see this as me attacking black culture but rather my views on why black people have not reached true equality.\n\nCMV post : \n\nBlack culture historically emerged from slavery and the struggle of being poor and underprivileged in white societys. This is an overgeneralization, but it is important to realize the foundation of black culture came from oppression and poverty.\n\nMany black people who become successful in America have become successful by adopting a \"white narrative\". Or rather they \"act white\" to get ahead. Black people generally gaze down upon other blacks who act white. And reasonably so. However I believe this \"negative perspective\" of \"acting white\" ultimately keeps black people as a whole from rising up. I believe this because subconsciously black people associate \"intelligence\" with being white. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is that white people in America don't actually have a \"culture\" distinct from being American. A white person merely says they are \"American\", where a black person identifies as a \"black American\" (again, an overgeneralization, I know). But by and large being black is an identity on its own that comes into question every day of their lives, a question whites don't need to engage with. \n\nGiven that \"white culture\" doesn't exactly exist in the same way, it could be said that black people are not resisting \"white culture, but rather that black people are resisting \"intellectualism\" (the exercise of the intellect at the expense of emotions).\n\nLet me explain, black culture entails several main components, like every culture: dress, language, attitude, emotions, perspectives, a collective history and etc. With black culture in America, their culture derived from slavery and the struggles of being poor (due to white oppression). Being poor and uneducated and unable to read for centuries lead to a language that, in all reality, is a poor version of English (not the black slang but the actual language used). Uneducated black people for centuries passed on their belief systems to future generations, including the distain for white people (and everything they represent) and today we have a culture that is in many regards \"intellectually resistant\". I say this because when a black person looks at a successful white person, they say it's because they are white with privlidge, but a successful black person would never claim their success is from acting white but rather working hard and educating yourself. \n\nThe most successful black people in America (apart from musicians, artist and the like), are successful by and large because they \"acted white\". They speak like white people, they act like white people, they got an education, and they pursued white careers. But nothing is objectively \"white or black\", things just are.  By insisting some activities are white and others are black is a poor way of thinking and it limits what opportunities you pursue in life if you refuse to do \"white activities\". \n\nAs I stated above, however, is that white people don't have culture, they just are \"American\". So whenever a black person chased the \"American dream\", other black people scold them for \"acting white\". My argument though is not that they are acting white, but rather they educated themselves to the point of realizing the struggle between black and whites in terms of obtaining success is strictly determined by the effort you put in. \n\nWhite and black people would get along better if we all saw ourselves as American rather than white and black Americans. White people feel more uncomfortable around blacks than any other race (except maybe Muslims, but that's only been the past 20ish years) mostly because white people have no way of relating to them. \n\nWhite people feel uncomfortable not because of \"black culture\", but because black culture promotes the ideology of the white man being evil. And in the past this was true. But I feel at this point, black people need to take responsibility for their current state. They are keeping themselves oppressed by not integrating with white\/American culture. They can't keep blaming white people for everything. If you haven't gotten ahead its because you haven't tried. Getting ahead in America means getting an education. If black people let go of black culture, white people wouldn't feel so threatened. If black people wouldn't act so \"hard\", white people wouldn't feel so threatened. And the irony is that black people feel they need to uphold this culture, but in reality it is the only thing preventing them at this point from being equal to whites. (most) Whites don't see themselves as being white, a privilege often attributed to white people from black people. But I'm not sure it's a privilege, as black people are \"choosing\" their culture. They are choosing to be \"black\" instead of American. It's okay to Honor your heritage, but resisting \"white culture\" (ie American culture) is the best way of obtaining what you want (ie equality).\n\nI know there are many systemic reasons responsible for black oppression and the development of their culture in general, but in today's world, equality is truly possible, but white people can't do anything more for the black communities. Black people need to start acting like Americans, not gangsters. Because that gangster vibe is not inviting. Even educated black people don't find the gangster vibe inviting. And it's because the gangster attitude is a attitude derived from fear of the white man. Making yourself look hard and threatening, while yes keeps white people away from you, it also keeps you away from the \"answer\" black people are striving for: peace, equality and equal opportunity.\n\nThink about it. If you owned a business, would you rather hire a thug, or a black person who is educated and uses proper English (yes, I said \"proper English\", not white english\")? White people don't discriminate you because your black, but because of your attitude. \n\nTo summerize: black culture is a self created culture of resistance that depends on resisting white culture. White culture doesn't exist, and so what is actually being resisted is intellectualism (ie, the exercise of your intellect at the expense of your emotions). By holding onto a history of poverty and a culture defined by poverty, black people ultimately will never find equality until they realize being intelligent and using proper english doesn't equate to being white, it equates to success. When white people see blacks make an effort to stop distinguishing themselves as a separate entity, white people won't feel so threatened and their passive racism will fall away, as the \"nigga identity\" is what whites hate about blacks, not their actual skin color. Stop acting like a nigga and you'll stop being treated as one.\n\nEdit: before anyone posts, I want to state that I know blatant racism exists in America still, and that simply pursuing intellectualism will not erase all the problems, but it's the only way to begin the process towards equality. There will always be racism, but by and large I feel there is too much blame being put on white people and not enough emphasis being places on personal responsibility.\n\nIf black people erased their perceived stereotypes, I guareebte there would be less police shootings too, as cops wouldn't immediately assume a black guy is a thug or criminal. Unfortunately I know white people created black peoples problems, but at this point, what else can white people do? We live in a world of stereotypes and prejudge people based on them. And there is much truth in stereotypes. If black people as a whole rose above their stereotypes and created new ones for themselves, they wouldn't appear as a perceived threat to whites anymore. And the relations between the two groups would settle",

    "selftext": "I will present what I call \"The Philosopher's Dilemma\".\n\nMany of the issues in philosophy have been debated numerous times throughout the millennia, with countless theses and counter-theses through the ages across the Earth on various subjects and questions. Some philosophers claim that the ideas of their time and place are the best ideas to go with and go with those out of a belief in progress or something like that. \n\nThe vast majority of philosophers that won't lean towards a side and consider evidence on both sides equally (in)valid will merely conform to society's opinions because that is all they've ever known in real life. Any philosopher that takes a view that is shunned by the majority of philosophers will either conform under pressure or be largely unsuccessful in getting their views across to the masses.\n\nThe reason that I'm saying this is because most of the questions haven't changed in millennia, and some questions are literally impossible to know purely empirically. These questions are nothing more than a waste of time that could be spent on other things. Any opposing view gets shut down by the other philosophers and the masses.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to say that getting into logic and rhetoric would provide the same degree of critical thinking as philosophy.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Logic is one of the first classes any philosophy major takes. Especially philosophers in the analytic tradition (America and England). If you’re applying logic to problems like these you’re already philosopher.\n\nAnd I don’t really understand. First you say philosophy should be dismissed because there is too much consensus and everyone toes a party line. Now you at it should be dismissed because there is too much consensus?",

It's a term that already existed; It's been an issue in many films before Star Wars.\n\n- The cast is diverse: That isn't inherently social justice commentary\n\n- The selling guns commentary is political, but it isn't social justice commentary\n\n- The Chewbacca choosing not to eat a porg scene isn't political.

It's one I had considered, but you're the first to make this argument.\n\nYou're right that minstrel shows didn't directly hurt anyone.\n\nHowever, the reason I see things as different now is because of the evolution of the practice of blackface.  Historically (If my understanding is correct), throughout the 19th century, blackface was most frequently used with the intention to ridicule, mock and demean.  What I would call 'innocent' blackface was less common or, at least, less publicized.  As such, it would be fair to assume that if someone you don't know has a darkened face, they're likely to be intending offense.\n\n\nIn the 21st century, the practice of using blackface to demean, mock or ridicule is (I think) rare.  So it is no longer fair to assume that if someone you don't know has a darkened face, they're likely to be intending offense.  Its much more likely that they're being interpreted as offensive without actually intending it.\n\nIf I'm mistaken about the commonness of truly mocking blackface (and I don't mean the idea that \"all blackface is mocking\") in the 21st century, then I'd like to know.

    "selftext": "Recently I have noticed a trend in language used to discuss relationships. It seems like the term \"abuse\" gets thrown around to describe everything from infidelity to even slightly mean behaviour. On threads like [this one](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/4d5sxs\/my_28f_boyfriend_30m_1_year_thinks_its_ok_to\/) a boyfriend says that since he censors his offensive language when making jokes, that his girlfriend should make an effort to curb her annoying linguistic habits. Is this stupid? Yes. But in the comment it gets called out as abusive many times.\n\nI feel like describing this somewhat dickish behaviour as abusive is harmful. There are people who experience serious abuse. Abuse where animalistic terror is inflicted on them because they are genuinely afraid for their safety. Where the place that they consider home is the least safe place to be. Where the sick individuals who inflict this on them are okay with hurting children and making their lives a living hell. And the only word to describe these people is \"abusers.\" Equating someone who's kinda a jerk to these people is harmful. Abusers should be unforgivable pariahs, not someone who got in an argument with a SO. The word should have power and it should be used carefully. To accuse someone of abuse should be akin to accusing them of rape. It should have heft behind it. The dilution of the term is harmful. CMV.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

    "ancestor_text": "diyaww @ 2016-04-04 19:56:47 :\n\nThere are multiple types of abuse, including physical, emotional, sexual, economic, and more. \n\nAll types of abuse, not just physical, can traumatize a victim by threatening their sense of security and autonomy. For example, if I force you to stay in a relationship because I control all of your financial assets, that's abuse. You may feel you have no options except to be unhappy with me for the rest of your life, or dead.\n\nAnd that's the problem with limiting the definition of abuse. A victim may not understand that what their abuser is doing is wrong or abnormal (especially when it's not physical) - and more importantly, that there is *help*.\n\nIf a more liberal use of the word abuse causes more victims to reach out for help, that's a good thing. Maybe they call a woman's shelter or counselor and learn that they aren't actually being abused - but what if they are?\n--------------------------------\n\nronep @ 2016-04-05 04:30:18 :\n\nI'm not sure it is a good thing. I think dilution of the term abuse may make it harder to isolate people who are truly, honestly terrible people. Let's say 30% of people call the guy who occasionally uses \"cunt\" in a joking manner abusive means that when you want to use a word to describe terrible, terrible abuse where the other person wants to kill themselves, you have no word for it. You've already cried wolf on the guy who jokes around. Calling him a wolf and the guy who beats his wife a wolf means wolf now means nothing.\n--------------------------------\n\ndiyaww @ 2016-04-05 05:12:10 :\n\nIt sounds like you want the term \"abuser\" to be a kind of scarlet letter that only true abusers wear. \n\nTry looking it at it from a victim's point of view: if you think abuse has a very narrow definition, maybe you don't seek help if your husband keeps you constantly hungry, because you still have food and shelter. Maybe you don't seek help because you live a comfortable lifestyle, even though your partner demeans you constantly and makes you feel worthless, stupid, and undeserving of life.\n\nThe fact is that there is a wide variety of types and combinations of abuse. We want victims to speak out. In this case, it's better to get more false positives by widening the scope than to more false negatives by narrowing the scope. We don't want victims to think, \"you know, abuse is a really strong word. My partner loves me, he's not capable of doing something that bad. It's probably not abuse.\" \n\nWe call someone a criminal whether they've committed tax fraud or killed someone. If we need more context, we can ask for it. If, after hearing that context, we think they deserve a scarlet letter we send them to jail and give them a record. But *only* if their victim comes forward.\n--------------------------------\n\nronep @ 2016-04-05 05:50:37 :\n\nBut you're speaking as if the only solution to those situations is labelling everything as abuse. Your partner can love you and still be a dick that you shouldn't be with. I know plenty of people that shouldn't be in relationships with people that love them. Saying \"if we don't call that abuse then the victims will be fine with it\" is silly. That's using up the current power that the word abuse has to change a current situation, but it's short sighted.\n\nIf we use abuse to describe low-level negative dickeshness, then it will lose its power and meaning.\n\nIt *should* be a scarlet letter. It *should* brand people as bad people. It should only be used to describe behaviour that society thinks of as absolutely reprehensible. Broadening the scope now and sweeping up a whole bunch of false positives weakens it for future use.\n\nYour criminal example, I think, is weak. Because the sub-terms are weak. \"Abuser\" means both someone who's kinda a dick, and someone who can be charged with murder. But what are the sub-terms that are analogous to criminal? \"Really seriously actually terrible abuser\" and \"abuser\"?\n--------------------------------\n\nKlosterheim @ 2016-04-05 06:53:37 :\n\nWell yes, some people believe that the best we can do right now for the good of the many is to widen the scope of this term and similar ones. They think that the benefit of having more people come forward outweighs the problems of having more people come forward that shouldn't and changing the meaning of words somehow.\n\nYou'll concede that if someone was to take your position to its extreme, it would make for a terrible solution as well. It's a question of balance.\n\nI think that you should think about whether it really is a big deal if words lose their oomph somewhat. What does it matter if you don't have a special terrible name to describe special terrible things, aren't the things terrible enough on their own ? Wouldn't it be a good thing if we could stop calling someone something and making it a huge deal because people jump at an emotionally-charged word ? Maybe we can stop arguing the semantics of who's what, and stop dismissing each other as much.\n--------------------------------\n\nronep @ 2016-04-05 07:13:14 :\n\nI think you're underestimating the power that the oomph behinds words has. Rapist is a great example. Rapist right now is a powerful word. It destroys lives and careers when it's used. It's a big deal. It can be wielded to make rapists outcasts and isolated. But, if, 100 years from now, rapist also means, for example, making a cat-call, then nobody is going to care when you label someone as a rapist. When you need to wield the power of the word it will no longer be there. You will no longer have a single, vile word that can can immediately encompass the terrible concept you want to encompass and put it in someone's mind, and immediately form someone's opinion of them.\n\nI think you are underestimating the power of words, and the loss of power when they're diluted.",

I FULLY understand why a man would do that, but the man doesn't deserve to be beat half to death for something like that. We live in a society and we have to uphold society with guidelines.  We can't have people dishing out beatings for things that we *ALL* would perfectly understand *why* they did it right?  We as a single person in that society, do not get to dictate what is deserved, thats for society as a whole to do.  Equally, it's also not up to us to dictate what innocent lives die in order to save our own fate either, that's up to a power higher than us as well.\n\nSo what is understandable is often times not what is deserved, even if *I* FULLY understand why someone did something.\n\nSo if we don't have an actual limiting factor for what is worth killing innocents, to avoid fates, and if we also accept that 'understanding' someones actions does not necessarily *condone* or make them undeserving of consequences, I find it difficult to find any concrete stance I could accept for killing an innocent person, to save your own innocent fate.",

She killed her cat to try and “appease” the demon that was after her. Some people feel like she deserved to die after that but I don’t. In no way am I advocating that people should kill animals (I love my dog) but If someone has the choice between killing an animal or burning in hell for eternity, 99% of them would kill the animal.\n--------------------------------\n\nNearEmu @ 2021-02-05 08:46:20 :\n\n99% of them would kill the cat I probably agree, but that doesn't answer whether or not killing an innocent creature is worthy of it.  It could perfectly well mean that 99% of people deserve it for killing innocent creatures to save their own soul.  That's pretty wildly selfish.\n--------------------------------\n\nLegitimateShift8 @ 2021-02-05 09:00:40 :\n\nI get you. With that I don’t think it’s really about what someone did but rather *why* they did it. If they killed animals because they just could then yeah that’s horrible and they now deserve whatever comes to them. But if they did it to avoid a terrible fate like that, as selfish and as bad as it is, I still do think it’s understandable and doesn’t make them worthy of that kind of punishment.\n--------------------------------\n\nNearEmu @ 2021-02-05 09:32:02 :\n\nWhere would the line be I wonder?  Would it be understandable to kill 1000 innocent cats in order to save yourself from a terrible fate?  Would it be understandable to kill *ALL* innocent cats?  Or would it be understandable to kill 1 90 year old woman to avoid the terrible fate?  What is the limiting factor on how many innocent lives you are understandable to end in order to avoid your own fate?\n\nAlso does it apply in all situations or only situations that involve hell?  Would it be okay for me to kill a families cat in order to avoid the fate of going to jail?  or.... would it be understandable to simply kill my wifes cat, in order to avoid the fate of simply not wanting a cat in my house anymore?\n\nThere must be some limiting factor involved right?\n\nThis is a hell of a discussion by the way lol\n--------------------------------\n\nLegitimateShift8 @ 2021-02-05 09:42:32 :\n\nLol it really is. It’s funny that we’re this invested in scenarios from a movie that came out twelve years ago.\n\nI’m sure there is a line though where I would think someone should try and find another way of escaping their fate. And for me this action was only justifiable when it comes to avoiding hell. If someone killed a cat to avoid going to jail for something they did, it’s wrong and I have no sympathy for them at all. But if someone killed a cat to avoid hell because a scorned gypsy cursed them, I’ll still think it’s wrong, but that’s more understandable. \n\nI always kind of have the mindset that you don’t necessarily have to agree with what someone did to understand why they did it. I wouldn’t like that someone killed their pet to avoid eternal damnation, but I’d understand *why* they killed their cat to avoid eternal damnation.",

    "selftext": "Religion has had some good in the past, when people where absolutely ignorant about the world. It used to be a great tool to answer unsolvable mysteries and guide people who had no idea what the fuck life was about.\n\nHowever, it has also ALWAYS been about controlling the masses and brainwashing. These poor people constantly living in fear of chastisement by some infinitely powerful being. You better act nice now, or (insert your divinity here) will fuck you up for eternity!\n\nOh what's that? You guys believe in a different god than us? Looks like it's time for a god damn blood bath! But sure, religions are about peace and kindness, unless you don't believe in the right one.\n\nAlso I already see you guys coming with the \"oh but don't put all the apples in the same basket, there's some bad religious people, but there are some good ones too!!\" \n\nFuck that bro. The actions of those bad apples far outweigh the positive aspects of the good ones. Yes some religious people contribute to charity and stuff, but do you really need religion for that? Can't you just be a good person without it?\n\nAlso, how is no one calling them cults? It's the same fucking thing. If some nutjob claims to be the son of a god today, everyone laughs at him and calls him crazy, cause he is, but sometimes he gets a following and we're all like \"well clearly this is a cult. These people are fucking stupid to believe that this guy is any kind of divinity whatsoever\". How many of the ones who laugh at cults are actually religious? I'd bet it's a fuckton of'em, but sure, fuck introspection and let's all be hypocrites.\n\nMy final point now, some of you may argue that religion is also about spirituality and trying to better yourself as a person, it's a moral compass. Again, fuck that shit! You don't need a fucking cult leader who's been dead for thousands of years to tell you how to act. We have social norms and things that are acceptable and things that aren't. Just be a fucking adult and reflect on your actions and thoughts and better yourself that way. Most religious people, as I said earlier, only follow that \"moral compass\" to escape an imminent doom when they die, not to actually be good people. They do it out of fear, and I don't think that makes you a good person, that makes you a coward who's scared of something nonexistent.\n\nReligion should and needs to be abolished, but of course that'll never happen. Oh well.\n\nTl\/Dr : Religions are about controlling people, have been and always will be a source of violence and hatred. They are cults and need to be abolished.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I do not wish any harm or hatred towards any religious people and I am for letting people belive what they want to, live and let live. However I just think religion shouldn't be a part of our society ANYMORE. I am against religion as a CONCEPT in a MODERN society. Not against religious PEOPLE. I know religion was a pillar of humanity IN THE PAST. I do not think it is still required TODAY.\n\nThank you for your time everyone, there are some insghtful comments that made me reflect and I did soften my view on the subject. \"Abolishing\" religion was a poor choice of words, it should just die out slowly while only keeping the positive morals of it, through education. However, my view is not changed.\n\nEdit 2: Guys, I stopped carring about the post after 100 comments, stop private messaging me, I'm not going to answer lmao.",

You say religions are cults, that shows you don’t understand the difference. You think all religions are the same, or that they force people to follow rules. Literally none of them do. Jesus also isn’t dead, that’s literally the whole point of the story. And no, a random person cannot just claim they’re Jesus, that’s called an anti Christ, Jesus himself has actually been confirmed to have lived by archeologists.\n\nBefore you make an argument about how “bad” or “wrong” religions are, should do a little bit more research so that you actually know what you’re talking about.\n--------------------------------\n\nRambo2090 @ 2020-10-17 14:05:30 :\n\nJesus has been confirmed to have lived by archaeologists?

The burden of proof is on you. That some people somewhere believe something isn’t proof.\n\nMormonism is a white supremacist cult is a fact established everywhere but the u.s. Mormons themselves have had to attempt to rebrand their doctrine in light of this becoming more common knowledge in the states.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 15:24:08 :\n\nSorry but it isn’t, again, you can’t just make a claim without proving it. I’m waiting for you to actually cite that information from a legitimate source, which I guarantee you can’t do\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 15:25:34 :\n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Criticism_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints\n\nYou’re are literally just trying to avoid how you have no proof of your claims\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 15:37:17 :\n\nYea no, it wasn’t correct at all, it tried to say the prophets and apostles said things they didn’t, I know because they provided the links to the talks, and I looked them up(the right way) and those quotes weren’t in there. It also tried to retranslate a verse in the Book of Mormon. Hers what they wrote versus the actual verse;\n\n“...And many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a white and a delightsome people.”\n\nThe actual verse;\n\n“...and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome people.”\n\nYou really have to check your sources before you just link a random article. Your not going to find legitimate history on the church outside of its own sources.\n\nOh and one other thing, they tried to say the church never corrected the supposedly “racist” rules. There literally an official declaration that removed the restrictions.\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 15:44:33 :\n\nLooking them up the right way doesn’t actually mean anything , you need to post your own source.\n\nThat quote is absolutely true sorry. 2 nelphi 30:6. It was changed to the version you wrote in 1981! Lmfao because of the growing criticism they were facing!\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 15:46:57 :\n\nOh my gosh! The Book of Mormon has never been updated since its original translation. They the only things they’ve don’t to update it, were to add dates, from archeological research, and make the chapter headings more detailed. The actual verses have never been changed\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 15:49:23 :\n\nFalse. Also it doesn’t matter, because it’s still a white supremacist cult with no proof for any of its numerous insane claims.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 15:50:32 :\n\nLike what?\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 15:51:26 :\n\nLiterally every single one. You notice how you have completely stopped trying to prove your original claim because you can’t?\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 15:53:33 :\n\nI never made an original claim, and church never committed any crimes at all. Actually do research from legitimate sources before you end up looking bad. Wikipedia is not a legitimate source on church history\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 15:55:55 :\n\nYes you did. You claimed there was actual proof of Jesus existing based on a tomb that some people believe is Jesus and on the lies of a literal conman Joseph Smith. Nowhere have I mentioned crime. Are you having trouble comprehending what you are reading?\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 16:00:06 :\n\nSorry that was supposed to say ‘claims’ and yes there is proof of every single of one of them. The church doesn’t make “claims” it makes statements, that tare supported. However that doesn’t mean the people in it do. Yes there are some past mistakes of church leaders on some subjects like racism, they’re people, and their a product of the era, just like everyone else. How do some people’s past mistakes define an entire organization?\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 16:02:32 :\n\nNo there is no proof of any of them sorry. If there was you could easily prove me wrong. The church itself perpetuated racism. It wasn’t just an individual. You realize abolitionists have existed as long as slave owners have right? I’m sorry but you are completely failing to engage with anything I’m actually saying. Are you in this deranged cult?\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 16:06:19 :\n\nYou’re asking that after all this? Of course I am, that why I know everything your saying is wrong. Not because I was “brainwashed” or whatever else. But because I actually do research, from legitimate sources, and I ask questions, a lot. It’s literally not possible for you to win an argument against the church.\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 16:08:28 :\n\nYou have done exactly zero of those things. That’s why you have no sources besides the ones we’ve already established as illegitimate. You absolutely do not ask the right questions or you wouldn’t be in a cult.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 16:12:45 :\n\nSaying it’s a cult doesn’t make it a true statement. But me saying Jospeh Smith was an actual prophet who translated the Book of Mormon with God’s help, is a true statement, because I figured that out for myself and I know it’s true. Think what your want, but I’m done with this conversation.\n--------------------------------\n\nyaboyQuinlan @ 2020-10-17 16:46:32 :\n\nLmao you claimed jesus was real and then linked to shitty websites that don't provide any evidence. Yet you think its on other people to disprove you? You are the one that made the claim he existed and failed to prove it. There is literally no evidence Jesus ever existed. People didn't start talking about him till decades after he supposedly died. The burden of proof is on the religious person when they make the claim he was real. Sorry you can't back up anything you say with actual evidence. Don't even try to quote some Bible verse at me either, the Bible is absolute nonsense that flips from \"literal\" stories to \"metaphorical\" stories in an instant. Also it was written hundreds of years after the fact.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 17:19:14 :\n\nOk then, can’t help you there. If you don’t think the Bible is a legitimate historical record, that would explain why you think there’s no proof or that it was written “after the fact.” Yep, can’t really help you. If you don’t accept the most obvious sources of proof why would you accept any other source?\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 17:21:13 :\n\nIt’s not matter of think. The Bible is not a legitimate historical record. It corroborates some actual historical events at the very best.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 17:24:17 :\n\nYea only people who haven’t read all of it would say that\n--------------------------------\n\nyaboyQuinlan @ 2020-10-17 17:30:14 :\n\nLmao I grew up catholic and have read the entire Bible front to back twice. It is the most inconsistent shit you will ever read, or have you never read it yourself? I'm sure you're wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, hell for you! You ever worked on a Sunday? Hell for you!\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 18:18:17 :\n\nWow, your the fourth person on here in the past month, who doesn’t know the difference between the law of Moses and the commandments, and also thinks bad people go to hell. That’s actually funny, it’s almost as if, the Bible ain’t the only thing you need to read, can’t draw more than one line through two points, but you can draw an infinite number through one.\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 19:47:07 :\n\nYou didn’t actually address what they said except to try and nitpick their funny point about fabrics. You are very talented at manipulation.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 19:50:22 :\n\nWell you see the thing is, you can’t really come to these conclusions about it being inconsistent, unless they didn’t really read the whole thing.\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 19:52:09 :\n\nCompletely wrong. The Bible is famously inconsistent.\n\nYou have to realize that your belief is based on just that, faith.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 19:53:30 :\n\nExcept that mine specifically isn’t. And by “whole” thing, I meant all five books\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 21:44:19 :\n\nYour bibles are just as inconsistent as every bible.\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 21:48:30 :\n\nlol what? There only one Bible. And again, you can’t actually make that claim if you’ve never actually read them. And by the way, based on your logic, you have no way to prove to me that the Roman Empire actually existed. You can use all the proof you want, sure they *might* have built the colosseum, but you can’t know that for sure.\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 21:55:19 :\n\nLmfao exactly!\n\nNo actually that’s not true. I don’t need to read Harry Potter to know it’s filled with inconsistencies because all stories with magic are. But I have, and it is. Actually Reading the Bible is one of the most effective ways to create an atheist.\n\nWe have loads of other evidence to support the existence of the Roman Empire besides the colosseum. We in fact do know for sure that the romans built it.\n\nSorry but you are literally parroting the lines you’ve been told to say to nonbelievers\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 21:57:15 :\n\nIf you’ve actually read it, you wouldn’t call it a Bible, you’d actually know the name of it. So prove it, after all, you are the one making the claim that it’s inconsistent. Where?\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 22:03:56 :\n\nWell that’s just patently not true. The criticisms of the inconsistencies of the Bible and the very idea of god are centuries old. The thing is literally riddled with nonsense.\n\nYou know what though, just go ahead and get back to me when a religious scholar actually solves the problem of evil, because that’s the best and foremost logic problem sky daddy believers have yet to solve\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 22:05:20 :\n\nLol, what problem of evil?\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 22:06:09 :\n\nLmfao remember when you said you had arrived at your positions through research?\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 22:07:22 :\n\nUh yea, what about that?\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 22:07:39 :\n\nObviously not\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 22:09:19 :\n\nBe more specific then, you keep claiming “there’s inconsistencies” but have not actually presented any yet.\n--------------------------------\n\n_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-10-17 22:16:27 :\n\nI just gave you a specific example that you don’t even know about.\n\n“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” — Exodus 20:8\n\n“One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.” — Romans 14:5\n\n\n“… the earth abideth for ever.” — Ecclesiastes 1:4\n\n“… the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” — 2Peter 3:10\n\n“… I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” — Genesis 32:30\n\n“No man hath seen God at any time…”– John 1:18\n\n“… Thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God…” — Leviticus 18:21\n\n[In Judges, though, the tale of Jephthah, who led the Israelites against the Ammonoites, is being told. Being fearful of defeat, this good religious man sought to guarantee victory by getting god firmly on his side. So he prayed to god] “… If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering” — Judges 11:30-31\n\n[The terms were acceptable to god — remember, he is supposed to be omniscient and know the future — so he gave victory to Jephthah, and the first whatsoever that greeted him upon his glorious return was his daughter, as god surely knew would happen, if god is god. True to his vow, the general made a human sacrifice of his only child to god!] — Judges 11:29-34\n\n“…thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. ” — Exodus 21:23-25\n\n“…ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.” — Matthew 5:39\n\n“This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.” — Genesis 17:10\n\n“…if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.” — Galatians 5:2\n\n“… with God all things are possible.” — Matthew 19:26\n\n“…The LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.” — Judges 1:19\n\nI’ve got plenty more\n--------------------------------\n\nlt_Matthew @ 2020-10-17 22:47:59 :\n\nYa know what, I found absolutely zero inconsistencies. One by one;\n\nKeep the sabbath day is a Commandment, where as in Romans, Paul is just telling them to stop arguing about simple things like ‘what day they prefer’ it had nothing to do with the commandments.\n\nBoth those verses have footnote for earth that link to the various verses about what happens to earth at the second coming. The earth is going to be destroyed, but not the whole thing, instead it will become the second of the three kingdoms. So the earth will burn and be wiped, but the physical globe will remain to be transformed.\n\nJacob saying he saw god, but John saying that’s not possible. In John, there is a footnote for ‘man’ which specifies that it means man in the flesh. Normal, imperfect beings can’t see god, they have to be transfigured, like Jacob was.\n\nI don’t see the inconsistency exactly. If god knew that his daughter was gonna meet him, then obviously that was intentional. God didn’t make a mistake.\n\n“Eye for an eye” is what the law of Moses said, the Ten Commandments replaces that, which Jesus is explaining.\n\nSame thing with the circumcision\n\nJust because all things are possible doesn’t just mean god will do anything just because. The verse in judges was just saying “by the way, god is still with Judah” it’s not stating that means he’s gonna win for sure.\n\nYea I saw none there, I think you just were confused on some of them. Which is ok, but it just goes to show that just reading, even multiple times, isn’t always sufficient to understand something:)",

As it was explained to me, the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion. It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times because they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men. \n\nI don't know what the rationale is at your gym.  I would argue that yes, the women's only hours there may be sexist, but they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours.\n--------------------------------\n\nPenguinEatsBabies @ 2013-07-05 23:09:19 :\n\nPersonal beliefs do not justify sexist and exclusionary policies.  What if Klansmen want white-only hours?  What if fat people feel self-conscious and want fat-only hours?  What if a group wants the pool to themselves once a week?  You can make anything an arbitrary restriction and prevent yourself from participating unless you're given special accommodations, but it's ultimately your own choice.

However, it seem juvenile to punish someone (a recent case had 180 days for calling the judge a \"cowardly bitch\") for an action that does nothing bad except for potentially hurting the judge's feelings - an action that would not be a crime in any other scenario. It is a waste of publish resources (in the referenced case, 6 months of prison time) to punish someone for something that does so little harm to society. It seems to have a large potential for abuse, in the common case that the judge is both the target of the disrespectful statement and the arbiter of the punishment. ",

You’re barking up the wrong tree here.  \n\nCan people produce porn ethically: yes. Can people strip ethically: yes. Can people engage in sex work activities ethically: yes. Is it inherently rapey and problematic under our current economic and social systems: yes.  \n\nI’m not saying that any of the things should be illegal in an absolute sense, but I am saying that how they exist today is harmful, dangerous, and inherently violent\/exploitative.  \n\nI’m all for sexual liberation, but to me that doesn’t include putting it under the yoke of money and financial control.  \n\nI think most people grapple with these issues because they see that what’s going on is dangerous\/harmful\/exploitative\/etc, but they have an intuitive sense that it doesn’t have to be and could exist ethically; and further, that ideals of personal liberty and freedom insist for it to one day exist in such ethical ways.  \n\nBut our current economic and social systems aren’t that utopic future, and acting like we should be reasoning from that world and supporting personal liberty\/freedom while we live in a world of financial control and domination is dangerous and harmful. And even if one individual is able to ethically engage in those industries, the industries’ mainstream existence will provide a hiding place for harmful illegal and violent forms of human trafficking and sex crime.  \n\nWe make laws and policies for our world, while trying to get to a better world; we don’t make laws and policies for a utopian world and hope for the best.\n--------------------------------\n\nPrinnyramza @ 2022-12-22 20:00:09 :\n\nAh so you're an anarchist who is trying to use the idea of rape to disencourage legalized prostitution eventhrough you can't logical separate it from already legal sex work such as porn and stripping\n--------------------------------\n\nUntakenAccountName @ 2022-12-22 22:24:04 :\n\n…I’m not an anarchist though? Not an anarchist at all. Anarchists annoy me. You really gotta stop arguing against your own versions of what other people say to you. You keep doing it in this thread.

But that weight only really applies downwards, I can overcome it for at least some time, I could use it to my advantage, and if I get somebody in a headlock it's not going to do a whole lot to diminish my muscular strength. It may even augment it.\n\nSay, making me wear a heavy glove is only going to make everything worse, because F=MA. With more mass in my fist I can punch proportionally harder. It'll wear me out sooner of course, but if I manage to land a hit early it's going to hurt a lot.\n\n&gt; As for why somebody would follow along, because clearly too many couple enjoy hitting each other. \n\nI very highly doubt it.

    "selftext": "EDIT: I misspoke, I don't mean ongoing abuse but heated arguments that result in violent acts eventually leading to a situation of domestic assault.\n\nI don't mean this comically, but genuinely (albeit half baked).  What I mean is a set of rules like you would find in boxing that keeps violence from being overly dangerous.  For one thing, weight handicapping to make up for size differences.  A 6'4\" 300lb person vs a 5'3\" 120lb person is inherently one sided, so the larger individual would need to limit all combat to, say, on their knees with padded gloves.  While this would be technical and require some in-depth thought that I haven't quite put into it, what I've realized with going to a boxing gym that having a way to vent aggression aggressively but safely REALLY helps.  A friend of mine and I recently got into an argument and pulled out the boxing gloves.  We never decided who was right, but we got our hits in and apologized to each other.\n\nThis would also work to stop cases of men being victims but being arrested simply because they are men.  By having laws on the books with regards to the combat, I feel like it would remove the assumption that it was the man's fault AND doesn't even require police intervention unless it went too far, in which case it's clearly whoever broke the rules.\n\nThe last point I think this would help with is empowering people in general.  Many think violence only tears down people weaker, but in a way it also empowers the weaker person if the stronger one has to handicap in order to be within the law.  Clearly the extremely violent cases wouldn't listen to the rules and the problem remains the same while also clearly the couples who are genuinely reasonable have no use for it, but what I would wager is the vast majority of domestic abuse cases could do with some reasonable aggression but safely.  Instead of anger boiling over and one party throwing a punch they regret and it permanently damaging the other person or the relationship, they can remember that they have gloves and rules to allow the situation to get physical.\n\nI feel like this could also reduce the amount of emotional abuse, as at least some would choose to dawn the gloves instead.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

    "ancestor_text": "dale_glass @ 2018-09-19 19:06:47 :\n\nI see three problems here.\n\n1. The amount of people who are actually interested in engaging in ritual combat to settle a dispute is actually very small. I'm male, pretty buff, and in all my life I've never even thought of settling a dispute by \"Let's put on some gloves and settle this like gentlemen\".\n2. Domestic abuse is... abuse. It's pretty much by definition a situation in which the normal rules have failed, and at least one of the parties has decided to dispense with all sense of decency and to beat the shit out of the other party. Even if originally both would be willing to engage in some ritualized combat in the general sense, we're talking about very heated situations in which it's unrealistic to expect somebody to cool down, arrange a battle, and then stick to the rules.\n3. Psychologically, it's unhealthy. Research says that venting your anger isn't actually a good thing. Beating your enemy feels good and makes you want to do it again. That doesn't make for a healthy relationship.\n--------------------------------\n\nMentalSewage @ 2018-09-19 19:31:16 :\n\nSo far you've come the closest to changing my mind.  \n\n1. I think that's because as a society, we have decided that combat is barbaric and only tend to allow violent response after pushed past the point of thinking clearly.  That means once a situation becomes violent, people are usually unsure how to conduct themselves reasonably because they think violence is the antithesis of reasonable.  In reality, the two concepts are totally independent. \n\n2. I suppose an ongoing ritual combat would break down over time with an abusive person, and devolve into actual abuse.  I suppose my main hope was that by handicapping the individuals, the would be victim of abuse would be able to take the would be abuser down a peg on occasion.\n\n3. I'd like more information in this research.  While I can see that as the case in some cases, getting beat I would think is a deterrent from wanting to do it again.\n--------------------------------\n\ndale_glass @ 2018-09-19 19:51:54 :\n\n&gt; I think that's because as a society, we have decided that combat is barbaric and only tend to allow violent response after pushed past the point of thinking clearly\n\nOkay, but why combat? Most couples are made of a man and a woman, and men have the overwhelming physical advantage in combat. Me, with my regular gym attendance, would need to be paired up by a professional female fighter, and even then I think I would have excellent chances if it ever came down to a contest of strength, which seems pretty likely. It would make for an extremely unfair fight, practically all the time. Boxing has weight classes precisely for this reason.\n\nBut there's a more important problem, and it's this: combat, done in any way at all, has nothing to do with the underlying dispute. Suppose I claim the world is round, and my opponent says it's flat. Suppose they are able to win by being a mountain of muscle. How does the ability to fight have anything to do with the actual disagreement?\n\nWe could pick a non-physical contest, but the problem would remain. If one side wins by being better at the contest, it's unrelated to the disagreement. If one side wins basically at random because they're about even, you might as well just throw a coin.\n\n&gt; I suppose an ongoing ritual combat would break down over time with an abusive person, and devolve into actual abuse. I suppose my main hope was that by handicapping the individuals, the would be victim of abuse would be able to take the would be abuser down a peg on occasion.\n\nAnd why would an abusive individual consent to being handicapped?\n\n\n&gt; I'd like more information in this research. While I can see that as the case in some cases, getting beat I would think is a deterrent from wanting to do it again.\n\n[Here for example](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/overcoming-destructive-anger\/201705\/should-you-visit-anger-room)\n\nYes, but winning is an incentive to want to do it again. Whoever loses will have an incentive to stop arguing, and whoever wins will have a lot of leverage to get their way. \"You want a black eye in the ring again? No? Then we're getting pizza.\"\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nMentalSewage @ 2018-09-19 19:59:03 :\n\nI completely agree it doesn't determine who it right, it's meant to vent hostility to ensure it never goes to the point of full on violence.  And assuming proper handicapping I don't see how it could be used as a threat.  At best a challenge.\n\nAs for why somebody would follow along, because clearly too many couple enjoy hitting each other.  And if they have the opportunity to hit each other knowing they wont actually hurt each other, wouldn't be judged, and wouldn't be arrested, they can get their licks in at each other and feel better without either of them getting hurt, I think you'd be pretty hard pressed to find a couple that fights a lot that WOULDN'T take you up on that.",

Companies that manage private prisons or sell legal drugs are going to have a vested interest in keeping drugs illegal, and sending those who do those drugs to jail. So are lobbies like the Prison Guard Union and companies that sell services to prisons.\n\nThose are the people that *want* to sell people to prison, and they just so happen to manipulate and use the government to accomplish those goals. \n--------------------------------\n\nclicheteenager @ 2018-03-06 20:38:29 :\n\nMy view is that government aren't being manipulated like you're saying, yes a justice sysytem was most likey never made for to make money but to just seperate the dangerous members of society.\n But I think sometimes along the line they saw they could profit off it, and work with these private businesses to make them money.\n\nThey get them prisoners, and the prison makes money and they politician gets \"donations\" off them in thanks for that.\n\nAn \"if I scratch your back you scratch mine,\" type of thing.\n\nAccording to [open secrets](https:\/\/www.opensecrets.org\/industries.\/indus.php?ind=G7000)\n\n&gt;In the 2016 election cycle, private prisons gave a record $1.6 million to candidates, parties and outside spending groups. That was nearly triple what they'd given in 2014 and more than double their contributions in the 2012 presidential cycle. Most of the increase came in the form of donations to outside groups, and Geo Group was responsible for most of that: It gave $300,000 to super PACs backing various Republican presidential candidates, including one backing now-President Donald Trump\n--------------------------------\n\nUNRThrowAway @ 2018-03-06 20:41:13 :\n\nYou've just proved my point though. \n\nThe government doesn't really gain anything by keeping people in prisons. In fact, it wastes a ton of government resources and is incredibly expensive.\n\nWhat you have are single politicians taking kickbacks from private lobbyists, and in turn manipulating the system. \n--------------------------------\n\nclicheteenager @ 2018-03-06 20:49:15 :\n\nBut the government is them, they *are* the government, this isn't just one politician, it's multiple.\n\nGovernment (Oxford definition) - The group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office.",

    "selftext": "First off, yes, I think that global warming is real. But from what I have seen of how factories work and how resources are used, I think it is unfair to blame corporations for \"ruining Earth\". Sure, yes, they are causing environmental problems, and yes, there are researches into how to produce with less harm to the environment, but I think that whining that corporations are purposefully prioritizing profits over the environment is kind of misunderstanding the point of corporations. They are an organization created to make more money, that's their job. Expecting corporations to take hits and cause their shares to fall because of some moral imperatives is like expecting a banker to do a fireman's job. They are already doing the best they can realistically do, and to do any more would simply destroy the economy. The issue isn't what people are doing, but because of how the world is. The Earth is a shitty, sensitive system that breaks too easily. I feel like people these days seem to think that all problems originate from people being jerks, without realizing that sometimes reality is just limiting. If living normally and expanding human civilization causes the Earth to be affected this badly, then I highly doubt it would be possible for us to fix that problem and still remain as a species that is growing. The only way out of this is to just utilize Earth's resource to the best of our abilities, and live with the consequences, because there is no way for us to stop consequences from happening without stopping production.\n\nEDIT: I should also add that I think that trying to impose too much regulations on corporations will only serve to hurt ourselves, and make the world as a whole \"poorer\".\n\nEDIT 2: In light of the main thing seeming to be the question of mitigating global warming VS mitigating the effect of global warming, I think I should lay my cards on the table. I think something that would convince me would be arguments on why it is more efficient to mitigate global warming itself, rather than mitigating the effects it would have on us.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Thus, its interplay with all sexualities is equally complex.\n\nIf a natal male is attracted to the secondary sex characteristics of a trans man but is not attracted to his primary characteristics or female biological characteristics on his body or any other, that is a homosexual attraction. If he accepts him as a man, enjoys his personality, and pursues a relationship and\/or sex with him homonormatively (i.e. not engaging sexually w\/ the trans man's primary characteristics and instead doing as gay men do) that is a homosexual relationship. Effectively, such a man would see a trans man as equal to a eunuch.\n\nI know many people of all sexualities in similar relationships with trans partners and they constantly face discrimination. They are told they are invalid and called dozens of names. In the right contexts, some will even accuse such people of things like genocide, supporting rape culture, etc. and I view such attacks as equally problematic with trans activists calling people transphobic for excluding trans people from their sexuality.\n\nTypically, detractors of such people insist that they are not monosexual and in fact are bisexual. In practical terms, this makes no sense as such individuals are never actually attracted to both sexes. They are attracted to one sex's characteristics exclusively and their preferences align in such a way that allows them to forgive a trans person's primary sex characteristics and love them for their secondary characteristics and personality.\n\nBoth responses are correct, completely valid, and no one should be forced to justify either and defend their belonging to any sexuality. Both responses should be expected, given the complex biological reality of trans bodies.\n\nI wish that we could accept and come to terms with this complex biological reality and accept that positions of monosexual inclusion and exclusion are equally valid and appropriately justified to the complex reality of trans bodies.",

It's a bad example of a task that has been mastered.\n\nHowever, chess computers are good enough that they're almost unbeatable by humans, but like... nobody is saying that humans should try to \"solve\" chess themselves, and people playing chess competitively aren't going around saying that they're eventually going to be perfect at chess. You seem to be arguing against a position nobody actually holds; I don't think I've ever heard somebody argue that people should try to beat computers at speed calculations, or at chess, or whatever.\n\n(Also people get really good or near perfect at minesweeper because they're bored at work and it's a single player game; saying people shouldn't try to be perfect at that is like saying people shouldn't ever play with jigsaw puzzles because a computer could put it back together easily. The point is killing time, not perfection.)\n--------------------------------\n\nRogerTheShrubber42 @ 2019-05-14 01:21:30 :\n\nI apologise for the confusion, but I wasn't trying to argue that people try to compete with computers, rather that they learn a skill past the point where it would be more practical to use a machine, like in competitions such as the math league at my school, where most of the problems wouldn't ever be solved without a calculator in any practical setting, but people still compete to be slightly faster and more accurate.",

Comprehensive here means that it’s based in a definite world view (e.g. a theory of justice based on Kant’s work, Mill’s work, Sharia Law, etc.). It makes substantive claims about the good that will alienate those who disagree. Political here means that it is attempting to be neutral with respect to world views; it’s supposed to be acceptable to everyone who is reasonable (here, that means being willing to find and agree to terms of cooperation that are mutually beneficial, on the condition that others do the same). A political conception of justice aims to be something all reasonable people can come to consensus on, regardless of their world view. As such, it must remain agnostic on certain  philosophical question and only stray as far as there is common ground amongst reasonable people. \n\nRawls starts off by framing justice as fairness in terms of Kant’s philosophy and tries to give reasons why people should accept the Kantian aspects of his theory, however, later he comes to think that he can’t expect reasonable non-Kantians to accept justice as fairness if it’s expressed and defended on Kantian terms, so he started trying to show that justice as fairness could be expressed and defended in terms that all reasonable people could accept, regardless of their world view. Whether he was successful is a matter of debate.",

The most complete set of desirable traits is the \"alpha male\". He chooses the equally genetically desirable female.\n\nThe problem with this argument that I see is that it assumes there is a universally agreed upon list of traits in order of value. Because every human has different traits that they personally value, there can never be a universally agreed upon list of traits.\n\n&gt;because they have a higher chance of survival in that specific part of the earth. The most complete set of desirable traits is the \"alpha male\". He chooses the equally genetically desirable female.\n\nWhile survival plays a big part in mating in the wild, its not the only factor present. Many species such as peacocks possess traits that do not help them survive in the wild at all, but serve as a desirable trait for courtship. There can be no most desirable male or female for everyone, there can only be a most desirable for every individual person. Because of this, there can be no Alpha who is most desirable.\n\n&gt;Regarding aggressive behavior, Adam misrepresents the traits of the dominant male. The meek rule the earth. Listen to the world's most powerful people speak. The last thing they are is aggressive because it displays weakness in their ability to control their own emotions.\n\nFirst off, I think we have to set some definitions here. What makes a person powerful? Different people are powerful in different ways. A MMA champion is  powerful in a different way than an influential businessman. From the way you phrase your argument, I'm going to assume you mean world leaders. Yet even there there is a variety. Take Kim Jung Un, by being aggressive with threats he gets what he wants. Or Justin Trudeau, who is almost never aggressive with threats, but rather aggressive against trade pressure from the US, a nation much more powerful than Canada, or Saudi Arabia recently. Aggression doesn't always mean losing your cool, aggression can be used as a tool to power, much the same way calm speech can be.\n\n&gt;Being kind also actually takes more balls than being an asshole, simply because we are socially conditioned to think 'asshole = she will let me fuck her',\n\nI believe you're using we incorrectly to account for a large group of people without clarifying who that group is. But I can say for myself that I was not conditioned to believe that, and I hope there are many others who were not conditioned that way either.\n\n&gt;and if you go against the grain to be a man of honor, you will encounter resistance, but reap huge rewards as your character is revealed.\n\nYou use the term against the grain, but I don't understand what you argue the social norm is. Neither do you elaborate on the resistance nor the rewards, and this in general seems to be assuming that everyone knows what you do and thinks how you do which we do not.\n\nTL;DR - There is no optimal combination of traits since everyone has different preferences. Aggression is not a bad thing, it is a tool and usually a carefully calculated one.\n\nSorry for the english it's not my first language",

Big Macs example - it is possible to have unhealthy habits\/addictions, so first, I'd argue that John is committing \"unlove\" against himself by not fixing those habits. Secondly, are his parents justified in correcting the behavior against his will... My framework, in it's current state, mildly addresses this saying that there are universals truths and personal ones. I say that one should not proselytize\/force their personal beliefs, maybe they shouldn't enforce universal ones either? But then how could you justify imprisoning a criminal (which I think is justifiable, it maximizes love towards the criminals future victims)?\n\n2.) 1950s homosexuality, most evidence was against gays. This is indeed another difficult situation. The evidence wasn't arrived by through honest scientific\/experimental means (I'm assuming). Since the evidence wasn't truthful, it shouldn't hold weight. We have similar problems today in the healthcare industry. Misinformation abounds in pharmaceuticals, alternative medicines, diet, exercise, etc. I would say that just because somethign is published in a journal, or had an experiment done, doesn't make it a truth.\n\n3.) I like that, I agree that force shouldn't be used against people in most situations. Defending yourself is ok. But what about using force in, say, apprehending a criminal, or even non aggressive force like grounding a child, or putting a child in school detention?",

    "selftext": "It's time for me to stop believing that organized religion is the source of moral truth, and recognize that humans are innately moral, and religion often struggles to keep pace.\n\nTherefore I've tried to develop a moral guidebook that is foundational, and universal - a framework that can address the morality of any issue. How could it be improved?\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n|  | **Truth** | **Love** |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Universal** | Majority would agree | Majority recognize it as love |\n| **Me** | True to me (I can't preach to others though) | It's my way of getting\/giving love (again, I can't preach it) |\n\n\nSo this says that the only 2 virtues are things that maximize Truth, and Love. These things either apply universally, or apply to me (so I would be wrong to proselytize them, since they only apply to me). The intent is to analyze any proposed moral question through the lens offered in each quadrant of the graph.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Longer Explanation**\n\nEx:\n\n*Does God exist*?\n\n* **Universal Truth** - Is there evidence that I could supply to anyone and they would more or less have to agree that God exists? Is there falsifiable evidence that God exists? No, so no universal truth to be found here. Therefore it would be immoral for me to proselytize otherwise.\n\n* **Personal Truth** - Do I want to believe in God, maybe because i had a special experience? Yes? Then that's fine. But I must recognize that's true only to me, and I would be wrong to try persuading others of it, without evidence that might apply to them.\n\n* **Universal Love** - Does a belief in God *necessarily* maximize Love in the world? (Notice one must be careful to not ask if the trappings of religion maximize love, such as social causes, but if the belief itself maximizes Love). If I can think of instances where a belief in God results in murder or bigotry, then I must concede that no, a belief in God does not maximize Love.\n\n* **Personal Love** - Do I feel more love for myself, and for others if I believe in God? If yes, that's fine, I must however not proselytize this until I have persuasive evidence that would apply to most people universally.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Implications** (or things I think are implied by this framework)\n\n* If homosexuality doesn't result in decreased love in the world, it's immoral to oppose two same-sex ppl forming a life together.\n\n* If I can't supply an honest person with evidence of Christianity, it's immoral (and annoying) for me to try\n\n* If vaccinations are truly causing disease, and anyone has to agree with the evidence, then it's immoral to continue administering them. If avoidance is actually *causing* more disease, it's immoral to not administer them.\n\n* If I can supply evidence that any honest person would agree implies a billions-of-years old universe, then it's immoral against truth to try to persuade others differently.\n\n* Rape is wrong because it is an infringment on love\n\n* Pot smoking is fine, as long as you don't drive high or neglect important things in your life\n\n* Alcohol consumption is morally fine\n\nForgive that these are my views, which you may disagree with, they are just attempts at interpreting a framework I hope to refine into being \"universally true\".

    "ancestor_text": "bytor99 @ 2015-06-30 19:16:46 :\n\nI think the biggest problem is that it's an incomplete philosophy. \n\nFirst, there is no basis for this philosophy. It makes the *assumption* that truth and love are the highest values possible, yet there is no backing for it. If life is a pre-requisite to truth AND love, shouldn't life be valued first? And should we not value freedom next, to let people pursue their own desires? In terms of truth, it makes sense for us to value that-- it allows us to gain more information about the world, and better develop moral decisions. But what about love? Love-- whether between friends, romantic partners, etc-- is a mutual agreement of sorts, a recognition to act in happiness and respect. Therefore, love comes from our values of 1) happiness (our friendships and relationships giving us more fulfillment, and our recognition that being an asshole to everyone makes us less happy) and 2) respect (our desire, or at least some people's desire, to be nice even when wronged). Love is not a PRIMARY value. \n\nSecond, you give no means of deciding what IS truth and what IS love. Truth may be described as \"that which is with accordance of reality\"-- but do we all witness the same reality? Perhaps there is an objective reality, but perhaps there is not. I have no way of knowing if we witness the same reality. It's all the same to me, and it SEEMS as if there is, but there are different truths to different people. A certain idea may speak to you, and improve your life, but not mine-- each person must thus be able to pursue *their own* truths. And perhaps there are some universal truths, but perhaps not-- that's something that has to be proved, not assumed. \n\nLooking at some of the examples--\n&gt;But I must recognize that's true only to me, and I would be wrong to try persuading others of it, without evidence that might apply to them\n\nWould you? Let's say there's religion A, and Jane Smith is a follower. And under the beliefs, if you do not believe in Religion A, you will suffer for eternity after death. Now, if Jane was convinced that religion A was true, even if Jane didn't have solid proof, wouldn't she be an asshole not to try to tell other people? I mean, she honestly believes that those people will suffer for eternity-- wouldn't it be loving to try to save them? You may argue that, of course religion A is wrong, and has no validity-- but in Jane's mind, it has PERFECT validity. \n\nThis is an example of where definitions come into play. Where is the boundary for truth and love? Now, clearly, the answer would be for JANE to value truth more heavily, and pursue knowledge that her beliefs are unfounded-- but suppose *she believes* she has. Truth and love, then are in contradiction. \n\nNow, looking at the implications;\n\n&gt;If homosexuality doesn't result in decreased love in the world, it's immoral to oppose two same-sex ppl forming a life together.\n\nWhy is the standard for immorality love? And why assume something is immoral unless it promotes love? If I go to the store and buy a few tomatoes with the intent to simply throw them away, there's nothing loving in that-- I don't intend to feed anyone. But I would argue that my choice is still moral because of *rights*. Which is another huge flaw in your philosophy- systems of love need systems of rights to gauge the *limit* of love. In my tomato example, it would be immoral, because no love would have been furthered-- but I think it's pretty clear that, since I agreed to buy the tomatoes, and the store agreed to sell them, nobody is being forced to do anything against their will-- both of us can continue happily.\n\n&gt;Rape is wrong because it is an infringment on love\n\nI actually think this is a good counterexample. A significant number of rapes are committed by a person the victim knows. Rapists may even be romantically in love with their victims-- in your world, this would be moral. Yet, because the RIGHTS of the victim are being infringed upon, in a horrible, inhumane, disgusting manner, it is one of the most immoral acts imaginable. \n\nTo take another example-- gay conversion therapy. Say that John is gay, and his loving family, followers of Religion A, believe that he will suffer in eternity for it. Let's say they even have some evidence Religion A is correct. Out of love, they kidnap him, and force him into a gay conversion therapy camp in a third-world country. Such situations as these have been proven CONSISTENTLY to cause great psychological harm and trauma. Clearly, it is wrong to force John against his will to go to this camp-- yet his family, out of \"love\", has done it anyways. Shouldn't there be a recognition of rights? That John should be free to live his life how HE wants? The boundary would be, his family, out of kindness, tries to *persuade* him-- yet, morally, that is the furthest they can go without being immoral.\n\nAnd last, the problem of war is one I think you cannot handle. Say Country A attacks Country B. Country B, acting purely in a system of love, would refuse to attack back, because violence isn't loving-- but, because self defense is an inherent right, I think Country B is right to stop aggression and defend itself. Under your philosophy, if even one country or person doesn't follow it, the others can be seriously harmed.\n--------------------------------\n\nJasonSilvermann @ 2015-06-30 20:05:52 :\n\nI like where this is going and you make some valid points, my \"framework\" indeed has holes.\n\nFirst, it seems my initial post didn't perfectly communicate my views, so I'll address some points where you understood a message I didn't mean to convey.\n\n1.) You start out speaking about how Truth can't really be known, that even truth is subjective. If you're willing, I want to agree that a solipsistic view won't further the conversation, so I'd like to agree that Truth can be known. Or at least let's look at truth as a spectrum. Isaac Newton's physics are \"true\" given certain evidences, and Relativity is \"more true\" given other evidences, and quantum, and something beyond quantum may be even \"more true\" than that.\n\n2.) You mention a few examples where an individual may hold some truth that is contrary with others (your ex: the lady who would be wrong to not proselytize her religion). My grid I drew out in my post addresses this (or at least I should hope it would). For example, if a parent is deeply religious and wants to undo their child's gayness, they would be wrong. Their religion, which is true to them, dictates gayness is wrong, and they're fine to hold that belief personally. But there's no evidence they could provide that would possibly persuade most people that being gay is wrong. (There is evidence that it takes a man and woman to make a baby and anyone would either have to agree with this, or choose ignorance\/deceit. But there exists no evidence at this level of \"potency\" which supports\/opposes being gay, or any religion). Does that make sense? I want the framework to allow individual \"truths\"\/beliefs, and also set a barrier between infringing on other's rights when that individual truth isn't universal. (for example, a creep may be obsessed with a girl, that's his personal truth, but if she doesn't reciprocate that love, it's wrong for him to rape her, he's infringing on her love\/health\/mental health).\n\n3.) Defense in warfare. Ya, I don't know how my framework would address that. What would you recommend?\n\nHopefully that explains my \"framework\" a little better, any comments now that we're closer to being on the same page?\n--------------------------------\n\nbytor99 @ 2015-06-30 20:19:55 :\n\n&gt;If you're willing, I want to agree that a solipsistic view won't further the conversation\n\nOkay, that's fine, I think. I still don't understand why LOVE is particularly something you value. In my opinion truth is essential to figuring out the world and developing our sense of morals-- yet why love? As I point out above, valuing love comes from valuing other things (happiness, life, respect, etc) so love is a secondary value, not a primary one. \n\n&gt; But there's no evidence they could provide that would possibly persuade most people that being gay is wrong\n\nOkay. Let's take another example, then. Say that John regularly consumes Big Macs and large sodas. Say this is a problem which is contributing to substantial health difficulties; John is frequently out of breath, and is gaining weight at an unhealthy rate. Surely this is enough evidence to convince most people that it would be in John's best interest to not consume Big Macs and soda any longer. John's family takes this evidence, and sends him, against his will, away to a \"healthy eating\" camp, where he is forced to stay, against his will. He definitely benefits from eating healthier, yet his autonomy and individual choices are being destroyed. \n\nYou may criticize this for being too extreme an example, yet 1) it shows your philosophy DOES have holes, 2) it shows your philosophy doesn't recognize RIGHTS which is a basis for society, and 3) I would bet most people have some unhealthy behaviors (eating cake, alcohol, etc), and even if they do not take it as far as John in this hypothetical example, it would still open up the possibilities.\n\nMoreover, going back to the example of the gay conversion therapy-- suppose it was 1950. Most of the evidence then DID claim there to be some problem with homosexuality, and most of the people in America would've supported endeavors such as gay conversion therapy. Would that have justified the hypothetical family's actions? I would say no, because the element of FORCE is what makes their actions wrong.\n\n&gt;Defense in warfare. Ya, I don't know how my framework would address that. What would you recommend?\n\nI would recommend holding AGGRESSION as a wrong. For your framework to be more sophisticated, you have to have an ultimate gain. You want to try to minimize the assumptions you're making and try to explain the world in as few logical leaps as you can. So rather than straight assuming truth and love are to be desired, why not value life first? After all, the purpose of your framework is for living your life-- it makes sense to begin there. From life, you can look towards truth as a means of furthering your understanding of life and the moral framework. From there, we can determine why any aggression is wrong-- it is destructive to the values of life and truth TOGETHER. If we value life, we should seek not to destroy our value. But, let's say a thief attempts to kill me in the streets. They have not abided by a respect of life. I surely want to maintain a respect to life, so I attempt not to kill the thief in defending myself, yet to continue MY life, I may very well have to defend myself. Yet I am no longer using force to impose my will on another person, I am using force to stop a person from attempting to impose their will on me.",

    "selftext": "So, go away if you have not seen the latest season. Just go. \n\nSo, in my view the big twist of Danny going \"evil\" was well done and amazing. I also believe this is what will happen in the books (probably better written and the details changed, but end result the same). I'm going to preface this by disclaiming that, while I liked season 8, it has it's flaws. Deep flaws. Dudes don't know how to plan a battle for shit. And can't remember about fleets. \n\nAnyway, so Danny burned Kings Landing. If you remember when Danny took Slavers Bay the slaves actually helped her. They welcomed her as a messiah like character because she broke their chains. She also was ruthless to the Slavers, burning and killing them. Sacking their cities and killing the nobels. We all cheered for her at the time, but that was just a mask for her brutality. The books have it very similar, where Danny utterly destroys those that appose her. Just for the most part those that appose her at first are evil. \n\nNow Season 6, Danny moves past the books and we no longer have a point of reference to know if this is the same as what GRRM has planned. Season 6 has Danny burn the leaders of the Dothraki because of what they have done. How they treat their wives and send them off when the leader dies. She killed all of them and took over as leader. We cheered because these men were evil, but this is another example of her anger and wrath. \n\nSo she then moves to Westeros and begins her war. She takes Casterly Rock but is out done by Jamie. In response she uses her dragon to burn the army, killing many in a mass slaughter. On top of this she takes her prisoners, and if they don't kneel burns them alive. I believe this scene was supposed to the the \"wait, Danny, you are going to far\" scene. \n\nPersonally, I feel like for the show to be well done we had to believe Danny was good right up until the end. The hints that she might go to such lengths needed to be buried, so that we would not see it coming. Just like the red wedding was a large surprise and we only figured it out in retrospect, so to is how this was supposed to be. \n\nDanny finally gets to King's Landing, at the start of her journey south it has already cost her one dragon and many of her (respawn capable) Dothraki and Unsullied. She has lost one of her best friends. She has had to endure the north refusing to kneel and treating her with hostility. (Side note I like that Sansa refused to kneel and think it's crazy that the North should trust her even if Danny helped fight the Nights King. The White Walkers were a threat to everyone so Danny was just doing herself a favor). \n\nSo Danny finally heads to King's Landing, having lost so much already and feeling unwanted. The she looses another dragon and her best friend. On top of that her spymaster has betrayed her, Jon is found to be her nephew and has a better claim on the throne, and Jon won't return her affection. She feels alone and rage. The city gives in, but to easily. The people don't want her, and so she finally decides to rule by fear. Make an example of Kings Landing so no one else will ever cross her. \n\n\nAnyway, let me know your opinions!",

Chances are, his day-to-day does not involve any actions where he may be racist or sexist. He likely crunches numbers, makes math models, and has a very narrow scope. I don't think there is any risk mitigation going on here, just looks like the company is playing along with the current trends.\n--------------------------------\n\ncapnwally14 @ 2020-06-16 16:20:12 :\n\nIf the person is in any sort of interaction with another employee at a job they're a risk. If they're in any sort of management position they're a risk. If they have a company email or chat, there's a risk. There are very few jobs where none of these things exist.   \n\n\nAny pattern of harassment is grounds for a lawsuit if the company is seen as having enabled it. You can be sure the company choosign to keep this employee employed (after public evidence of racism \/ sexism \/ etc) would make a defense significantly harder.\n--------------------------------\n\nshittypeoplematter @ 2020-06-16 16:24:06 :\n\nIf this behavior was not exposed during his work, it's likely he is masking his bigotry at work (when it should be important for employment).

But that doesn’t make sense to me because this is a lifetime appointment. Trump can’t fire Barrett if she rules against him in an election case. She can’t lose her job based on the way that she rules. Therefore in my opinion there is no conflict of interest. Also, if Barrett recuses herself that would mean the possibility of a 4-4 vote.

Total change?  -0.5\n* Healthy child to a child with CMVitis moves from somewhere around 0.5 to -0.5.  Total change? -1\n\nIt looks to me like that's twice as bad, according to your own math.\n\n\n---\nFurther, I'm not certain that your math is valid.  Is non-existence *really* better than having pain?  It's not pain all the time, is it, that it is worse than nothing?\n\nI would argue that the appropriate scale is 0 for non-existence, 1 for perfect health, and every malady adds some (negative) value to the sum.\n\nUsing *that* math, then you're right that the *end result* of giving birth to an otherwise healthy child with an incurable disease would have the same *result* as infecting an otherwise healthy child (ie, 0+1+(-0.5)=0.5 == 1+(-0.5)=0.5), there's still the question of *our change.*\n\n* In the case of the fetus live, you're allowing their value to go from 0 to 0.5.  That's a change of +0.5\n* In the case of infecting the healthy child, you're *forcing* the value to go from 1 to 0.5.  That's a change of -0.5\n\nSo, I'm afraid, using either your math or mine, the result is clear:\n\nIn both cases, the infection of a healthy child has a greater negative consequence.\n\nAdditionally, there is a *huge* difference in Agency.  Your entire question is attempting to draw an equivalency between harm you have no control over, and harm that you're actively causing.  It's logically equivalent to saying that letting someone jump off a bridge is morally equivalent to pushing them off the bridge.  \n\nIf that's the case, does that mean we should charge \"Good Samaritans\" with murder if they don't keep somebody alive?",

Here's my rationale:\n\n1) The 'default' state of being is 'non-existence', let's rank it at 0. \n\n2) Healthy individuals are on a scale between 0 and 1: some are better off, some are worse off, but most have a good life overall.\n\n3) Extremely sick individuals are somewhere between 0 and -1: the diseases cause immense pain and suffering to the kid and the poor soul will never have a normal life.\n\nBy giving birth to someone in the third category you're moving a human being from 0 to a negative state, rather than giving birth to a healthy child and moving a soul from 0 to a positive state. If instead of getting abortion and trying again for a healthy child (or adopting) you choose to keep the baby, you have made an action equivalent to inflicting disease upon a healthy child.\n\nCMV.",

In Australia, voting is based on preference, meaning even if you vote for an independent who doesn't get a seat, if you put one of the two major parties as one of your preferences, that vote will go to them instead, and won't be wasted. I won't argue that things are great here, but the two parties is a symptom of the voting system, and a voting system based purely on most votes wins is always going to push away third parties, because any support you give them, is support taken from your least disliked party.\n\nAustralia still has two major parties, but thats not the complete story. Our last national government was a coalition, as no one party had the majority, so a major party basically teamed up with a smaller one. Our next highest party 'The Greens' gets a small but sizeable representation, as do a number of independents. It's still far from perfect, but it's a shift from two strict power blocks that is impossible with a plurality voting system as any slow change will be stamped out before it has any effect.\n--------------------------------\n\nFickle-Topic9850 @ 2023-04-14 03:17:50 :\n\nI didn’t really answer your question though.

The embassy from Taiwan to the Vatican City however is in Italy, so the embassy is a technically Taiwanese extraterritoriality of the Vatican extraterritoriality that is actually in Italy. The Vatican is too small to have an embassy to it actually be within it! To me that counts as not having “capacity to enter into relationship with other states”\n \n\nPost Italian reunification Vatican City a state around the institution of the Catholic Church, it is a religious leadership with state. Countries should have people who live in them. Vatican City does not have any political interests separate from the Catholic Church, if “Vatican City” needs something, its either the HQ of the Catholic Church needs something, or the clergy or direct employees of the Catholic Church needs something. \n\nThere is no reason for the leader of the Catholic Church should be treated like the leader of a country*, when that “country” is a few hundred employees of the Catholic Church, not a real polity. Nor should the catholics church headquarters treated like a whole country. It skews statistics and is just not comparable to the other ~200 countries, where people actually live permanently. \n\n*the Pope is important because he is the head of a specific religion that has ~ 1 billion adherents, not because he is the leader of a “country” whose land area and population are negligible\n\nIf it is important for the leadership of the Catholic Church to have sovereignty, the Holy See should have sovereignty rights and extraterritoriality over the Vatican complex in a similar way the Knights of Malta currently do(and the Knights of Malta should stop having sovereignty, cause like, they don’t need it), but the church don’t merit the rights of an independent state. Since the country is merely an extension of the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church (well, just the leadership\/the concept of the Holy See) should be granted whatever specific sovereignty \/rights is necessary.",

    "selftext": "I have seen a LOT of comments, mainly from men, that lying about whether they use porn is just a little white lie to spare their SO's feelings or none of their business. I argue that lying about whether you use porn is on par with lying about whether you sleep with other people minus the physical risks of STDs.\n\nPorn is a sexual behavior usually involving other people in a non-physical way that is being concealed. The sole purpose of the concealment is being able to manipulate a partner into thinking they are in the monogamous relationship they agreed to, when they aren't. \n\nCommon arguments include:\n\n**She gets so mad\/my ex got mad. It's easier to just lie. Women force men to lie about this by shaming them.** The answer to this is either break up, stop using it, or come to some kind of compromise. Anger\/hurt from your partner is the opposite of justification for why it's OK.\n\n**All men use porn. You know in Montreal...** First off that does not justify the concealment if it was true. Even if there was not a single man on Earth who doesn't watch porn, she is still allowed to make that decision and lying removes that ability. If it was a valid argument, then being honest and adding that statement would be enough. Second off it's untrue; most large scale studies find about 20-25% of men don't. The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior found that almost 1\/5 of men under between 20-50 hadn't even masturbated in the last year. And the Montreal study was trying to find men who had NEVER used porn, it wasn't asking about current use.\n\n**As long as it's not impacting their sex life, it's none of her business.** All this really means is as long as it isn't impacting HIS sex life, there's supposedly no issue. What people really mean with this is as long as he isn't using porn instead of sex or can't get it up. If she doesn't trust him or is having sex under false pretenses, how is that not impacting her sex life?\n\n**It's unreasonable to ask someone not to masturbate.** Porn isn't needed to masturbate, but even if the request was to never masturbate, it is still not ok to lie about. Even if you think the request is the most outlandish thing that's ever been said, lying about it is a breech of the monogamy agreement.\n\n**Yes you can masturbate without porn, but it makes it more fun and faster.** Is more fun and easier a good justification for an affair?\n\n**But vibrators, romance novels, my ex was anti-porn and cheated on me, etc...** Red herrings that while sexual in nature have nothing to do with whether it's ok to lie about porn.\n\n**It's just insecurity, and that's on her to overcome.** It's also insecurity to not want sex with other people in your relationship. Insecurity doesn't mean \"ignore it and have an affair.\" It's valid to say a partner should try to be ok with it and work on it because it's something you won't stop doing. It's not valid to decide they have to be ok with it or you'll conceal it and do it anyways.\n\n**Porn has been around forever.** So have affairs, still not ok to hide them.\n\nI am curious to hear under what justification lying about porn is either fully OK or not a big deal\/just a white lie. Note I am not posting about whether it is or isn't ok to use porn in general, this is only about the justification for lying about it. Also note: I am not talking about \"don't ask don't tell\" agreements.",

I never felt so sympathetic for anyone since.\n\n\nI sometimes think to myself, the only reason I don't go on with that is because I'm so afraid of fucking up. I'm facing the prospect of homelessness and had to flee my country and I really dont want to experience the former and never wanted to experience the later, I wish if there was just a simple, easy and safe way go 'get out'\n\n\n\nOf course, it would not be given to anyone but only to people who would need it, people who have terminal illnesses or those who have been thinking of suicide for a long time. This is how I imagine it would be controlled so not everyone does it on a whim. \n\n\nI wish this was a thing.

I work in a clinic and there are people I have to call multiple times for weeks to get them to answer their phone just to tell them they have medications waiting for them. Standard practice is to call 3 times on different days. Then the patient calls and asks for a status on the medication, I have to tell them I called them 3 times with no answer and no voicemail. \"I didn't recognize the number\". Even worse are the times we have to reschedule an appointment and they never answer. They come to check in and get mad that the appointment has been canceled. Luckily we document every time we call someone and whether or not a voicemail was left.\n\nMy daughter is 19, she just went to and graduated a technical school. She started applying for jobs and listed me and her mom as alternate points of contact. We started getting multiple calls a day because they couldn't leave her messages to set up interviews.
