Thank goodness for the mattress cover saving the mattress lol\n\nI just scooped up all the peed on stuff once she woke up, and off to the wash. \n\nIt's just pee. Whatever.

Other times I'm so hungry that even the abdominal discomfort doesnt happen but I eat 3x as much as I would normally because it feels like an empty hole in my stomach and nothing will fill it. Point being, lots of pain and very difficult to stop eating.\n\nI didnt find out what was wrong until a few years after I became diabetic and mentioned it to a doctor, but my whole life I've had this issue. My family nickname was hungry, I heard the hi hungry I'm dad jokes plenty (which is not funny when you're in actual pain from needing food and your dad is making idiotic jokes), and my mom once had cps called from the school because I was always complaining that I was hungry. She had to show them full cupboards and accessable snacks to show I wasnt being starved.",

I responded by being so incredibly irresponsible that I have a record now (that I’m thankfully expunging most of) and a prior drug habit. But after I grew up a lot and my son’s death he stepped up, took me in, and is helping me piece together my life so that I can have the future I should’ve had 5 years ago. OP needs to take responsibility for how he raised his children to have their habits and reactions. It didn’t come from nowhere.",

By \"reformat\" I assumed the OP meant that they took their OS disk and did a complete re-install via reformat, as reformatting usually means wiping a disk clean.\n\nAn updated, larger OS should not degrade computer performance much. (Note: I do not include brand new OS's, ie Win7 v. Win XP, just updates like Service Packs). \n\nAlso, Hard drive performance can degrade. RAM can degrade as well, but usually RAM errors just cause the computer to not boot at all. So for physical degradation, usually it's the CPU, GPU, or other complicated IC, or it's the hard drive. Most other components, degradation = hard failure.\n\nIf you have a 10 year old computer, AND you are using the latest software, it's not going to be pretty. Hardware performance down and software demands up... somethings gotta give.\n",

Photons are massless particles, and consequently always move at the speed of light until they are stopped, whatever energy they have.\n\nThe color of light is a consequence of its wavelength\/frequency. When you shine a light through, say, a red-tinted film, what's happening is that the pigment (or what have you) in the film absorbs all frequencies of the passing light *except* red. So if a photon's frequency is within that range of reds, it will pass through, otherwise it will be absorbed. By contrast, if you pass that same beam of light through a perfectly translucent prism, it will all pass through.",

Atoms will still decay and gradually fall into disorder. This is called entropy. It's why people age. It's why ice will melt if you leave it out on your counter.  Us measuring or not measuring the duration, doesn't change that the duration exists.\n\nAlso what you are referring to as \"space-time\" is not entirely accurate. While it's true that time is often considered a fourth dimension including the 3 spacial dimensions, \"Space-time\" isn't based on our units of measurements. Spacetime is based on relativity where space and time are both part of the same thing. And anything with mass will bend space-time. This is gravity. Time dilation is also from relativity, where something moving close to speed of light will experience time slower relative to something at rest frame. At the speed of light, photons don't experience time at all. Again, all of this holds true regardless of if we measure it or not.",

Some have thicker layers than others, but bacteria still usually are defenseless against soaps). Hand sanitizers are the actual killers of bacteria. They essentially burn them up and shrivel them through the alcohol. \n:^) microbiology is really eye opening to alot of stuff man",

If you're into it fine, but I'll be over here as a proponent of plant based diets, but no thanks on that community. Vegans have severally tainted all credibility by being associated with douche bag protestors and idiotic bloggers.\n\nI am not anti the vegan diet, but find the movement itself to be too judgy, entitled and closed minded.\n\nAgain, I have nothing against ethical vegans principles, but the behavior of individuals within it has been ridiculous enough to steer me towards a more holistic approach to plant food.\n\nMy cousin has worked on many farms and studied agriculture as well as I'm friends with a university professor who's topic of focus is food sustainability and nutrition.  Neither of these people are vegans, but both eat plant based diets 95% of the time.",

Wouldn't they still be able to see the taste then?\n\nIf that were true, then some adults (toy makers or children's book writers) should have been able to understand why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch even in 1995.  Yet we know for a fact that they were not able to.\n\nPerhaps losing the ability to understand why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch is what defines child-to-adult transition.\n\nPerhaps *people* who retain a sense of childlike innocence never truly become \"adults.\" \n\n\n",

The ability to show a world fundamentally different from our own serves to take issues that are tied up in specifics in our world and abstract them to their logical form. It also makes us question which elements of our own world are essential and which are accidental, since we have a potentially infinite range of fantasy worlds but our sample size for real worlds is one. The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas is a critique of utilitarianism. Wheel of Time explores the memetic nature of myths and the psychological burden of concepts like destiny.",

They absolutely have hope in the present life.\n\nYour hope and purpose doesn't need to be grounded in reality. \n\nConsider two patients facing cancer. One has hope that God will heal him. One doesn't believe in God. God doesn't exist. Does that mean that the person who believes in God doesn't have hope any more? No, because that person believes in God. Belief in God is enough to provide hope; the actual presence and action of God is not necessary.\n\nHonestly, were I an all-knowing, all-seeing deity who wants a creation with free will, I would make sure that the creation benefits from belief in God without needing physical proof. In this interesting scenario, the deity would indeed have no need to prove himself via miracles beyond the initial development of the faith. I'm not saying that this is what is happening, but the Bible makes it clear that free will is a priority in creation. ",

    "body": "I think it's more valuable to specifically and explicitly distinguish between \"racism\" and \"systemic racism\" at least in common parlance. While the academic definition certainly distinguishes the institutionalised oppression of class, that's not the colloquial usage. When most people talk about having experienced \"racism\", I think what they're referring to is predominantly what you seem to define as specifically simply \"prejudice\". If you think of it like a venn diagram, this overlap between the academic and colloquial definitions just leads to ambiguity in meaning, which I think hurts the conversation and doesn't provide a productive solution, and if anything gives ammunition to those who hold prejudicial views because it just makes it feel like the game is rigged even from the perspective of the language being used- bigotry and hate thrive in ignorance and fear of the unknown, so dissolving the foundation of even common language hurts efforts to expand narrowminded people's horizons. I think the function of language should be clarity, and making an effort to specifically and distinctively separate the concepts of the common experience of encountering \"a racist\" and therefore \"encountering racism\" versus the more abstract experience of being victim of institutionalised racial prejudice and therefore \"being racially oppressed\" is a worthwhile endeavour. As such I would say that a white person even in contemporary America can in fact encounter \"racism\" just as anyone can, but absolutely are not in a position as the majority power to be victim of institutionalised oppression.

Along with their identification they experience intense scrutiny, inner turmoil, and confusion on their path to be themselves. Real, medically documented turmoil.\n\nYou appear to be saying here that turmoil is a necessary requirement because being a woman cannot just be through self-identification?",

Also, loans are not only long-term obligations such as mortgages, but also unsecured short term loans like credit cards, which almost *entirely* go directly into the economy. \n\nNote, though, that this isn't an argument about the rich's money \"trickling down\" to poorer people, as these kinds of loans actually exacerbate inequality, if one thinks that's something important to care about. \n\nIt's only an argument that it doesn't result in lower velocity of money, but rather higher.",

I'm completely normal.\" \n\nThere has to be some part of you that realises that being a sadist, is part of the DSM-5, and is classified as a personality disorder, which makes it a mental disorder.\n\nWhich renders your entire argument moot, when you argue that your opinion is normal because you are sane.\n\nYou cannot be a sadist that acts on your impulses, and claim to be normal. You are simply a sadist that has not been caught. You're just a smart sadist that blends in, thats it. \n\nBeing caught for killing an animal and enjoying it, is the only reason that you arent diagnosed with a sadistic personality disorder.

They are just same hero's journey one after another. \"Story\" doesn't exist in a vacuum but is always part of art direction, world building and style.\n2. Story of Dark Souls as whole is something I haven't countered in any other media. I have read lot of stories of depression, self discovery or sacrifice but none are tied to same kind of grand mythology as Dark Souls. It's story and way it tells it's story are both unique. Or can you tell of a film that tells the same story?\n3. Dark souls is not just a story. It's multiple stories and players\/chosen undeads story is just one of them.\n4. Finally Dark Souls disproves your position by counter example. Video games when done right can be not just good but more unique storytelling medium than anything out there.",

    "body": "Thanks for your reply!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a question, let's say you have two theoretical humans.  One has free will and the other doesn't.  Let's not worry about how one can or can't have free will.  Let's just assume that this is the case.  Your job is to test which one has free will and which doesn't.  How would you test this?  When I think of not having free will, I think of someone who acts logically and not based on impulse.  They don't run into walls because it is illogical.  So if someone does run into a wall intentionally, they probably have free will because it makes no sense to run into a wall.  So to me, seeing the ability to act intentionally illogically would seem to suggest free will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing I've taken away from the other commenters the most in this debate so far is that their reasons for believing there is no free will can often be turned around as proof of free will.  For example, you say that a person being pressured by an outside force can be made to take certain actions.  This is because a person needs to be able to evaluate a large number of things and then apply all of those to make a decision.  This makes sense for a person who can actually make a choice.  If they are under duress or at least feel like they are, they may bow to the person or thing putting them in that position.  But if they have no free will then I'd reason that it makes less sense for them to give in because why would their actions be based on abstract things such as duress?  They would be able to make actions without needing to evaluate such trivial things and do things more coldly and logically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe we are also using different criteria to determine what is free will.  You are quite concerned with outside forces affecting our decisions.  This draws me back to the question about the wall.  I don't feel like walking around the wall instead of attempting to walk through it has any indication as to whether I can make a choice or not.  Why should it?  I evaluated the situation and make a decision.  If I choose to eat only after first being influenced by the smell of food, I don't see that as evidence against free will either.  I again evaluated a situation and made a decision.  Clearly there are always going to be outside forces involved in decision making.  Heck, just the ability to breathe affects every decision you make.  If you can't breathe you certainly will make different decisions than if you can breathe.",

Maybe tax credits for people who are donors, or a full opt-out system where everyone is assumed to be a donor by default.\n\nWe love to start with punishment solutions without even trying others first.\n\n&gt;Doctors would, just as it is now, have a clear set of criteria to decide these cases.\n\nExcept now you are giving them criteria that are outside of their medical opinion and into their _moral_ opinion, which is the concern.  I don't like the idea of the people in power getting to decide who lives or dies based on their own moral calculus.  That is too dangerous a door to ever allow to be opened.",

    "body": "This is exactly the issue I pointed out. Your moral instinct is wildly self-inconsistent. We know it isn’t logical. \n\nRule 1 of logic — The principle of non-contradiction.\n\nYou said “it is immoral because the right to life in inalienable”\n\nInalienable refers to a right that cannot be surrendered. But now you hold the contradictory view that this doesn’t mean assisted suicide is immoral. \n\nIf I can’t surrender my right to life so that you can eat me **because** that right is inalienable, then I can’t surrender that right for any reason. Including assisted suicide.\n\nI assert that really you’re just grossed out by eating people and your rationalizing it as something to do with a right to life. You can’t actually observe\/intuit what is moral. This is just a moral illusion.",
