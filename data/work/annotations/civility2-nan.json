If it really came down to it, the government would make it so that the farmers pay minimum wage, and the government makes up the cost to above minimum wage to incentivize individuals to take the jobs. I would be out there myself for $11 or $12 an hour, but it's not important enough to be worth that amount yet.\n\nI'm sorry you just don't get how huge a disruption it would be.\n\n&gt;Because it's damaging to the people born in the country whose line they decide to cross. They know it's illegal, they know the risk. They have a legal route and refuse to take it. If breaking one non violent law is ok then breaking ALL non violent laws are ok. Hell, if you cross the Mexican border illegally they don't offer the same amnesty, so why should the U.S.?\n\nThe economic evidence shows that the economy mostly benefits from migrants. Is there some other way that they're really harming Americans other than the psychic trauma of having _broke the law_?\n\nAlso, most of the people do not have any legal means of working in the country. Visas have a hard cap at 600k a year. The waiting list can take over a decade. If you can't see these very poor people are in a sympathetic situation at all, then we probably don't have much more to say to each other.\n\nNon-violent laws are broken all the time without punishment, and the world mostly goes on ok. Cops let people off for speeding tickets or look the other way on a little bit of pot. Such a hardline stance of \"if one law is allowed to be broken, than all are broken\" is extremist and unrealistic.\n\nI'm not looking to force you to change your view, but a modicum of reflection would make me very happy.",

Furthermore, in the playoffs there can't be any ties, so both teams would be given a completely fair chance, and we'd get to see them give it their all on both sides of the field.",

So most of their fleet will be 1-seaters since that is what most of the usage is with only enough 4-seaters to provide for the additional seats when they are needed.",

    "body": "I think the biggest problem is that it's an incomplete philosophy. \n\nFirst, there is no basis for this philosophy. It makes the *assumption* that truth and love are the highest values possible, yet there is no backing for it. If life is a pre-requisite to truth AND love, shouldn't life be valued first? And should we not value freedom next, to let people pursue their own desires? In terms of truth, it makes sense for us to value that-- it allows us to gain more information about the world, and better develop moral decisions. But what about love? Love-- whether between friends, romantic partners, etc-- is a mutual agreement of sorts, a recognition to act in happiness and respect. Therefore, love comes from our values of 1) happiness (our friendships and relationships giving us more fulfillment, and our recognition that being an asshole to everyone makes us less happy) and 2) respect (our desire, or at least some people's desire, to be nice even when wronged). Love is not a PRIMARY value. \n\nSecond, you give no means of deciding what IS truth and what IS love. Truth may be described as \"that which is with accordance of reality\"-- but do we all witness the same reality? Perhaps there is an objective reality, but perhaps there is not. I have no way of knowing if we witness the same reality. It's all the same to me, and it SEEMS as if there is, but there are different truths to different people. A certain idea may speak to you, and improve your life, but not mine-- each person must thus be able to pursue *their own* truths. And perhaps there are some universal truths, but perhaps not-- that's something that has to be proved, not assumed. \n\nLooking at some of the examples--\n&gt;But I must recognize that's true only to me, and I would be wrong to try persuading others of it, without evidence that might apply to them\n\nWould you? Let's say there's religion A, and Jane Smith is a follower. And under the beliefs, if you do not believe in Religion A, you will suffer for eternity after death. Now, if Jane was convinced that religion A was true, even if Jane didn't have solid proof, wouldn't she be an asshole not to try to tell other people? I mean, she honestly believes that those people will suffer for eternity-- wouldn't it be loving to try to save them? You may argue that, of course religion A is wrong, and has no validity-- but in Jane's mind, it has PERFECT validity. \n\nThis is an example of where definitions come into play. Where is the boundary for truth and love? Now, clearly, the answer would be for JANE to value truth more heavily, and pursue knowledge that her beliefs are unfounded-- but suppose *she believes* she has. Truth and love, then are in contradiction. \n\nNow, looking at the implications;\n\n&gt;If homosexuality doesn't result in decreased love in the world, it's immoral to oppose two same-sex ppl forming a life together.\n\nWhy is the standard for immorality love? And why assume something is immoral unless it promotes love? If I go to the store and buy a few tomatoes with the intent to simply throw them away, there's nothing loving in that-- I don't intend to feed anyone. But I would argue that my choice is still moral because of *rights*. Which is another huge flaw in your philosophy- systems of love need systems of rights to gauge the *limit* of love. In my tomato example, it would be immoral, because no love would have been furthered-- but I think it's pretty clear that, since I agreed to buy the tomatoes, and the store agreed to sell them, nobody is being forced to do anything against their will-- both of us can continue happily.\n\n&gt;Rape is wrong because it is an infringment on love\n\nI actually think this is a good counterexample. A significant number of rapes are committed by a person the victim knows. Rapists may even be romantically in love with their victims-- in your world, this would be moral. Yet, because the RIGHTS of the victim are being infringed upon, in a horrible, inhumane, disgusting manner, it is one of the most immoral acts imaginable. \n\nTo take another example-- gay conversion therapy. Say that John is gay, and his loving family, followers of Religion A, believe that he will suffer in eternity for it. Let's say they even have some evidence Religion A is correct. Out of love, they kidnap him, and force him into a gay conversion therapy camp in a third-world country. Such situations as these have been proven CONSISTENTLY to cause great psychological harm and trauma. Clearly, it is wrong to force John against his will to go to this camp-- yet his family, out of \"love\", has done it anyways. Shouldn't there be a recognition of rights? That John should be free to live his life how HE wants? The boundary would be, his family, out of kindness, tries to *persuade* him-- yet, morally, that is the furthest they can go without being immoral.\n\nAnd last, the problem of war is one I think you cannot handle. Say Country A attacks Country B. Country B, acting purely in a system of love, would refuse to attack back, because violence isn't loving-- but, because self defense is an inherent right, I think Country B is right to stop aggression and defend itself. Under your philosophy, if even one country or person doesn't follow it, the others can be seriously harmed.",

I would suggest mixed gender locker rooms, but that never flies. A simple partition down the middle of the locker room can solve this, so both sides can still talk. \n\n&gt;This is especially prevalent in sports like hockey, where players spend upwards of 45 minutes getting ready.\n\n90% of which doesn't really require separate locker rooms. \n\n&gt;My second reason is that it is very uncomfortable for boys to tackle, bodycheck, etc... girls, due to being raised not to hit girls in any circumstance. \n\n\"it's the way I was raised\" is a terrible excuse. That's kind of shit that let's certain groups do horrible things to other people. \n\n&gt;When the boys do play physically against girls, it is rarely ever as hard, which gives the girls an unfair advantage. \n\nThis is your own shit getting in the way. Give no quarter. If they signed up for a contact sport, they knew exactly what they were getting into. If they didn't want to get hit, then they'd be playing in a non contact league. \n\n\n\n\nHere's another point to consider. So girls have to go play in the girls league right? What if a small guy wants to go play in the girls league because he doesn't want to get stomped? Separate gender sports are a terrible way to deal with the problem. Girls can join boy scouts, but boys can't join brownies. \n\nInstead we should do for hockey what we do for martial arts, weight class. ",

I wish that when they break the design they would use CSD to primarily make it easier for me to understand what‚Äôs going on, and then worry about how weird or consistent the interface was.  \n\nI get that nobody wants to futz with ugly and inconsistent interfaces, but if you're messing with it all anyway CSD seems like a great way to actually make things easy.  \n\nPersonally I'm not sure why the word \"Layout\" tells me what I need so much better than an icon, but a text interface, weird or otherwise would be 1000 times more pleasing than consistently providing something already hard for me to understand.",

    "body": "Ok so let me address some of your points, and I also want to say kudos to you for trying to learn. I think that‚Äôs a noble, life long endeavor and I hope you learn something from the thread. \n\n&gt;I can't see a way for rich people to avoid taxes by loopholes.\n\nThe easiest way I could think of would be to make purchases in a different jurisdiction (buy things in country X and move them). Secondly, the fact that people can avoid laws, isn‚Äôt a reason not to have them. \n\n&gt;I think it is fair, laws are for everybody so why do we discrimate people base on income ?\n\nI think this might be a misconception of how a marginal tax rate works. Person A makes 50,000 person B makes 100,000.\n\nBoth A and B pay the same amount of money on the first 50,000 of income (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 10% so that‚Äôs 5,000 each). Then Person B pays on the next 50,000 of income (let‚Äôs say 20%) which means 10,000. So Person A‚Äôs final taxes are 5,000 and Person B is 15,000 (or marginal tax rates of 10% and 15% respectively). Person A and B are treated equally on the money they make. \n\n&gt;I belive it has some benefit for both the rich and the poor, because you abolish income tax so people's working rate rise to maximum and people have more money.\n\nGenerally speaking, poor people don‚Äôt pay as much income tax, because the starting brackets are both low, and don‚Äôt kick in at 0 dollars. You might want to specify what you mean by ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô (do you mean they keep more of their money? Because if you don‚Äôt pay income tax, but do pay a consumption tax, it‚Äôs less of a benefit). You also pointed out in point 1 that you‚Äôd prefer to have no loopholes, so ostensibly the rich person would pay more too. \n\n&gt;Rich people have to choose between saveing money for the future,invasting or cosum the money and pay taxes. People shouldn't have to pay tax when they are growthing the economy.\n\nWait, paying people for goods and services is a way of growing the economy. So do you believe in a consumption tax or not? Also saving is basically the same as investing (either you do it, or the bank does). \n\nedit: to clarify how paying for goods and services: if you buy 10 &lt;item&gt;, that's money the &lt;item&gt; store can now use to buy more of that item to restock it. That money then goes to the item manufacturer. If there's enough demand, they hire more workers.  Same with the store. Maybe they open a new plant (or a new store). That makes the economy bigger. The economy is the sum total of all transactions, so more transactions == larger economy. \n\n&gt;I do see that it is kind of regressive but i'm still not convinced. My friend said everybody has to buy food, but even here the rich pays more tax cause they are more likely to go and buy expesive stuff to eat. But i do concede that you could have a basic income to keep the poorest atleast alive.( Or you could habe people giveing free food through charity, like how i saw it in Vietnam a communist state.)\n\nYes, the idea is if you spend 100% of your income on things, then you will pay a greater percentage of your income in taxes, compared to someone who pays only a fraction. This means it has a greater impact on those people who spend all of their paycheck. When you say the rich pay more, do you mean in absolute or relative terms?\n\n&gt;It makes the live for people simpler.\n\nSo would having the IRS just tell you how much you owe (since they have copies of most of your forms anyway). Then you could just redo the sections they don‚Äôt know (e.g. return free filing)",
