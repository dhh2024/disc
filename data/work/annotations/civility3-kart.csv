"[{""rating"":1}]",2290,"6","arcisal","","There are several ways to play Sniper.

You get MoM basically to get more headshots off. This also involves you actually leaving the lane and killing heroes. While its not such a bad idea, you're just delaying your more important items (in my humble opinion). 

I prefer to go Treads &gt; Aquilla &gt; Maelstorm. People say that you get Phase on him so that you can reposition yourself easily, but I prefer to ability to tread switch to get that extra Assassinate off or the extra tankiness and attack speed. Aquilla is a great early game item that allows you to stay in lane with its regen and solves your crap base damage. Maelstrom procs help you farm as well and can be upgraded to a Mjolnir later on which is way more relevant.

I get Blink sometimes but I find its too gimmicky for me. Yes its great and all for escaping, but that is provided you see them before they're on you.

Your hope and purpose doesn't need to be grounded in reality. 

Consider two patients facing cancer. One has hope that God will heal him. One doesn't believe in God. God doesn't exist. Does that mean that the person who believes in God doesn't have hope any more? No, because that person believes in God. Belief in God is enough to provide hope; the actual presence and action of God is not necessary.

Honestly, were I an all-knowing, all-seeing deity who wants a creation with free will, I would make sure that the creation benefits from belief in God without needing physical proof. In this interesting scenario, the deity would indeed have no need to prove himself via miracles beyond the initial development of the faith. I'm not saying that this is what is happening, but the Bible makes it clear that free will is a priority in creation.

While the academic definition certainly distinguishes the institutionalised oppression of class, that's not the colloquial usage. When most people talk about having experienced ""racism"", I think what they're referring to is predominantly what you seem to define as specifically simply ""prejudice"". If you think of it like a venn diagram, this overlap between the academic and colloquial definitions just leads to ambiguity in meaning, which I think hurts the conversation and doesn't provide a productive solution, and if anything gives ammunition to those who hold prejudicial views because it just makes it feel like the game is rigged even from the perspective of the language being used- bigotry and hate thrive in ignorance and fear of the unknown, so dissolving the foundation of even common language hurts efforts to expand narrowminded people's horizons. I think the function of language should be clarity, and making an effort to specifically and distinctively separate the concepts of the common experience of encountering ""a racist"" and therefore ""encountering racism"" versus the more abstract experience of being victim of institutionalised racial prejudice and therefore ""being racially oppressed"" is a worthwhile endeavour.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a question, let's say you have two theoretical humans.  One has free will and the other doesn't.  Let's not worry about how one can or can't have free will.  Let's just assume that this is the case.  Your job is to test which one has free will and which doesn't.  How would you test this?  When I think of not having free will, I think of someone who acts logically and not based on impulse.  They don't run into walls because it is illogical.  So if someone does run into a wall intentionally, they probably have free will because it makes no sense to run into a wall.  So to me, seeing the ability to act intentionally illogically would seem to suggest free will.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I've taken away from the other commenters the most in this debate so far is that their reasons for believing there is no free will can often be turned around as proof of free will.  For example, you say that a person being pressured by an outside force can be made to take certain actions.  This is because a person needs to be able to evaluate a large number of things and then apply all of those to make a decision.  This makes sense for a person who can actually make a choice.  If they are under duress or at least feel like they are, they may bow to the person or thing putting them in that position.  But if they have no free will then I'd reason that it makes less sense for them to give in because why would their actions be based on abstract things such as duress?  They would be able to make actions without needing to evaluate such trivial things and do things more coldly and logically.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe we are also using different criteria to determine what is free will.  You are quite concerned with outside forces affecting our decisions.  This draws me back to the question about the wall.  I don't feel like walking around the wall instead of attempting to walk through it has any indication as to whether I can make a choice or not.  Why should it?  I evaluated the situation and make a decision.  If I choose to eat only after first being influenced by the smell of food, I don't see that as evidence against free will either.  I again evaluated a situation and made a decision.  Clearly there are always going to be outside forces involved in decision making.  Heck, just the ability to breathe affects every decision you make.  If you can't breathe you certainly will make different decisions than if you can breathe.",0,"2024-05-22T21:21:32.994444Z","2019-10-10 11:15:30","[{""rating"":5}]","[{""rating"":1}]",4,"[{""rating"":6}]",32843453034,"[{""rating"":2}]","[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":5}]",190.792,812447761,"[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":1}]",32841824968,"[{""rating"":4}]","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dfpkpd/_/f3656ju/",2,"data_driven_civil_discourse_subset_4-9","changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-22T21:21:32.994460Z"

Rule 1 of logic — The principle of non-contradiction.

You said “it is immoral because the right to life in inalienable”

Inalienable refers to a right that cannot be surrendered. But now you hold the contradictory view that this doesn’t mean assisted suicide is immoral. 

If I can’t surrender my right to life so that you can eat me **because** that right is inalienable, then I can’t surrender that right for any reason. Including assisted suicide.

I assert that really you’re just grossed out by eating people and your rationalizing it as something to do with a right to life. You can’t actually observe/intuit what is moral.
