Most people don’t make analytical decisions when talking about their own lives and challenges.\n\nThis is kind of amusing to me, because I believe so fiercely in doing everything I can to communicate effectively. I get scientific papers back from review with a side note thanking me for making the draft manuscript readable.\n\nBut this kind of communication is an asynchronous conversation, and people speak in their own voices.\n\nIt doesn’t require policing or condescension or judgement on extra letters or syllables.You just figure it out and meet halfway. Trust me. I’m one of three people managing an online community that swells to several hundred people when we hit the on-season, and a lot of them are new to each other and from different backgrounds.\n\nOf course there are misunderstandings. Of course there are different communication styles. There can be clashes and conflict because of this.\n\nThe vast majority of the time, it’s very easily sorted and I don’t even have to step in. When I do, I assume good faith. That’s one of our most useful rules. We have a high tolerance for diversity of views and misunderstandings… and a zero tolerance for bs, whether that’s passive aggressiveness, trolling or just basic rudeness; once people have had any misinterpretations or worrisome behaviours explained, it’s almost always fine.\n\nIf you’re annoyed at encountering an acronym you’re unfamiliar with, that’s understandable enough. Anything that interrupts a reading\/listening flow can be jarring.\n\nYour discomfort doesn’t mean that expression needs to be policed. It’s a one-off, as most things like this tend to be. That’s a case where self-policing is the order of the day.\n\nBeing contemptuous of other people’s communication styles doesn’t make you smart or special.\n\n(I’m out at this point. I feel I’ve addressed my point and the importance of extending a little tolerance and grace to others, and I’m off to go get in the sea. I won’t reply further.)",

The boy was lazy, couldn’t make it through college, couldn’t hold a job very long, and finally was divorced by his wife after years of carrying all the load while he took pills and basically didn’t contribute. About five years after he got divorced, he ended up dying of an accidental drug overdose and leaving his two children without a dad all because he was entitled, spoiled, and lazy. Meanwhile his sister who wasn’t fawned over has succeeded in her field and makes bank, and is enjoying her grandchildren. The females in this family are going to have much more productive lives, but I can see the sons marrying and expecting their poor wives to wait on them hand and foot. The mother is creating helpless males. She probably was raised this way, but it’s time for her to butt out and let her kids become functioning adults.",

But imagining faces is a lot more difficult. Like, if I try to imagine my best friend or my mom I have a few characteristics that identify them (red hair, their eyeshape, a scar) but I'm imcapable of putting all of them together. But if I see them in real life, I can definitely distinguish them from a person that looks similar\nI thought that was the norm until now.",

Which isn’t to say that leaks don’t happen.   They do.   However, you might also be surprised how many of them are deliberately put out there by networks or studios for publicity.",

    "body": "I'm sure there are examples where an attempted murderer got a longer sentence than an actual murderer -- it would depend upon the jurisdiction, the jury, the skill of the defense attorney at the sentencing hearing, the circumstances surrounding the murder attempt (and whether or not there were other charges that the person was found guilty for).  Someone convicted of 125 counts of attempted murder (say, for an arson at an occupied building or something filed under RICO statutes) could quite easily get a much longer sentence than someone convicted of one count of murder. But generally, given *identical* circumstances, someone convicted of attempted murder is going to get a shorter sentence than someone convicted of murder (that being said, there is never going to be a situation with _identical_ circumstances).",

    "body": "For those now fearful of driving across the LC bridge, allow me to greatly compound that fear. In the U.S. generally, almost 8% of all bridges are structurally deficient and, more alarming, about ONE THIRD of bridges need repair or replacement, including one third of interstate bridges. If that doesn’t sound like a crisis, consider this: to fix only those bridges that are structurally deficient (ignoring the other repair\/replace, at great risk), it would take almost 70 years and 54 billion dollars. Of course, in that time, imagine how many will be further damaged. (See the following, though many sources exist: https:\/\/artbabridgereport.org\/)\n\nWe have an infrastructure CRISIS. It isn’t politically sexy and the problems are mostly invisible (for now). Add in the cost and labor, and it is easy to see why those in charge turn a blind eye. It is almost guaranteed that there will be catastrophic failure of multiple bridges before anyone is motivated to act. \n\nIf you’re still complacent, go ahead and look into the state of sewers, dams, and other major infrastructure. It’s all crumbling and not much is being done to address it. Good luck out there.",

Basically, we aren't just opening up more about the many different forms of mental trauma we experience, we're actually experiencing more of it over time, and that ***modern society is legitimately making the trauma worse.***\n\nThrow a dog into a fighting pit, and then into a cage, it will then stay traumatized. Take one, and send it to a professional, give it a family, and over time it will lose its trauma symptoms. \n\nSo the same goes with modern society. Lose a child? See war? Get deployed to South Korea, never see combat, but be forced to stay away from your family for a year? \nOur lonely apartment buildings are all our cages. ",

It’s got nothing to do with whether or not someone will vote for you. Racism on the other hand is an aspect of your character, and something you can control, an therefore are responsible for.

The ability to show a world fundamentally different from our own serves to take issues that are tied up in specifics in our world and abstract them to their logical form. It also makes us question which elements of our own world are essential and which are accidental, since we have a potentially infinite range of fantasy worlds but our sample size for real worlds is one. The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas is a critique of utilitarianism. Wheel of Time explores the memetic nature of myths and the psychological burden of concepts like destiny.",

They absolutely have hope in the present life.\n\nYour hope and purpose doesn't need to be grounded in reality. \n\nConsider two patients facing cancer. One has hope that God will heal him. One doesn't believe in God. God doesn't exist. Does that mean that the person who believes in God doesn't have hope any more? No, because that person believes in God. Belief in God is enough to provide hope; the actual presence and action of God is not necessary.\n\nHonestly, were I an all-knowing, all-seeing deity who wants a creation with free will, I would make sure that the creation benefits from belief in God without needing physical proof. In this interesting scenario, the deity would indeed have no need to prove himself via miracles beyond the initial development of the faith. I'm not saying that this is what is happening, but the Bible makes it clear that free will is a priority in creation. ",

    "body": "I think it's more valuable to specifically and explicitly distinguish between \"racism\" and \"systemic racism\" at least in common parlance. While the academic definition certainly distinguishes the institutionalised oppression of class, that's not the colloquial usage. When most people talk about having experienced \"racism\", I think what they're referring to is predominantly what you seem to define as specifically simply \"prejudice\". If you think of it like a venn diagram, this overlap between the academic and colloquial definitions just leads to ambiguity in meaning, which I think hurts the conversation and doesn't provide a productive solution, and if anything gives ammunition to those who hold prejudicial views because it just makes it feel like the game is rigged even from the perspective of the language being used- bigotry and hate thrive in ignorance and fear of the unknown, so dissolving the foundation of even common language hurts efforts to expand narrowminded people's horizons. I think the function of language should be clarity, and making an effort to specifically and distinctively separate the concepts of the common experience of encountering \"a racist\" and therefore \"encountering racism\" versus the more abstract experience of being victim of institutionalised racial prejudice and therefore \"being racially oppressed\" is a worthwhile endeavour. As such I would say that a white person even in contemporary America can in fact encounter \"racism\" just as anyone can, but absolutely are not in a position as the majority power to be victim of institutionalised oppression.

Also, loans are not only long-term obligations such as mortgages, but also unsecured short term loans like credit cards, which almost *entirely* go directly into the economy. \n\nNote, though, that this isn't an argument about the rich's money \"trickling down\" to poorer people, as these kinds of loans actually exacerbate inequality, if one thinks that's something important to care about. \n\nIt's only an argument that it doesn't result in lower velocity of money, but rather higher.",

They are just same hero's journey one after another. \"Story\" doesn't exist in a vacuum but is always part of art direction, world building and style.\n2. Story of Dark Souls as whole is something I haven't countered in any other media. I have read lot of stories of depression, self discovery or sacrifice but none are tied to same kind of grand mythology as Dark Souls. It's story and way it tells it's story are both unique. Or can you tell of a film that tells the same story?\n3. Dark souls is not just a story. It's multiple stories and players\/chosen undeads story is just one of them.\n4. Finally Dark Souls disproves your position by counter example. Video games when done right can be not just good but more unique storytelling medium than anything out there.",

    "body": "Thanks for your reply!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a question, let's say you have two theoretical humans.  One has free will and the other doesn't.  Let's not worry about how one can or can't have free will.  Let's just assume that this is the case.  Your job is to test which one has free will and which doesn't.  How would you test this?  When I think of not having free will, I think of someone who acts logically and not based on impulse.  They don't run into walls because it is illogical.  So if someone does run into a wall intentionally, they probably have free will because it makes no sense to run into a wall.  So to me, seeing the ability to act intentionally illogically would seem to suggest free will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing I've taken away from the other commenters the most in this debate so far is that their reasons for believing there is no free will can often be turned around as proof of free will.  For example, you say that a person being pressured by an outside force can be made to take certain actions.  This is because a person needs to be able to evaluate a large number of things and then apply all of those to make a decision.  This makes sense for a person who can actually make a choice.  If they are under duress or at least feel like they are, they may bow to the person or thing putting them in that position.  But if they have no free will then I'd reason that it makes less sense for them to give in because why would their actions be based on abstract things such as duress?  They would be able to make actions without needing to evaluate such trivial things and do things more coldly and logically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe we are also using different criteria to determine what is free will.  You are quite concerned with outside forces affecting our decisions.  This draws me back to the question about the wall.  I don't feel like walking around the wall instead of attempting to walk through it has any indication as to whether I can make a choice or not.  Why should it?  I evaluated the situation and make a decision.  If I choose to eat only after first being influenced by the smell of food, I don't see that as evidence against free will either.  I again evaluated a situation and made a decision.  Clearly there are always going to be outside forces involved in decision making.  Heck, just the ability to breathe affects every decision you make.  If you can't breathe you certainly will make different decisions than if you can breathe.",

I'm incredibly skeptical that we could push societal change on a large enough scale in the U.S. to eliminate the need for firearms based on the fact that nearly 250 years later, race is still an issue to the level that the Buffalo shooting happened. I wish one of those people in the store was armed so they could have put that psycho in the dirt.",

Maybe tax credits for people who are donors, or a full opt-out system where everyone is assumed to be a donor by default.\n\nWe love to start with punishment solutions without even trying others first.\n\n&gt;Doctors would, just as it is now, have a clear set of criteria to decide these cases.\n\nExcept now you are giving them criteria that are outside of their medical opinion and into their _moral_ opinion, which is the concern.  I don't like the idea of the people in power getting to decide who lives or dies based on their own moral calculus.  That is too dangerous a door to ever allow to be opened.",

And their policies have devolved from policies that counter Democrats to, frankly, extreme and nonsensical policies. Their values used to be upholding free market, a strong military, Etc. Not inherently moral or immoral views. Depends on who you ask. Radical and inhumane views have become mainstream now. Waterboarding, withholding human rights from people based on sexual orientation, refusing to give immigrants fair trials. Letting domestic abuse perpetrators own guns. These are immoral things and they've come to light in the mainstream.",

We know it isn’t logical. \n\nRule 1 of logic — The principle of non-contradiction.\n\nYou said “it is immoral because the right to life in inalienable”\n\nInalienable refers to a right that cannot be surrendered. But now you hold the contradictory view that this doesn’t mean assisted suicide is immoral. \n\nIf I can’t surrender my right to life so that you can eat me **because** that right is inalienable, then I can’t surrender that right for any reason. Including assisted suicide.\n\nI assert that really you’re just grossed out by eating people and your rationalizing it as something to do with a right to life. You can’t actually observe\/intuit what is moral. This is just a moral illusion.",
