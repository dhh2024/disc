This is kind of amusing to me, because I believe so fiercely in doing everything I can to communicate effectively. I get scientific papers back from review with a side note thanking me for making the draft manuscript readable.

But this kind of communication is an asynchronous conversation, and people speak in their own voices.

It doesn‚Äôt require policing or condescension or judgement on extra letters or syllables.You just figure it out and meet halfway. Trust me. I‚Äôm one of three people managing an online community that swells to several hundred people when we hit the on-season, and a lot of them are new to each other and from different backgrounds.

Of course there are misunderstandings. Of course there are different communication styles. There can be clashes and conflict because of this.

The vast majority of the time, it‚Äôs very easily sorted and I don‚Äôt even have to step in. When I do, I assume good faith. That‚Äôs one of our most useful rules. We have a high tolerance for diversity of views and misunderstandings‚Ä¶ and a zero tolerance for bs, whether that‚Äôs passive aggressiveness, trolling or just basic rudeness; once people have had any misinterpretations or worrisome behaviours explained, it‚Äôs almost always fine.

If you‚Äôre annoyed at encountering an acronym you‚Äôre unfamiliar with, that‚Äôs understandable enough. Anything that interrupts a reading/listening flow can be jarring.

Your discomfort doesn‚Äôt mean that expression needs to be policed. It‚Äôs a one-off, as most things like this tend to be. That‚Äôs a case where self-policing is the order of the day.

Being contemptuous of other people‚Äôs communication styles doesn‚Äôt make you smart or special.

(I‚Äôm out at this point. I feel I‚Äôve addressed my point and the importance of extending a little tolerance and grace to others, and I‚Äôm off to go get in the sea. I won‚Äôt reply further.)",0,"2024-05-22T17:50:37.280166Z","2022-02-26 00:45:56","[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":4}]",11,"[{""rating"":6}]",39088676434,"[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":5}]","[{""rating"":3}]",185.013,1754258539,"[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":3}]",39084282442,"[{""rating"":4}]","https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t0fujv/_/hygdzrm/",3,"aita_10-19","AmItheAsshole",4922054,"2024-05-23T08:17:55.652633Z"

In the U.S. generally, almost 8% of all bridges are structurally deficient and, more alarming, about ONE THIRD of bridges need repair or replacement, including one third of interstate bridges. If that doesn‚Äôt sound like a crisis, consider this: to fix only those bridges that are structurally deficient (ignoring the other repair/replace, at great risk), it would take almost 70 years and 54 billion dollars. Of course, in that time, imagine how many will be further damaged. (See the following, though many sources exist: https://artbabridgereport.org/)

We have an infrastructure CRISIS. It isn‚Äôt politically sexy and the problems are mostly invisible (for now). Add in the cost and labor, and it is easy to see why those in charge turn a blind eye. It is almost guaranteed that there will be catastrophic failure of multiple bridges before anyone is motivated to act.

Your hope and purpose doesn't need to be grounded in reality. 

Consider two patients facing cancer. One has hope that God will heal him. One doesn't believe in God. God doesn't exist. Does that mean that the person who believes in God doesn't have hope any more? No, because that person believes in God. Belief in God is enough to provide hope; the actual presence and action of God is not necessary.

Honestly, were I an all-knowing, all-seeing deity who wants a creation with free will, I would make sure that the creation benefits from belief in God without needing physical proof. In this interesting scenario, the deity would indeed have no need to prove himself via miracles beyond the initial development of the faith. I'm not saying that this is what is happening, but the Bible makes it clear that free will is a priority in creation.

While the academic definition certainly distinguishes the institutionalised oppression of class, that's not the colloquial usage. When most people talk about having experienced ""racism"", I think what they're referring to is predominantly what you seem to define as specifically simply ""prejudice"". If you think of it like a venn diagram, this overlap between the academic and colloquial definitions just leads to ambiguity in meaning, which I think hurts the conversation and doesn't provide a productive solution, and if anything gives ammunition to those who hold prejudicial views because it just makes it feel like the game is rigged even from the perspective of the language being used- bigotry and hate thrive in ignorance and fear of the unknown, so dissolving the foundation of even common language hurts efforts to expand narrowminded people's horizons. I think the function of language should be clarity, and making an effort to specifically and distinctively separate the concepts of the common experience of encountering ""a racist"" and therefore ""encountering racism"" versus the more abstract experience of being victim of institutionalised racial prejudice and therefore ""being racially oppressed"" is a worthwhile endeavour. As such I would say that a white person even in contemporary America can in fact encounter ""racism"" just as anyone can, but absolutely are not in a position as the majority power to be victim of institutionalised oppression.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a question, let's say you have two theoretical humans.  One has free will and the other doesn't.  Let's not worry about how one can or can't have free will.  Let's just assume that this is the case.  Your job is to test which one has free will and which doesn't.  How would you test this?  When I think of not having free will, I think of someone who acts logically and not based on impulse.  They don't run into walls because it is illogical.  So if someone does run into a wall intentionally, they probably have free will because it makes no sense to run into a wall.  So to me, seeing the ability to act intentionally illogically would seem to suggest free will.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I've taken away from the other commenters the most in this debate so far is that their reasons for believing there is no free will can often be turned around as proof of free will.  For example, you say that a person being pressured by an outside force can be made to take certain actions.  This is because a person needs to be able to evaluate a large number of things and then apply all of those to make a decision.  This makes sense for a person who can actually make a choice.  If they are under duress or at least feel like they are, they may bow to the person or thing putting them in that position.  But if they have no free will then I'd reason that it makes less sense for them to give in because why would their actions be based on abstract things such as duress?  They would be able to make actions without needing to evaluate such trivial things and do things more coldly and logically.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe we are also using different criteria to determine what is free will.  You are quite concerned with outside forces affecting our decisions.  This draws me back to the question about the wall.  I don't feel like walking around the wall instead of attempting to walk through it has any indication as to whether I can make a choice or not.  Why should it?  I evaluated the situation and make a decision.  If I choose to eat only after first being influenced by the smell of food, I don't see that as evidence against free will either.  I again evaluated a situation and made a decision.  Clearly there are always going to be outside forces involved in decision making.  Heck, just the ability to breathe affects every decision you make.  If you can't breathe you certainly will make different decisions than if you can breathe.",0,"2024-05-23T07:33:48.630901Z","2019-10-10 11:15:30","[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":3}]",4,"[{""rating"":5}]",32843453034,"[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":1}]",60.772,812447761,"[{""rating"":1}]","[{""rating"":4}]",32841824968,"[{""rating"":1}]","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dfpkpd/_/f3656ju/",2,"data_driven_civil_discourse_subset_4-9","changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-23T07:33:48.630914Z"
