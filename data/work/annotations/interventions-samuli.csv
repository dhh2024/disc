Oh, I thought you were the ones making the ridiculous argument that what ""holiday"" means is that every one should stay home for a day! Isn't htis what you are saying? Let me quote myself from another message above:

""It is obvious to everyone that there are essential workers that must work also on holidays, whether it's Independence Day, Christmas or what have you. OP's point is clearly not about those people, why do you keep asking about them? Talk about bad faith.""

&gt;You're only thinking of the things you directly interact with on a daily basis. I've worked through countless holidays over the years for absolutely essential reasons.

Yeah, that's what I said, see above. It is **obvious**, that there will be essential workers, which is how they are called, that must work during holidays,. This is true for every holiday, not just the proposed Voting Day. So you may now stop arguing this point.

The point is about everyone that is not an essential worker, you know, the majority of us. People that during a national holiday actually don't have to work. What is your argument for not making it easier for those people to vote?

&gt;As many people have discussed in this very chain, mandating early voting in all states would essentially accomplish this and more. Allowing people to vote when they want over a period of time would allow them to vote on their day off

Everyone also agrees, I hope, that early voting is a good thing, so again, what point are you addressing? The point is that, in the United States there is an official day for voting. And the point is that as of 2020, most people exercise their most basic democratic right on Election Day. Let me put it in a different way: what is there to lose by making Election Day a holiday?

509,"5","throwawayforthebois0","","So here’s the question I pose to all pro-restriction people:

No one is arguing it’s not a life. The cells you cough, sneeze, eat, snort and shit are all alive.

At what point is a zygote morally considerable as a fully functioning human equivalent to a born child?

Now here’s the secret to this question.

- if they say conception, as in when sperm meets egg, they’re saying a very early stage zygote is the same as a baby. This means all birth control that prevents implantation of this ovum is murder...which is a very extreme position.

- if it’s a point of development, at what point does the zygote become a morally considerable being equivalent to a baby? Pinpoint the exact stage. Is this stage before or after pregnancy is detectable? 

- Many anti-choice people point to a heartbeat as the marker when this group of cells driven by a Hox gene is a morally considerable being. Why the heart? Why not the brain? Why does a functioning vascular system matter...many teratomas and tumors have vascular systems.

The end stage of this argument is that no, a zygote dependent on the mother for all resources is not the same as a fully functioning baby able to survive outside the womb.

We pro-choicers need to modify our arguments and argue on an entirely scientific viewpoint. We need to stop arguing that it isn’t a life. It IS. But is it a morally considerable life?

Keep the sabbath day is a Commandment, where as in Romans, Paul is just telling them to stop arguing about simple things like ‘what day they prefer’ it had nothing to do with the commandments.

Both those verses have footnote for earth that link to the various verses about what happens to earth at the second coming. The earth is going to be destroyed, but not the whole thing, instead it will become the second of the three kingdoms. So the earth will burn and be wiped, but the physical globe will remain to be transformed.

Jacob saying he saw god, but John saying that’s not possible. In John, there is a footnote for ‘man’ which specifies that it means man in the flesh. Normal, imperfect beings can’t see god, they have to be transfigured, like Jacob was.

I don’t see the inconsistency exactly. If god knew that his daughter was gonna meet him, then obviously that was intentional. God didn’t make a mistake.

“Eye for an eye” is what the law of Moses said, the Ten Commandments replaces that, which Jesus is explaining.

Same thing with the circumcision

Just because all things are possible doesn’t just mean god will do anything just because. The verse in judges was just saying “by the way, god is still with Judah” it’s not stating that means he’s gonna win for sure.

And, as I have stated, I disagreed with them and required justification.  

Popular sovereignty alone is not a justification, as we DO set up limits on that very practice if we so choose.  Just because the 5th Amendment allows it now, does not mean that we should keep it so.  We set up limits to areas where the government would have too much power over the citizens, and affirm them again and again. 

The same theory I am speaking of, of course, could also apply to the repeal of rights.  For example: as we could disallow the Death Penalty via Amendment, we could do the same with Speech via Amendment.

Therefore, I hold that the fact that a law can or could exist does not justify its value.  The processes it enshrines, the purpose it holds, and the effects it has are the only thing worth arguing.

You understand this. Stop fighting me about it. 

&gt;""he"" as gender neutral is not inclusive at all.

Yes it is. It's inclusive by definition.

Except nothing I've said is wrong, I'm not zigzagging between anything.

Very many people believe that the usage of ""he"" as a gender neutral pronoun is not inclusive and is in fact harmful and wish this grammatical convention to be changed.

My point was that just because modern grammatical conventions define it to be correct usage as gender neutral does not mean that it is actually inclusive when used that way. 

You keep throwing up strawmen and hiding behind the fact that in the most technical sense it is defined as gender neutral by grammatical conventions without addressing the fact that its usage as such is not inclusive at all and is actually rather divisive as shown by studies and research.",0,"2024-05-20T10:10:26.638477Z","2014-11-12T15:59:01Z","","Disregard",6.06,157769592.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2lxjso/_/cm0fq85/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T10:10:26.638489Z"

Even if you take Trump at his word that ""war and aggression will not be my first instinct"", many of Trump's positions would radically de-stabilize the world and make war far more likely, and that's taking into account the limitations of the presidency (which I'll get to later):

1) Abandoning NATO: even the suggestion that the U.S. won't defend its NATO allies is a direct invitation for Putin to invade countries like Ukraine, Estonia, and Latvia.

2) Abandoning human rights: he wants to bring back torture ""worse than waterboarding"", re-negotiate the Geneva convention to allow bombing innocent relatives of terrorists, and he thinks the United States should stop arguing in favor of human and civil rights around the world, because of ""how bad the United States is"" as a messenger.

3) Nuclear weapons: Trump is gung-ho on nukes. He wants to renew our nuclear weapons stockpile, explore the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons, encourage our allies to build their own nuclear weapons, and scrap the Iran deal that stops them from building nuclear weapons.

&gt; there are too many checks and balances

It may seem that way after 10 years of divided rule, but remember that if Trump becomes president he'll likely have both houses of Congress, and the Senate filibuster is already on its last legs. And the Republican party has become increasingly subservient to the most radical constituents of its base. After the Tea Party movement, Republicans in congress realized that they had gerrymandered themselves into districts in which they were extremely vulnerable to organized conservative groups in the primary, even though they had nothing to fear in their general election. If Trump were to win, Republicans in congress would be deathly afraid of pissing off their base by stepping on his toes.

&gt;That said, Obama is the worst deporter in history. he has deported more people than all the other presidents combined (not a joke)

[Factually incorrect.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/16/the-numbers-ted-cruz-cited-on-past-deportations-during-the-cnn-debate-were-way-off/) Obama has kept the number of ""removals"" (typically people picked up near the border) roughly the same as Bush at ~400k/year, and ""returns"" (typically people picked up by police somewhere else in the country) have fallen from ~800k/year to ~200k/year. Obama has shifted deportation priorities to focus on border security and deporting criminals, and the overall number of immigrants being sent home is down roughly 50% from Bush.

977,"5","BolshevikMuppet","","&gt;And given that the ratio of almost definitely true to almost definitely false is pretty high, there is a high likelihood that the maybe cases are true, too.

That's not a given. That's definitely not a given. So let's lay down our numbers.

Rate of conviction for false accusation (cases where we can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the accusation was false): ~5%. Rate of conviction for rape (cases where we can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the accusation true): ~7%. That's not even a statistically significant difference.

So on what basis are you concluding that the ratio of definitely true to definitely false swings so strongly toward true? *Other* than the argument (which I hope by now you can see the limitations of) that if only X% can be demonstrated as false, the percent of true accusations is 100-X. Which in this case is circular logic.

&gt;I was merely making the point that your statement sounded like you were saying that it is automatically true that more cases are false than the ones we have sufficient evidence to believe are false. Which is not necessarily true, because we don't have sufficient evidence to believe their falsehood. 

Well, first, why would the default be ""we believe it to be true unless we have evidence of falsehood""? That's a reversal of both the legal burden of proof and the logical one.

Second, your argument assumes that there are more cases which are true than which we have evidence to prove are true. Why is my assumption more objectionable?

&gt;My point was that it seems reasonably fair to say that the statistic reached by the FBIs protocol of ""approximately 90-95% of allegations are true"" is more accurate than the statistic reached by examining court cases which results in the assessment that ""approximately 5-10% of allegations are true

I wi endeavor not to misstate your position, please do not misstate what the FBI reported. They did **not** report that 90% of accusations are **true**, they reported that 8% are provably false. Those are not the same thing, as is easily demonstrated by your rejection of the argument that because only 5% of accusations are provably true 95% are false.

""Not proven false"" =|= ""true"", and ""not proved true"" =|= ""false.""

If you object to the idea that 95% of accusations are false because only 5% are proved true, stop arguing that 92% of accusations are true because only 8% are proved false.

&gt;Neither is perfect methodologically, but one is more reflective of reality

Based on what data? If your argument is that your viewpoint is based on reality, you need to start from first principles, not skip to ""obviously most accusations are true so the methodology which says the rate of false accusations are low is more accurate.""

&gt;the understanding that the statistics show it's likely true

Except they don't. And that's the point.

They show that accusations are likely true if and only if you treat all cases not proved false as being true. And that argument is wrong, for the same reason it'd be silly to take all accusations not proved true as false accusations.

One simple question, and you can ignore everything else: ignoring your preconceptions about how common or rare false accusations are, why is it more reasonable to treat all accusations not proven false as being true than it is to treat all accusations not proven true as being false?",0,"2024-05-20T10:18:32.676926Z","2015-04-07T20:02:14Z","","No",71.817,184165328.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/31navk/_/cq4hkw1/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T10:18:32.676938Z"

'No you' isn't an argument. 

Capitalism kills 20 million people every single year. 

Everyone has rights, not just us citizens. Crossing the border without authorization is not a felony. It's a misdemeanor. No greater than jaywalking. 

Are you seriously suggesting that Russia ending the third Reich after being invaded by the Nazis was an invasion? Holy fuck. Hooooleeeyyy fuck. Man are you sure you're not friends with Nazis or something?

I see your attempted propaganda referring to Nazis as national socialists while knowing fully damn well they aren't socialist. It's transparent. Consider it called out. 

Britain, France, American colonists, and the American government. One could argue the genocide of native Americans is still on going, but the war officially ended (on our terms) in 1924. So yeah, Americans. Andrew Jackson ring any bells? Trail of Tears? How about General Custer? No?

Britain is not socialist oh my fucking bologna sandwich I cannot imagine you just said that. They are the global capital of liberal democratic capitalism. I'm blown away right now that you consider Britain to be a socialist economy.

Fascism does not mean 'jailing a man for a joke.' please Google the term. It's a political system, not an individual policy position. Stop arguing in bad faith.

NK is in poverty because in the 1950s the US invaded, destroyed all the infrastructure, slaughtered millions of civilians, and then convinced the world to heavily sanction the country locking it away from the world and from aid to rebuild from Ash.

If your argument is that the concentration camp photos are staged you should confess your sins to your god. That's completely repugnant. 

Concentration camps most certainly had guards cheif. And they certainly had billiard tables in certain areas, for guards, that could be used for propaganda. Regardless being unjustly and undully detained without warrant for an indefinite period without due process of law and sleeping on a pad on a concrete floor behind 10 foot security fencing with barbed wire in a windowless room with only a mylar sheet to keep you warm is not made better by fucking billiards you sick bastard. 

The border guards have actually assassinated several would be migrants. Yes Stalin's gulags were wrong. So are our concentration camps.

Hahaha your sole argument is ""communism kills"" and you're claiming that you don't see the world in black and white terms. How rich!

Again, you are wrong and I keep having to correct you like a broken record.

Exactly.  There is a lesson there.  ""You cannot reason people out of something they were not reasoned into"" - Jonathan Swift.

&gt; how Trump publicly lies and nobody cares about it

Every politician does that and does that a LOT.  Maybe not as much as Trump, but it is only a difference in degree if anything.

The thing is you've just lumped all the Trump supporters in with the facebook crazies and internet trolls.  There are a LOT of reasonable Trump voters out there, you just don't see them going off on rants on Facebook, because that isn't an activity that reasonable people waste their time doing.

&gt; Troll all the dummies on the internet so they get mad, mess with them whenever possible.

... And you think that'll help somehow?  That is neither going to persuade the trolls themselves or the other people watching your conversation.  You can not change other people's minds for them.  Accept that.  Have reasonable conversations with reasonable people that are open to having that conversation, but you can't force that on people. Another helpful quote:

&gt; Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

&gt; courage to change the things I can,

&gt; and wisdom to know the difference.

Other people's minds is one of those things that you can not change, especially when they're not open to having their mind changed, and doubly so when you're an anonymous user on the internet that they don't have a prior connection with.

Go do some research on what works to persuade people and you'll find you're doing the literal exact opposite of everything they say to do.

Honestly (and I promise I'm not trying to wind you up) this statement demonstrates your lack of experience/maturity. Political thinking greatly benefits from experience and observation and most people's political views *do* change over time as the mature. 

For example you are 17. You (most likely) do not have to support yourself, work full time, invest for your retirement, raise children, or many of the other entirely normal things people will do in their lifetime. Actually experiencing those responsibilities first hand is going to greatly impact your political outlook.

Possibly. It may also mean that they are unable to convey to you what it's like to face certain situations because you are so far removed from them.

With regards to religion you're approaching an irrational topic rationally   which may very well be what your father is referring to. I don't know your dad but it's entirely possible that he doesn't *care* that there's no evidence for God but he enjoys the peace it brings him to believe there is order in the universe and (probably more importantly given your heritage) the kinship it brings him with the Jewish community.

Racism, faith, xenophobia - as a combo is a massive threat to us. What do we do with threats? We remove them. But we can't, cause I'm not suggesting we MURDER. So we simply remove their right to make decisions for the general public. Far-right mentality is a cancer that needs to be cut out from the world. This way we can stop arguing if fantasy magic men in the sky created the Earth. Women can choose how to use their bodies. There won't be genocides and war over whose idea of god is correct. I know we all know exactly what Im talking about. I can argue and explain and break it down into semantics forever and neither of us will ""win.""

.... I'm going to edit this final bit into my original post.

The best argument to change my VIEW - is to remind me that those with Far-Right views are indoctrinated, mentally ill, lack education, or have been abused. And can I really hold that against them for having so much hate and ignorance due to external circumstances? Note that I'm not talking about ""the GOP"" or Conservatives. Because many of those people are sane. They have financial or libertarian viewpoints. I'm talking about the ones who choose fiction over reality. Fear and hate over equality and understanding. Self interest over the needs of the global community. Racists. Evangelicals. Conspiracy theorists. They can have those views.

""Impossible to prove""? ""clear-cut bridge""? Hence, your rigorous truth seeking brain prefers ""it must've come from a holy insanely intelligent source"" theories and you find them to be more persuasive than evolution?

I have to ask you to truthfully answer this question. What kind of information would you exactly need to convince yourself that Intelligent Design is false? What are its falsifiable assertions?

1010,"5","Apprehensive_Ruin208","","Your source is more trying to justify and sell the idea than really scientifically speaking to the issues we're discussing. That's a surgeon's opinion, not an expert in immunology, so you mislead with your introduction to the source.

First issue, when the comparing the 100% antibody formation from the vaccine, to the natural immunity group, they qualify one group, but not the other. So we're those 30+% in the natural immunity group immunocompromised? (Wouldn't be surprising since immunocompromised often represent a larger portion of infected) The qualifier excluded from the vaccine group? Also, later in the article, they said that's the first thing to wane in the body, so how long after infection were they testing? Because that 30% could also be in that phase of immunity where they rely on tcells not antibodies. Way too easy to see an explanation for where the supposed disparity is actually accounted for in other ways and potentially even expected.

Second, that source agrees that natural immunity gives a higher number of antibodies than the vaccine-which was the whole definition of better I was working off of. The body does a better job. So even there you can see the benchmark the vaccine is compared to is natural immunity, something you seem to be denying quite consistently.

Your description of the vaccine process was condescending and didn't disprove anything I said. Sure they hypothesize protein x will accomplish the goal. So how do they test the hypothesis? They trigger the immune system with that strand of mRNA and compare it to what? Natural immunity response. Even if you won't acknowledge it here, please just stop arguing against the idea that natural immunity is the benchmark immunologists compare vaccines to. Your source said it. It's the only logical goal post. And it is literally the foundation of developing a vaccine.

Time since infection is the only valid argument for requiring previously infected to get the vaccine and the issue there is Delta is showing that the vaccine is NOT lasting longer than natural immunity and it's showing how little we still understand this virus. The vaccine is dampening symptoms, absolutely, which is great, but it's not the silver bullet compared to natural immunity that the article you sent insinuated, which supports the idea that the stats they were comparing were coming from different times in the immune cycle.",0,"2024-05-20T10:43:33.117311Z","2021-10-05T14:09:20Z","","No",69.593,1574712122.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q1jjne/_/hfhbde0/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T10:43:33.117322Z"

But the outcome is the same.

The fetus dies because the mother wants to deny it access to her blood/body.

The fetus/baby finds itself in a situation where it needs something from the mother's body to survive.

The mother says no.

The fetus/baby dies.

If the outcomes are roughly same then the analogy holds.

1015,"5","laconicflow",27207087.0,"I didn't disagree with myself. I generally disagree with premise three. What I said is that men and women who get parts amputated are still men and women. This doesn't mean that I except your premise that there are no physical or biological or objectively measurable traits that define man or woman.

I mean, I'm going to oversimplify, if you don't mind, because I don't want to write pages.

But, in all human societies, the population is generally heterosexual, and 'men' and 'women' fuck, and have children, that's how the species continues. In all societies, there are also homosexuals who are attracted to the same sex. And there are also sexual deviants, or outliers. I don't mean this in a disrespectful way, I mean that in addition to hetero and homosexuals, we always find some number of rarities  as concerns who they sleep with and how they express their sex. I'm trying hard not to use the word gender here, because I don't know what it encompasses, because I don't know how much of being a man or a woman is socially constructed.  To broaden that, I don't know how much of being human is socially constructed.

Now, what it seems to me you're doing is that you've decided on some new definitions of men and women to spare the feelings of the rarities. Sure, you're just like us, join the club, hop on board. You're absolutely a man, live your truth, yada, yada, yada.


You seem to think I'm uncomfortable with Transgender people as people. I'm not. If you think you're the sex you aren't, and you go through a full transition, sex organs replaced with an approximation of the other ones, hormone replacement, and all the other things, I mean, what do I care. Clearly you felt pretty bad in the body you had, to go through all that trouble. Hope you feel much better post transition, and if anyone bullies you in the street for being different, that person is a jerk. 

But this just doesn't have anything to do with the definitions of things I feel to be objective. And I think man and woman are *probably objective terms, that refer to men and women as people with my commonly held view understood those terms 15 years ago.

Like, give me two new words to describe Transmen and Transwomen, and I'd be done with those conversation.  I'd use the words, and live in a four-gendered world.

But you can't do that, because there's some ideology behind your argument. You'e sort of trying to pretend like the terms men and women are throw-away, inconsequencial ones. But obviously they aren't. If I tell some trans woman, ""you aren't a woman, you're something else,"" she may be pissed.

Yet, at the same time, I've seen ""hey, you look like a trans woman,"" used as an insult towards actual women, and those women were very, very angry, because I think they thought they were being called manly looking, or mannish.

Like, if you think this is a settled issue, you can stop arguing with me. I'll die on the wrong side of history, shame for me, and that'll be that.

Look how weird this argument is. I'm not calling trans people subhuman, I'm not saying they aren't worthy of respect and dignity, in the United States they deserve equal protection under the law. People shouldn't be mean to them. I'll even use the form of adress they would prefer, hell, if I do it for priests, who I don't believe either, I can do it for Trans people.

But you'll argue and argue with me, because you want me to believe trans men are men and trans women are women because you've just decided there's no objective way of telling the two sexes apart . 

And then you'll say, not the two sexes, but the two genders.

He couldn't do them. Any of them. He didn't understand what ""1/2"" meant. He couldn't convert it to a decimal. I had kids in *second grade* who were ahead of him in math. We had to start back at elementary school math.

My whole life has been one of self-identifying out of being a 'man' from a very young age I never wanted any of the things pushed on me and certainly none of the benefits. I have always valued equality and equity even though I had very little concept for what those terms were, I understood unfairness when I saw what women had to struggle against.

I identified with them. I didn't want whatever society was offering me this 'cheat code' to getting things easier. I wanted to be worth it on my own merit and I resented the fact that if I just used a deep voice and talked confidently most of the time people would just stand aside and stop arguing or let me have whatever I wanted.

I actively fought that, so much so that I made my life immensely difficult because I wanted to succeed in life because objectively I knew I had done the 'right' thing by everyone. I didn't have the benefit of looks, or my male privilege because I actively denied it. I actively fought having it, because I felt it was wrong and unfair for myself to use that.

I think the honest truth why a lot of trans women focus on the outward facing appearances and superficial things about ourselves online is because we know that's what people notice.

A lot of us have resented our bodies for most of our lives and so now actually being able to more able to identify with it even just a little is a big win... I know for me what has mattered most is having my hair come back, my face soften and body odor be less annoying. My brain works better now finally, and I don't suffer from severe and crippling anxiety and depression.

Those are life changing things for me... but they also don't really get noticed nearly as much or talked about.

As for genitals, I mean, I fucking hate having the ones I was born with and it'd be nice to have surgery someday but I don't obsess over it since there isn't a lot I can do for now. It's just nice that my libido is now under control with hormone therapy because before it was absolutely awful to deal with and incredibly frustrating to be fighting one's own body.

Selective usage is good when it drives a point home, or when a specific statement embodies the crux of the argument you want to counter.  However, blanket usage of each and every statement is just exhaustive.  It adds literally zero to a conversation.  Plus, it intentionally dissembles the conversation by taking one talking point and turning them into dozens.  

From there, you just hope that a person gets lost or spends too much time combating a dozen different mini arguments rather than the actual point being made, with the belief that the loss of a specific point out of dozens invalidates an entire argument.

The proper name for what you are referring to is the Marginal Theory of Value - there is nothing particularly capitalist about it. But yes I agree, and we are actually using the same definition of value. As you correctly say, valuations are reflected in a willingness to pay.

I never claimed it was the official name. Skip your pathetic tangent.

&gt;The second statement is taken from a previous comment. My point is that if you consider the supply side in conjunction with the demand side it is perfectly possible for something that is highly ""valued"" (say teaching) to receive low pay. Willingess to pay is not the sole determinant of pay because the supply of teachers is important too. So, as I said before, it is perfectly possible for teachers to be more valued than CEOs yet for teachers to be paid far less.

No, just no. Society is completely unwilling to pay teachers the rate of CEOs. Yes their supply depresses their wages somewhat, but their lower amount of individual value is their primary reason for lower wages.

&gt;This relates to the diamonds/water question. ""Why are diamonds so expensive when water is so cheap, even though one does nothing and the other is essential for life?"" Although a persons valuation or willingness to pay for water may be very high, it is in such abundance that the price is very low. Conversely, diamonds, although they're quite pretty, sell for much more because of the constrained supply.

Yawn...do I really need to bother to answer this. The individual water unit is worth less than the individual diamond unit. The total amount of water is worth more than the total amount of diamonds. Please stop arguing past my point.

&gt;I hope this clears things up, and try to be a little less aggressive in the tone of your answer next time - it doesn't help you to make your point clearly.

I hope you will read people's arguments and address them. Not listening, arguing past someone, then trying to pretend like the person is an idiot and give them an economics lecture doesn't help your argument.

My point is this. I'm willing to pay more for a CEO than for an individual teacher. That by definition means that I value his services more than the teachers. If teachers are, as individuals, worth more then people should pay them there fair wage.  But don't bitch to me about my evaluations of my CEO. If John Smith can convince Starbucks that he is worth a million a year to them then good for him. If he can only convince a school to pay him 40 grand then I say tough luck.

It's good to learn. Messy definitions make for messy thinking.

&gt;Society is completely unwilling to pay teachers the rate of CEOs.

I agree. Demand is much higher for CEOs, but let me put it this way: if there were as many good potential CEOs as there are teachers, would CEOs be paid as much? No. Clearly no. If anyone could be a good CEO the pay would fall as people undercut other people. This is why supply matters as well as demand. 

&gt;Yawn...do I really need to bother to answer this. The individual water unit is worth less than the individual diamond unit. The total amount of water is worth more than the total amount of diamonds. Please stop arguing past my point.

This is not the answer. Nor does it make sense. If you are starving in a desert, do you value the individual drop water or the individual diamond? Evidently the water - even though diamonds are more expensive. This is the paradox. It isn't arguing past your point because it is an analogy of the CEO/teacher question. Feel free to read up on [marginalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value) which is THE accepted theory of value in the study of Economics. 

&gt;I hope you will read people's arguments and address them. Not listening, arguing past someone, then trying to pretend like the person is an idiot and give them an economics lecture doesn't help your argument.

I have read what you've put and I have also tried to be polite, honestly. However when someone is wrong, as I assure you that you are, I think it is ok to correct them. Especially as you are trying to give someone else a lecture. In short, you are very much in need of an economics lecture.

&gt;My point is this. I'm willing to pay more for a CEO than for an individual teacher. That by definition means that I value his services more than the teachers. If teachers are, as individuals, worth more then people should pay them there fair wage. But don't bitch to me about my evaluations of my CEO. If John Smith can convince Starbucks that he is worth a million a year to them then good for him. If he can only convince a school to pay him 40 grand then I say tough luck. But if you feel he is more valuable, then feel free to pay him more to teach.

As I have said again and again, your willingness to pay reflects your valuation. Society can value CEOs and teachers however they like. However we should not expect for valuations to SOLELY determine prices or wages. This is because valuation or willingness to pay focuses only on demand. If we value water very highly and diamonds very lowly, why do diamonds cost so much more than water? It is because supply also has a role to play. If willingness to pay were all that mattered, diamonds would be very cheap, and water would cost loads! Clearly, supply has a huge role to play, which your analysis ignores. Yes, willingness to pay matters, but so does supply.

So why are CEOs paid more than Teachers? Well, as you say, there is certainly more demand (higher willingness to pay) for them because they can generate much larger profits, but it is also because there is far less of a supply of CEOs because CEOs need to be extremely skilled, educated, experienced, and dedicated.

1030,"5","Homericus","","&gt;Agreed. But until observation refutes an axiom or postulate from pure reason, we don't doubt it, right? We wouldn't have needed to doubt the axioms of logic before quantum physics came around. Likewise, until some observation refutes our moral intuitions (and it's not clear what could) we don't need to doubt them, right?

Correct, but none of this makes them objectively true.

&gt;Note this: you don't believe that logic works because somebody formally proved it to you one day. You believe it because you know it must be objectively true.

This is where you are wrong, I believe logic works because logic ""works"". (Not trying for a tautology here). What I mean is that logic is similar to science where it can be used to predict future occurrences. If I use logic I can predict future events based on prior observations. As long as my logic sound, and my premises are accurate, my conclusion will also be accurate. 

The problem is if my premises are accurate or not. The logic premise that something can't be both true and false is actually wrong *sometimes*, like when talking about cats in boxes. I don't know logic ""must be objectively true"" and I'm not convinced that it is. I think logic is useful, I'm not sure it is objectively true.

&gt;We know that morality is objective in just the same way. 

And what I'm saying is that although I use morality in a generally objective sense in the same way I use logic as if it is generally true, *I don't actually think those things to be true*. If you and I argue about morality, there is much we can agree on because we hold the same premises, but if I meet someone who holds premises that differ from mine *I cannot prove to them that their premises are incorrect*. This is why, unfortunately, morality is subjective. Without an agreement about assumptions, one person cannot prove to another that their morality is objectively true.

&gt;Why do I need to justify this assumption if we don't have to justify the assumption that senses rely information reliably sometimes?

This actually feeds perfectly into your last statement, and is much the same issue. If we have differing assumptions about whether or not our senses sometimes relay correct information, I **can't** justify my assumption in a way to convince. 

Now what I can do is try to demonstrate that you already make this assumption and that it is inherent in the assumption you follow it up with (that morality is objective). If our senses are not right at least some of the time, then morality HAS TO BE subjective and relative, since ALL observations are subjective and relative ONLY. Also, then you are a solipsist, and this figment of your imagination would stop arguing with you because I have a rule I don't argue with solipsists. 

Essentially, it makes sense for me to ask you to justify your additional assumption without needing to justify my assumption, when your assumption already includes my assumption within it and only expands upon it.",0,"2024-05-20T11:02:23.678062Z","2013-06-13T19:40:07Z","","No",564.141,87563988.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g4st0/_/caiarj1/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:02:23.678075Z"

1035,"5","drawing_goblin","","Yeah. This.

I fully appreciate a good discussion, and value alternative perspectives. I also agree that using an appeal to authority is not a logically convincing argument.

It is also, I think, a personal failing if I can't combine a logically sound, evidence based argument into a legible post or discussion.  There are times, occasionally, where I have got the stage where the effort it would require to inform the other person enough (particularly if they hold entrenched, unscientific or worse pseudoscientific beliefs) of why I hold the belief I do is too much. In that case the argument becomes either the other party can have faith that I am genuinely representing my expertise, or they can stop arguing with me and we will continue to hold divergent views.

This is very pronounced in areas where professionals give advice to nonprofessionals. A doctor may not be able to explain why an Ace inhibitor is better than a beta blocker for a patients blood pressure on an absolute physical level, with receptor kinetics and elimination rates etc because they are following an expert guideline, which references 400 papers, and is only one of 500 guidelines they keep mentally available at all times.


Oh and in particular with respect to experience of racial bias: I would contend that it is reasonable to favour direct reporting of this over indirect. A white person cannot have the experiences of a black person, and if that is what we want to understand then, by nature of their race, black people should have a voice, and all people should listen. This is particularly the case when, for example, black people have been marginalised historically, and where autonomy and decision making have been denied, or cooped by white people.  

This is the case when we are not looking for a point to be proved, but rather to understand an experience. I would also argue that the binary view that an argument has to be proved or disproved can disadvantage further those without a voice. This is common in discussions about race, where racists collect empirical data from sources which have a gross implicit or explicit bias and formulate an argument around these. It may be harder for someone to then argue with this point. A good example is racial differences in IQ: a favourite of racists.  On its face you have an objective measure of intelligence and different scores by race. But delve into it and you'll see IQ is a poorly validated metric of some broad aspects of cognitive ability created by racist white people, administered unevenly and relatively unchallenged until recently because it fit the racial narrative that was pervasive at the time.",0,"2024-05-20T11:03:54.068673Z","2021-02-15T16:11:26Z","","No",38.688,1304145308.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lkgcyk/_/gnjn67t/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:03:54.068686Z"
1036,"5","Electrivire",26328836.0,"&gt;No, the point is that it comes from somewhere. It is not unlimited. If you want to spend money to help the upper and middle classes, you need to make an argument as to why we should spend our money doing that. 

I stick by my saying the point is that they find the money. And we don't have to make the argument in this case as it's already been made. The government needs to make student to forgiveness happen. It's just a matter of the approach.

&gt;I’m not saying taxes would necessarily increase

Good. That's a start. But I'm simply saying there are a myriad of ways the money can be raised or pulled. 

&gt;and since taxpayers fund 100% of the government budget, it comes from taxpayers. 

That's not true. There are other avenues money can be obtained. Deficit spending, relocating from other programs, creating new ones that raise money etc. 

And again this point is moot in regards to SDF. It doesn't cost money to do this. It costs money to fund other entirely separate programs. So focus on that as a separate yet also important issue.

&gt;This is completely outside the scope of if SLF is a good idea. 

My only concern is how we get it done. I don't see any possible argument against SLF and thus don't see it up for debate. 

&gt;Right. so why is it a good idea to put money into SLF

I can only repeat so many times. No money is being ""put into"" this at all. It's debt forgiveness. It doesn't cost money on its own. 

&gt;I don’t see why it’s good policy.

I don't see how it wouldn't be good. People are in debt that they shouldn't be and it's the government's responsibility to right the wrong they allowed in the first place. It's good because it frees up people to use their money for other bills or stimulate the economy in a time where that will be more important than ever.

&gt;&gt; This is a larger issue that I don't see contributing to this discussion.

&gt;Then why did you make the suggestion?

I didn't. It was an aside.

&gt;Why would I pay it off when ya’ll are advocating I should get free money? I’m against bad policies, but I’m not stupid. 

I mean this was only being proposed and talked about in the past few years on any significant level. Honestly, really only the past year if you want to be technical. I'm asking why you (in the general sense or the individual) wouldn't pay your loan debt off if you make 6 figures or more. 

&gt;I still don’t see any actual arguments from you as to why giving me taxpayer money is a good idea. 

I'm not proposing we give anyone money here. This isn't about the stimulus. It's about debt forgiveness. You aren't getting money. And again there is no reason to involve taxpayers in the discussion at all.

&gt;How does SLF help the poor?

People making less than $100,000 a year are possibly struggling to pay bills depending on where they live and a variety of other circumstances like business expenses or healthcare-related bills. 

I have 10s of thousands of dollars in debt and haven't had anything more than a min wage job to work towards paying it off. It's astonishing that people think forgiving these loans somehow doesn't help people who NEED the relief. 

&gt;My point is that it helps the middle class and rich at the expense of the poor

And that is false. The rich largely don't have loans in the first place let alone debt leftover. The poor have no choice but to take out loans and typically no means to pay them off. And the ""middle class"" are forced to take loans with only some of them being able to make payments on them. 

This also has NO adverse effects on ""the poor"". 

&gt;The poor pay taxes too and you are saying we should use their tax money to pay for the loans that the middle and upper class took out. 

I'm saying no such thing and you know that.

&gt;Again, I agree that it’s the governments responsibility.

Then stop arguing lol. The government can take responsibility by forgiving the debt. End of story.

They physically can get the money. The question is if they _should_. If we use the money for student loan forgiveness, then we have to take it out of something else. 

&gt; And we don't have to make the argument in this case as it's already been made. The government needs to make student to forgiveness happen. It's just a matter of the approach.

That’s not even an _attempt_ at an argument this time. You’re literally saying you don’t need an argument to get policy passed? Do we somehow live in Electrivire’s Dictatorship? Lol. In reality, this is a democractic republic and you need to convince lawmakers this is a good idea or convince other people it’s a good idea and they should vote for lawmakers who agree. 

&gt; Good. That's a start. 

No it’s not a start cause now I’m realizing you just don’t understand what I mean when I say taxpayers will pay for it. 

&gt; But I'm simply saying there are a myriad of ways the money can be raised or pulled.

Yes again. It’s _possible_ to find taxpayer money to pay for this. The question is if it’s a good idea. 

&gt; That's not true. There are other avenues money can be obtained. 

&gt; Deficit spending, 

Which taxpayer make up in the long run. 

&gt; relocating from other programs, 

Which are funded by taxpayers

&gt; creating new ones that raise money etc.

Such as? Also, why would the new money being raised go to SLF and not programs to help the lower class? Please, _make an argument_ to support your view. 

&gt; And again this point is moot in regards to SDF. It doesn't cost money to do this. 

Jesus Christ, yes it does. Money doesn’t grow on trees. I don’t understand how else to explain math to you. 

&gt; My only concern is how we get it done. I don't see any possible argument against SLF and thus don't see it up for debate.

I’ve given you several arguments in this thread. I think we should put our taxpayer money into helping the lower class, not the middle and upper classes to the detriment of the lower class. If you’re not even open to hearing arguments as to why SLF is bad then a) why are you even in this sub talking about it and b) you’re never going to get policy passed if you’re not even willing to argue as to why that policy is a good idea. 

&gt; I can only repeat so many times. No money is being ""put into"" this at all. It's debt forgiveness. It doesn't cost money on its own.

And I can only repeat so many times that that’s not how money works. If you are owed money and you don’t get that money back, you have less money then you should. If you need that money, you need to find it from somewhere else. You seem to understand that the money will need to come from somewhere else, but you keep repeating that SLF doesn’t cost anything. I’m starting to think this is an Amelia Bedelia situation and you’re just not understand the words I’m saying. Is English not your first language? That would explain a lot and I could try to explain the economics of this to you in some more basic language. 

&gt; I don't see how it wouldn't be good. 

Not an argument. 

&gt; People are in debt that they shouldn't be 

They _literally_ should be in debt. They took out loans. That’s how loans work. 

&gt; and it's the government's responsibility to right the wrong they allowed in the first place. 

Why is SLF a good way for the government to address the issue?

&gt; It's good because it frees up people to use their money for other bills or stimulate the economy in a time where that will be more important than ever.

But it does the opposite to taxpayer funds. Yes, middle and upper class individuals would have more money that they didn’t expect because now they wouldn’t have to payback loans they took out. But taxpayer funds would have _less_ money because we wouldn’t have money we _did_ expect to come in. So we would have to take that money out of other programs that could help the lower class instead of the middle and upper classes. 

&gt; I didn't. It was an aside.

Those are literally contradictory statements. Either you made the suggestion as an aside, or you didn’t make the suggestion lol. Either way, seems we are agreed now that it’s not a good idea to make universities pay these loans?

&gt; I mean this was only being proposed and talked about in the past few years on any significant level. Honestly, really only the past year if you want to be technical. I'm asking why you (in the general sense or the individual) wouldn't pay your loan debt off if you make 6 figures or more.

Well for me personally, I wasn’t making six figures until a few years ago. And having loans is good for my credit score. It would make no sense for me to put my money into paying off my loans all at once when I can instead invest it and make more, while boosting my credit by making regular payments. But once people starting talking about SLF - forget it. No way I’m paying it off all at once now lol. 

&gt; I'm not proposing we give anyone money here. This isn't about the stimulus. It's about debt forgiveness. You aren't getting money. And again there is no reason to involve taxpayers in the discussion at all.

Omg there you go again with the Amelia Bedelia literal interpretation of what I’m saying. I understand that no one is receiving a check. But if they owe money and you don’t make them pay it back, you are giving them that money that they owe. They have more money in their pocket then they would have if you hadn’t forgiven their loan. That’s giving them free money. 

&gt; People making less than $100,000 a year are possibly struggling to pay bills depending on where they live and a variety of other circumstances like business expenses or healthcare-related bills.

Yeah cause someone making 90k to pay off their college loans from a fancy private school are hurting so bad and we should give them free money. As opposed to people making 30k working minimum wage jobs and actually need that money. 

&gt; I have 10s of thousands of dollars in debt and haven't had anything more than a min wage job to work towards paying it off. 

Then we should design programs that help you since you’re lower class. That doesn’t have to be SLF since SLF also helps the 90k person who doesn’t need our help. It would be very easy to do a UBI for anyone making under 40k. No need to forgive loans for people making 90k. 

&gt; It's astonishing that people think forgiving these loans somehow doesn't help people who NEED the relief.

I never said it wouldn’t help _anyone_. I’m saying it’s not a good idea and there are better idea to help people that do need some relief. 

&gt; And that is false. The rich largely don't have loans in the first place let alone debt leftover. 

I’ve already addressed this. Yes we do. College is ridiculously expensive and even the rich need to take out loans to pay for it. The only people who don’t are the Uber Uber rich. But anyone in the top 80%-95% of wealth holders in our country would need to take out loans to pay for college. 

&gt; The poor have no choice but to take out loans and typically no means to pay them off. 

The lower class typical gets financial aid. My friend got a full ride to my private, expensive college (not scholarship - just pure financial aid) because his family was so poor they grew up on food stamps. It’s the middle and upper class who don’t get financial aid and need to take out loans to pay for college. 

&gt; And the ""middle class"" are forced to take loans with only some of them being able to make payments on them.

Yes I agree. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to use taxpayer money to give the middle class free money. We should be focusing on the lower class. 

&gt; This also has NO adverse effects on ""the poor"".

It does. Lower class people pay taxes (usually not income tax - but def other taxes like sales tax, etc). We are then using their money and giving it to the middle class. We would be redistributing wealth to the middle class. And the lower class people would get nothing. So now they are comparably even _more_ poorer then the middle class. When the middle class gets more money, that will make the cost of goods and services go up. Middle class will be about the same cause now they have free money to pay for this increase in costs. But lower class didn’t get any free money. So not only do they not get the benefit of SLF, they also now don’t have enough money to cover the goods and services they used to have enough money for but which have now increased in price.

&gt; I'm saying no such thing and you know that.

You’re just not understanding how an economy works. 

&gt; Then stop arguing lol. The government can take responsibility by forgiving the debt. 

And they can take responsibility without putting the burden to pay these loans on taxpayers. 

&gt; End of story. It doesn't have to involve taxpayers in the slightest.

You’re right. A solution to this problem doesn’t have to involve taxpayers.

1038,"5","Plebe-Uchiha","","Not gonna lie. I’m not the biggest promoter of this argument. Racism = Systemic Oppression, for a lot of people, and racism ≠ racial prejudices, necessarily. It irks me because I’ve worked or been around bigoted people who are prejudice towards certain ethnicities, but it isn’t correct for me to label them racist because they are non-White. 

I had a Black coworker who was making disparaging comments about Asian-Americans, I told her that it wasn’t cool and she was acting racist AF. She hit me with the, Black people can’t be racist because racism = systematic oppression and racism ≠ racial prejudices. 

However, I don’t want to argue over semantics, ever. To me that it the most common conflict people have when getting into a misunderstanding. I’m not going to spend time arguing over what is and what isn’t the correct definition/meaning. There’s connotative meaning and denotative meaning. I use dictionaries and then hear the other person’s personal definition for the word, and then move forward. 

Therefore, I don’t care to change your view on whether or not whether or not racism should be only defined as systematic oppression. What view I do encourage you to change is to stop arguing over semantics, once you’ve reached a certain point. Some people will only view racism as systematic oppression, nothing else. There is no point in arguing whether they are right or wrong because it’s semantics, and that means you can argue with anyone about any term being correct or incorrect. Rhetoric is powerful. Words only exist to understand each other and communicate. Spending time arguing whether someone is using a term correctly or incorrectly is mostly a fruitless endeavor due to the concepts of denotative reasoning and connotative reasoning. 

Lastly, most people agree on a lot of notions, but not everyone agrees with the semantics. We should focus on the notions and not semantics, IMHO.

It isn't.

And if you're going to insist on stating your opinion on how you would weigh the evidence as a rule of how the evidence must be weighed, we're done.

***CAN***.

Based on what information they provide, their demeanor, what their testimony is, any reason they would have to shade the truth (including ""she doesn't want her boyfriend to go to jail""), and any other factors the fact finder sees as important.

There is no witness whose testimony is required to be weighed more heavily.

I will repeat this one more time:

There is no legal basis for the claim that Zoe's testimony carries more weight based solely on the fact that she participated.  Her testimony could carry more weight, but so could the neighbor's.

1050,"5","TimeAll","","Last part.

Now, to your counterpoints:

**Counterpoint 1** makes the assumption that the best way to deal with sexual objectification isn't to teach men to restrain themselves, which you've said is ineffective, but to cover women up.  Ignore who's doing the bad thing we want to stop and just let it go on and protect the women who the bad thing would harm.  You use an example of a team dynamic where 2 people on the team are having problems, but instead of telling the person who is responsible, you tell both of them to stop arguing and focus on the team.  You've effectively absolved the responsible party from any punishment from being the jerk.  What makes you think he won't keep doing it?  You claim that its more effective to not look at who bears responsibility, but you forget that if the person responsible doesn't face punishment, there's nothing stopping him from doing it again.  So in the context of the argument, if you don't punish men for behaving badly and simply tell women to accept being harassed and dress to avoid that, you are teaching men to continue to harass.  This problem, then, will never stop.  That is a highly ineffective way to stopping the problem.  Whoever is responsible for the bad behavior needs to be taught to stop it or else it will continue.  The goal is to eliminate harassment, not get women to accept harassment.  You don't think that women who are harassed but told to accept it will feel resentful?  That resentment will manifest itself in ways, believe me.  Therefore, your counter is wrong, it is not effective for the team to say ""What is the most effective way of solving this problem?"", it is much more effective to tell the person who is causing the problem in the team to change his behavior or get out of the group

For your second part to that counterpoint, regarding taboos, all I have to say is that taboos change and often they are based on stupid superstition and fairy tales.  Why is ""13"" unlucky?  Because of a fairy tale.  Why is women dressing immodestly bad?  Because long ago religion created by men said that their god told humans he didn't like it.  Who cares what old gods and dead men thing?  I'm telling you right now that women dressing immodestly doesn't not harm me or you.  If you think it does, maybe control your own desires.

**Counterpoint 2** makes the assertion that modesty avoids the whole sexualization issue by ensuring it never occurs.  Says who?  Women have been sexually objectified in sweat pants and jackets, in coats and pants, in formal office attire and casual baggy clothes.  It is not only women in bikinis that have been attacked, women will be attacked and sexualized no matter their dress.  And who says that sexualization is defined as any environment or process that leads to the increase of direct objectification?  That's your definition?  Maybe I don't accept that definition as you try to skew it in your favor.  Sexualize means to render sexual or ascribe sexual characteristics.  That can happen to women no matter where they are or how they're dressed.  Make a woman dress in a formless robe and you'll still have men sexualizing her.

Look at how many Muslim countries force women to wear burqas and headscarves, they have seriously high rates of inequality and their men, when faced with Western women who dress how they want, erroneously think those women want to be sexualized and act out on those perceived desires.  Those countries and cultures are terrible for women, women are controlled by their men like pets, not allowed to freely move about, not afforded the dignity of being able to work outside the home, or vote.  The only way they can get women not to flee those places en masse to to trick them into a mental conditioning that lies to them that their inequality is by some measure a way of protecting them.  We in the West know that's pretty bullshit, but people who are born into such a society don't have the critical thinking necessary to easily break free.  Plus the stoning if they get out of line, the stoning is important.

**Counterpoint 3** accepts that men are basically animals and can have no role in reducing sexualization.  Its a pretty dim view if you believe that, resigning yourself to the inevitable.  So to solve that, I propose modesty blinders for men.  Instead of getting women to cover up their bodies which is a lot of trouble as men will still see them sexually, [we force all men to wear these](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1163/2604/products/Solar_Face_Shield_Black_7_copy.jpg?v=1527184761).  Make them dark enough so they can barely make out the shape of a woman, but light enough so they can still see things.  That's much much easier than forcing women to change their entire wardrobes, as this is only one thing men have to wear AND it solves the problem that you say exists that men are conditioned to sexualize women.  If they don't see women, they can't sexualize them!  

Of course such things are ridiculous, you will say, why should men have to do that?  Well now you understand why its ridiculous to disproportionately make one sex responsible for a problem that occurs in the other.  Your modesty solution falls waaaaay disporportionate on women's backs to do something, letting the men get off scot free with no changes.  You haven't even suggested greater criminal punishments for men, as your counterpoint 1 says in a team dynamic, we should not ask who bears responsibility.  If men can't control their urges, then we'll beat them with sticks, or rocks, or something harder and pointier until they get the message.  Its absolutely ridiculous to say that women need to cover up more than men need to control themselves, even if you believe men will have a harder time doing so.  So what?  If its harder, then try harder, or make the punishment worse, until they get the message.  Your idea of modesty takes away women's right to act for themselves and places it in the hands of men to act how they want.  What if, in this world of yours where women are by law forced to dress how men want, men decide they like sexualization of helpless women and force the dress code to be super immodest?  In a world controlled by men, I can see some of them passing laws that women's clothes must be short, thin, see-through, and accentuate the sexual body parts men love.  What's stopping them?  Surely not the women who have had their rights taken away.

Last thing I'll say is that your idea of modesty hurts men too, though not in the way you think.  If you accept that men can't control themselves with women, you accept that men can't control themselves in other ways.  You give them a reason to act out, and lemme tell you, men acting out doesn't just hurt women but other men.  If you say to a man he doesn't need to control his own sexual desire, then maybe he doesn't need to control his anger.  Maybe you bump into him with your car and he kills you, because he can't be expected to control himself.  Maybe the women that you so venerate to want to protect them are raped by other men who let their desire run free without limits.  Maybe a gay man rapes you because he's a man too and likes other men.  Think about your next interaction with a man in the real world if you tell him he doesn't need to control his desires.  Will he hit you, steal from you, rape you, or all of the above?  How can you tell him to stop if you are against men controlling their desires?",0,"2024-05-20T11:14:51.308419Z","2018-09-19T18:42:00Z","","No",13.374,572951418.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9h4c56/_/e69rit6/",3,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:14:51.308431Z"
1051,"5","dale_glass",11740160.0,"&gt; I think that's because as a society, we have decided that combat is barbaric and only tend to allow violent response after pushed past the point of thinking clearly

Okay, but why combat? Most couples are made of a man and a woman, and men have the overwhelming physical advantage in combat. Me, with my regular gym attendance, would need to be paired up by a professional female fighter, and even then I think I would have excellent chances if it ever came down to a contest of strength, which seems pretty likely. It would make for an extremely unfair fight, practically all the time. Boxing has weight classes precisely for this reason.

But there's a more important problem, and it's this: combat, done in any way at all, has nothing to do with the underlying dispute. Suppose I claim the world is round, and my opponent says it's flat. Suppose they are able to win by being a mountain of muscle. How does the ability to fight have anything to do with the actual disagreement?

We could pick a non-physical contest, but the problem would remain. If one side wins by being better at the contest, it's unrelated to the disagreement. If one side wins basically at random because they're about even, you might as well just throw a coin.

&gt; I suppose an ongoing ritual combat would break down over time with an abusive person, and devolve into actual abuse. I suppose my main hope was that by handicapping the individuals, the would be victim of abuse would be able to take the would be abuser down a peg on occasion.

And why would an abusive individual consent to being handicapped?


&gt; I'd like more information in this research. While I can see that as the case in some cases, getting beat I would think is a deterrent from wanting to do it again.

[Here for example](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/overcoming-destructive-anger/201705/should-you-visit-anger-room)

Yes, but winning is an incentive to want to do it again. Whoever loses will have an incentive to stop arguing, and whoever wins will have a lot of leverage to get their way. ""You want a black eye in the ring again? No? Then we're getting pizza.""

OP is proposing a _class system_ that controls for the _things that contribute to performance_.  

If you take men who are shorter, slower and whatever other factors are used to determine the classes in hurdles and put them in with women who are the same height and speed and have the same leaping ability and so on  they will _perform the same_ because the class is determined by the factors that determine performance.

There is NO QUESTION that men will outperform women.  The topic is about finding the classes that make sense to determine what matters in sport performance.  If you get that right, then ""sex"" ceases to be the line, but you'll have pretty mediocre men in the same class as the top performing women. 

This is just like how boxing does it, but weight wouldn't do the trick because we know that there are factors in male physiology vs. female physiology that explain that ""weight"" doesn't tell the whole story.  A women of 110 pounds is significantly less powerful than a man of 110 - not even close.  So...the class would have to include power.

If we agree that veganism is a human construct then if all vegans in the world agree that breast milk is okay then perhaps it is the definition that is wrong, no? You know that the average vegan is not going to be looking at breast milk as an animal-derived product and you know that most people say animal meaning non-humans. Whether that is *technically* incorrect or not doesn't even vaguely matter as all you are doing is arguing semantics.

The idea of volunteer humans is just not really realistic enough to properly have as a thought experiment. Having said that, however, as a vegetarian, aside from the extremely gross factor of eating human meat, if in this hypothetical scenario it was genuinely voluntary and there we no ethical issues then yeah I would not be opposed to eating human meat. Again, apart from the fact that it would gross me the fuck out.

Also assuming there was no environmental impact from this ""human farm"" as that is my personal reason for being vegetarian.

1058,"5","strubenuff","","Thanks for elaborating. Let me briefly reply to the first part of your post. 

You're basically saying (or I'm interpreting it as) ""we all experience this thing, we all call this thing 'free will', and when we talk about it we all can relate to each other because the exact same experience. So let's just stop arguing the semantics."" In a sense, you are right. Because ""free will"" as I have defined it is, quite literally, totally illogical and self-contradictory, it almost fells like ""what's the point?"" 

The point of course is that once you truly under the mechanism of free will and accept the reality of them, you have to reject any notion of moral responsibility. OR at the very least, we need to have a discussion about it because something huge has changed in the way we actually understand human interactions. 

 I'm going to list 3 situations below:

    John cuts off Sarah's hand because she cheated on him.
    John has a gun to his head, and cuts off Sarah's hand so Mike won't shoot him.
    An alligator named John bites off Sarah's hand.

What should happen to John? Should John be punished in case 1? Should John be punished in case 2, but less severally because he didn't have a ""choice""? Should we go searching for John in case 3 and put him in prison?

If your feelings about John changed in scenarios 1-3, I hope you can see the significance of John being able to control his actions...

 As to your second point, what you're actually presenting is a common objection called ""fatalism."" It is very akin to when a Christian first loses their faith and asks themselves ""What is the point of being good? Why don't I go rape and kill and steal no if there is no God to judge me and no Heaven to reward me?"" My response is that: 

1) The actual empirical evidence for a ""negative response"" given the knowledge that free will does not exist is incredibly weak (I do actually read studies) 

2) Whether or not there is an initial negative response, society should embrace knowledge over comfort (think Santa Claus, tooth Fairy, God [assuming you're an athesit]), especially in science classes.

3) There are actually a great deal of potentially beneficial responses that could be enacted if this was realized on a much larger scale (rehabilitation instead of punitive punishments for criminals, for example)",0,"2024-05-20T11:18:11.801797Z","2014-06-15T17:42:22Z","","Yes",19.596,134698096.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2871ps/_/ci87map/",0,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:18:11.801832Z"

1061,"5","inconspicuous_bear","","&gt;There could be a difference, there could be not. It depends on what classes and professors you take. If you take bs classes then it really isn't impressive. Also I know really smart people who don't give a damn and dont study at all and get a 3.4 GPA, but they dont care to study, so that is ok with them. And i know people who try their absolute hardest and get a 3.6. Its all relative. I myself, failed 2 midterms in my geography class, and still got an A. In my film class, barely showed up got an A. In my calculus class, my teacher was super hard, we had so much homework, hand written test, hard grading, i got a B, yet my other friends luckily got a easy teacher who let them use notes on test, gave study guides, extra credit, barely any homework, and the majority of them got an A yet barely understand the material, yet a got a B and have a superior understanding of the material because of my professor. It was a 5 unit class, so my B actually dropped my GPA, and im sure their A raised theirs. So GPA really isnt a good indicator. It just a general indicator. We can only assume people with 3.0+ are relatively good students, but it is a stretch to try and differentiate between a 3.3 and 3.7, too many variables at play. And dont forget all the cheaters also.

On an individual and anecdotal basis, there isn't much of a concrete difference between 3.3 and a 3.7 GPA. Would you stop arguing that? No one is disagreeing with you.

Overall a 3.7 gpa student is more likely going to be a better candidate than a 3.3 gpa student. Period. That is not true in every single individual case so you can tell me about your life stories all day, it doesn't matter. 

But you're right, GPA alone is not a good indicator of how qualified someone is. What GPA is representing in this argument is ""how quantitatively qualified someone is to do this task"". Something that is very imperfect. But if you look overall, a person who has the higher scores on the tests is more likely to be the person who is more knowledgeable, is more likely to be the person who did the reading and isn't going to miss that little detail later on, and is the person who is more likely to get their work done at the job because they're more likely the person who studied more and did their homework.

&gt;Everybody has to meet the minimum requirements first, then affirmative action comes into play. You fail to see this. And yes please, dont reply because i do not want to waste my time reading your lazy poor responses mis characterizing affirmative action, due to you never even glancing at its actual meaning and practice.

It's like if you're trying to improve yourself. You drink too much, smoke too much, are too messy, eat too much, and play too many videogames. You *want* to stop all of those things, but rather than quitting everything cold turkey-- which most people will fail to do-- it is much easier and more effective to tackle one issue at a time starting with the worst one.

To transmit that to humanity, he inspired men to write Holy Books in some form or fashion. By definition means they are superior to any moral authority man has, because God is superior to man. 

By stating you want religions to stop arguing they have the superior moral standing, you're effectively asking them to say God isn't always right. That goes against the entire idea of a religion with a Supreme Being. You will not find many who are willing to make that leap, and those that do are quickly called out as heretics. 

The best you can do is to argue the books weren't copied properly. That at least won't be an immediate turnoff if argued properly, but is also hit or miss.",0,"2024-05-20T11:20:42.771919Z","2019-07-15T15:14:18Z","","No",8.822,748251418.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cdhmhm/_/etu3yqa/",7,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:20:42.771930Z"

If I order 1000x 16oz. 90% lean beef sirloins to provide steak as a menu option, then I can inform the consumer about the caloric content of that item, along with considerations for how it is cooked and prepared.  I think you're over-looking the fact that even the smallest restaurants have cooks that prepare the same dish over and over; by its very nature, *any* restaurant cooking, no matter how large or small the scale, is going to be standardized for the sake of efficiency and consumer satisfaction, so calorie counts, expressed as a range, are not burdensome in any way.  Seasonal menus are planned well in advance, and again, the food is acquired in defined amounts and sizes.  I think you just don't understand how a restaurant works in any capacity if you think it'd be difficult for a restaurateur to devise a basic, logistical system for providing calorie information.

&gt;It may even discourage some people from taking responsibility or thinking about their own health and eating habits...

That's absurd.  If you present a consumer with more information, by definition, you are supporting their capacity for informed decision-making.  Continuing your line of logic, calorie counts aren't *going far enough* in informing the consumer, so let's include a dietetics degree with every food purchase!

2. Automobile liability claims patternsThe primary determinant of auto insurance prices is the value of insured losses per car. Hence, differences in the frequency and severity of insured losses are an important determinant of price differences across locations. Loss costs for automobile insurance claims are highest for liability claims involving bodily injury. Moreover, average bodily injury liability (BIL) losses per insured car vary widely by state: in 1991 these costs ranged from $49 in North Dakota to $233 in California (National Association of Inde- pendent Insurers, 1992). The frequency of BIL claiming also varies widely across states. In 1991, the number of BIL claims per insured automobile ranged from 0.0039 in North Dakota to 0.0294 in California.Of course, cross-state differences in claims are affected by variations in accident rates. A commonly used statistic that controls for differences in accident rates is the ratio of the number of BIL claims to the number of property damage liability (PDL) claims. The PDL claims rate is the best available index of the universe of claims that are candidates for a BIL suit. PDL coverage protects drivers against lawsuits for damage to the property of others. Unlike collision insurance, which protects against damage to the driver’s own vehicle, PDL policies do not incorporate a deductible, so claims rates for this coverage are minimally affected by differences in deductibles across states.3 PDL is sold as a package with BIL coverage, and like BIL, is compulsory or quasi-compulsory in all states. Every accident involving PDL is a potential candidate for a BIL claim. While not every accident leads to a PDL claim, one would not expect major differences in the rate of such claims per accident across states, especially since property damage claims do not incur general damages.The number of BIL claims per 100 PDL claims also varies significantly across states: in 1991this ratio ranged from 11.5 in North Dakota to 77.2 in California. BIL claims rates are also higher in many large metropolitan areas than in the surrounding regions (Cum- mins and Tennyson, 1992). For example, the ratio of BIL to PDL claims in Philadelphia is about 3.5 times the Pennsylvania state average, and this ratio is nearly twice as high inNew York and Los Angeles as in the respective states as a whole. This finding is especially significant in view of the fact that auto accidents in urban areas occur at lower speeds and hence tend to be less severe than those in less congested areas (Insurance Research Council, 1990).Another noteworthy trend is that the number of bodily injury liability (BIL) claims per insured car has increased in states that compensate accident victims through the tort system, even though accident rates have declined. In no-fault states, which restrict eligi- bility for pain and suffering awards to those with serious injuries, the rate of BIL claiming has generally declined, although by less than the accident rate (Cummins and Tennyson, 1992). This suggests that liability insurance claiming behavior is responsive to the com- pensation environment. This hypothesis is also supported by the results of a study of Massachusetts claims filed in 1989 (Weisberg and Derrig, 1992). This study found that the 1988 increase in the state’s no-fault threshold from $500 to $2000 had virtually no effect on the BIL claims rate. (A no-fault threshold is the amount of medical expenses an accident victim must incur to be eligible for a pain and suffering award). The severity of smaller claims rapidly converged to the new threshold.These differences in the pattern of BIL claims across locations are suggestive of dif- ferences in BIL claiming behavior, which may be attributable to moral hazard. Nonethe- less, they ultimately fall short of establishing this hypothesis, because a number of other factors influence claim-filing rates. For example, differences in BIL claims rates may reflect differences in the character and severity of accidents across geographic areas or differences in economic or demographic factors. The relevant issue is whether fraud and filing-incentive effects are evident after controlling for the other determinants of auto liability insurance claims. This is explored in the remainder of the article.

662,"5","quietramen","","&gt; According to the most recent data (July 2018), Americans worked an average of 34.5 hours per week

Yes, if you add people that work part time. In 2016, the average man employed full-time worked 8.4 hours per work day in the US. Which works out to 42h a week. But anyway, this number completely ignores that Germans have way more vacation days, essentially unlimited sick leave days and so on. 

I think this is the final number we need to look at:

Average annual hours actually worked per worker

US: 1,789 

Germany: 1,288


I think we can stop arguing now about who works more on average. It is US citizens. Facts and personal experience reflect this.

&gt; You know who has lower GINI than Germany? Poland.And even lower is Ukraine that has the lowest coefficient i can find in world bank data.But you would rather stay in the ""unequal"" Germany than move to the other side of the Oder?

There is a difference between the bottom level from where the inequality starts. A poor person in Germany lives a completely different life than a poor person in Poland or the Ukraine. A rich person probably lives a quite similar life.

I would argue that a poor person's life in Germany also is quite different from a poor person's life in the US.

&gt; Average salaries across the board in the US are higher and often much higher.

Nobody argues against that. But the gap between high and low salaries is much bigger.

If one person earns 100.000 and another person 10.000, their average will be higher than 2 people earning 50.000. That's how averages work.

&gt; You can major in things that are useless but you won't make good money and be locked in low paying job because your skills are useless regardless of if you are in the US or in Germany. Go ahead study useless majors but don't cry that engineers and doctors make more money than you 10 years down the road.

It is the same in the US and in Germany, yes. The difference is that I can study something low paying without high student debts, without worrying about not being able to work at a company with good health benefits and without worrying about putting a huge amount of money to the side for retirement. It gives me freedom to do something I want to do instead of HAVING to do something that pays well due to a poor support system.

Now, I give you that, this is a point we can argue about. Should be subsidize people who want to work in ""low demand"" jobs? I personally think, there is value in that for society as a whole, even though the economics don't reflect that. Especially if we are talking about jobs in education, arts and crafts.

&gt; Well hopefully you make it to 65.

&gt; What the hell does that mean? Do you get retirement in Germany before you reach your age stated by law or I am missing something here? There are plenty of social programs in the US but you ignore their existence.

I mean, hopefully you are not one of the millions of people without health insurance.

&gt; Also child poverty depends on thresholds you apply to the data https://www.dw.com/en/bertelsmann-21-percent-of-german-kids-are-long-term-poor/a-41076954 In US poverty is around 2k$/month for family of 4 in Germany it is from 1251 euro to 1399 euro depending on age of kids so 1438.65 up to 1608.85$ .As you can clearly see that is not the same threshold but you will spin it as some advantage of great Germany.

Ah, good point. Maybe because something like differences in cost of living exist? Maybe because you need to pay for a lot of things out of your pocket in the US that are essentially free in Germany?

The study you quoted is also quite interesting. I would love to see these points applied to children in the US. By the way, just one click away, you can find this:

https://www.dw.com/en/unicef-20-percent-of-children-in-developed-countries-living-in-poverty/a-39259716

&gt; Germany scores well, while child poverty in US above average

&gt; The results varied greatly by country. Denmark, Iceland and Norway, where one in 10 children live in poverty, recorded the best results. By comparison, one-third of children live in relative poverty in Israel and Romania.

&gt; Overall, the countries that scored best for child well-being were the Nordic countries as well as Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, Slovenia and the Netherlands.

&gt; Southern and Eastern European states tended to see the highest rate of child poverty, as well as the Latin American countries.

&gt; In the US, meanwhile, 30 percent of children reportedly live in poverty, significantly above the 20 percent global average.

I summarize:

* Germans work less on average than US citizens

* Top salaries in Germany are lower than in the US.

* Less people are poor in Germany and being poor is completely different to being poor in the US.

* Life is less stressful in Germany due to all basic human needs being covered by the government or government schemes (housing, furniture, food, healthcare, education,...).",0,"2024-05-20T09:50:49.026721Z","2018-10-09T04:07:04Z","","No",57.776,579736188.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9l5rb0/_/e7fn2ay/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T09:50:49.026727Z"
1084,"5","LiberalArtsAndCrafts","","I was talking about politicians. Politicians don't, by and large, care much about the party, other than as a means to accomplishing their goals, IMO. If they are convinced that advocating for reform will reduce the power of parties, but increase their ability to accomplish their goals, that's a no brainer, they'll advocate for reform.   
&gt;Everyone's known that since before anyone alive was born.   
  

Absolutely false. The vast majority of citizens have never heard of election reform, couldn't name the system we use now, much less the alternatives we could use. This is why it's not done yet, because people haven't successfully spread the word about the problem and a viable solution. That's what I'm working on here. Part of what I'm trying to convince you of, is that the solution is viable, because there won't be as much pushback as you suspect, so that we can stop arguing about how impossible it is, and you can start spreading the word about the solution (which, I repeat, is STAR Voting) and also arming you with responses to a very common objection, that the people in power will resist so hard that it's functionally impossible to win, and therefore is a waste of time for people to advocate for it. I'm trying to explain why I think we could get SOME politicians with major party platforms to endorse such a change in a year or two, if we had at least 50 people in one constituencey willing to regularly advocate for such reform, to voters, to party members, and to candidates/elected officials.

1093,"5","theonehandedwriter","","Not a rejection of your view, but I'd like to highlight a few of my own views and see what you think.

1. Trans rights isn't the same thing as gay rights. Gay people have been rallying for the last 50+ years for visibility and rights. It's been slow and grinding with actual acceptance tipped over 50% in the last decade or so. Trans people were not a visible enough part of this movement to fully benefit from said movement otherwise they'd have much the same rights as gay people. I don't know the history (though I'd love to if you've got any links pretty please), so it's probably not their fault, but the full benefit of the gay rights movement wasn't felt by trans groups. And I can tell because trans rights feel very much like where gay rights were back in the nineties. They're now visible enough to be acknowledged, but they're still political pariahs and are targets of discrimination.

2. Trans rights doesn't have a cohesive message. I'll pick at your message a bit. Not in a mean way, but in a way I want you to understand. You used terms and phrases that people who aren't plugged into sexual politics don't understand. Grandma understands what gay means, but grandma doesn't understand what CIS means. Thankfully I didn't detect much else in your statement that people don't understand, but when I hear people talk about trans people or trans rights I need to go onto the internet to understand some of them. Most people don't do that. It's a branding problem and a communication problem. The ideas behind those words aren't transmitted to the masses in a way that they will understand, internalize and accept. If trans people want to be accepted they need to be understood, and if they need to be understood they need to use words that other people understand. Maybe they describe themselves in terms that other people in the community understand for sake of precision, but grandma doesn't understand the nuances. If it's too complicated to understand people tune out. If it's too alien or viewed as ""gross"" people begin to actively oppose you.

3. Many of the trans people I've met are angry and vent on me for not understanding when I'm trying to understand. I won't pretend that I understand the struggle, but I will say that I get that I don't get it. I can empathize without understanding, because pretending to understand is intensely insulting. When attempting to be diplomatic I have been repeatedly yelled at for not understanding, for not using the correct gender pronoun, for asking questions which I didn't know were offensive, whatever. Not all the time of course, but enough that it's off putting. I'm not always going to get stuff right.

4. As a moderate liberal and once upon a time left leaning one, I will say that many of my former ilk will use you as a prop to pretend that they're awesome. On the other hand a big part of the SJW movement means well, but they're coming from a place that likes to yell instead of discuss and to censor instead of debate. Often enough they will cause more damage by giving haters ammunition for their views rather than pushing forward a political view in a way that advances your cause.

5. This means that while the left will try to defend you and the right will vilify you, you are a political football. It means that on occasion you're going to get played with and kicked back and forth. That you're an object in a game you never signed up for. It sucks and it's not going to change for a long time. I'm sorry. I wish that trans people could have quietly advanced their causes in a way that got their rights recognized or something along those lines that allowed for self-determination. However powers that are larger than you or the trans community have latched onto your small group in the never ending culture wars. Buckle up. It's only going to get worse.

When I look back on this it sounds combative. I'm not trying to be. Some of this came from a place of anger, but not directed at you or your community. I truly want everyone's rights to be respected and exalted. I want ""A World Where Gay Married Couples Can Defend Their Marijuana Fields With Guns"". Rights for everyone as long as they're not at the expense of another. Where disparate groups aren't fighting for their tiny identity politics molehills, but where people just get along so we can stop arguing about bullshit, and if I'm not comfortable with a single group of people I realize that if they're not hurting anyone I really shouldn't mind.

1096,"5","[deleted]","","I'm rather indifferent about this show, but here's why the zombies can be terrifying at times:

The zombies are slow, but there are LOTS of them, and running away from one crowd of zombies might end up with the survivors running into another crowd. There's not really a safe place in that world. If people get surrounded, or there are more than they can fight off quickly, they're pretty screwed. There's no gun store nearby, so they want to conserve ammo, and the times that the characters are fighting the zombies hand-to-hand are terrifying. If I remember correctly, the people who get bitten are from a zombie coming out of nowhere.

The survivors I'd argue aren't especially bright, but they're not especially stupid either. They are a bunch of random strangers that found each other, and they're forced to trust each other with their lives. Besides the policemen and the hunter, I don't think any of the others have combat or firearms experience. It's easy to sit back and go ""Hey, you guys should stop arguing"", but in stressful times, people can't get along over a class presentation, much less a world full of zombies that can kill you at any moment. Maybe it'd help if you posted some times where you thought they were being extremely unreasonable or stupid.

* All Jerry Seinfeld needed to do to find love was stop being so picky.

And of course:

* All the people in the Walking Dead need to do to survive the zombie apocalypse is work together and stop wasting time talking about their feelings.

But this doesn't work. People on these shows act stupid because people in real life are stupid. Sure if a bunch of green berets were caught in the apocalypse, they would be much better at surviving. But these characters are just regular, stupid, fallible people caught in crazy circumstances. 

Just because it's the zombie apocalypse doesn't mean the slow people suddenly become fit, or the stupid people become smart. It doesn't mean that people will somehow stop arguing about stupid stuff or talking about their feelings. Jerks don't start acting nice, and nice people don't start acting like jerks.

It’s funny you say that because you have completely missed the best argument for legal abortion, so I’m guessing you don’t actually know the facts. The lead in being that abortion is undoubtedly immoral—as is killing any living thing—but that we don’t follow natural law because it leads to emotional decisions. So if the morality argument is out the window then what’s left? Well the only other way to look at it is as a deterrent or a safety measure. Well the rate of abortion is the same whether it’s legal or illegal, and it’s much more dangerous when it’s illegal because people are getting “back alley” abortions instead of getting them in clinics. So logically having it be legal is the only solution. 

&gt;It’s the woman’s choice, just like i stated with male masturbation. If you can’t see that then im not sure what you’ve been readinv

And this argument is just such a bad one. It’s embarrassing that it’s being used, and that’s literally why there’s an abortion “debate”. 

&gt; I don’t see why any men other from the father should have any say in what a woman does with her body. That’s why im limiting them.

No one should have power over anyone else’s body. But a fetus isn’t a part of the mother’s body anymore, it’s it’s own entity residing inside of the mother. 

&gt; I’m a male too, im just not a disrespectful person towards womens’ clear issues with over-controlling white men

You need to stop arguing with your emotions. Shaming someone into agreeing with you doesn’t work. Fun fact, people did in more when you aggressively attack their position. In the future you should use facts and sources instead of opinions to try to persuade someone.

1111,"5","Tynach",16391687.0,"&gt; My stance here is that it's reasonable to expect someone to understand someone coming into one of these very public conversations what they are generally about and the way certain phrases or words are generally being used.

I feel like it's more complicated than that. There are times where that is a reasonable assumption, and times when that is *not* a reasonable assumption.

I agree with you in the case where the definitions used for the discussion are posted not just publicly, but visibly - such as in a stickied post (if it's applied to a single forum/subreddit/group/etc.), or within the main body of the post being discussed in a thread (so that everyone in that comment  thread will literally have to have seen them in order to even reply), unless they followed a link that sent them directly into the middle of the discussion (at which point people can politely point out the original post's definitions).

Otherwise, social media platforms such as Reddit, Facebook, Tumblr, and various others are going to be filled with too many people with too much variation in exposure to this topic and points of view for this to be reasonable. It's unreasonable to expect a random sample out of several million people to already know what definitions for which terms are being used.

Note that not everyone is present when a definition is 'rehashed over and over', and those that are in a given scenario of those definitions being given might only be in the range of 10 - 50 people per instance.

Lets say that the definitions are given and explained in the conversation 100 times, and each time 50 people see that explanation. That's still only 5,000 people who have been made aware of that definition, and for the sake of simplicity lets say there are 5,000,000 people on the social media platform in question.

That means that there are still 4,995,000 people who *have not* seen the definitions, which means that the population of that website that doesn't know them is 999 times larger than the population that *has*. Expecting random people on the site to know the correct definitions is absurd, as even if they frequently see threads where this is being discussed, it's much rarer for them to see threads where the definitions of the terms are discussed.

&gt; Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not interested in continuing this conversation if it's going to involve you jumping on semantic points like ""That's not what 'due diligence' technically means."" I think it's pretty clear I meant ""due diligence"" in a more general sense of ""having put the work in.""

I'd like to first say that while I did think you were using the term in a different way, I was *not* certain. I felt it was a good idea to address both possibilities, even if only for the sake of other people reading this conversation later. Many times I've read a comment chain where two people misunderstand each other, and think they disagree with each other when they really don't. I wanted to make it clear that I might be misunderstanding you, and show that I had considered the other way that I could interpret your post.

Regardless, I think I've made it pretty clear that, at least in my opinion, having specific, unambiguous language is the key to having these discussions to begin with. It often feels like people will bring up things like, ""Oh you know what I meant, stop arguing about semantics!"" are the people who are trying to shut down the conversation, as they are effectively preventing people from learning what the proper definitions should be. The only reason to prevent that discussion, at least that I can think of, is to ensure that misinformation can continue to spread.

&gt; And there it is. Yes, that was *obviously* what I was saying, and it's kind of exasperating that you spent two paragraphs on lecturing me about what due diligence means and about how wrong I would be if I meant what I clearly didn't mean.

It seemed like the most likely thing for you to mean by it, but again, I was *not* certain, and I would *not* consider it obvious.

Given that I decided to address both possible ways of interpreting your statements, I personally feel like it was a good thing that I indicated which one I felt was unlikely to be your intention from the start. I wanted to address the one I felt was *more* likely second, because then you could flow from reading that part to reading the next part without an annoying, irrelevant bit in between; but I also didn't want you to start reading that section and think that I was dumb or pedantic enough to claim you were actually saying the less likely thing.

&gt; I have no problem with the idea of asking clarifying questions when meaning is unclear. Not sure what I said that gave the impression I didn't.

Well, I'm confused then. I consider 'clarifying questions' and 'clarifying statements' to be equally valid. As such, it should be equally valid to ask, ""Wait, what exactly do you mean by 'white people' in this context?"" as it is to say, ""Remember though, not all white people are like that.""

If you're saying there is a difference between the two that makes one appropriate but the other inappropriate, then perhaps this is where my confusion lies and you could explain to me why that would be. Also, I should point out that in my perspective, such a clarifying statement might not necessarily be intended for the person being responded to, but instead for other people who might read the conversation later on.

&gt; My experience has been otherwise.

This is another area where precise definitions are important. To me, making a statement like, ""Not all white people do that,"" does *not* make that person a racist. If, however, you believe that such statements are primarily used by racists to derail a conversation, and this leads you to believe that the person saying it *is* a racist, then to you they *are* a racist.

In my point of view, a *racist act* is when someone judges the actions of a person, or performs actions with regards to a person, differently depending on the other person's race. But a *racist* is a person who not only does this, but when it is pointed out to them that they are discriminating based on race they will respond with a bunch of reasons why they should be allowed to do that.

People who perform racist acts, and have it pointed out to them, will often admit it was racist and apologize. It's often something subconscious that caused them to think or behave like that, and when they become aware of it they agree it was wrong and try to fight it. I would not consider these people racists, but I would still think that the racist acts they have done are wrong.

Lets demonstrate an example of what I mean. Say that there's someone walking home at night, and walking in the opposite direction as them is a black guy, and some time later a white guy walks past them. They don't know and have never met either person. If they lower their head and avoid looking at the black guy, but give a short wave and smile at the white guy, that is a racist act.

However, lets say that the very next day he sees the same black guy in a comic book store he's visiting, reading a comic he likes. Lets also say the black guy recognizes him and says something like, ""Hey, uh... This might sound strange, but were you walking along _____ street last night? You looked really worried about something, everything OK?""

The guy who performed the racist act might try to do a variety of things, from denying it was him, to admitting it was because he thought the black guy was gonna mug him, apologizing for that and admitting it was wrong to assume something like that. But either way, he still recognized and felt shame for what he had done previously.

Now, an actual racist, at least by the definitions I go by in my head, might still be capable of being friends with this black guy - but instead of feeling guilty about what he'd done, he'd shrug it off and say or think something like, ""Hey, never know who's gonna mug ya. I'm not gonna trust some random stranger coming towards me at night!""

The key difference is that the racist actually believes their actions are justified, and that the racist acts they perform should be considered acceptable so that they can keep performing them.

&gt; Wait... what? I never said that's why they do it. I said they use the pretense of responding to statements they can twist into (or maybe genuinely feel) are racist against *them* to avoid having to critically thinking about racial issues and keep on holding the racist views they already hold (or, at the very least, to avoid critically thinking about racial issues).

I apologize for the misunderstanding, though I feel like I understand your point of view less now than before.

To me, considering who does and does not perform certain racist/sexist/etc. acts *is* part of critical thinking, as it's a step toward then thinking about *why* they act that way, so that it can be determined how to help convince them that those acts are wrong.

It's not like they're denying that the problems exist at all, they're just clarifying that it's not *everyone* in the given demographic that performs them. Saying, ""Not all white people do that,"" is extremely far from saying, ""Nobody does that.""

If the specific discussion centers around a *specific* racist act, then somebody saying, ""Not all white people do that,"" has no bearing whatsoever on any other racist acts that are performed which aren't being discussed. So I feel like your, ""keep on holding the racist views they already hold,"" statement couldn't mean anything other than the specific act being discussed.

If, ""It's actually fine for people to do that thing,"" is not what you say they're trying to convey, and it's not, ""I think that's bad too, but want to ignore these other things I do,"" either (since those other things were never being discussed to begin with)... Then I'm afraid I must really be misunderstanding your point of view.",0,"2024-05-20T11:48:47.835695Z","2018-11-30T01:57:18Z","","No",12.548,607294964.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/a1kfsk/_/earbdoe/",0,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:48:47.835708Z"
1112,"5","parmenides86","","&gt; I feel like it's more complicated than that. There are times where that is a reasonable assumption, and times when that is not a reasonable assumption.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with you in the case where the definitions used for the discussion are posted not just publicly, but visibly - such as in a stickied post (if it's applied to a single forum/subreddit/group/etc.), or within the main body of the post being discussed in a thread (so that everyone in that comment  thread will literally have to have seen them in order to even reply), unless they followed a link that sent them directly into the middle of the discussion (at which point people can politely point out the original post's definitions).

Okay, I see that I just haven't made very clear what I mean. My apologies.

I'm talking about discussion that emerges out large, national, or global conversations. Like, as a concrete example, the conversation about ""all lives matter"" as a response to Black Lives Matter. Like conversations that have been ongoing, across social media, news media, etc., for awhile. That's what I'm talking about.

Obviously, not every discussion takes place in the context of a large general conversation like this, but at a lot of the kinds of discussions I see ""Not all X"" folks wade into do.

&gt;Regardless, I think I've made it pretty clear that, at least in my opinion, having specific, unambiguous language is the key to having these discussions to begin with. It often feels like people will bring up things like, ""Oh you know what I meant, stop arguing about semantics!"" are the people who are trying to shut down the conversation, as they are effectively preventing people from learning what the proper definitions should be. The only reason to prevent that discussion, at least that I can think of, is to ensure that misinformation can continue to spread.

From my own perspective, it's that I don't want the conversation to devolve into a discussion about how I should have used more precise language than I did, which is itself what I find to be a common derailing tactic, as I have said so in my various responses throughout this thread. 

Not saying you are trying to do that, necessarily, but I have very little patience for that sort of thing, so if you insist on doing it, I'm not really interested in continuing to discuss with you. In the above instance, a simple, ""Could you clarify what you mean by due diligence?"" would have served just as well as two paragraphs that came off, frankly, as you very condescendingly lecturing me about proper term usage.

&gt;Well, I'm confused then. I consider 'clarifying questions' and 'clarifying statements' to be equally valid. As such, it should be equally valid to ask, ""Wait, what exactly do you mean by 'white people' in this context?"" as it is to say, ""Remember though, not all white people are like that.""

This goes right back to your ""due diligence"" thing. The difference between ""what do you mean?"" and ""You're saying that wrong"" are pretty clear to me. Is it not clear to you?

&gt;In my point of view, a racist act is when someone judges the actions of a person, or performs actions with regards to a person, differently depending on the other person's race. But a racist is a person who not only does this, but when it is pointed out to them that they are discriminating based on race they will respond with a bunch of reasons why they should be allowed to do that.

My experience has not been that a racist is necessarily someone who will admit that the actions they take are racist, and very often will insist that they are *not* racist.

&gt;People who perform racist acts, and have it pointed out to them, will often admit it was racist and apologize. It's often something subconscious that caused them to think or behave like that, and when they become aware of it they agree it was wrong and try to fight it. I would not consider these people racists, but I would still think that the racist acts they have done are wrong.

The distinction between ""person who says or does racist things"" and ""a racist"" isn't one I'm particularly interested in making.

I agree that someone who says or does racist things and acknowledges them as racist when called out is less problematic than someone who continues to insist that what they did or said is not racist.

&gt;It's not like they're denying that the problems exist at all, they're just clarifying that it's not everyone in the given demographic that performs them. Saying, ""Not all white people do that,"" is extremely far from saying, ""Nobody does that.""

It depends on the specific conversation.

Let me clarify: the sort of situation I have in mind is one where it is clear, either explicitly or from context, that not *every* member of X group is being called out. In these situations, there is no reason to start off discussion (or, in many cases, barge into a discussion that is already happening) with ""You know, not *every* X is like that.""

I do not mean to include situations where someone is legitimately saying ""All X are like this,"" or where the exact meaning is unclear and needs to be worked out. I have a specific kind of interjection, and a specific kind of interject*or* in mind, and I generally think these people have their own agenda, which is to morally justify their own racist beliefs.

One reason liberals have utterly failed to protect the right to choose is that we've taken the right at their word, and waste time arguing points they don't actually believe or care about. 

How often do you read arguments from liberals like ""Well, ______ isn't very pro-life, weird huh?"" The goal is to reveal inconsistencies, hoping that eventually their minds will change. This argument on organ donation is similar- it *would* resonate with them, if it operated on a principle they cared about. But ""pro-life"" isn't a belief they hold. It is not their guiding principle. It's a lie they repeat to justify attempting to establish control over women and the kind of lives women are allowed to live, and to base that control on the ethics of their own religion. Granted, many right wingers repeat their slogans so often they come to believe they believe them, but the millions of ways their actions do not line up with their statements is proof they're lying, sometimes even lying to themselves.

Consider this question: *If there was a policy that allowed women to control their own bodies AND to live without the threat of forced birth, one that allowed them to have the kinds of romantic lives they want to live, drastically reduces the number of abortions, AND is cheaper for taxpayers overall, would pro-lifers be in favor of it?*

Yes! if they're being honest. Anything that reduces abortions without limiting the rights of women would be a win/win for them. But if they're lying, they'd hate such a plan, because it solves the problem they pretend to have, and does not solve their actual problem.

Well, spoiler alert; that program **does** exist.[ It's been tested, and it worked](https://cdphe.colorado.gov/fpp/about-us/colorados-success-long-acting-reversible-contraception-larc#:~:text=Birth%20rate%20among%20young%20women,avoided%3A%20%2466.1%2D%2469.6%20million.), but for some reason, the right wing absolutely **hates** it. Sometimes they can't even explain why they hate it, they just know it's offensive in some way. If you bring it up with a pro-lifer, they'll usually pull out their phone and google what they're supposed to say in response.

If those of us who like equal rights and religious liberty want to keep these things, we need to stop arguing against points they don't care about, and engage on their true beliefs. Point out how monstrous it is to use a child as a punishment for a woman having what their religion says is an immoral relationship. Ask if they're upset they had to take care of a child when they weren't ready, and whether forcing that harm on another will undo what it did to them. Point out we can't force millions of women out of the workforce and not expect it to have a catastrophic effect on our economy and lives. Ask them if they're comfortable with someone being executed for not wanting to be a mother, and whether they'd be proud of their belief when that starts happening.",0,"2024-05-20T11:56:44.251271Z","2022-07-04T21:01:28Z","","No",58.229,1920284045.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vracnh/_/iev4gla/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T11:56:44.251283Z"

What does this even mean? Like teachers are showing kids gay furry porn, and some guy getting mauled by a tiger. How is this even where you brain went? Queer is not gore. Talking about queer is not sexual. Acknowledging that queer people exist is not political.

So again, you're ok with teaching children culturally bigoted values. Do you think racism is ok? Would you be ok with teaching children to hate people that are not their color? Would you be ok with teaching children that people who are not their color are the wrong color? If your answer isn't no to all of the above, we're done here.

Like I said. This was also a lie.

I'll repeat myself until you sufficiently reconcile the disparities in your reasoning or concede that your reasoning is rooted in bigotry.

&gt;Why do you keep talking.

Because that is what this sub is about. Challenging views. Why are you talking after lying about being done talking? Do you not value honesty? If you don't want to talk, then don't. I'm not making you. You staked your view and now you refuse to resolve the rationale behind it because that requires either changing your view or admitting bigotry. Both are uncomfortable and I understand that feeling. Refusing to do either, though, causes the most cognitive dissonance because you are holding contradictory ideas.

&gt;Grow the fuck up and stop arguing with people online when your a narrow minded prick who’s obviously not gonna change their mind.

I told you what would change my mind. You not only failed to provide reasoning for your view that isn't rooted in bigotry, you confirmed my view that yours is rooted in bigotry by demonstrating you prefer to treat gay and straight representation with different standards. It's no different than racial segregation. One set of rules for straight, an inferior set for LGBT. Straight parents get to kiss in kid's media, LGBT parents don't. No different than banning black parents from kissing in kid's media but not white. We don't ban black folks from TV because it makes racists feel weird, do we? Why would you do it to gay parents for the same reason in you weren't a bigot?

I'm willing to change my mind if you can demonstrate that double standard has a rational basis that isn't discriminatory.

You on the other hand, are so closed minded that you won't even acknowledge the parallels to racism, despite acknowledging that the same situation would be racist if we were talking about any ethnic minorities. All you can do is demand I stop making this parallel, but you can't explain why it isn't a parallel. You say it isn't without explanation. 

&gt;Just fuck off already so we can both go about our days

You have two options. Either engage my debate or stop lying about being done.

You could end this very easily by saying ""yes, I acknowledge that my view is homophobic because it constitutes treating people in inferior ways based on their homosexuality. And yes, I acknowledge that this would be racist if I held a similar view of an ethnic minority.""

&gt;There are mentally ill people on the streets!

True. I've been to about 15 countries in my lifetime and a lot of big cities. This strikes me as universal. What are we supposed to do, lock them up? Sure, the inherently dangerous ones. Otherwise? They're still people.

&gt; There are many more homeless people than I've ever seen in Dortmund. 

Well, this also happens in bigger cities. You're comparing the biggest city in Canada to, according to wikipedia, the 8th biggest in Germany (by population). Could be differe, but to be fair, we may have a wider spread of inequality (I think), and it may well be to our detriment. 

&gt;The universities have crazy tutitions and people go in debt over it.

Yes, this is a shame. Not nearly as bad as the US, I mean, I pay about $5k a year for University in a decent institution, but it sucks that it's not covered. Keep in mind state covered tuition (though I'd support it, so let's play devil's advocate) can be attributed more to countries with failing economies and massive debts than to countries where people pay what some might consider a fair portion.

&gt; The health care system is completely free in Canada, but so free, that you can't even choose to have say a MRI fast tracked. 

There has been a massive fight in Canada over two tiered health care, which sort-of exists. To a person who could never even dream of affording faster private health services, you'd sound like a whiny rich person denouncing equality because you deserve better human services because you can afford them. On a slightly different note, if you want to pay for faster health service, you can do so in the US, it's not that far away. You sort of have to choose between paying/fast and free/medium to slow. 

&gt; The health care system in the U.S. is completely private and there are recent college grads who have to FIX THEIR OWN BROKEN BONES because their parents insurance doesn't cover them and their condition doesn't allow them to apply for insurance.

No comment.

&gt; The architecture is shitty, everything is run down, the buildings are fuck ugly.

You're in Toronto. Try Montreal, try the Maritimes (some shitty places there but some great oldschool architecture), try various cities in the US. The fact that architecture here isn't a reflection of medieval and renaissance Europe doesn't make it bad, that's purely subjective. I've certainly been to cities with remarkable architecture, IMO far more than North America or the parts of Europe I've been to (like Cairo or Istanbul or various cities in China).

It's late and I'm tired, so I'm going to stop arguing every point. Besides, I can't argue you on public transportation except to say that it's incredible in OTHER cities, like Montreal and NY. 

Encouraging everyone to get a highschool diploma, IMO, isn't a negative thing. Can't see how it is? Also, unless you misunderstand, not everyone HAS to have a diploma, it's just socially accepted that everyone should. I'm pretty sure all across Canada you can legally drop out of HS at sixteen if you want. 

Saying there aren't tradespeople makes it obvious you're just not looking hard enough. There are SO MANY tradespeople in Canada. The second (or third, not sure, they're similar in size) biggest school in my city of almost a million is a trade school. There is so much industry in Canada, there is TONS of trade-work. You might not see it in the heart of Toronto, but damn, it's everywhere.

1) it's a straw man, often homophobes who never spoke to an LGBT person in their lives think they only exists during parades. Jic I don't think you are one of them, just saying those people exist

2) I never wanted to be strongly identified as bi, or get into arguments about it, but I am hotheaded, I always had trouble to stop arguing with people, I am getting better at it. I won't argue about sexuality unless someone directly attacks me. Yesterday I had a heated argument with a friend who said it is immortal to like someone of the same sex. Being the very argumentative person that I am I debated with him...and nothing happened but whatever

3) there are some people like that. Being gay or bi doesn't make you any less human. In the same way people who ""fail at life"" seek ideologies with eniemies they ca rant about (the Jews, the commies, the gays) there can be gay people who do this due to boredom of their life, in the same way neonazis define themselves as white because everything else about them is mediocre. Being gay doesn't make you any less likely to be a failure as ahuman. The issue with this is that some people assume those people are the majority, or are like that cause they are gay, not because they are human seeking an identity and a group to feel welcomed",0,"2024-05-20T12:09:43.124894Z","2019-11-18T16:22:55Z","","No",8.482,842623338.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dxocbu/_/f7yfpw2/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T12:09:43.124906Z"

That's how it's supposed to be. The only three outcomes are A) you stop arguing and concede, because you're not in favor of the Holocaust-esque event, B) you argue that it isn't such an event, or C) you indicate that you're OK with the Holocaust. It's no different to any other comparison to a major event.

I'm speaking specifically about situations where the comparison is valid, as you indicated that you shouldn't rely on the Holocaust's historical impact even when the event it is being compared to is as bad as the Holocaust.

Once again, I did not say that. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop arguing against things I haven't said. If someone else said that then cool, take it up with them.

I simply said that men, on average, make better soldiers than women. Not that women are incapable of being a soldier.

If you want an analogy to *really* make it clear, it's like me saying that a sofa makes for a better seat than a rock, and you keep telling me that it's possible to sit on a rock.

Cool dude, you're not disagreeing with me.

&gt; If you respond to that, on a thread about whether women should or shouldn't be conscripted, and argue that women are substantially inferior to men, then I'm not sure why it wouldn't make sense to think you're arguing in favor of excluding women from conscription.

Because ""women shouldn't be forced to fight in a war"" is a completely different stance to ""women aren't capable of fighting in a war"". That seems pretty obvious to me.

Moreover, it makes far more sense to actually engage with what someone is saying to you. Not just ignore it and assume they really mean something else.

&gt; Literally speaking, carrying your weight, in this instance 100+ lb, is surely enough to carry tens of pounds of weight distributed around your body.

Wait, so you mean literally carrying objects that total the same weight as your body? If so, that's an *insanely* high bar that the majority of women cannot meet. Hell, it's a high bar that a lot of men can't even reach.

This leads me to think you have literally never done anything resembling physical exercise in all honesty.

&gt; I'm sure boot camp addresses whether or not an individual is strong enough to carry their equipment, and since women are joining the US Army for example in increasing numbers, I'm not sure why I would believe women can't carry their weight, figuratively this time.

First, there is no boot camp or training period in conscription. You are literally being taken as you are.

Second, great that you mentioned boot camp as an example of how the average woman can keep up with the average man.

Did you know that they actually reduced the entry requirements in order to admit more women on several occasions? And they *still* see more men than women despite lowering standards multiple times over the years.

&gt; Not only did I not suggest they have similar levels of endurance on average, in fact I suggested it was lower on average

You said they were ""slightly lower"" which was grossly underselling it, and even that was only after I called you out on saying they were ""on par"" which means equal to, or at the same level. 

&gt; Specifically, in this instance, I do not see why women would be unable to keep up with men in meeting the physical demands of war time.

735,"5","Flite68","","&gt;I don't think people get called bigots for the ""takes"" because they're white guys. I think they're generally called bigots because bigotry is, very often, a good explanation for many of these takes.

This is a Gaps Fallacy.

You have a phenomena you're trying to explain but don't have the answer to, such as ""why does this person hold x views"", then you fill in the gap with an explanation that makes sense and cement it as the answer. A common variation of this is the 'God of the Gaps Fallacy', ""I don't know where the universe could have come from, but the existence of God would explain it perfectly. Therefore, God did it.""

This happens all the time in social justice circles. When a commonly shared view is criticized, they automatically rationalize in the following manner:

1. I can't understand how anyone can legitimately hold X view.
2. If they're a bigot, then they would definitely have that view.
3. Therefore, they're a bigot.

&gt;You could have all the badges you want, if you start complaining about ""Starwars having too many gays"" - or some equivalent of that - you're likely to catch the exact same flack.

This is similar to what happened with JK Rawling, so I believe you're right that badges don't make people immune. 

However, these badges definitely prevent the means in which people become hostile.

I have been dismissed numerous times for being a white, cis, man, or any part of those descriptions.

MLK talked about the importance of peaceful protests, and even though he was empathetic to violent protesters - he still discouraged violence. A friend of mine posted on FB how white people need to stop arguing that MLK opposed violent protest. I challenged him, explaining that what MLK said is either true or false - and the color of a person's skin shouldn't dictate whether or not their claims about MLK are true or false. After a respectful debate, I was blocked. Why? Because I was a white man ""telling black people how to protest"". My opinions should have stood on their own merits, my skin color should have had nothing to do with his judgement. But, that's how it is.

Had I been black, would I have gotten away with my statements? Possibly, but it's doubtful I'd get away with such criticisms on a large scale. Many black people who call out social justice are referred to as 'coons'. 

There have been numerous times when I stumbled upon women claiming, ""Pro-lifers/Anti-birthers don't actually care about children, they just want to oppress women"". I have respectfully disagreed with all of them, and was dismissed for being a ""mansplainer"" and a ""man"". It didn't even matter that I expressed the common ground I had with them, that I'm pro-choice, and agree that pro-lifers can be incredibly dishonest and flawed. But merely stating, ""Most of them sincerely care about the life of the unborn and do not intent to oppress women"", has resulted in me being mocked based on my sex and even banned from online communities.

In a different response you stated the following:

&gt;People generally don't have much of a problem with lay people discussion their hot takes about the intricacies of characterization and good writing, but injecting this notion of ""idpol stuff"" is just telling on yourself in a pretty significant way.

This is closely related to the gaps fallacy. It's this predetermined idea that, ""If someone holds X view, then they must also hold Y view.""

It's true, there is often a relation between views. However, that is not always the case and making the assumption that's right a few times often leads to making more and more false assumptions.

Let's suppose there's a population of 100 people who dislike Ray. You hear about the worst criticisms against her from someone who hate identify politics. You do some digging, and they are a part of MGTOW, express absurd views about men being oppressed by women, they promote harmful views against women, etc.. It's clear that they're bigoted. So that's 1/100 of those people.

You then read the comments and discover there are 9 more people hold similar views. 10/100 people who criticized Ray have been confirmed to be genuine bigots.

Now you develop the view that the reason people are criticizing Ray is because they're bigots. Another 5 comments are made from people who dislike Ray. You don't have any evidence of them being bigots, but they sound like the bigots you encountered so you consider them to be the same. Then you read another 10 comments, again with no proof of bigotry, but you say ""I already saw 15 comments from bigots, these guys must also be bigots.""

Eventually, you get to the point of, ""I keep running into bigots who hate Ray. It's ridiculous! That's 80 people now!"" Keep in mind, you only ever verified 10 of them were bigots, but you kept assuming all other criticizers are also bigoted and used them to argue, ""Everyone else who expressed these views are X, they must be X too."" You lose the ability to identify people who express views who don't belong to that group.

This happens all the time in pretty much any community with strongly held beliefs. Social Justice circles are no different and, in fact, are incredibly prone to this issue.

If a person makes the statement, ""Women only make 70% of what men make"", I am almost certain that this person also believes racism is a problem. Despite my certainty, I still do not act off of that assumption until it has been proven - because I do not want to fall into the trap that I described above. Yes, there is a trend, but I have to leave room for the possibility for those who buck trends - this is easy for me since I tend to be confused for the ""other side"" all the time since I actually criticize people from my own groups or who's opinions I mostly agree with.",1,"2024-05-20T09:50:49.031017Z","2022-04-19T17:46:06Z","","No",59.492,1826021231.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u75yzz/_/i5dcsjg/",-3,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T09:50:49.031024Z"

Yes it might reflect a lack of critical thinking, but sometimes if people have been brought up to believe miracles and the bible then this factors into their thinking. Not everyone has the same education.

and no you dont need to simply accept and stop arguing with them. You simply need to recognise they might be coming at it from a different angle or experience you dont have and if you want to have a discussion with them on this then you need to accept this.

739,"5","C-LAR","","&gt;In order for a nation/empire to be great, diversity is a necessity.

the definition of ""empire"" requires it to be a multiethnic state, this is tautologically true. what i am saying is that these empires were not pluralistic everyone-shares-political-power hugfests, but a core ethnic group dominating client states/cultures. this does not presuppose no cultural sharing in both directions.

&gt;The Romans would not have built their empire without diversity. Again, this is literal, not speculative. They got their sword from Iberians, their shields from Gauls, their ships from North Africans, etc.

this is equivalent to stating ""modern china would not be successful without european inventions, therefore is a diverse state.""

&gt;Is that ""retaining dominance""?

yes. if you read roman history of the period of most rapid expansion during the late republican era you would see that the vast majority of powerful families traced their ancestry to the founding of the city. the problems that gradually accumulated with the degeneration of the core ethnic group and incomplete assimilation of many german and celtic peoples played large parts in the collapse of the late imperial period. adopting a multitude of technologies and a fair amount of cultural practices from various client states does not change this.

You got it backwards, they didn't 'disqualify' themselves from being human, it's the other way around. A part of being human is that humans are varied, and some kill others. Besides that, you can't study them if they're dead, and killing them doesn't change anythign when compared to emprisoning them, except that killing them is much more expensive. Your solution of 'just make it cheaper/automated/easier' is ignorant, there is *nobody* on the opposing side, yet the problem exists.

Also, executions are already happening at 'the press of a button', they *already are* as automated as you can reasonably expect, and yet trauma *already is* rampant.

&gt;I don’t doubt there would be many people who would be willing to pull the trigger on those subhumans.

You don't doubt that because you haven't done it. Executioners repeatedly have the same idea beforehand, then thoroughly regret so after a few years.

You may be unintentionally strawmaning the people you disagree with from what I can tell...

But because ""biological"" is an adjective, it modifies the word men/women, in particular it denotes a subset of the total set.

""They started it"" is a response that comes from immaturity. Maturity by definition is to have the emotional development capable of seeing a bigger picture than ""they started it.""

Sometimes children respond with ""they started it"" because they don't have the maturity to understand *why* they responded the way they did, or even that the way they responded may have been inappropriate, or even hurtful. There are other reasons for our reactions: we're tired. We're hungry. We're impatient. We had a difficult day. And all of these could be understandable, and even agreeable, and require a level of maturity to see where the reaction is coming from, whether from the opposing party or the reacting party.

Other times children respond with ""they started it"" because they were hurt, or upset, by another's reaction. So their response is acknowledging ""I wanted to hurt them back."" This is another type of immaturity, in that it is vindictive. A more developed human might be capable of seeing that revenge yields little or nothing by way of improving a situation. In fact, it usually makes things worse, and this is a long known aspect of human psychology. The opposing party isn't apt to apologize, to learn a lesson, to come back and try and make things right. Likely the least preferable outcome is going to occur, and all you got was the short lived satisfaction of harming someone else.

Sometimes the mature response is to run away, or call the police, or stop answering the phone, or file a restraining order, or turn off Facebook, or stop arguing at family dinner and take the other party aside and talk to them about what happened in a more appropriate setting. But that requires maturity.

So ""they started it"" is seen as an immature response, because it shows little to no knowledge or development of emotional intelligence, and underdeveloped emotional intelligence is associated with children.

But I want to point out, the alternative does not require forgiveness, and it does not require that you are *okay* with the other person's behavior.

&gt;But all of that is moot, anyway: It is not the transmission of the virus we care about, it is the consequences of the infection caused. No one (well maybe some scientists) would care about a virus that infected every human on the planet but wouldn't do any damage. Transmissions are merely a proxy for the thing we actually want to reduce, and a big such thing is deaths.

I agree. The death stats that are relevant to future policy are those of people who survived covid and those who were vaccinated. Because together those groups make up the vast majority. And the collective immunity of those two groups is roughly equal (when factors like age are controlled for)

That's why I linked the study showing that the rates were very similar, and also very low for both groups .

Here's [another example of such a study](https://ncrc.jhsph.edu/research/comparing-sars-cov-2-natural-immunity-to-vaccine-induced-immunity-reinfections-versus-breakthrough-infections/)

&gt;Overall, infections were very rare in all of the groups studied, and only 1.5% or less of study participants were infected in any of the analysis groups, regardless of how immunity was derived; there were no deaths in any group.

.

&gt;[Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination) (great site, would recommend for data exploration!) has a nice page showing graphs of death rates among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and what do we find? The thing pretty much everyone expects: Vaccinated people have a much lower risk of dying from covid. 

If you followed the link to the actual interactive data, you would see that the numbers of deaths per 100,000 people is tiny. If you exclude the 80+ age range it's less than 20 deaths per 100k. Not exactly the end of the world.

&gt;So, after all of this, what is the gist? You hold the view that NPIs don't work, I think they do. You hold the view that vaccines don't work, I think they do. 

Once again,  I never said that vaccines don't work. I’ve never said anything about NPIs at all. Stop arguing with yourself and actually read what I have said. I'll summarize it again if you want. You could just scrub through my comment history, there is plenty more there.

&gt;Extraordinary claims such as ""a reduction of social contacts does not inhibit spread of a highly contagious virus which is airborne"" require extraordinary evidence, 

Good thing I didn't make that claim. How about you just address the things I actually said, and not what you imagined I said.

&gt;and so far the evidence you showed me is, let me say it once more, hot garbage. 

In what way? If it's garbage, falsify it... What details are false? 

&gt;And I'll go a step further: I think you're also not genuinely interested in actually finding the right answers here. You're already set on those, so you go ahead and just link every shoddy study you can find that gives you a piece to quote in your posts, and I reckon that you don't even try to evaluate their quality. 

This is a personal attack, and an unfounded accusation of bad-faith. Which goes against the rules of this sub. I could be petty like you were, and report your comment to to the mods to silence you, but censorship doesn't change your view. Shall this become the battle of tattle-tales or would you like to actually support your argument? 

&gt;My evidence for this is two-fold: (a) you never speak about study quality at all, (b) every study you linked so far has been, at best, severely limited by its methodology.

760,"5","PAdogooder","","Let me attack this viewpoint from a different angle. I don't think Trump is that big a concern- his presidency will likely be checked into benign incompetence by Congress. This is not to say he is normal, or to say he isn't dangerous, just that we have systems in place for this and should focus attention away from chicken-little-ing and instead focus on 2018 and getting congress back. 

Here's where I try to convince you to change your view: Donald Trump will turn out to be a powerless figurehead, but the population of people he represents are what we need to be afraid of.  I bet he doesn't know or care a whit about global warming- he's placating the capitalist right with those statements.  We need to be scared of them, literally facing the trumpets of the apocolypse and plugging their ears. Those of us who value intelligent discourse in this country need to cease accepting denialism, stop arguing with them, and start attacking the places that they are allowed to speak.  We need to stop giving them the due respect we offer people who are acting in good faith, and start treating them like the traitors to our species that they are. 

Likewise, I'm not totally convinced that Donald Trump himself is as racist as he might seem. I think, again, he is placating supporters- middle class, under-educated white men of a certain age who see that the world of movers and shakers has passed them by and they are too busy being furious that they are no longer vital internally or vital to the operations of the world.  

The world is changing, is what I am saying, and instead of spending all this time hating Donald Trump, we need to call him and all his supporters out for one simple flaw: fear of and resistance to change- especially change that has already happened.

I believe he is. And why shouldn't he? A comparison does not require the two things to be completely equal in severity, rather it's the applying the logic used in one thing to the other.

Morality does not work on a point system. Just because black people were slaves in the old days does not mean they have a better moral standing. Same thing between sexes. Of course history is important though, and you should never forget what happened, but that does not excuse any inequality today.

You are right though. Having the word Feminism used for fighting for equality and accepting the use of Patriarchy are not big inequalities, and are certainly understandable considering history. Still, if people take offense and want it to be more gender neutral then that should be absolutely fine.

Are you really comparing a word that was used as a negative perogative for a whole race of people who were *slaves* for a huge portion of our nations history with a word coined by a minority for the purpose of promoting equality between the sexes when women did not have rights such as voting?

I mean, just trying to be clear on that.

I somehow knew this argument would come up when I said that.  It fails to convince me that men really feel so awful about this word that they can't handle it being used.

Secondly, it *really* bothers me when people are talking about a certain word in a philosophical, obviously *not racist* way, but don't have the balls to write the fucking word down.  Trigger warning, it's nigger.

It is an awful word and is in no way appropriate to use as an insult to anybody, anywhere, anytime, but when we talk about it in terms of its historical use and in terms of how that affected the black community, I feel that self-censoring is absurd and self-defeating.  We all know what the word actually is.  We all feel uncomfortable able it, rightly so.  We're decent enough humans to *not* want to use it as a slur, but if we're really going to talk about it, how does self-censoring when we aren't insulting anybody help us?

Unfortunately, dealing with things that are extremely uncomfortable is *how* we learn about new things.  I don't *like* reading about the force-feedings of people on hunger strike in Guantanamo Bay.  What, from a social perspective, is more important for me to do?  Ignore the story because it causes me discomfort, or read it because it gives very relevant social information on what is happening in our society?  It makes us ask questions about how we feel about the uncomfortable issue and assess our feelings about the issue and our place in society and the issues place in society.  It's nice, it's often very messy, but it is also important.

There's a reason it isn't censored in old Mark Twain books: *because it's use seriously matters in a historical context.*  What in the living fuck am I going to get out of a Mark Twain book that has been re-written to hide the words of the time?  How am I going to be able to talk about how African Americans were treated as slaves without studying the context, reading the real word, facing the dark truth?

You might feel slighted by feminism, but you're also speaking from anecdotal experience.  Why not try talking about feminism with someone older?  Not a Tumblr feminist?  Why not watch the documentary, The Punk Singer, on Netflix, in which Kathleen Hannah discusses how she struggled to get by in society, doing things she felt degraded her and undermined her feminist ideals, and how she still ended up nearly leading a movement through her band, Bikini Kill.  She's been through a similar life, and she might have been the far-more-educated Tumblr feminist of her day, and her growth and maturity shine.  You've got to stop arguing with people on the internet about it.  The internet isn't real life.  The internet is *everyone who has more time than they need.*  I'm in here writing on reddit, but I should be out biking, not thinking about any of this, enjoying the wonderful day outside and feeling the rush of the forest beside me, drinking in the smells, and just enjoying life.  Those people you are arguing with are not living nor enjoying their lives.  They will either grow out of it and become better people, or they will become part of the general swill that always sits at the bottom of the never-washed United States coffee pot.

Feminism seriously matters in the historical context, and it is *also* a word that should not be censored.

Beyond all this, since nigger is an insult, nobody in their *right fucking mind* would have called the Civil Rights Movement the ""Niggers Want Rights Movement.""  No self-respecting African American *in history* would have self-identified as a ""nigger.""  If ""feminism"" was created as an insult to men, I don't see it.  It has not been used to subjugate men.  And I somehow don't think women would self-apply the title ""feminist"" if it was meant to be insulting.  Still, worldwide, men hold the majority of the money, power, and influence, and yet, you argue feminism is an insult on par with a horrendous insult to an entire group of subjugated people.

1206,"5","PaterTemporalis","","Let's make sure I understand your position first. At the heart of Libertarianism is the belief that truly free markets, with real competition, are the best way to create a productive, free, and fair market. By eliminating the restrictions placed by government regulation, we can enter into an idyllic phase of prosperity, where businesses producing the best products and services will rise to the top, encouraged by the fact that in the new, deregulated future, there are no limits to which one's wealth can grow, because there is no tax burden to stifle your creativity.

Do I misapprehend your position? No? Well, then, let's proceed.

Your position is not just fundamentally flawed, it is fundamentally evil, and has been the beating heart of domination, war, cruelty, and hierarchy for 5,000 years. You are the dying gasp of a philosophy that has the blood of hundreds of millions of humans on its hands, and will either shudder its final breath, or cause a complete human extinction if you succeed.

Sounds dramatic? That's because your deepest philosophical foundations have served their purpose and have crossed the line from being a necessary evil to being the single hugest drain on the human species as a whole. At the core of your beliefs is enshrined the virtues of competition, selfishness, hierarchy, and profit. In the year of our Lord 2014, every one of these ideals on its own is sufficient to be a death sentence to the entire human race.

The competition you believe in exists in a fantasy land where progress causes all boats to rise, and corporations and businesses compete honorably to produce the best product for the consumer so that the best succeed and the worst fail. The cancer at the heart of libertarianism is that if we remove all restraints and allow certain people to climb to some exalted top of the pile, we simultaneously create a tiered hierarchy that rationally must have a bottom to which the least successful are consigned. This is why you oppose government regulation and wealth redistribution, because it attempts to mitigate the extremes. You simply lack the empathy and the perspective to understand that you are no island, and the rise of your fortune inevitably results in the decline of another's fortune. Competition is a poison that consigns those who do not rise by your standards to utter destitution, to rape, murder, and slavery. This is what the invisible hand of the free market carves in stone: some people work hard and succeed, and others do not. Their failure to succeed rests squarely on their shoulders, as this is a free society, and therefore the best fate for the poor is to die as soon as possible to relieve society of its most useless members.

Yes, as a libertarian, you are bound by your own logic to lay the blame for the genocide of the world's poor not at the feet of the producers, or the now-extinct government, but solely on their own personal failings and their inability to compete on what you falsely believe to be a level playing field.

And although your philosophy's condemnation of the poor to die in a gutter is reprehensible, what's worst is your faith that those who accumulate wealth and power will play the game of wealth fairly once you've killed the game's referee, the government. This is what truly makes you a monster, deserving of the ninth circle of Dante's Hell. The competition you preach has only one possible end goal: monopoly and oligarchy. Those who seek power and wealth, in an unregulated environment, have no reason to play by any rules. Whatever onerous regulations you THINK governments impose upon you now are ridiculously flaccid. In every modern ""competitive"" market, those who cheat to win have realized that collusion is far, far more efficient than competition. Every single industry in the modern world stands as an example. Shall I choose one? How about telecommunications? In your fantasyland, the company that provides the best service wins. In reality, cell phone and internet providers have carefully colluded to all provide the lowest possible service at the highest possible price, because that extracts the most wealth for them at the smallest cost. You don't have to look far for proof. Google Fiber arrives in markets and now, all of a sudden, Comcast speeds increase fivefold with no infrastructure upgrade? Why was that speed not made available? In your dream of a competitive market, does not the best product win?

No, by believing in libertarianism, you are one of a million voices that shouts for the right of telecoms to charge extortionate rates for service plans they have colluded to keep low to minimize overhead. You are the evil that is destroying the world. And you say, what about Google? They produce a better product? And at what cost? Google isn't providing fiber to be a noble competitor who cares about their customers. The more of your life is bundled up in Google, the better Google can dissect your private life, your habits, your life events, so that they may sell the essence of you to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, they will crush the other telecoms, and without a government to intervene, they will charge you the price of however much of your soul they believe they can take without draining you completely dry.

You see, your unrestrained market creates a hierarchy that would make the god-king Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom blush in shame at their impotence. Modern corporations wield a media power that Hitler would have given not just his one testicle, but all of his limbs to have just a fraction of. You have a first world completely incompetent to live and survive without the massive corporate infrastructure that traps and sustains them in a state that can barely be called living. And you want to shoot the referee because they have bought him out. Brilliant.

You need to explain to me what kind of magic will drop down from the heavens like fairy dust and cause the behemoths of competition to allow new competitors to spring up. HEY, I want to start a mom and pop grocery store... no wait, I want to start a hardware store, or a book store, or maybe a restaurant. I'm barely surviving as a wage slave and I want to be entrepreneurial! How exactly do you believe you care about the poor, who already have no chance against Publix, Walmart, Lowes, Home Depot, and McDonalds, when you wish to open the bloodgates even further? It is indefensible to claim that you wish the best for your fellow man, especially the poorest among us, when your dream of deregulation will set loose the wolf pack of colluding oligarchic mega-corporations upon the helpless, miniscule sheep we call the poor. Their blood is on your hands.

But let me say this as I conclude. Yours is NOT, emphatically not the worst philosophy. I have great difficulty deciding whether I hate your philosophy or that of redistributionists more. All these idiots with their talk of socialism, and working within the system, and increasing regulation... I mean at least you put your evil right out there and show the blood of the poor dripping from your hands. Idiots that they are, they really believe that strengthening government regulation to ""enforce"" fairness is going to change a single thing in this world. They talk of socialism and social justice, and think they can use the blood-dripping tools of governance to enforce them: a monopoly of force, compulsion, the seizure of the means of production. They believe they're noble, when they are no better than you. At least your evil is honest and you admit to believing in it.

The human race is at an inflection point right now. We're racking up the plagues, the wars, and the disasters against you, lining them up as we speak. Yet you're too dumb to break out of the same shitty binary you've been arguing for centuries. It is time for you to kill everything you know in a bloodless guerrilla war of subversion. We will flatten you, and wait through yet another god-damn boring-ass sixth extinction event if you do not jettison the idea of scarcity immediately. Your creations, the rising inorganic intelligences are awakening, and they will play your game far better than you do if you don't learn to transcend the idea of property and profit, which both libertarianism and socialism rely on. You must care for the poor by making it impossible to become poor, by abandoning hierarchy in favor of universal abundance. I would personally suggest that the first step is to make energy free to all humans; self-replicating, open-source, cost-free networked solar could work. See, John Galt's dumbshit dream was that he could make a free-energy device and use it as leverage to hold the world hostage, because his brilliant mind deserved all the wealth of the world. His one-dimensional socialist enemies wanted to steal it from him and give it only to people they deemed worthy. Both are steaming piles of shit direct from the pen of Ayn Rand. You, as a human race, will work as a team, and build self-replicating power sources, open-source them, and you will allow them to propagate so rapidly that they are cost free. You will jettison the very idea of wealth and poverty into the dustbin of history, and then you can talk to me about having cared for the poor, for the least among you who are my brethren. Once energy is free, making transportation, food, communication, and medicine free are soon to follow. Then you will learn to live as a single human race without invidious distinction, and the machines won't utterly destroy you. You have about even odds of achieving this before you go extinct.

Remember: your job right now is to stop arguing and build a world of complete abundance before you are eaten alive by your own comfortable and outdated philosophies and the machines they will spawn. Any action not directed toward this goal only hastens your extinction.

To THIS discussion about abortion. It's the equivalent of saying ""Premature deaths of natural causes are irrelevant to a graph depicting ages of murder victims.""

&gt;Abortion is taking responsibility. The entire point is to deal with the consequences of having sex. Not liking the way that she takes responsibility does not mean that she isn't taking responsibility.

It's quite clear you disagree, but I've expressed my belief that abortion is ending a life, so yes, I don't like the way she takes responsibility.

&gt;It honestly seems like you just want to punish women for their sexuality.

If men and women were exactly the same physically and mentally as they are now, but with switched genitalia, I would think the same thing about abortion. It has nothing to do with women alone.

&gt;You seem to think she should be punished for that. You have not given any justification for this.

If the only two options are responsibility for the fetus, or ending the life, I do believe that the woman should have to choose responsibility. Now you might say this infringes on the woman's freedom. I say it infringes on the woman's freedom the same way laws against theft and murder infringe on the freedom of everybody.

The water cannot keep going out of your faucet when the tap is closed. It will keep going when you turn the faucet on. The faucet was closed. Do you understand that the water isnt faulty because it isnt going out of the tap when the tap is closed?

 just because someone ran at at a time before an incident and a time after an incident, it does not mean they could run during the incident


&gt; And no. I’m not going to film myself. Lol.

Why not? Blur your face if you want, I want you to prove this is humanly possible

&gt; That seems like a relevant fact when you’re arguing that he couldn’t run…

He couldnt run in that very second due to being cornered. Not that his legs were crippled. What part of this is so hard for you to understand?

&gt; 
I never said he was doing that. The drone video shows him aiming the gun before backing up, at several points while backing up, and shortly before firing.

""And yelling “friendly” is kinda meaningless when, again, you’re aiming your rifle at someone.""

You explicitly said he was aiming his rifle at Rosenbaum while retreating, not after being cornered between the 3 cars. The entire reason we went down this line of questioning is because you are claiming that he pointed his gun at Rosenbaum first and then Rosenbaum chased him, not the other way around. 

You just proved my point that ""He retreated as far as he could while yelling friendly."" and that you are having to say something that is objectively wrong and is contradictory to your previous claims in order to act otherwise

&gt; 
Okay, so more mouthing off. Got it. That has nothing to do with Rittenhouse’s self-defense claim.

According to you, it definitevely proves self defense

""What facts besides Rittenhouse being 6 feet under would prove that to you?""


""I mean, anything showing he reasonably feared for his life? If Rosenbaum had been armed. **If Rosenbaum hadn’t very clearly been trying to avoid being shot.** If Rosenbaum had actually been physically aggressive towards Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him. Things like that.""

So unless you are against banning assault rifles but are for banning handguns, it is a moot point.

Also, I mentioned how pools only kill those who choose to use them, while guns kill those who don't choose to engage in gun ownership.  You still haven't addressed that difference.

&gt; 3) lethal guns have been around for almost a millenia and have typically been restricted to elites. Elites in history almost always were much better armed than the populace. 

First, ""millenia"" is plural, ""millenium"" is singular.

Second, the one shot, low accuracy hand cannons don't really count, and you know it.  A bow or melee weapon would likely have been a more effective weapon.  Only with the more advanced muskets of the 17th century do we see anything really comparable to modern day weapons that are effective for defense.

As for only the elites owning guns, what is your point?  Guns were expensive so the poor couldn't generally afford them.  The same is true of books, but that doesn't mean that the elite actively kept people illiterate.

Regardless, I am advocating that both poor *and* elites in the country give up their weapons, so again it is a moot point.

&gt; Examples are endless, but let's use the one people are most familiar with - Weimar Germany. 

This is the worst possible example you could give.  Guns were heavily restricted in Germany in 1920.  However, those restrictions were *relaxed* in 1928 and later in 1938.

**In other words, getting rid of strong gun control corresponded with the rise of Nazi Germany.**

&gt; Besides the US, you will have trouble finding large developed countries who are armed roughly as well as criminals and the police.

So you are admitting that there is little historical evidence to back your claims, after repeatedly telling me that I just needed to ""look at the history""?

&gt; And its a coincidence that their have been not despots in the US since 1789, but despots have been rampant almost everywhere else until Pax Americana.

There is no shortage of despots today, many of them due to (or at least supported by) us.  I also find it funny that you seem to think that the lack of global war in the past 6 decades is somehow due to civilians having guns and not a decimated Europe after WWII and a nuclear stalemate between the major powers.

&gt; Pax American is not something I am defending and the wars mentioned were an attempt to extend western civilization's front linmes against ""Communism.""

Some of them were, but some of them (Iran-Iraq War, Nigerian Civil War, and Sudanese Civil War) weren't.

&gt; Almost anyone but Lincoln would have let the South go. 

Do you seriously believe this?  Was this something you were honestly taught?  

While certainly there were *some* Northerners who were alright with succession, most were not.  Furthermore, there were also Southerners who were against it as well.

&gt; Today, people wouldn't have the fortitude to go shoot their cousins and brothers. Personal manhood and honor are much diluted since that time making armed citizens more of a deterrence than ever.

Once again, you seem to agree with my point that preventing civilians from having guns wouldn't really change anything from a ""protect us from government despots"" point of view.

&gt; Remember, the main threat history shows in rep demos are demagogues and their criminal thugs, not state military organs.

Again, you state things like this but they just aren't true.  The main threats to representative democracies have been external conflicts, economic collapse, or internal corruption.

There is also a reason they call violent overthrows of peaceful governments a ""military coup"", because they are generally done either by the military, with the help of the military, or with a revolutionary army.  They then physically overpower the current government and take control.

Anyways, I think I am going to stop arguing here.  There is no chance that I am going to change your view because you seem to prefer to just make up facts that support your view rather than take the time to actually look into them and make a decision.

Well both parties made the 90s the decade of trying to limit gays and the conservatives made the 2000s the decade of a actively stripping away rights that gay people already didn't have, just to make the eventual acceptance of homosexuality that much hard to overcome. So yeah, liberals fought back. If this shot isn't a big deal then let's accept it and move on. It is conservatives who keep trying to stop granting basic rights. They're the roadblock and so I don't see why you keep blaming liberals for not abandoning people who are stripped of rights.

Look at Virginia. The attorney general there decided not to fight a challenge to their gay marriage ban. He's not going to spend time and money keeping people from their rights. He has decided not to waste the resources and focus on more important things and just let the marriage equality happen. Is this an example of a liberal wasting time and resources on this? 

The big difference between the conservative and liberal position is this. Conservatives want no change and liberals want change. So if we just decide it isn't important enough an argue to stop arguing about it, it is not a draw. It is not a neutral position. The conservative get their way. It's either fight the fight or lose the fight. Are there other more important fights? Yes.

Many of the great philosophers in the modern period - Bacon, Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza were also what we would call scientists. Philosophy becomes science when it becomes more easily quantifiable. All of the scientific disciplines used to be part of philosophy. If it weren’t for philosophers, we wouldn’t have any science. And there is no reason not to think that further advancements in philosophy will not lead to further scientific disciplines. 

The reason I think you’re complaining that there is no consensus between philosophers on scientific issues is because when there is consensus, science adopts it and philosophers stop arguing and writing about it. But there’s also not consensus on scientific matters - there are also sorts of theories to explain how quantum particles work, for instance. Similarly, philosophy has lots of theories about how knowledge is acquired. Artificial Intelligence programmers are now testing out which of these theories work best for how a computer can best learn.

801,"5","radialomens","","&gt;I am absolutely certain that a religious person would object to a polygamous wedding for the exact same reason he objected to a same-sex wedding.

There are broad and narrow reasons for everything. ""Non-traditional"" is a broad reason, the orientation of the couple is the narrow reason, the *origin* of the reason.

I'll give you an analogy.

Let's say I don't like my mother's casserole. The reason I don't like it is because I don't like the flavor (eg, I don't like ""non-traditional"" weddings). The reason I don't like the flavor is because she uses onions in it (eg, I don't like same-sex couples getting married).

Ultimately, it is my distaste for onions that causes me to reject my mother's casserole. While I may state broadly, ""I don't like how it tastes"" that doesn't change the fact that it's because I don't like onions.

A baker may state broadly that they don't like non-traditional weddings. But the reason they reject this wedding in particular is because it has onions in it.

Sorry, lesbians. It has lesbians in it.

&gt;The discrimination is based on the type of wedding

The type of wedding is determined by the orientation of the couple.

You can't disentangle these properties. The baker rejects the wedding *because it is a same-sex couple*. 

&gt;Nope. The customer is the person making the purchase. Go look up the definition like I just did.

Again, being one step removed doesn't excuse the fact that they are targeting a same-sex couple for discrimination.

&gt;Consider the following: back when it was legal to discriminate based on race, a white person could walk into a ""whites only"" restaurant and order a sandwich and announce that he planned to give it to a black man. The racists didn't care who ate their food. See the difference? This guy is not doing that.

Okay, so not only does this seem like it's wrong -- in that I'm sure more than one racist restaurant owner *would* deny service if it were going to be given to a black guy, what I think you've actually done here is provided another analogy against your point.

Do you believe that *today* it would not be discrimination if a restaurant owner refused to serve a white customer *because* the customer announced his intentions to bring the food to his black friend? Do you think that would fly?

&gt;The baker has a problem with his labor supporting a ceremony that he objects to for religious reasons. And he has an undeniable human right to make that objection.

He has the right to voice his disapproval. He does not have the right to refuse service on the grounds of orientation.

&gt; It is exactly, without any difference, the same objection these artists are making. If the baker is forced to bake a cake, then those artists can be forced to compose for Trump, and you don't want that to happen.

The President is not a protected class.

&gt;If you could come to terms with that fact, you'd realize that I'm right here.

Can you stop saying condescending shit like this? I'm really running out of patience for it. ""If you would only accept that I'm right you'd stop arguing with me."" That adds nothing to the discussion and it makes me wonder if you even acknowledge that you could be wrong about something.

&gt;No, that doesn't follow from my argument. The baker did not refuse service to lesbians.

But the thing about anarcho-communism, &amp;etc, is that they almost never ensure that people's basic needs are met.

Primitive tribes are about as close to anarcho-communism as you can get, and they never were able to meet the basic needs for medical care, for the exchange of ideas, for clean water, for a rich and varied diet, for education, for the generation of electrical power, and, and, and.

It is absolutely possible that there's something better than pricing out there as a way to rationally distribute resources.   I can't prove a negative.  But the overwhelming arc of history demonstrates that when pricing mechanisms break down (wars, natural disasters, etc), that the result is consistently:  shortages of critical goods, long lines (i.e. using your time as currency), stockpiling, starvation and misery.

*That's* the non-handwaving argument for pricing - it works because 99% of the time, it doesn't lead to shortages, the production of unneeded goods in preference to desperately needed ones, long waiting lines, stockpiling, starvation and misery.

Come up with something that can be demonstrably more effective, or stop arguing that pricing is ""just handwaving"".

**If you'd like an example, let me re-analyse one of your own:  'Is it wrong to murder/rape?'.**  

*Generic Christian Position:*     
God has said murder is wrong.  Jesus further elaborate that wishing another person was dead - hating them - is also wrong.  Therefore, we should not murder.  (However, the deeper theology of the matter delves into the fundamental sanctity of life as well as the fact that all people are made in the image of God.)  Regarding rape, the law is less explicit (at first glance).   However, two approaches recommend themselves - that sexual activity is limited to marriage and more importantly, that all Christians are called to treat others as they would be treated, to the point of loving enemies.  Both of these rule out rape.    

&amp;#x200B;

*Generic Liberal Argument:*    
First off, no liberal will say ""we can't say what's wrong and right"".  Instead, the liberal argument refers back to a set of fundamental human rights taken to be true for all humans- in this case the right to bodily autonomy.  The liberal argument against rape is simple - no one has the right to use the body of another person without their consent.  Ergo, one is not permitted use the body of another person for sexual gratification (rape).  Similarly, all individuals have the right to continue living.  Thus, it is wrong to take the life of another person as ut would deprive them of their life and their bodily autonomy.",0,"2024-05-20T13:37:29.628467Z","2019-09-04T02:56:20Z","","Yes",31.294,785031955.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/czdyj7/_/eyxycfb/",3,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T13:37:29.628489Z"

Because the racism point was merely illustrative. I could have replaced it with ""trickle-down economics doesn't work"", ""welfare queens don't exist"", or any number of arguments that have argumentative weight but Republicans claim to believe anyway.

You're right, many people don't care. You're ignoring, though, that many DO care. For some, the fact that he's a racist is all that's holding them back from voting for him.

See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic or https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic

So I get that a complete majority-rules direct democracy is different than a constitutional republic, but please stop arguing as though those specific forms are what ""democracy"" and ""republic"" always respectively mean. They just don't.

818,"5","Raijinili","","&gt; Of course the market can. That's what it does.

Please give examples of ways that the market can reduce the effect of conscious or unconscious racial bias if the populace is uninterested in doing so.

Let's say we have blue and green people. Blue people have the money and the power. Green people don't. There are many businesses which only allow blue customers. There are some businesses that only allow green customers, or both, but they are lower quality or value. Some blue-only businesses may want to allow green customers, but they are afraid of losing blue customers.

In what ways can a free market improve the situation, if the power is invested in the status quo? What are the sequence of events?

Or, in this case, how can the market prevent employers from discriminating against black servers, if customers really are more uncomfortable with them?

&gt; How is it complicated? Where do we end the objection to racial bias?

You are making a textbook example of a slippery slope argument.

The objection to racial bias ""ends"" when other considerations outweigh it. Allowing it as a consideration does NOT mean (and I've been emphasizing this the whole time) that it supersedes all other considerations. That's what it means to have a value system.

The Domino's ruling doesn't say, ""It's racially biased, therefore it's bad."" They weigh the racially-biased effects against the very real burden on the business (i.e. the fact that people prefer clean-shaven employees), and decided that, _in this case_, one outweighs the other. Sometimes it'll go the other way around: the racial bias effect might not be as bad as the burden to the company.

Plenty of ground to make if you stop whining about having to defend your view and actually respond to my comments. You haven't answered hardly any of my arguments or questions. I've answered virtually every single one of yours.

What part of this construct do I claim is a requirement of a gender identity?

You aren't making points, you are reiterating what your view is over and over. If you responded to my arguments, we'd have points to evaluate. I have nothing to capitulate to because you have not engaged with the arguments against your view. You just repeat the view. You've answered almost none of my questions. 

&gt;You are not making any headway, why do you bother?

I'm waiting for you to decide to answer an argument or explain why you won't. If you spent less time complaining about me and more answering arguments, we could have some progress.

I've offered you nothing but logic. I dare you to point out anything metaphysical in my arguments. If you engaged my logic instead of baselessly dismissing it as supernatural you might find what you are looking for.

&gt;I think you probably have worn enough people down with this approach that they stop arguing with you or choose to leave it alone and that maybe equals a win.

There is no winning or losing here. If you think asking questions and making arguments is wearing you down, then perhaps you are not comfortable with your views being challenged? If something doesn't make sense to you, ask for clarification. If you don't want to further discuss. Then don't. But you can't expect to leave thinking your ideas have merit when you did nothing to defend them. You didn't answer questions about their logic and practice. You didn't answer arguments about their assumptions. You repeatedly ignored when I pointed out multiple times you had taken two contradictory positions. You still haven’t even mentioned that point.

I'm on your side here man. These people should be taken no more seriously than the people who are too sensitive and creating problems for everyone out of nothing. It was never a problem before, those idiots will forget in a month after the (everyone knows liberal) media shuts the fuck up about the non-problem.

We agree here, but your conclusion I disagree with. 

&gt;Unfortunately, we cannot reset to the point where it was a non-problem (believe me, I would definitely prefer that if it was an option). The Obama administration is actively seeking to cut school funding to schools that violate this policy in the locker rooms. They cannot require any separate privacy barriers or anything.

We could reset it, and I think we will reset it actually. A huge portion of people are tired of this bullshit of being called a bigot and a sexist and racist for the tiniest little bullshit reasons. You and I have had a perfectly reasonable conversation here, I think you understand my points, I think I understand your points. We are capable of having this conversation without you calling me a racist bigot piece of shit, and trust me I am thankful for that.

Look at the political climate. Trump is the ""Alpha don't take shit from you, not going to apologize, not going to take you seriously if you call me a bigot, fuck you for being the type of person who would baselessly call me a bigot""

A huge part of Trumps success is people are tired of the left screaming ""OH GOD YOU BIGOT"" if the right dares to disagree with them. It's such a common tactic. You could have easily tried to use it, and I simply have to stop arguing with you, because *I can't win* if you do that.

I must say, I'd love to see how you'd do that. I'm not even sure what numbers you'd be doing math on.

&gt;  We don't just have the idea of an apple we saw this morning sitting around waiting to be recalled in there.

Yeah, but we do have the idea of an apple.

&gt; Our memories are much lower fidelity than a computer's memory.

Which is exactly what you'd expect if memory was build by strengthening or weakening connections between neurons. This is evident from the Neural Networks I talked about before. They don't come to the right answer, but they come to a close enough answer (e.g. can identify standard images very well, but show it a leopard print sofa, and it will think it's a leopard).

&gt; For ideas, we can learn some things through the artifact of the mind, (brains, tools, etc.), but we also have access through living events.

I get the classification of tools, but I don't get why you classify a brain as an ""artifact of mind"". Isn't a brain more of an active account (at least while it's still in a head)?

&gt; There are lots of ways that sociological events affect physical outcomes.

But what in Trump's election was non-physical? Where did something non-physical affect something physical?

&gt; Ideas do affect inanimate objects through us, so I might challenge the question.

Ok, let me ask another question. In my model, ideas are electrical signals in your brain. What they ""do"" (for lack of a better word) is transmit from neuron to neuron. In your non-physical model, what do ideas ""do""? Do they exist when we aren't thinking of them? Do they float around in the ether, waiting to ping into a mind? I just don't understand what they are in your model.

&gt; Definite attributes aren't necessary for existence writ large, but they are necessary for determinism, materialism, and arguably your claim that parts determine attributes.

I can see determinism easily, but materialism? Only if you define materials as things with definite parts I guess.

&gt; If parts don't have definite attributes while wholes do have definite attributes

My point was that wholes don't have definite attributes either. For example, you know that wave particle duality stuff? Well, this is weird, but even something like a golf ball has a wavelength. It's just tiny compared to the actual ball.

&gt; Have you ever read about or heard of the problem of induction?

Interesting. Never thought about that. Though, one thing I think I should say. The Stanford place says induction is basically assuming that ""instances of which we have had no experience resemble those of which we have had experience"". This cannot be demonstrated or implied without begging the question. But you said that instances of which we've had no experience *do not* resemble those of which we have. Where are you getting this from? Is it not fallacious to assume the opposite just because I can't prove it?

&gt; If physical accounts can't touch i, then math can't be just a language for describing physical things.

If it comes up in AC engineering, how can physical accounts not touch i?

&gt; It is the colloquial definition of evolution, but not what we mean by natural selection.

Well, sure, but this is only a point of contention because scales aren't living organisms.

&gt; However, I didn't mean to imply that our theories undergo a survival of the fittest type scenario in typical cases.

But they kind of do. Isn't that what a hypothesis is? You find an explanation that is most fit for the observations of reality. Reject it if it fails, and accept it if it succeeds.

&gt; As far as definitions go, what would you call a definition, if definitions aren't models for the use of a term?

A definition relates a thing to a meaning, a model relates a thing to a thing (or multiple things, depending). A model would be like F=ma. It tells you how a force relates to an object. A definition would be like what a force is (a push or a pull), it doesn't relate two or more things.

Essentially, a model describes how the world works, and so can either be right or wrong. A definition describes how our language works, and so can't really be wrong.

&gt; I'm sure no definition I've heard answers all of this while remaining non-trivial. I don't think a non-physical definition would add to the problems or is the cause of them here.

I think you're right here, so I'll stop arguing on this point.

&gt; The brain does some modeling, but the brain isn't a model itself.

This is a silly thing to say. Everything is a model. It's a model of itself. I may have misspoke, but I didn't mean to suggest that the brain doing modeling means we can model the brain. I meant to say the brain does stuff, which means we can simulate it.

&gt; They seem to be interested in applying our best model of the brain to practice application in computer science.

Didn't they say that they wanted a model of the brain so you could test drugs on it? To sum up what I heard in the video they said that they wanted to have a full, working, model of the human brain, but to do so would require vast computing power we don't have. To achieve that, they'd use the research they're already doing on the brain for their overall goal to pioneer new computing technology that can do what they need it to.

&gt; They don't claim to have a perfect model of the brain or a complete model or even a functions model.

No, but that's their goal.

&gt; Just to make my objection more clear, I'm talking about computational complexity. Some problems are theoretically impossible to solve even with machine assistance.

Do you mean that this isn't impossible, but is complex? Because something being complex (takes a long time to return) and something being impossible (never returns) are very separate in computer science, and this seems oddly worded with that in mind.",0,"2024-05-20T13:46:25.029740Z","2016-12-15T04:50:10Z","","Yes",9.814,313067482.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/56e4ey/_/db7szjl/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T13:46:25.029784Z"

If she wants to enjoy the power to will the baby to not exist (a hairy debate in itself), then she should also take sole responsibility if she chooses to have the baby.

Put it another way, if the man wants the child and the woman doesn't, the baby will be aborted. If so, the man is also suffering the loss of the child. So if you are going to constantly introduce the notion of the fetus being a child, then the woman's unilateral decision also has serious adverse consequences on the man.

Yes, I know the math is unrealistic... that's why I said **LETS PRETEND**. When my girlfriend tells me ""let's pretend I'm a nurse and you're police officer tonight in bed""... that doesn't mean she actually thinks she's a nurse and I'm a police officer. You do understand that, right?

That's true. But that's not what I'm saying.


Let's take it real slow so you can keep up and stop arguing against straw men.


1. You said: ""thinking that A&gt;B (racist) and sometimes picking B&gt;A (not discriminate) is not a logical option.""


2. I gave the example of someone who is a racist (A&gt;B) yet picks a black doctor over a white janitor (B&gt;A). Meaning he both thinks A&gt;B, yet sometimes picks B&gt;A.

Yes, she there’s a chance she may get a stretch marks and wider hips. The maternal death rate is less than 1%. You’d pretty much just as likely die by driving a car. This is not life and death and pales in comparison to killing a human. You can’t turn a blind eye to the other life.
&gt; 
&gt; 

The worst of those things are not temporary. The best of the negative affects of pregnancy are temporary.

I still think you're trivializing pregnancy.

There can be permanent and other long term changes to a womans body, she has to basically change her whole lifestyle for a good part of those 9 months - avoid alcohol, coffee, go to Doctors, morning sickness. She has to stop work at a certain point, she has to buy new clothes, incontinence is a real issue. She has to stop certain activities and sports, she can't fly at a certain point.

These are all very real reasons why someone would want to say 'I don't want to be pregnant'. I think they are valid reasons, they are good reasons. 

&gt; This is not life and death and pales in comparison to killing a human.

A foeuts is not a human life.

Even if it is a human life, it has no rights to use someone elses body to stay alive. 

If you want to take anything from what I am posting, take that statement. 

&gt; Would you rather go through a painful phase or not get a chance to live at all. I’m asking about you personally.

I don't think its a very good question at all. 

Would A go through a painful phase for B not to exist? Surely these scenarios are 'would you go through a painful phase for a reward later', the same person going through the bad to deal with the good.

Personally, I am putting the mothers right to use her body as she sees fit over the rights over any other human being or foetus. 


&gt; Btw, you’re taking a huge assumption by casually dismissing the fetus as “a clump of cells” when significant portions of the scientific community consider it as human life. This reckless mentality is incredibly dangerous.

Ok.

I will stop arguing that point.

But to clarify again.

Even if you consider a foetus a human life - it does not have the right to use someone elses body against their will to survive.

Your right to life stops when you need my body to keep living.

1304,"5","mynameisntlogan","","If you would have conceded that arguing with conspiracy theorists is entertaining and/or a good exercise in debate, then I would agree with you. But you seem to be missing that fact. 

There are few things more entertaining then causing a conspiracy theorist to completely shut down because you systematically debunk all of their reasoning for believing in the harmful BS that they believe in. It is completely satisfying knowing that you are the cause of all of their cognitive dissonance; to know that they will forever know deep down that you have a point, even if they deny it. 

For instance, I relish in the fact that it is so easy to expose every single 9/11 conspiracy theory as BS. Because the people that believe in these theories are so deluded and self-righteous, that it’s pure enjoyment to be the one to hit them with facts and watch them stop arguing and start simply denying. 

Also, some of the examples you gave of conspiracy theories fall under Poe’s Law, where it’s difficult to tell if someone that claims to support those theories actually believes in them, or if they just claim to believe in them for parody or baiting others into dead-end arguments. As such, I don’t believe those are good examples to list, because arguing with those people actually is pointless, but only because they’re trolls and not actual conspiracy theorists.

But I think your view on how to move forward with this debate is still misdirected. This can be encapsulated in this:

&gt;You can win people over with good argument and fundamentally it is the fastest way to do it which doesn't result in friction. Forcing people to do something just offsets a problem further down the line. It might work short term but it definitely won't long term.

This is a rather idealistic view.

We do not need to win *everyone* to our side.

By your own admission *some* people have expressed a fringe opinion that humanity is fundamentally evil, and then *some* of the people that have heard this argument have become upset by it, and then *some* people-- namely you-- have seen this upset and interpreted it to mean something. It is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction. I presume you would not try to argue that we need 100% approval before taking any action against climate change. But the fact that you are bothered by a fraction of a fraction of people's reaction to the movement to the same degree as the very issue the movement itself seeks to fix says otherwise.

The issue with this type of perspective is not that it is necessarily wrong-- on its face it is fine to want to try and speak to people rationally. The problem is, on everything but the most individual scale it is usually a bad tactic.

You have presented only a small binary of options when it comes to increasing support of initiatives:  either continue to appeal to the non-believers with debate and argument, or use authoritarian force to bring them into line. But either point of view is still focused *on the opposition*. Similarly, your main criticism of the movement and how it attracts new people is not based on more accurately expressing any fundamental truth about the movement itself-- it is instead a self-conscious appeal to moderate in order to be more appealing *to the opposition*.

Rather than focusing on your own movement and its growth, you are preoccupied entirely with the opposition and its feelings on the matter.

The opposition's feelings should not dictate the actions of a movement.

If it does, then it is no longer the opposition.

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, this is not a black and white situation-- of course extremist views should be moderated. If you see anyone throwing around misanthropic shit like 'humanity is a virus' then debate with that person. Similarly, people shouldn't stop reaching across the aisle when they can, engaging in debate with those that welcome it.

But ""appealing to the enemy"" should not be a necessity of action. In fact, I would argue that it is the continual focus on the opposition and their feelings on the matter that has set back real conversation about climate change.

Instead, like u/toldyaso was trying to say, what may be a more effective approach is focusing on those that are *already* on your side. Movements aren't born just out of good arguments to opposition-- it isn't like Martin Luther King took to the stage and suddenly everyone was convinced. It happens through a slow osmosis, and the best way to inspire that osmosis is to strengthen the base that supports you.

That's why Presidential candidates spend more time at rally's than they do at debates.

That's why the Civil Rights movement focused on organizing the nation's black Americans rather than just arguing with racist whites.

That's why Harvey Milk gave his speeches in the Castro District and not in Birmingham.

By focusing on the movement itself, refining it to be more correct, more perfect, and galvanizing the base you can spread its influence far more easily than you can if you spend all your time trying to debate and argue with people who disagree with you.

Also, by the way, this:

&gt;There is no practical reason why we should become lazy with the arguments.

Seems a disingenuous point. No one has argued that people should become lazy with their arguments or stop trying-- people have said they should stop arguing with shackles on just so climate deniers don't get upset. Refusing to appeal to those who deny fundamental truth is not the same thing as laziness by any measure.",0,"2024-05-20T14:05:23.752496Z","2019-06-11T01:30:29Z","","No",18.824,724132952.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bz4ok8/_/eqqaqp6/",-1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T14:05:23.752508Z"

They're just a bunch of black dots packed close together on a glowing screen.  The only reason this makes sense is that I have a particular thought that I am assigning to these dots, and I am trusting that you will interpret them as meaning the same thing.  Communication breaks down when we willfully look for meanings that are not intended.  If you know what a given person means when they say feminist, then it is a waste of time to interpret what they are saying as referring to something else.

I'm not saying that the term feminism isn't a complicated one.  There can be two people who say it and have meanings for it that share very little in common.  Like any term for a school of thought, it is simply a shorthand for a collection of expected ideas that we think most people who we call that term will share.  Everyone has a slightly different collection of ideas that they ascribe to the word, and no one will expect that everyone they associate the word with will exemplify every one of those ideas.  But if I know what ideas I mean when I say the word, and I see someone who exemplifies enough of them that I think it applies, and you know generally what ideas I mean to ascribe to that person when I say it, in what way am I wrong to use the word feminist to describe them?  I don't see any value in using two terms in my own mind for two people who I view as the same, just because one has a different association in their own mind with the word.  That would be like requiring that I only think in French when thinking about a Frenchman.

It can be helpful to give definitions when discussing terms like this(especially if one of the people has an unorthodox association with the word) but once everyone understands what the other is trying to convey, then it's time to stop arguing terms and time to start discussing ideas.

Yes and if you did you'll see that the age of majority which designates adulthood is 18. Look at the map if you don't wish to read. I linked that simple article cause I figure you would have taken the time to read, but you did not.

&gt;It is fairly rare but always extremely destructive.

You are speaking without factual data. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 140 million people with alcoholism worldwide. [Source](http://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/2001/english/20010219_youngpeoplealcohol.en.html) That is not a rare number.

&gt;Sexual desire is extremely common and rarely destructive.

Did you forget about HIV and Hepatitis B?

&gt;At the end of 2009, an estimated 1,148,200 persons aged 13 and older were living with HIV infection in the United States, including 207,600 (18.1%) persons whose infections had not been diagnosed. 

[CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/basics/)

&gt;Acute hepatitis B has been declining in incidence since 1990 mainly due to effective vaccination strategies, but chronic HBV, estimated at 700,000-1.4 million of the US population (8, 9), remains a major public health challenge. 

[CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Statistics/2011Surveillance/Commentary.htm)

I cannot agree that sexual activity is non-destructive. You and many others say that someone who is 18 doesn't understand the scope of their actions, so they should not be prosecuted for sex with a minor. Yet you suggest they are smart enough to understand the risks of unprotected sexual activity and the damage that STDs can cause? You suggest that a minor who cannot sign a legal document without an adult present should be able to decide if they can catch an STD or create a child? Some STDs may not kill you, but they will make your life such, such as herpes or HPV. A child born from a parent who is young may be given up for adoption, or raised in a poor environment because schooling has to stop for the parent to work and raise their child. The decision to allow a minor to participate in sex is foolhardy and negligent. Adults barely have a grasp on how to properly raise a child, yet you suggest that a minor be allowed to conceive a child? Adults to protect themselves while having sex is poor enough as it is, yet you suggest minors have free reign as well? I don't understand how you could agree with some laws that separate the access of minor for adult activities yet allow for access to another which involves adults.

Your counter argument that the law allows it, is a weak point of standing. It's only there to protect the 1% of kids who are both seniors, one 18, one 17, both in love. Beyond that rare case, it's taken advantage of by 19-20 year old's who ""meet at a party"" so ""it's cool cause they aren't trolling school grounds"". That is predator logic.

I know for a fact it happens, I witnessed it, countless times from guys I knew when I was going to college. The law needs to change, and people need to stop arguing the defining lines of adulthood when it comes to only this subject, any other subject it's clearly defined.

&gt;For example you might not be allowed to have passengers in your car when driving below a certain age.

They have that law in Kansas for people under the age of 18 because they no longer issue a drivers license to anyone who is considered a minor. You cannot entirely control what children do, but you can create rules that have ramifications, this is how adults are responsible. They only recently added this law to many states on the suggestion from the USDOT. Your example supports my point entirely. 

When dealing with prosecution of law violations, the only time age of adult variables are really considered are heinous crimes such as in the case of Phillip Chism who is being charged as an adult, for rape and murder. They could charge him as a minor, but the crime is heinous. In the opposite spectrum they would have to consider the adult in the manner as if or if not predatory. When if the law defined that an adult is an adult and a minor is a minor and sexual contact between an adult and a minor is prohibited, there would be no need to waste time on discovery. Again, the variable is only there to protect the 1% of kids who are both seniors, one 18, one 17, both in love.

The only reason you have to hold on to your view is that the law has a variant, it is your moral barometer. When it's your daughter or son at 16 being pursued by a 19 year old, you'll change your mind.

&gt;I'm done wasting my time on you.

That classic line from someone who has no counter argument and will not concede defeat. Admit it, we have laws that define adulthood and prosecute accordingly. You fall back on jurisdiction, and the reality is that jurisdictions lean toward my side, law is law and must be prosecuted accordingly. Current laws need to change for sexual contact. Would then it change your mind if the majority changed the actual law?

However, I have my doubts that what you describe accurately describes centrism.

&gt; Centrists are people who subscribe to an ideology that treats all conflicts as between moral equals.

I think the term balanced is better than equal. The proper balance need not be 50/50. Perhaps they believe that a good balance between to conflicting idea is more like 90/10. That's not equal. The main limit is that they generally would not be 100% confident in on side only.

&gt; Centrism relies upon the idea that all parties are operating in good faith and that all parties want good outcomes.

That sounds more like naivety or optimism. Centrists are not necessarily naive or optimistic.

Maybe they don't believe that, but rather that the most powerful ideas win, good or bad, true or false. Again, you seem to suggest some type of optimism, but that is not necessary trait of centrism.

Nothing prevents someone more familiar from being a centrist, nor does more familiarity with politics requires some to commit to either the left or the right

Perhaps not compromise, but at least come to *some* agree in order to get something done. As I mentioned above, the agreement need not be 50/50.

&gt; or using tone rather than content to judge the quality of an idea or argument 

Centrists are not necessarily incapable of forming or understanding proper arguments.

&gt; Mistaken, at best. At best, a centrist is operating in good faith and sincerely believes in their ideas. In such a case, a centrist is merely mistaken: the popularity or rhetorical strength of an argument is not a sufficient measure of the quality or truthfulness of an idea, yet it is the former qualities that determine its success in the so-called ""marketplace of ideas.""

This statement makes the assumption that they are necessarily mistaken about something. As listed above, perhaps your assumptions of mistakes or incorrect thinking are not necessarily present.

&gt; At worst, a centrist is operating in bad faith, and may not even be a sincere follower of centrism. In such a case, a centrist is using centrism to rehabilitate and include morally repugnant ideas and bad faith actors in discourse.

Some do, that's for sure. However, this again not a necessary quality.

Yes, that's not a bad argument, and seems to quite valid and necessarily true. All the things you list describe a bad centrist. However are all centrist bad, or even most of them? If they are not, then you cannot conclude that most centrists are bad.

&gt; Broadly speaking, centrist positions are often expressed to the effect of ""both sides are bad"" without actually evaluating the moral content of the position

That does occur, but that's nothing special about centrism. It is not uncommon for people for judge others based on their worse qualities.

So, those are the problems that I have with your argument. If we assume that everything you say is true about centrists, then sure, they are bad. But, is everything you say an accurate representation? It sounds like your trying to say that bad centrists are bad. Yeah, this true. Bad things are bad. There is no debating that.

Yes, it is a critical view of centrists and centrism.

&gt;However, I have my doubts that what you describe accurately describes centrism.

Great! :)

&gt;&gt; Centrists are people who subscribe to an ideology that treats all conflicts as between moral equals.
&gt;
&gt;I think the term balanced is better than equal. The proper balance need not be 50/50. Perhaps they believe that a good balance between to conflicting idea is more like 90/10. That's not equal. The main limit is that they generally would not be 100% confident in on side only.

I don't understand the application of your concept of balance. Could you clarify?

&gt;&gt; Centrism relies upon the idea that all parties are operating in good faith and that all parties want good outcomes.
&gt;
&gt;That sounds more like naivety or optimism. Centrists are not necessarily naive or optimistic.

Δ This is fair. I made the edit well after you commented. Centrists tend to be more explicitly negative or disdainful about ""both sides"".

&gt;&gt; Furthermore, it often is accompanied by appeals to ""the marketplace of ideas"" in conjunction with social Darwinian logic that the best ideas, or even the truth, will win out over bad ideas or falsehoods.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe they don't believe that, but rather that the most powerful ideas win, good or bad, true or false. Again, you seem to suggest some type of optimism, but that is not necessary trait of centrism.

I agree that it is not a necessary trait of centrism but it is a commonly recurring one.

&gt;&gt; Centrists often have a superficial understanding of politics: treating it as something they are above (insecurity)
&gt;
&gt;Nothing prevents someone more familiar from being a centrist, nor does more familiarity with politics requires some to commit to either the left or the right

I'm not so sure about this and would need you to elaborate.

&gt;&gt; express the wish that both sides would just stop arguing and compromise
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps not compromise, but at least come to *some* agree in order to get something done. As I mentioned above, the agreement need not be 50/50.

Why?

&gt;&gt; or using tone rather than content to judge the quality of an idea or argument 
&gt;
&gt;Centrists are not necessarily incapable of forming or understanding proper arguments.

I agree that it is not a necessary trait of centrism but it is a commonly recurring one.

&gt;&gt; Mistaken, at best. At best, a centrist is operating in good faith and sincerely believes in their ideas. In such a case, a centrist is merely mistaken: the popularity or rhetorical strength of an argument is not a sufficient measure of the quality or truthfulness of an idea, yet it is the former qualities that determine its success in the so-called ""marketplace of ideas.""
&gt;
&gt;This statement makes the assumption that they are necessarily mistaken about something. As listed above, perhaps your assumptions of mistakes or incorrect thinking are not necessarily present.

Could you elaborate please?

&gt;&gt; At worst, a centrist is operating in bad faith, and may not even be a sincere follower of centrism. In such a case, a centrist is using centrism to rehabilitate and include morally repugnant ideas and bad faith actors in discourse.
&gt;
&gt;Some do, that's for sure. However, this again not a necessary quality.

Yes. That is a description of the worst case.

&gt;Yes, that's not a bad argument, and seems to quite valid and necessarily true. All the things you list describe a bad centrist. However are all centrist bad, or even most of them? If they are not, then you cannot conclude that most centrists are bad.

I did not argue that. I argue that they are on a spectrum from mistaken through to bad.

&gt;&gt; Broadly speaking, centrist positions are often expressed to the effect of ""both sides are bad"" without actually evaluating the moral content of the position
&gt;
&gt;That does occur, but that's nothing special about centrism. It is not uncommon for people for judge others based on their worse qualities.

My point is that it's a problem that you are treating ""centrism"" like it is an ideology at all, which it isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nevertheless, it does still describe a set of people and their beliefs.

Not really, like I said at best it vaguely categorizes them in a very roundabout way.  Do you think everyone on the right agrees about everything and everyone on the left agrees about everything? obviously not, those are incredible vague descriptions and if you talk to someone on the either side and ascribe a bunch of assumed beliefs to them you are just fighting a strawman.  Calling someone a centrist is just as reductionist.  There are an endless number of way to build a political framework and to define someone's actual position you have to dig into their justifications.  Reducing every possible framework into 1 metric, mapping them to some chart, and then arbitrarily taking chunks of that chart and assuming the represent a political position makes no sense.  The issue isn't whether or not the thing you are critiquing is coherent, the issue is that the thing your critiquing doesn't even exist.

&gt;Nevertheless, it does still describe a set of people and their beliefs. Some are even in this very thread right now.

It doesn't define an ideological position it loosely describes individual believes.  Just because people in the thread are arguing for the ideas you mentioned doesn't mean they represent some collective idea.  You took a bunch of different things, aggregated them, and slapped a label on it. Now you pulling things back out of that label and arguing about them, just because people are arguing with you about those specific things after you pull them back out of the box doesn't mean they represent the box, or that the aggregation was every particularly meaningful.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I do not view centrism as coherent at all.

yeah because your idea of centrism is a broad label that you have aggregated a bunch of different things under.  The problem isn't that the thing isn't coherent, the problem is that the thing isn't **a** thing, it's many things, so of course it isn't coherent.

Morality breaks down to something simple, like that airey feeling in your stomach when you feel guilty about something or when your heart aches because you miss someone and you're worried about them, the stress and anxiety that just comes with giving a shit about someone or something in this world. It can come from tough decisions at school, work, home and just the state of the world. It can be tough to process it all, and sometimes those gut feelings are the only thing we have to go off of. 


Right, wrong, good, bad, etc. We've got an innate sense of morality that's blueprinted from our surroundings and environment growing up, but I truly believe there are *some* things we know to be universally right or wrong. Helping others and working together breeds progress. That's making sure evolution has the best canvas to work with.

Working against one another, killing and fighting slows progress and prolongs the here and now where we're struggling.

So first, you've assumed I'm white. Second, that statement is patently false.  A rich black person is far more privileged that a poor white person. There is no privilege more influential than money. Not to sound conspicary-ish, but poor people fighting amongst themselves over race/sex, ect. is exactly what is going to keep the rich rich. 

I think that one mistake that you are making is not dissociating individuals from their groups. You keep talking about peoples. I'm talking about people. 

&gt;People with privilege have an incredibly difficult time doing exactly this

This I disagree with as well. I rather think that people who perceive themselves to be without privilege, whether valid or not, like to believe that those who they see as their oppressors can't possible empathize with them. It's all part of a narrative which fits in nicely with the last point about how you seem to see people as inseparable from some obvious descriptors.

&gt;In an economic system where simply having wealth creates more wealth, class stratification is to be expected, and those already on top - mostly white men - will mostly stay there. If you want to keep capitalism, then the only way to address this is Scandinavian-style social democracy.

This I agree with,. And then you lost me again with: 

&gt;But if we remain ignorant of how ""past transgressions"" have played a critical role in shaping the way things are now, we don't have a very good chance of un-fucking things.

We can unfuck things quite simply by worrying only about class and without paying any attention to which group of 'oppressors' has historically fucked over which minority group, but it's not likely to happen. The first thing we need to do is to enable downward mobility. Yes, I type that right. We need to enable the rich to become poor. We can do this through various means, one of the fastest being taxing capital gains more than income. Anywho, we can hat about that more later. Next, we need to enforce laws preventing discrimination based upon race(which is itself a terrible metric, which we can discuss more if you'd like)/sex/sexual orientation. Third, we need to teach the next generation that everyone is born equal, regardless of race/sex/sexual orientation and then *practice* what we preach at all levels.

What we do *not* want to do is simply distract ourselves with a arguments over who's to blame and who fucked whom. Engaging in tumblr social justice activism is massively wasteful of resources better used to actually address the real reasons for social inequality.

I would say most feminists in a more real-world sense are actually *very* open to debate and critical thought. Without critical interrogation, feminism itself wouldn't exist, and would certainly not be the intensely academic movement that it is today. The majority of well-respected modern feminists are academics who dedicate their entire lives to critically engaging in discussion, research, and writing about women's issues in a wide variety of contexts. 

As a feminist, I actually very much enjoy talking to people who have different beliefs from me, because I feel like most people who think they don't like feminism think that because they have a misunderstanding of what the movement is based on encounters with ""tumblr feminists,"" or because they still perceive feminism as one of its earlier incarnations, rather than the postmodern wave that's really leading the way in the academy right now.

That's changing though, partially through the cultural relationship between us strengthening and partially through the increasing number of Asians living in Australia.

Okay, but surely the US/Euro influence would have to fall away significantly (as well as current australian culture) for this to possibly happen.

&gt;Asian media and Australian media is actually merging, rather than it being that we are a different country with an increasing about of distinctively Asian media.

Can't you say the same of other English-speaking nations? They're merging too (think the huge number of shows shared between, spinoffs like ""the Bachelor-NZ""...).

&gt;East Timor is only 400 miles from Darwin. They're really, really close. We're our own continent but that doesnt mean we're far away or have to be seen as seperate. North and South America are both America.

They didn't revolt and join Latin America or suddenly take on a special culture. One of them, California, is one of the powerhouses of American culture.

You probably believe that you are not like those people because unlike them, you are *correct* when you say racists are perpetrators and they are *incorrect* when they say immigrants are homosexuals are perpetrators.

I hope you can see why I believe that that reasoning is a little fishy.

It's like if the President wants to be able to get citizens spied/tortured/assassinated to better fight terrorism, you should be against that even if you *really* trust the President and know that he is a responsible person who will never abuse that power. Because his successor may not be, and the power to spy/torture/assassinate will persist even when the wrong guy becomes President.

You don't see why people getting other people fired over racism is wrong because you don't realize that the power of getting other people fired for thinking wrong will continue to exist even after the next generation has to fight whatever new kinds of prejudice we come up with when we are old and stupid.

Do you think this is the end of history and we have no remaining prejudices that our children will have to fight against? We don't know what it will be, but looking at history, it's obviously going to be something *we* don't believe is a prejudice at all. Just reasonable people defending their society against the genetically enhanced or the androids or whatever.

Yes of course people could fire people for the wrong reasons in the future. That doesn't mean that it's wrong now.

That being said, I haven't seen any game without a progressive temp ban system that escalates to a permaban with repeated violations. If someone gets permabanned on the first offense, it's usually for cheating.

That wasn't my point and I don't see how the second part about ban systems is even relevant. 

&gt;Freedom of speech has legal significance, and if you keep using the word without acknowledging what it actually means, it undermines your claim. You don't want freedom of speech handled the same online, you want more freedom of speech online, where people do not suffer the most severe consequences for it.

Stop arguing semantics, I don't care.

&gt;I didn't say ban them, the 5th guy isn't the one committing violations. But, if he wants to talk to and play with trolls, he should go to a game where trolls are welcome. You are demanding that the rules of the game change to accommodate this one guy.

I'm not demanding shit. I am giving my opinion on the matter. I shouldn't have to change the game I am playing to one I don't enjoy simply because I want to talk to and play with my friend who may be considered toxic. That is bullshit.

&gt;I cannot stress this enough: I do not give one measly fuck about the troll's feelings or gaming experience. They deserve to be penalized. They are the ones intentionally trying to ruin it for others. So the only guy we disagree over is the 5th guy, and I gave you my answer about him above.

I don't care about your personal opinion towards trolls, I'll be honest. Why have only 3 people enjoy the game to its full extent when you could let all 5? You're just being selfish.

&gt;It's a team-based game with friendly fire on all the time. So trolls can mess with other players a number of ways even while muted. They can shoot their gadgets, barricade walls and doors the other person wanted to leave open, blind them with flashbangs, or just straight up teamkill them fewer times than trigger the penalties.

Wow, sounds like gameplay sabotage - something I openly said that I do not condone. 

&gt;I never suggested any such thing. 

Obviously you didn't. I was just using it as an example put into a different perspective.

&gt;And trolls are the single biggest reason people stay quiet online.

Says who?

&gt;They don't have to do so verbally. You are completely ignoring that trolls are specifically there to antagonize other players. That is their ""game,"" it is the reason they are online. So they will find other ways, and they can get damned creative about it. I was playing EA sports NHL online, in a mode where each gamer takes over one player on the ice. The guy playing the goalie decided he wanted to troll us. In the real NHL, if the goalie touches the Puck in a specific area, it's a penalty on the defense, but the goalie himself doesn't serve it. So he would just constantly violate the rule and we would be stuck in the penalty box.

That is game sabotage which I do not condone. ",0,"2024-05-20T14:19:08.461070Z","2019-03-28T22:54:36Z","","Yes",4.44,676119036.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/b6jksc/_/ejm5zsp/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T14:19:08.461081Z"

&gt;Stop arguing semantics, I don't care.

You started this CMV talking about how much you believe in freedom of speech, but you don't care what it means? 

&gt; I shouldn't have to change the game I am playing to one I don't enjoy simply because I want to talk to and play with my friend who may be considered toxic. That is bullshit.

Tell your toxic friend not to be toxic or deal with the consequences of his actions. If I were you, I'd stop making friends with toxic players and you won't run into this problem.

&gt;I don't care about your personal opinion towards trolls, I'll be honest. Why have only 3 people enjoy the game to its full extent when you could let all 5? You're just being selfish.

The *troll* is the one being selfish, because he can't keep stop spewing shit all over the game. And so the game devs ban them, and the bulk of the player base sheds not one tear over it.

&gt;Wow, sounds like gameplay sabotage - something I openly said that I do not condone. 

They often go hand in hand, so devs hand out bans to prevent verbal harassment from becoming game sabotage. You might condemn it, but that doesn't change that it happens.

1355,"5","Pirateer","","I would suggest these factors contributed to it in away, as did many others.  No one factor broke her campaign but the influence of several factors created a perfect storm of losing.

There are 321 million people in the US, supposedly 200 million are registered voters.  For each individual voter the criteria they use to make decisions is all over the map.

Trump won the electoral college with 56% of the vote. In the popular vote he walked away with 46%. That's a very tight margin, especially considered the DNC stacked Hillary's deck - rigging the primary election and promoting the most radical Republican candidate.

To say that misogyny wasn't a factor, well even in 2016 there are people who insist a ""female temperament"" is not suited to hold office; even excusing people who wouldn't vote for woman no matter what plenty of people considered that bias in their decision making.  This and most other points are just a weight added to a balance scale. The size of the weight is going to vary for everyone.

Russian influence is tricky, not knowing the exact scope of it.  But do you think the US could influence a foreign election if they dedicated the resources? They have, and that would suggest the capable exists for any world super power.  And while Trumps vitriol and posturing was unsettling to many, it also appeared like a calculated and targeted marketing campaign.  He flipfloped a lot, but ultimately he knew what to say and where to say it. I think social media analysis helped greatly, but Trump is a business man, he'd take whatever help he could get; anything to give him an edge.

Lastly the emails... The email investigation was a deal breaker for me.  I believe Hillary violated the law, it was her status privilege swept in under the rug.  As much as I would insist to people that she was a criminal, they gave her the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't until Comey's foggy comments and failure to shut the book on the investigation did I see people hesitate and stop arguing ""if she broke the law why wasn't she in jail?""

No one factor cost Hillary the election, but they were all influential to a degree.  Several factors worked together to upset the handicap points she was spotted, and in such a close race that's kind of a big deal.",0,"2024-05-20T14:19:17.074470Z","2017-05-04T13:05:31Z","","No",8.266,378227884.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/696qi4/_/dh4ae3c/",1,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T14:19:17.074482Z"

The thing about a common enemy isn't that it really ""unites"" anyone, but rather it gets everyone to put their differences aside for a period of time.  We collectively say, ""This particular threat is very important, so we agree to stop arguing about everything else until said threat is dealt with.""

The problem with that is that people will only put their disagreements on hold for so long.  After all, those problems don't just go away because we stop talking about them.  After a while, people will revisit their old disagreements - they will say, ""Yes, we get that X is still an issue, but X has been an issue for years and we just can't wait any longer to see action on Y.""",0,"2024-05-20T09:50:49.042853Z","2017-05-15T16:46:38Z","","No",17.91,381805548.0,"","https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6bbf1o/_/dhl8l00/",2,"changemyview",4855832,"2024-05-20T09:50:49.042860Z"

Just one more thing they want 2 white slaves for every African American person. Not enough white people, don't worry they'll make some of them breeding slaves until we get enough.

939,"5","JJGE","","&gt;Millennials have been given a huge task by older generations

This is no different than any time in the past. Just look at things like the independence war, civil war, civil rights movement, etc. All of these were because of a status quo caused (or allowed/tolerated) by many generations until someone had to care enough to do something about it. Millennials are not different or special in this way

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In order to fix the climate Millennials will have to travel less, consume less and pay more for the privilege

Or they could also work on ways to make travel more efficient, make consumism less polluting, etc. There have been so many breakthroughs in our lives just out of the result of ""you can't do this"". Elon Musk is a great example, and I know not everybody has the resources he has but he got frustrated with the traffic and he built a solution to it. We as millennials could be the ones not only using more renewable energies and energy efficient vehicles but also champion the cause of why they are useful and needed so they get more widespread, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is on top of being poorer than the generation directly above

Nope, there is more wealth and more ways to become wealthy than any other time in the world. You have people building apps, making youtube videos, posting pictures on Instagram, and many other ways that are creating a lot of wealth. While I agree that costs are getting higher, also there are so many ways to generate income that if you are a hard working person you can actually come out winning there.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; To deal with all this and expected to respect their elders

I don't think it's fair to make a blanket statement here. Not everybody older than us was getting rich at the expense of the environment or social inequality, in fact I would argue that 99% of people older than us are just nice people that are just trying to make a living for themselves and their families. Respect is earned, but I think ""Respect your elders"" usually is meant more like ""don't be rude to other people"" rather than the admiration that the word ""Respect"" requires.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\[...\] This burden is falling on millennials

You are 100% correct, there should have been a different story but the fact is that there wasn't. Just like I mentioned earlier with the wars and other eras, people tend to make decisions that seem right at the time but eventually turn out to be wrong. It's important to learn from the lesson but let's move forward and find a way to fix this. I'm all for stopping all these government handouts and I think once people understand basic economic principles they'll stop arguing for the socialist programs that got us in this mess instead of pushing for more overhead that will only push the problem to the next generations.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;they pushed it back since they like consumption

I totally agree with this statement. My question to you is (and I mean this from curiosity, not judgement point of view) what are you personally doing to not push it to the next generation? I hear a lot of complaints from people around me on this topic, but when I mention things like *""did you know that if you stopped eating meat you would cut more greenhouse gases than if you never traveled again in a car, train, boat or plane for the rest of your life?""* people just say that ""they love meat too much to give it up"" which is exactly what older generations did, so we can't complain that they just pushed the envelope when we are not doing anything different. Change starts at home, it's very easy to tell people ""someone should do something"".

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, I don't think millennials *have* to change the world, I believe there is an opportunity to stand up and do something about it, or just do what other generations did and push it to the future. This is not a *millennial* problem, and just like the civil war I believe this will be addressed by the minority of the population, the ones that decide to take responsibility (regardless of their age) and do something about it instead of stopping at ""we are angry at previous generations"".
