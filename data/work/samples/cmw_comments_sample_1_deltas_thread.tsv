The rich aren't obligated to help the poor. But then again, the poor aren't obligated to buy into our society's notions of property and ownership. There's really no reason that they should continue to see your stuff as ""your"" stuff. It could easily become their stuff, and there are more of them if it comes to fisticuffs.

The fact is, the things most people take for granted in these sorts of arguments, like property rights, are really concepts that we as a society have invented and agreed to believe in. There's really an implicit bargain being struck here, but if one side takes things too far, the deal is off. Whenever that has happened, those who took your attitude were the first against the wall.

The frank, rather crass, answer to this, is that if the rich don't do anything to help the poor, the poor will kill them and take their stuff. It has happened many times in the past, and we are never all that far away from its happening again.

You can easily construe this as a threat, but when you think about it a bit more, it really isn't. It's simply the nature of the bargain that most societies have hit upon. The bargain is: ""Don't be too much of a shithead, and you get to have stuff and live your life how you want."" If someone hoards wealth that they don't need or ever plan to use while people around them suffer from want, that person is a shithead. They aren't keeping their end of the bargain.

For whatever reason, there are lots of Nigerians at my school. They're the most sexist bunch of dudes I have ever met (used to have a Nigerian roommate, and he and his friends were always making horribly sexist statements) and they basically did the stereotypical stuff you were talking about up there. I also saw him hold a knife to an Asian kid's throat for ""disrespecting"" him and had to talk him out of beating the kid up multiple times. KC's entire culture seemed to be built on ""flashiness"", on conspicuous consumption, violence, and sexism.

BUT one of my best friends here, Marv, is black, and he isn't like that at all. Two of his roommates are also Nigerian, and they bug the hell out of him, too. So... I guess what I'm getting at is that race does not equal culture. I'm not particularly fond of the Nigerian culture I saw, but that doesn't mean that *all* Nigerians or *all* black folks are part of that culture. For all I know, the Nigerians I have met could all be Igbo, or Yoruba, and that's just what's sticking out in my brain (confirmation bias).

Marvin likes cars, and so does KC. However, while KC puts shiny things on his car and lets it fall to pieces (my parents will get me another one, so it's a'ight), Marvin enjoys working underneath the car-- he changes his own oil and brakes, and his old car was pretty heavily customized under the hood, though you couldn't tell from the outside. KC blasts loud rap music everywhere he goes. Marv likes classical and blues. KC parties almost every night and aggressively hits on girls. Marv prefers to study or go to a movie and the only reason he isn't in a long-term relationship is because he's so shy and quiet.

What I'm getting at is that culture doesn't account for individual preference (some people are just douchebags) and that you're only seeing partial aspects of a culture. Motley Crue, one of my favorite bands, was pretty heavily into sex and drugs too... but they have attained the respectability of age. AC/DC had a lot of songs about fighting and killing, but because they've been around so long, they have become more mainstream and less perceived as in-your-face and aggressive. Also note that normal, quiet, nice people tend to stick out in your brain less than assholes because either A) you just didn't notice them, or B) they didn't make an impression in your brain.

Now, I do think that there are parts of what you're calling ""black culture"" (although I would, conversely, call it ""poverty culture"") that *are* extremely harmful to the community as a whole. However, as a fellow southerner, I have seen the effect of meth on white communities and the effect of smuggling corridors on the border. **Black communities are not the only ones that have problems; all poor communities are suffering right now.** The guy out there listening to rap in a beat-up Caprice and shooting a dude in a tenement over crack isn't that different than the guy listening to Lamb of God in his beat-up F-150 and shooting up the trailer over meth.

If you can't get a job because you're black and uneducated, or you can't get a job because you're white and uneducated, what difference does it make? If your culture is built on violence, white or black (I'm looking at you, so-called 'outlaws' and 'proud rebels'), how does the end outcome differ? It's still an unsustainable model.

Finally, I think that certain political groups have historically utilized white-versus-black (or, where I'm from, white-vs-black-vs-Indian-vs-Hispanic) to create a wedge between **haves** and **have-nots** to sustain their own power structure. Our system, a democracy, means that there is a vote for every person, rich or poor. Well, there are a lot more poor folk out there than rich, so to be able to sustain their policies, certain people have found it politically expedient to exploit racial tension to create a divide in the poorest element of society to prevent it creating a powerful voting block. If you don't believe me, look at the history of Texas. Johnson was from Texas, and Texas was solidly Democratic until Johnson's Civil Rights act went through. Texas has been Republican ever since. Oklahoma, similarly, was once a progressive state. Race was used to drive a wedge into that voting block and break it."	55.0	0.0	753	False	True	0.0

He pointed out how American culture promised so much - glitzy capitalism etc. - and yet they lived lives of destitute poverty. This means that unlike some people in developing countries around the world, African Americans are intimately aware of their own conditions.

I am a British man, and people often hold similar views about black people over here. I think my friends who think like that share the OP's distaste for feeling that they are being racist. 

I think that NewQuisitor has a point about the impact of poverty on behavior. There is a culture of survival of the strongest universally in urban areas of poverty: there is a danger of being perceived weak which informs the development of their personalities.

James Baldwin (an African American intellectual in the 50s, 60s and 70s)   I found had a lot of insightful views about black conditions, and culture and also about how to escape a relationship of hate between whites and blacks. In the South I assume black communities would retain memories of the oppression which haunted them - in some areas they will have known people who were lynched, a practice which stopped in the 20s or were beaten and harassed by the police etc. It is humbling to reflect how recent these events are."	4.0	0.0	228	False	True	0.0

They're laughing at the fat neckbeards to satisfy their upsetting desire to feel superior to something, and using fedoras as just another way to make themselves feel better.  

But, among that, fedoras generally do not look good on a guy wearing a t-shirt and pants.  In fact, it's against its intended purpose and these people (""neckbeards"" who wear fedoras incorrectly to be counter culture), are ruining the name of a fedora.  

So you see these ""fat neckbeards"" wearing a fedora and they're essentially ruining the hat.  Which is why it brings so much ridicule.  If enough people wear it incorrectly in a way that looks bad, people assume that it looks bad and fedora gains a negative connotation.  So Reddit generally ridicules people for tarnishing fedora-style hats while looking terrible in them anyway

Do you think drugs are a waste of time and money?   What do many well off people do with their money? Do they spend it all efficiently and wisely?  Do you engage in activities that others would consider a waste of time and money? What I'm trying to get at is everyone enjoys different things.  Whether it be videogames, cigarettes, collectors items, trading cards, antiques, gambling, coins, or even drugs, these are all habits/addictions cost money and time.  Should we test the welfare recipients on everything that doesn't directly contribute to their health and quality of life? That would be absurd.

Willfully abuse charity is a subjective phrase.  You have your own ideas on how money should be spent, particularly for how those who receive welfare benefits should be spent.  You probably think you know what is best for them.  But because spending money is subjective, they would rather spend money on x rather than y.  They perhaps think their quality of life is increased by smoking weed or tripping on acid as opposed to having a healthy, well balanced meal.  Perhaps the pros outweigh the cons in their mind.  Perhaps the thrill of gambling excites them more than 10 hour of watching cable.  Just because they live their life differently than you doesn't mean its irresponsible.  I will give you that in some cases you are right, but you should never categorize all or even most people who have different ways of doing things as irresponsible.  Try to take an objective standpoint and understand that maybe paying 10$ for weed a day helps them escape from their relatively crappy life and is the most optimal way to spend money on happiness.  Try to understand that gambling for 5 hours a day gets may get more excitement than watching cable.  Your way of life should never impose on others in my opinion.  Imagine some of the hobbies you have being taken away from you, just because they are socially unacceptable and considered irresponsible. (Even if they really aren't.)

For instance, there is the argument that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings, while ""unsavoury"", were justified, because it shortened the war and indirectly saved many lives. I don't agree with it, but the evaluation of these bombings - whether they were justified or not - is not so clear-cut.

However, what I will argue is that *""unsavoury"" actions have a high cost*.

Most of human interactions require trust. For instance, I go buy some bread to my local baker's because I trust him not to put sawdust in his products. Trusting people you know is rather easy; trusting people you don't know looks like a leap of faith. This is one of the reasons why we have laws: so that the cooperative actions are favorized, and trust can be established between strangers.

Let us look at the trolley problem. Let's say you have killed one bystander to save two people. If we look at this result, we could think it is a gain (or not the worst loss). However, you have established that *you are confortable with living in a world were killing a bystander can be justified*. As such, everybody could kill anybody, if it were for the greater good. And, especially *everyone could kill you*. For the greater good, of course, but it doesn't matter much when you get the bad end of the stick.

Now, try to trust people who would be fine shooting you if they believed they were right. Try to trust in a law when it could be put aside at any moment for the greater good. The idea that ""laws are always to be respected"" is perhaps a fiction, but it is a useful fiction, which should not be made light of.

Hence, I think that the notion that ""the end justify the means"" is, ultimalely, harming the trust that we need to live together as a society. For the second and third examples you give, a similar argument can be made. The government could restrict our rights for the greater good, but as such, signals that other rights could also be restricted - which can reduce the trust the people have in the government.

Once you factor this moral hazard, the evaluation of whether a particular end justify a particular means is much harder, and the balance goes against those ""unsavoury"" actions."	2.0	0.0	403	False	False

Government invasions of privacy, thus, are a problem not necessarily for privacy reasons but rather because they inherently represent violations of the current doctrine of due process.

Ordinarily, we're willing to tolerate basically any privacy violation so long as the government gets a warrant.  The operative word in ""warrantless wiretapping"" isn't ""wiretapping"".

Clearly it's going to be used one way or another, the question is simply ""how?""  Especially if the actual information collection is secret, what's to stop them from using that information extrajudicially, or to guide the search for further information?  In the courts, the doctrine of the ""fruit of the poisoned tree"" is used to stop this, but how can that be invoked if you can't prove what information was used or collected?  It's much like previous trials on warrantless surveillance, where the government avoided responsibility for illegal spying on U.S. citizens by basically saying ""well, you can't prove it because we refuse to admit it.""

There are a vast number of uses for information beyond simple trial evidence.  People hide many things that are not legally incriminating but can still be life- or reputation-ending, and a legal prohibition isn't going to stop the use of those for leverage.  As one person pointed out in another thread, in countries where similar surveillance has become the norm it's common for people to be blackmailed with such information by various government agencies, something that certainly circumvents any prohibition on admissibility.

Finally, collecting the information at all is an inherent hazard.  Much of the information is personal and identifying, and depending on the general nature it may include things like credit card numbers or similar information.  In short, it's a hacker's goldmine.  Are you going to argue that the NSA databases are sufficiently secure?  I wouldn't.  There's fairly decent cause to believe that they've been breached at least a couple times domestically, and lord knows what would happen if government-funded hackers from, say, China got ahold of that kind of information.  Even if you genuinely, 100% believe your government would never *ever ever ever ever* do something like that (personally a pretty bad bet to begin with), would you trust a foreign government which was pissed at the U.S. the same way?  Would you really want a hostile party having non-incriminating but sensitive information on basically every single person in your country?

And its societally far easier eventually to pass a law that forces parents to submit their unborn kids to mandatory gene therapy to substitute their inferior genes with superior alleles while they are still embryos, than to force them to abort their babies. The former is morally far closer to mandatory vaccination (already a law in many countries) than to eugenics or reproduction control.

Well the quickest way to justify your employment is to realize that availability itself has value.  The little two minute conversations, and the peace of mind of having a (presumably) technical safety net are not worthless to other employees, though it feels that way to you.  You're basically ""on call"" while in your chair.

Is this the best possible way of utilizing you?  Probably not, but any organization that grows sufficiently large becomes progressively more inefficient.  We play video games and have perfect understanding of every aspect of the universe, along with godlike powers to influence it.  But obviously this is not how real life works.  Managers frequently supervise projects about which they have no knowledge.  And even if they did at one point work in the field, their knowledge immediately begins to decay the moment they are promoted.  So they can and do get played by their subordinates, just like a mechanic can tell you whatever he wants and without any knowledge, you're helpless to contradict him.  But here's the kicker, in our analogy, it's not even your car.  So when 4th and 5th gears break 6 months later, hey, you just did what the mechanic told you to, right?  On my project, we've had 3 project managers in 2 years.  More important than fixing things is making sure they don't break while you're in charge.  Doing nothing accomplishes that goal very nicely.

 But even when immediate supervisors are informed and invested enough to reform the system, they often don't have the authority to enact the changes.  They need more personnel, or less, or more time for refactoring without any new functionality, etc.  Usually that goes up the chain to someone even more detached and insulated from project success or failure.   The project managers are there because developers can't be trusted with decisions about development, and change control committees are there because project managers can't be trusted with decisions about the project.  A tyrant or fool at any point could be disastrous, so we create oversight to protect us from failure.  But it also prevents success.  So if you really wanted to find a place where everything you do matters and you can accomplish anything as fast as you can physically implement it, go find yourself a tiny startup where hiring you increases the company's population by like 10%.  But keep in mind that as you gain freedom, you lose security, as the very thing that makes indie companies appealing is also what makes them so risky and inconsistent.

I think you can make a good case that he alright with it and that it wasn't a slur in the 1930's when the team was named. Most obviously, that the team was renamed after he was hired and brought several Indian players to play on the team and he kept coaching. Usually you don't rename a team to insult the coach and not have him quit. See http://tombenjey.com/2013/05/06/redskins-named-in-dietzs-honor/

[By far the best paper on the beginnings of the word](http://anthropology.si.edu/goddard/redskin.pdf) makes a compelling case that it's a term that originated with American Indians. (Also, FWIW, American Indian is the preferred term, not Native American.)

Obviously, this is only anecdotal evidence, but ever example I have ever heard of it being used as a slur comes from after WW2. The earliest are usually being in the 60's at the re-education schools that were used to try to eliminate Indian culture and heritage.

There are also some other examples that indicate the word didn't become a slur until after WW2. For example, this NY Times article from 1912 uses in a headline in reference to Jim Thorpe. http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C12FC3B5E13738DDDA10A94DC405B828DF1D3. I find it doubtful the NYT would use a racial slur in a headline like that.

You can even find a reference in this 1975 biography of Thorpe to the ""noblest redskin"" http://books.google.com/books?id=rDV1jOx2P3cC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=kJ2Qm93PSc&amp;dq=jim%20thorpe%20%22noblest%20redskin%22&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20thorpe%20%22noblest%20redskin%22&amp;f=false

The term is clearly supposed to be a compliment. I think the ""noblest"" adjective is quite racist because of it's use in terms like the ""noble savage"", but I don't think you can make a similar argument for redskin.

The exact policy I have in mind should not change behavior for hiring workers, because something I mentioned briefly in my main post is the prospect of offering a tax break to those who do hire workers. While the tax rates may be prohibitively high for those who do not hire, for those who do, and offer the wages and benefits workers SHOULD have, I think general tax breaks are warranted. This should encourage the behavior that I'm hoping to get. if you just tax the rich at 70-80% or something, that might just cause them to pass on the tax to the employees by eliminating their positions or cutting their hours.

Not at all, it's just paying off people to stop working, which isn't a sustainable activity.  Plus it encourages people to put themselves into that position, making the number of people you're paying to do nothing increase, likely in a dramatic fashion.

Also, you don't raise efficiency by doing this.  Sure, the people that are still bothering to work likely are better workers, but you're simply moving the average from the working force to the welfare force, and ignoring the cost of that.  You're still paying for the people who aren't producing anything.  Well, the rich, who own the businesses, are paying for them when you take their money.

2) Raising taxes will not fix the deficit, especially if you just give that money to people who aren't working.  Spending less will fix the deficit, but even that will have consequences.  But you can't fix the runaway deficit by pushing harder on one end.  There may be some room for taxes, but you will never catch up with the spending that way.

And your information about Reagan is one-sided, revenues went up during the time those taxes were cut, though theories vary widely as to the exact mechanism that was in place (economics is complicated, and neither you nor I understand it well enough to know for sure).

3) Now you're suggesting that companies will make more money by taking their profits away and giving it to people to spend on their products?  I'm not sure you really appreciate how silly that is.

To me, one thing you said really stuck out for me:

&gt; However, in college, my views changed. I began to realize the system was stacked against some people, that the rich are gatekeepers when it comes to wages and all, and that it's not necessarily peoples' fault for being poor.

2 things here...college is notoriously liberal on both sides - the teachers and the students both trend very heavily (and sometimes fanatically) liberal.  There are reasons for both, that I won't bother going into.  Suffice it to say that the influence at that stage of your life wasn't particularly unbiased, and you should take that into consideration.

Second, whenever someone says something like 'the system was stacked against them' in such a general way, I immediately call foul.  The system isn't perfect, far from it, but it is really *really* the opposite of what you are implying here.  I'd venture to guess that nowhere else in the world, or even in the history of the world, were people put on a more even playing field when it comes to opportunities than what we have today in the US.  There are no caste systems prevalent here, there are plentiful opportunities to improve yourself and your situation, and people are free to find a way to make their lives better.  I'll agree ahead of comments that it is easier for some than others, but no one is prevented from becoming the next Bill Gates because of their birthright or their bank account.  People get ahead, sometimes far ahead, every day in this country, and they're encouraged to do so.

My only fear is that we will become a society where there is no incentive to become better, to create the next big thing or start the next successful company, because the politicians take away the incentive to accomplish it.

Simply having higher taxation provides no new wealth &amp; reduces the value of the dollar (and other measures of wealth) in a nation with high tax rates **when** there are opportunities to move wealth elsewhere. Inflation would do the same thing. Inflation is highly progressive because it impacts one in relationship to their holding of dollars without creating the burden of having to actually file taxes with the added benefit that one cannot lie on their taxes to get out of having their wealth redistributed.

That said, I would caution you against making claims that we were wealthier before the 1980's. Most headlines that indicate such a thing state something like household income being down without analyzing the fact that household size is also smaller. Headlines that address distribution of income often look only at pre-tax income, not accounting for existing tax transfers. Honestly, probably the best measure of wealth change over time is the amount of time required to work at the median wage to buy common household goods and services.

If California tries to raise their taxes, the rich will move to Nevada or Texas. If the US tries to raise taxes, the rich will go to another country with lower taxes. Corporations and the rich also have access to many loopholes like carried interest or hiding money in overseas accounts.

The biggest hurdle to taxing the rich is that the rich and corporations by definition have lots of money and can buy their way to lower taxes by paying off politicians, running endless commercials, and creating a 24/7 news network to broadcast their agenda.

Did the Ottoman Turks ever pay the Byzantines? Did the Mongols pay the hundreds of countries and cities that they invaded? Why can't our government and our society as a whole just let this go, like every other nation in the world did after they conquered a surrounding territory.

Both of those societies practiced slavery, so why shouldn't we? Perhaps societies from centuries ago are not the place to look to for moral guidance.

&gt; Without conquest and military expansion, the world and civilization as a whole would not have expanded as quickly and efficiently as it did, and the cultures of different countries couldn't have mixed to inspire new ideas and methods of technological advancement. Yes you could argue that such a feat is achievable through trade, but the process would be much slower, and the full affects of some cultures may not be completely absorbed or even shared with other cultures.

I can't argue against this point in relations to world history (although I don't neccesarily think you are correct), however in relation to the conquest of the Americas this view doesn't hold water. Native American societies were more often annihilated than absorbed.

&gt; Had Columbus turned back at the first sign of inhabitants, Europe would not have benefitted from crops like potatoes(a crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom), and corn.

Europeans at this time were beginning to engage in trade on a global scale. There is no way that upon hearing of a new continent (or a westward route to the far east) they would have decided to never visit the continent again, even if they had no intention of conquest or colonisation. The Columbian exchange could have happened just as easily without conquest.

&gt; The introduction of the New world as a trading hub also facilitated international trade, not only to the new world, but to places like Java and the Ottoman Empire. Western Europe was transformed from a somewhat economically isolated area, into a trading hub for the entire known world.

The New World would still have been used for trade, Western Europe would still be a trade hub considering the role of Western Europeans as global traders during this time period.

Also, why don't we try flipping the scales. Say that next week an advanced alien civilization discovers Earth. Would you agree that they are justified in conquering and colonising our planet? What about the specifics of the conquest? Are they allowed to encourage the spread of disease in our communities? Enslave us and work us to death? Tear down our cities and burn our books? Are they allowed to force us to resettle away from the fertile areas they have taken for their colonies? If you accept the conquest of the Americas as justified then surely you must accept this justified."	4.0	0.0	484	False	True	0.0

But your understanding of flirting and relationship-building is misguided.

Flirting is an act of communication, not just a sexual game. It is a way of demonstrating interest -- sexual and/or otherwise -- to a potential partner. This has the benefit of allowing the relationship to progress organically rather than trying to make a sudden hard turn into a romantic relationship with someone to whom you have shown no interest. 

&gt;Flirting assesses sexual compatibility, which alone is not sufficient to guarantee long term success, making it not a useful indicator. 

No, sex assesses sexual compatibility. Flirting doesn't tell you anything about what turns a person on. Flirting is opening the door just a little bit. It may give you hints, but that's kind of the point. But it's well-established that sexual compatibility is a big factor in long-term relationship success for most people. 

&gt;The rationale being that when the time comes, I'll turn up the seduction and work it out, but that time only comes during dating, not before.

The problem with this approach is that you're trying to take the relationship from zero to sixty with no warning. Flirting is a way to gradually break down social barriers so the relationship can grow closer. Most people don't respond to a sudden, ""Hey I'm into you!"" Even if they're interested back.

You are trying to manipulate the process of building a relationship rather than participating in the social norm. You're welcome to follow a different set of social norms, but you will have limited success because most people are expecting relationships to develop in a certain way, and in most cases flirting is a part of that.

&gt;My guess is, women look for a spark, and I actively avoid generating it--if there is a flirt opportunity, I consciously turn it down.

Understand: What you are doing is communicating that you are not interested. You are placing yourself firmly in the friend zone.

&gt;Background: I was a child actor, so once I find out my partner's turn ons, I can play out the fantasies and characters she wants. To me, seduction is like acting out a role. And the compromise is if I give her a night of acting, I'll get one in return.

This has nothing to do with a genuine relationship, which is ostensibly what you want. You need to learn how not to act, how to be an authentic human being who responds to other human beings in the moment rather than trying to read and calculate.

You need to learn how to build a romantic relationship because....

I didn't intentionally slack off, I just got too lazy because no one was telling me what to do.

When I got back home, my parents cracked down on me hard. After them yelling at me about how much time I waste on video games, on the internet, on facebook, and doing so many other pointless things, I got kinda mad.

Think of the problems of the past and of the present. In America, 150 years ago there was slavery. After that, there was segregation and the conditions of life for black Americans was hardly improved until the 1920s, but it was improved, and it has improved since then and it will continue to improve. The arc is long, yes, but eventually justice is achieved. 

What you have to understand is that in today's society there is so much abundance. New farming techniques and water irrigation make it so we can feed the entire planet and then some. The presence of starvation in poor countries is because we do not yet know how to efficiently allocate resources to prevent that kind of death and suffering. But we are getting closer. By almost any metric, this is the best time in recorded history to be alive. More people are living happy, healthy, long lives than at any other point ever.

Progress cannot be stopped for long. We'll find the technology to decrease our imprint on the global environment at a useful scale. If people seem unwilling to convert to solar energy or wind or whatever else would work towards that today, it is because the technology has not quite caught up to the problem yet. But we have achieved many greater things than creating a more efficient car or a better system of irrigation or of lighting.

The difference between criticizing smoking and criticizing sexualized video game characters is that we already presuppose that video games are a fantasy and are prone to being unrealistic. 

You'd might as well be making the argument that video game violence makes people more violent. What makes sexualized characters different is that it's just distasteful, like video game violence against puppies where market forces indicate that people like violence against puppies. 

And really, I'm not sure you can say these characters do any more damage then the constant sexualization in other parts of culture. Whereas when you consider smoking, it is known to cause bodily harm.

To address the second point there though, I am aware women can be sexist, but it isn't like there is abundant female sexists in the gaming community.

I'll be honest, gaming is really lacking in quality characters in general. For every bad sexualized character, there are several bad ones that aren't. Character development is still something game developers need to work on in general. Sexualizing a character is just a way to disguise bad writing, but I don't think you'll find many people championing sexualized characters are good models for character development. If someone does, then certainly the person is just a shallow moron with no concept of story telling.

My biggest point here is when feminists that aren't gamers come into a gaming space, declare that their presence is needed, and presume to be some morally superior authority. Which again, is like going into something like a book writing community and then declaring that they don't have enough books that suit your tastes and that all there other books are hateful toward you. It's invading a community and then trying to demand it conform to your standards.

Again, I have nothing wrong with female gamers esposing their opinions toward the gaming industry. They are legitimately invested. But people like Anita Sarkeesian wouldn't care if the gaming industry collapsed overnight. (Not that the death/rape threats were warranted, the internet is a vile place.)

&gt;Sure, but society still gives males the upper hand, so no damage done, unlike perpetuating sexist stereotypes that are unfair towards women.

If you don't think that the over-the-top portrayal of some men in video games is just the same as the women's portrayal or today's fashion models, you're deluding yourself. A six pack on any male character is just as unrealistic as a women's hourglass figure. No one takes the evil British guy's accent seriously, I mean it was practically parodied in Star War: The Old Republic, but our society tends to see men as idealized in tough guy gentleman. Either that, or people wouldn't insist women be treated like princesses, rather than humans, nor would they make the ""chivalry is dead"" comment sound so negative as it was basically the idea that men should serve women and women let men serve them.  Of course, that is not to say that chivalry was especially liberating for women either.

Let's just put it this way, if you don't think male gender roles do damage, just like female gender roles do, I don't know what to say. Suffice it to say, this doesn't affect my original point about this and that is sane people should be able to realize that character portrayal in video games is far from realistic.

I don't think it's relevant.  And example is Pacman vs. Miss Pacman.  Pacman is male by default and adding a ribbon, mole and lipstick makes it female.  This is fantasy (you can't get more unrealistic than a pacman) but it projects what we think women to be which is men with decoration.  This wouldn't be harmful it it wasn't because since we are children we are taught that boys look good as they are, but girls must put stuff on to be feminine.  In a society where males and females used a comparable amount of accessories, makeup and decorations (or both wore non at all), the pacman/ms. pacman stereotyping would be a non issue.  

&gt; My biggest point here is when feminists that aren't gamers come into a gaming space, declare that their presence is needed, and presume to be some morally superior authority  

Let me understand your biggest point then.  
1) What if the feminist criticizing a certain stereotype is a gamer?  What makes a gamer, someone who you judge as caring or just someone who researched into the games only to identify the stereotypes?  
2) What if they are not entering a gaming space but using neutral territory like a newspaper, blog or youtube?  
3) Who is able to claim moral superiority and who isn't, apart from the above criteria?  

&gt; Anita Sarkeesian wouldn't care if the gaming industry collapsed overnight  

What if the points she makes are valid regardless?  (example is the pacman described above)  How is the same point different if a gamer states it, even if male?  
I disapprove of Sarkeesian's monetary interest in her activity, more profit-driven than with a true interest in females and males getting on better, but I do admit she did her homework and has many valid points (and many very bad ones).  If someone is a criminal, liar, thief and dishonest says something true, is it less true now?  

&gt; if you don't think male gender roles do damage, just like female gender roles do, I don't know what to say  

As I said before, it's context.  In a male-dominated society, sexist stereotypes against women are more harmful than sexist stereotypes against males.  If it were a female-dominated society then I am sure the same exact game would have other objections and other impact.  Hence the brits-are-evil analogy.  If the brits were a minority that were oppressed and segregated negatively, the death star accents would be unacceptable.  

&gt; character portrayal in video games is far from realistic  

But has an impact in society.  This doesn't mean every other aspect of sexist stereotyping in publicity, fashion, films, books, etc. is more acceptable, it just means that the gaming industry is not immune from criticism about their sexual stereotypes."	1.0	0.0	471	False	False

To affect any change, criticism will need to be levied by people in the market. Outside forces won't change anything, it will just cause a lot of annoying bickering on the internet. I think we agree here, but it's probably the biggest reason to discourage criticism under the banner of ""feminism"" and instead adopt a banner for female gamers.


My argument in favor of female gamers speaking out specifically and not just any feminist, is almost entirely based on Anita Sarkeesian. This is where I'm trying to draw the line, between the Anita Sarkeesians of the world and female gamers that are distraught with how gaming portrays women. It's more likely to get addressed by the gaming industry and it might actually get support from the community. As unlike having feminism invade a community and force change, you have the community changing itself and really it's just the way I see the issue, as intracommunity.

&gt;As I said before, it's context...

You attitude here sounds to me like a sort of cop out. ""Patriarchy, therefore your complaint is invalid."" While I would agree if you pointed out that men seem to be perfectly OK with their stereotype, and therefore we should work on women, you instead dismissed the issue out of hand. However, as another redditor pointed out to me, the male portrayal here represents a male power fantasy more than a female sexual fantasy, so I'm just going to drop the point as that is entirely correct as I can see.

&gt;But has an impact in society...

It seems I'm slowing being trapped into defending sexualizing women, and again, that's not something I want to do. I am simply trying to say it's not something that necessarily carries out of video games. A video game may say, ""go murder those guys with a shotgun, it's tons of fun"" and most of us realize that they would never mean to do so in real life. By the same logic, a video game may say, ""look at this woman with a large chest, she's hot"" but they don't actually mean real women look like that. If you want to say sexualizing characters is stupid, fine that makes sense, but I don't see how it has any affect outside of video games.

It is not really comparable to a commercial where they portray the women as entirely real. I guess I could see some argument for film since there are games that try to display a narrative, so I think that may be valid, but films tend to be portrayed much more realistically since they don't have silly game mechanics breaking suspension of disbelief."	0.0	0.0	464	False	False

&gt; men seem to be perfectly OK with their stereotype, and therefore we should work on women, you instead dismissed the issue out of hand  

I admit a well-based bias here.  Some males are upset about the females expectation  of a sixpack or brave attitude in the same way some females are upset about expectation on large breasts or small waists.  I agree with this.  This is the statement of ""gender equality"" which we agree on.  

A different issue is feminism.  Feminism is more specific than (and can coexist with) gender equality, it focuses on a subset of this which I would describe as ""the component of gender inequality that lessens females or puts them at a disadvantage in an already male dominated society"".  

So yes, Conan the Barbarian might make a slightly fat black guy, or a small shy nonviolent caucasian uncomfortable, and this is a victimization by stereotype and I criticize this too.  But this is another topic.  The two victims of Conan's stereotype will still have the social advantage of being male.  

Feminism focuses on how this influences against women's place in society, that's all.  These two focuses are not mutually exclusive, but you and I can both understand that those specializing in the issue with the highest number of victims have a point worth considering.  

With the rest of your points I agree with.  Ads, publicity campaigns and hollywood stereotypes are much more relevant than gaming ones, but this doesn't mean gaming ones are good, it just means that the priorities might lie elsewhere.  The fact heroin and cocaine are very harmful doesn't make smoking healthy or good, we can oppose them all and people focusing on smoking are not wrong only because there exists a greater harm.  I consider myself a feminist only in that I am aware of what trends are harmful for females, admitting that a female in New York has it better in every aspect than a male in Congo, but this doesn't mean you should get away with segregating that female in new york.  It's subtle, I admit, but still worth standing for."	2.0	0.0	433	False	True	8.0

I think the fundamental issue you're encountering is that you don't understand how investigations like this work.

You need first to understand the agencies and players (the cast of characters, if you will):

* The Ferguson Police Department
* The St. Louis County Police Department
* The Office of the Prosecuting Attorney, St. Louis County
* The US Department of Justice
* The Missouri State Highway Patrol

Now, you need to understand how they intersect.

The Ferguson Police Department employed the officer involved in the shooting. As soon as the shooting occurred, they called in the St. Louis County PD, and turned over the shooting investigation to them.

The St. Louis County PD is the lead agency on the SHOOTING investigation. They report their findings to the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney.

The PA's office is the final say for the release of any and all information about the shooting investigation. If they don't approve it for release, it's not released.

The DOJ is conducting a parallel civil rights investigation, and performing about a million interviews. In perhaps the first recorded occasion of this EVER happening, their agents are going door to door.

The MSHP is the lead agency for running the combined unit that's responding to the riots and looting. They have nothing to do with the shooting investigation whatsoever.

Now, as you know, the public is clamoring for the release of the shooting investigation and associated documentation (including the autopsy report). The PA's office has repeatedly refused to release any of this information, and has clearly laid out the circumstances upon which they will release it.

The Ferguson PD, who had no part of this investigative process, and does not control the report or the release of it, literally can't do anything.

The analogy would be that you and my friend Pete are on a street corner. I ask you for some gummy bears, you tell me Pete has them, Pete's dad says I can't have any, and in response I burn your house down.

Now, as to the video and investigation of the strong-arm robbery. This is a case that DOES belong to the Ferguson PD. They investigated it, collected evidence, and then asked the PA's office for what is called exceptional clearance. 

Exceptionally Cleared means that we know who did it, but because of exceptional means (death, usually), there is no reason to continue the investigation or prosecution.

Once the PA's office signs off on the exceptional clearance, the Ferguson PD released the report and evidence to the media, pursuant to the poorly-worded FOIA request from a media member. 

People are upset because they, like you, don't understand why things are done the way they're done.

For more information on why the Ferguson PD officer has not yet been charged, please see this fantastic article from our friends at St. Louis Public Radio:

It's tempting to want to agree with you, for the simple reason that we do indeed come out on top in most measurements of happiness, wealth, and a number of other statistics.

There are some frequently cited drawbacks, however:

1. The ""Jante Law"" culture, which is a variant of the ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"", where excellence is actively discouraged.

2. The sometimes excessive xenophobia, indicating that the model largely works because of a high level of trust between citizens, and between citizens and the state. The introduction of foreign elements, where trust isn't an integral part of the culture, could theoretically sabotage the efficacy of the model.

3. The ""Low Expectations"" critique — maybe we're so damn happy because we don't expect much of life, and therefore real outcomes tend to match or exceed our expectations. Maybe our culture would create ""happiness"" under different circumstances as well, indicating that the model itself isn't what's creating these statistics, but rather some other factor, like culture or even genetics (as suggested by some admittedly fringe theories).

4. The wealth of Scandinavian countries is also the result of the same mechanisms that have created wealth in the rest of Europe, including most prominently exploitative colonialism. While Scandinavian countries were only minor colonial powers (most notably Denmark), they all benefited massively from trade with stronger colonial powers, like The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and to an extent Germany. The Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn't necessarily created the wealth in the first place.

I don't particularly agree with all these criticisms, but they're worth considering.

One relevant question, though: Do you think the Nordic Model is *the best possible system* or just *the best we have at the moment*? I think any Swede, Dane and Norwegian would say that they can point to flaws in our individual systems. Someone is always going to be at least a little bit dissatisfied, but allowing yourself to think that ""this is the best we can do"" is harmful, because our societies *do* have real problems as well, even if they're slightly smaller problems than some other nations face.

One specific problem that I'm familiar with, because I'm Danish, is the fact that Danish societal coherence is largely based on *ethnic* and *cultural* homogeneity. This means that even if Denmark is doing great in the globalised economy, it is facing a massive *cultural* struggle, because there is no concept of Danish national identity that doesn't prescribe a very specific ethnic and cultural background. In a globalised world of many ethnicities, this becomes a real problem that manifests itself both in very high levels of xenophobia, but also in perpetual cultural insecurity, which makes it difficult to interact with people from other backgrounds. This is how the idiom of the ""duck pond"" (*andedam*) in Danish has emerged, as a metaphor not just for the country itself but for the slightly self-obsessed and self-important mentality of the Danes.

Compare this with American national identity, which is to a large degree grounded in the Constitution of the United States of America, its rights, freedoms, and institutions, rather than any specific ethnicity or culture [although obviously a distinct American culture has emerged over the last century]. This isn't to downplay racial issues in America, but the point is that Danish minority identities aren't even hyphenated. It's ""The Danes"" and ""The Muslims"", not ""The Danish Muslims""."	398.0	0.0	576	False	True	0.0

&gt; reduces poverty which benefits everyone.

Reduced poverty does indeed benefit everyone but when poverty rates are calculated the same way between advanced economies they are largely indistinguishable from one another, there is a fairly good analysis including some history [here](https://www.chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/economic-science-institute/_files/ifree-papers-and-photos/PriceFishback.pdf).

Largely where the US differs from other advanced economies is that our programs tend to be non-universal other then for old age transfers (which is the reverse of the rest of the world as it is universal where it generally isn't elsewhere), programs like public health are means tested where they are not elsewhere.

&gt; High level of education

The US actually has an identical tertiary enrollment rate to all the Nordic countries.

A fairly persistent problem in the US (its existed since the 80's) and to a lesser extent elsewhere is that even with a rise in education skills acquisition has been relatively flat, while people are entering and graduating from tertiary education at increased rates their marketable skills are not increasing. The problem here is caused by insufficient information being available to those embarking on tertiary education, they don't understand what the future value of their skills will be so make poor choices regarding which skills to acquire.

&gt; highly efficient administration

They are efficient due to their size, states of the same size are similarly efficient.

&gt; effectively invests into the society

You would have a hard time justifying the US doesn't also do so but just in different ways. Public science &amp; healthcare R&amp;D spending in the US is extraordinarily high compared to every other advanced economy (EG - The vast majority, nearly 90%, of worldwide public vaccine research spending is in the US), NiH and NSF actually fund research in the Nordic countries too.

&gt; providing multiple incentives

Which often fail. One of the reasons why Sweden went in a different direction in the 90's is due to their persistently high structural unemployment, having double digit unemployment even in a boom is a significant problem and poses a very significant mobility issue. In many of the countries today they are finding similar problems in education, people are becoming perpetual students obtaining degrees because they can rather then there is actually any value to them doing so.

&gt; angles of growth

Growth in Nordic countries is certainly below potential but more significant globalization creates a great deal of interaction between countries economies such that high growth countries with significant trade will necessarily increase growth in other countries. There is a good paper on the Nordic vs US models from this perspective [here](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/varieties_of_capitalism_april_9_2013.pdf).

&gt; Low level of income inequality

Beyond the moral case its hard to make a case for inequality being bad, its simply not causal with any negative economic outcomes. Poverty &amp; mobility are the issues which actually do impact outcomes but always seem to take a back seat.

&gt; low crime

Check out Northern New England. US national figures are biased by a couple of places (DC particularly) which have very high crime rates.

&gt; good healthcare

Different healthcare then the US, better accessibility but lower quality of care; it largely depends on how you consider healthcare issues.

Beyond political reports we really don't rank healthcare systems of advanced economies, they all have good quality of care and all respond to local lifestyle &amp; political factors. The US is expensive but offers a wider array of treatment options then other countries, there are simply too many points of bias for any ranking to be useful so they are largely considered to be equivalent.

&gt; great education

Agreed, we spend the 2nd highest per child in the world and perform shockingly badly. K-12 is in desperate need of reform.

&gt; But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing

This is does do, nearly half of total world capital is available in the US. Net capital flows in advanced economies is towards to the US rather then away from it. As a good example even the European pharma's perform the majority of their R&amp;D in the US (EG - Most of GSK's R&amp;D is in MA). Capital created in the Nordic countries will typically end up in the UK or US.

&gt; sustainable economic growth.

As a quibble there is no such thing, all non-artificial growth is good for everyone. If we had a magic wand which would add 5% to growth immediate we should wave it, higher wages, reduced prices relative to incomes etc.

A better intermediate model which largely accomplishes what you are likely looking for would be the German system. Their healthcare system is incredible, the works council system is incredible (but currently illegal in the US) and while I don't think we need to legislate it in the same way the shared prosperity principles are really interesting.

Being 19, I only have limited experience, and as far as I know, grown-ups are worse at this than teenagers. 

In my own experience, people will test everyone's confidence all the time. Every time anyone tries anything new, from wearing a shit with an abnormal print on it, to doing feces-related performance-art. People will always try and make fun of you, to see if you are confident in your own choices.

Grown-ups are worse, as far as I know, my mom being a well-educated American woman really annoyed a lot of people. She was trying her best to excel at her job, working overtime and studying besides her job, to get better at it, this didn't sit well with a lot of people. It went so far that even her boss would try and prevent her from improving. She since quit, because of a major bullying problem. At her new job she is one of the most important people in the municipality, yet they still refuse her a full-employment. 

If you think this sounds just like ""people being assholes"", it really is something slightly different. Even the government realizes the problem of shooting down anyone who excels at anything, to the point where public school teachers are teaching kids that you should remember to congratulate people who do stuff well. Even going so far as to actively talk about ""combating the Jante-law""."	121.0	0.0	251	False	True	2.0

As others have pointed out, there's a strong argument to be made that culture is a major factor in your success. I think that if we're going to look for a ""best"" socioeconomic model, we should look for one that's more generally applicable - one that isn't tightly tied to a particular culture and a cohesive, homogeneous national identity.

It turns out that there's a model that fits that description quite well. [Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) looks a lot like the Scandinavian countries on measures of [happiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report), [education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index), [life expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy), [economic mobility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility), and [GDP per capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita), and is [relatively close on income inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality). It's also an aggressively [multicultural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism_in_Canada) nation of [immigrants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada) which specifically [rejects the need for homogeneity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mosaic). Because of this, the Canadian economic, educational, and legal systems aren't built on shared identity and trust, but rather on a sort of consequentialist pragmatism. Canada tends - in general terms, over a multi-decadal time scale - to adopt policies that work and discard ones that don't. In this it contrasts sharply not only with its idealistic southern neighbours, but also with the differently-idealistic political culture of Scandinavia.

So I think you should consider Canada's model as a more generally-applicable candidate."	2.0	0.0	212	False	True	0.0

Arguably progression is fueled by those who refused to be content.

It appears that the culture in Denmark is one that try's to reinforce the feeling that people should be content. That they need not stray from the norms of society. 

In theory if this was applied universally, we would not have much of what we have today, especially in the sciences and in innovation. It was the people who refused to see the world ""as is"" and viewed it as a world that could be changed that created much of what we have now. Religion was the obstruction to those choosing to be different, historically. If you were not inline with the religious majority, you were shunned. Similarly in the Danish society it appears that if you are not inline with the Danish culture you too shall be shunned. 

In regards to being humble or being arrogant it's neither. It's more so  adhering to the ""status quo"". Don't think you are better, because we are striving for a homogeneous society of equals. Straying away from the socially approved behavior, will in turn make you against the Danish way of life. 

The consequence of this is a society that stunts ""thinking outside of the box"". The ""if it isn't broke don't fix it mentality"" makes people who try to ""fix it"" oppressed by those who do not appreciate them for straying from the cultural norm. 

As /u/simonask points out, much of the Danish success was from trade with the colonial powers. As he says ""the Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn't necessarily created the wealth in the first place."" The creation of that wealth in a globalized economy is achieved through innovation. One example of this is the progression of alternative energy. If the Oil rich countries continue to rely on the historical cash cow of oil, without exploring new ideas. They will be left behind by those looking for alternatives. Similarly without relying on creation the Danes risk being left behind. 

To summarize, restricting people from wanting to be the best, will restrict them from wanting to go against the norm. Without going against the norm there will be no progression, which can cause a negative affect on society. "	12.0	0.0	386	False	False

We already require guilty verdicts beyond reasonable doubt to send people to prison, to stay there for life or be executed. And yet innocent people are constantly ending up there by accident. You can't say torture is OK only if we know for a fact they're guilty because we can never know. Everyone on death row is there because we KNEW they were guilty. Except some aren't. As technology advances and cases are revisited we continually free wrongly imprisoned people.

If torture is only allowed for the TRULY guilty, does that mean that everyone else in the system is only KINDA guilty? It doesn't work like that. Everyone must be judged as being 100% truly guilty to receive a punishment.

really? a democracy in which only white, male natives to the country who had completed military service could vote is a ""true"" democracy? and Athens was one city-state. the US is a country that spans a continent and has MANY times the population and diversity of Athens.

&gt; A direct online representative democracy would work better than a republic now that the internet exists

whether a direct democracy would work better than an indirect democracy is better is a question independent of the existence of the internet. here are a few points against direct democracy itself that i find convincing:

* the rapid voting of a direct democracy would make policies and laws very sporadic and inconsistent. changes in laws, government, and the economy usually take many years to show if they are better worse for society, so the time between elections gives us time to appraise the officials we elect and their policies. for example, support of the death penalty usually spikes shortly after a horrific crime, since people want to see the criminal punished as harshly as possible, but swiftly drops as time passes. so policies would just be a constant to and fro swing in accordance to the immediate popular mood, to no helpful effect

* direct democracy is mob rule. minority groups would be shut out of the political process and picked apart by majorities, thus lacking proper representation of the full population. conversely, if there is a minority group that is extremely passionate about a bill, many of them will turn out to vote, possibly more than everyone else because everyone else didn't care enough to vote. thus the minority would then get their way purely out of the apathy of the majority. and we should expect low turnouts on many votes, considering how you cant expect every citizen to feel strongly about or simply even understand every bill or law proposed, every time it is proposed."	1.0	0.0	437	False	False

Sorry, ""true"" is loaded language.  I meant, direct, where people vote on issues rather than representatives.

&gt;the rapid voting of a direct democracy would make policies and laws very sporadic and inconsistent. 

This is 100% true, but I think this is something that could be worked out through voting on the policy of the system itself.  Monetary policy could be voted on every 4 years or something.  As it stands, the public has no direct input into monetary policy at all.

&gt;a great many people are already not welly informed or interested in politics

In my system, people wouldn't have time to pay attention to votes they don't care about.  And the corporations would have to launch a campaign for every issue instead of just funding/paying off a few candidates.

&gt;minority groups would be shut out of the political process and picked apart by majorities

I tend to agree, and you're the closest that anyone's gotten to changing my view. But I think that the low turnouts would tend to be a feature.  The minorities could get shut out if both sides are passionate, but if the majority just doesn't care much, they will probably have their way much quicker than if they have to get a majority of people in congress paying attention to and agreeing on something that most people don't care about.

is it perhaps true that maybe some things *shouldn't* be changeable? the years between voting, for example? because you yourself said the years between voting could be voted on. and what if when those 4 years are up, the people decide now they only want 2 years between voting? and after that, 1 year? 6 years? a decade? the inconsistency wont stop. and when it comes to monetary legislation, is that a bad thing that we don't get a say? if we did, what would we say? what would 316 million people who have no idea what the first thing about monetary legislation say? do you honestly trust every single person to take the considerable time and effort to receive a proper understanding of the intricacies of monetary legislation, and then cast a well informed and welly thought out vote on it? or do you think no one will, and will instead remain ignorant and clueless, and jump on to whatever is suggested to them by mass hype (which we've established is very inconsistent and sporadic), advertising campaigns, and personal bias? you know, **just like they do now**?

&gt; In my system, people wouldn't have time to pay attention to votes they don't care about. And the corporations would have to launch a campaign for every issue instead of just funding/paying off a few candidates

that still doesn't clear up the issue with the lack of representation. If anything, that's just a tacit admission that a large part of legislation wont be decided by a majority vote, like you desire, but by the whim of a few, independent from the majority of people, like you accuse representative democracy of doing. at least in a rep. democracy, the majority consent to these few having the legislative power, since they voted for them. and i doubt companies will pour so much time and resources into EVERY issue. after all, many issues will be ignored by the majority of people (as has been established) who don't really care about it, and will thus be completely at the whim of minorities already devout to a particular position, one which they aren't likely to change if it differs from what the corporation wants, regardless of any advertising to the contrary. instead, they will pour it into the big, important issues that hold many people's passion and attention, **just like they do now** in our current system. so companies will just ignore the smaller, trivial, unalterable votes and still push for only a few big things, just in your system it will be for the legislation itself instead of a candidate.

&gt;  I think that the low turnouts would tend to be a feature

low turnouts on voting, in a society whose progress and activity is decided solely on voting, is a very bad feature

&gt;  they will probably have their way much quicker than if they have to get a majority of people in congress paying attention to and agreeing on something that most people don't care about...it would be a major task to get congress to pay attention to something like that

but is that necessarily a good thing? what if the minority wants a bad thing? speed isn't the point. ensuring good, agreed upon legislation is the point. even if it is good legislation, like your native american example, it is still unfair for anyone besides the majority of the pouplation to have such power in a majority-wins system. i mean, doesn't the notion of a minority having unfettered decision making power undermine the notion of majority rule, the point of direct democracy and everything you want in your system?

The United States government is far and away the largest lender of student loans.  Private market lenders will likely act as you describe, but there's no reason the government has to.  They do money-losing things all the time.  IIRC, something like 3/4 of student loan dollars come from the feds.

Second, student loans used to be bankruptable.  There were some scandals with med students finishing school and promptly filing BK.  

Discretionary authority exists among bankruptcy judges already to refuse discharge of debts entered into when the debtor planned to file, for example.  That authority could be expanded on and guidelines established to look specifically at immediate post-graduation/disnerollment bankruptcies.

Another possible solution would be to require that student loans can only be discharged through Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  On Chapter 13, you have to enter a payment plan and live on a pretty strict budget, with all excess income going to your debts for 3-5 years.

But I think that bringing student loans into a well-established legal institution for dealing with debt is a good idea in the long run, even if some special rules need to be adopted to prevent abuses.  "	13.0	0.0	232	False	True	2.0

If so, would you also agree that we should only ever drink things out of sippy cups or Contigo travel mugs?  

But aside from that, here are some things to consider:

* The wide base of a wine glass makes more of a difference than you'd think.  Objects tip over once their centre of gravity is no longer directly above part of the base.  This angle is pretty much the same as many other glasses.  Obviously mugs are more stable, but aside from that there isn't that much difference.  [Here's what I mean](http://imgur.com/a/49p26) - the angle from this point to the edge of the base is equal to the angle you'd need to tip the glass before it fell over.

* I have successfully cleaned thousands of wine glasses and never had a single problem with breakage. 
* Because the top lip of the glass curves inwards, spills from the liquid sloshing around is less likely.  
* The thin glass of a wine glass makes it lighter and easier to carry around for long periods of time, which is good for times when one is socializing at cocktail parties and whatnot.
* Wine glasses can be held at the top of the stem without using the entire hand.  Again, good for social events where one might be holding a plate of food, shaking someone's hand, and accepting a business card all at the same time.
* Wine glasses look elegant.
* The curvature of the glass is more conducive to sipping, and makes it easier to savour the wine.  This allows for a fuller appreciation of the wine's flavours and allows the aromas to collect right under your nose.  This sipping motion also makes moderation easier."	10.0	0.0	311	False	True	0.0

What he means by that statement is that ideas do not exist in a void. For example, take this comment. You are reading the words I've typed into a comment on this post in the change my view section of the larger reddit website. Presumably you are reading it in a web browser on some type on internet enabled electronic device. Each step of the process modifies how you perceive the content and imposes additional meaning on my message. 

If you took this discussion and transplanted it to another website, your perception of it would be altered based on how you perceive the website. For McLuhan it was more than simply the physical form the content takes. The publisher matters, the author matters, the typeface matters, the supporting art matters.

If this thread was on 4chan, how would you evaluate it? What if it was in the online edition of the Wall Street Journal? How about Vox, The Daily Mail, or Yahoo News? Each of these sources color our perception of the content and that is what McLuhan means by the ""medium is the message"".

With that in mind I have to take issue with each of your statements.

&gt; Reading print media makes us more educated, as opposed to the digital media we revel in today.

To apply McLuhan's lense to this situation you would have to be more specific. If two people read the same article, one digitally and the other in print, neither would be more educated than the other. They would have different perceptions of the significance of what they've read but both would have the same information.

&gt; Playing violent video games and watching violent films makes us more violent.

For every study saying that statement is true, there is an equal and opposite study saying it's false. The fact is when you zoom out, humans have become less violent as a whole.

&gt; Watching television makes us less social.

It makes it easier to be anti-social but watching television does not require us to be less social. Many times discussing television gives people who would not have otherwise interacted a common ground they can build relationships on. Social groups also form around television and can be a great way for people who otherwise find it difficult to meet people to socialize.

I'll take on your argument here though. I've been meaning to look into this more in depth anyway.

So I disagree with you that (1) does not matter. The only way for me to say that it is worse to kill a baby cow than an adult cow is to say that there are degrees of badness in killing animals, and that requires me to be able to say that it can be bad to kill an animal, otherwise I could only say that it is not bad to kill animals, and there could be no degree of immorality in that scenario. And I think you must admit that there are degrees of such, as my neighbor's pet dog is clearly much happier than a calf in a veal crate, and you have said that happiness and suffering does matter in animals. The question is then, does the calf suffer more than your average beef cow?

Now while I think you under-estimate the cow's ability to feel pain, I don't think I need to press this point so much as the difference between a veal calf's reality and a standard beef cow's. Beef cows do spend time outside. Here's an [EPA article](http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/beefphases.html) on the subject. However, the outside they spend time in often does not have grass, and is only a feedlot. During winter they can be confined inside, and also confined a few months before slaughter to help fatten them up. They are most often dehorned as well, without anesthetic. However, veal calves not only experience all this, (94% of dairy calves are dehorned, while about 17% of those calves are given anesthetic. [Page 109](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_ir_CalfHealth.pdf). There's no debate that dehorning causes pain.) but must do so *while being starved and confined in a crate for the entirety of their life.* So I think we can say that veal calves suffer at least twice as much as your average beef cow.

Duration of suffering matters too though. So how long is that miserable calf's existence? The MSPCA says veal calves suffer [for about 18 weeks](http://www.mspca.org/programs/animal-protection-legislation/animal-welfare/farm-animal-welfare/factory-farming/cows/veal-calves-on-a-factory-farm.html), or 4.5 months before slaughter, and since the age of veal calves is such a contentious issue, pretty much all sources have the same number. I couldn't find any official data on beef cows, (or steers), but scouring around forums gives me about 18 months for commercially raised, non-grass fed beef. ([1](http://www.homesteadingtoday.com/livestock-forums/cattle/235359-age-slaughter-steer.html),[2](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/beef-farming/page-7),[3](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/feeding-cattle.html)).

So the numbers add up quite nicely, 18/4.5 = 4, meaning steers suffer for 4 times as long as veal calves before slaughter. So the suffering of 1 veal calf is 1 unit, and a steer is 4 units. However, (and there is official USDA data on this, thank god), we get about [880 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/BD7FAEF0-CFC8-3E27-A0EB-67C04E8FB488) of edible meat per beef cow, and only about [175 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/4D51FF2B-04BC-3312-8D46-ED424F7C2D01) per veal calf. 880/175 = ~5, meaning per lb of meat you eat, you cause a 5x longer duration of suffering for veal calves. do the math and we have 5 units of suffering per lb of veal eaten, and 4 units per lb of beef. This is purely on a basis of duration, not intensity, of suffering... even though as I've argued above, we have good reason to believe that veal calves suffer more. So you would have to actually argue not only that veal calves don't suffer more, but that they actually *suffer less*, in order to justify the view that eating veal is no worse than eating beef.

On top of that, every purchase of veal covers a negative expense of the dairy industry. If we stopped paying for veal, not only would the dairy industry lose its profits, but it would actually suffer, as it would still be producing calves, simply not selling them. Whereas if we were to stop buying burgers, the beef industry would stop raising cattle, and would lose profits, but not actually go into debt.

And finally, there's a great practical reason to consider veal worse than beef, once again, *even if the suffering is the same.* Imagine I give you the opportunity to live in two societies. One in which it is considered just as bad to kill an adult as it is a baby, and one in which it is considered worse to kill a baby than an adult. I think it's clear that a society that considers cruelty to adults not as bad as cruelty to children would be a better society, for indirect reasons such as the need to protect children more, and the moral innocence of children, and by saying that there's nothing worse in killing a baby for food than there is in killing an adult, you're supporting a worse society, however rational your view may seem at surface.

All things considered, I think there's very good reason to find killing baby cows for food more immoral than killing adult cows, even though both are clearly immoral."	16.0	0.0	835	False	True	0.0

The dog was domesticated somewhere between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago while man existed as a hunter gatherer, by comparison the cow, sheep, and pig was domesticated around 8,000 years ago and are tied with man's development of agriculture. So we have had a relationship with dogs for at least twice as long as any of the animals we use as a food source. This also shows that we never intended them as a livestock animal since we literally had not developed that concept at the time.


15,000 years ago man and wolves filled much the same niche and had many similarities, both traveled in nomadic packs hunting much the same animals, even our social structures are remarkably similar. It has been theorized that the domestication of wolves was not some thing we actively did but rather a gradual symbiosis. Wolves fed on our scraps and wolves less aggressive to us thrived while more aggressive ones failed. Wolves following our tribes served as a deterrent to larger predators and a free alarm system notifying us of any approaching threat. Eventually we began to work together to bring down prey. Wolves became dogs and we welcomed them into our huts and our families.

 At no point is there evidence of us using them directly as a food source except when no other sources were available. In fact meat eaters like dogs are terrible animals to use as direct food animals, every time you move up the food chain a step the amount of meat for resources required to create it diminishes dramatically. Essentially it takes a given amount of energy to grow grass which comes from the sun, a pig eating that grass can only convert a small portion of that total energy into meat, and a dog eating that pig can only convert a even smaller portion of the energy from that meat into its own meat. Carnivores are just not designed to put on weight like herbivores. For this reason actual farming of dogs is horribly inefficient and completely uneconomical. This  is why so many of the dogs for this festival are kidnapped instead of farmed, it's the only truly viable way to provide that much meat. What is the purpose of growing perfectly edible meat to feed to dogs which will produce exponentially less meat than you originally fed them for a product (dog meat) that from everything I've heard is not exponentially better.

 Since dogs make for terrible livestock instead we bred them to depend on us emotionally and to see us as members of their pack. Dogs have several abilities which uniquely augment our own such as speed, loyalty, intelligence, sharper senses, and hunting ability. Dogs and humans are the only animals that use visual cues to communicate, it certainly was not inherent in them before domestication and is not in any other domesticated animal showing that we viewed them as closer to equals to be communicated with than livestock to be slaughtered. We used these dogs to help us survive in a very harsh world by aiding us in hunting and protection. Dogs literally put food on our table and watched over us while we slept for thousands of years. In recent years dogs have been much less critical to our success as a species but still provide many valuable functions. In a very real sense our species and theirs are for no better word ""married"" we have developed an bond, depended on, and provided for each other in a symbiotic relationship that goes far deeper than any other domesticated animal for tens of thousands of years. 


TL:DR
Essentially Dogs were never intended to be livestock like pigs and cows. They would be horribly inefficient if we used them that way due to their carnivore nature, which means if a ready supply of pets to be stolen did not exist it's likely this festival would also not exist for lack of supply.  A tradition of eating dog can only ever thrive on the immorality of stealing dogs or incredibly uneconomical waste of resources farming them. We also have a deep and inherent debt to them for protecting, feeding, and loving us for far longer than recorded human history. All of these things are unique to dogs and show why eating dog is not the same as eating pig, but rather a betrayal of all that they have done for us over the last 15-30 thousand years.

And this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name ""Montegue-Capulet"" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.

Of course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).

In summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating.

The single-last-name-of-father system likely feels most correct to you because it (a) is most familiar and (b) gives you the most benefits while asking the fewest concessions. First, you know that you have an ingrained and biased preference about names: you prefer your wife and children take your name, but would feel uncomfortable or disappointed by the opposite. This is not a topic on which you are neutral and simply trying to find the easiest universal system.

As a measure of clarity – who is related to whom – hyphenating provides *more* information. The single-last-name system obscures familial relationships in comparison.

As a measure of legal identity – how many people share your name – hyphenating makes each name more distinct. 

I too work in an industry where I deal with thousands of names and families. The single last name system does not allow me to know “who is related to who” at anything better than an educated guess. I know dozens of families who share last names but no close relation. I know dozens of blended families. I know dozens of guardians who don’t share names with children, and committed couples who are not married. I also know siblings who get mistaken for spouses, and spouses who have been mistaken for siblings. Helping strangers make assumptions based on a single last name seems like the weakest possible defense. 

As a matter of personal identity – the right of a couple to determine family identity and choose names that are appropriate, representative, and meaningful – having a range of possibilities means couples can make a decision about how they understand their family construction. Group labeling and identity are incredibly strong sociological forces. 

As a measure of ease – spelling, length – that consideration does not exist in any other naming context, and it becomes absurd to try to impose the ease standard universally. If your wife had a much shorter last name than you, would it be inconsiderate to give your own name to your children? Is it unnecessarily complicated to give children a first name with more than one syllable? Is it unacceptable to name your child after your French mother if the name may be difficult for American businesses? 

Maybe more to he point, though, the difference in ease between the most complex and most simple names I have *ever* written has been minor - a dozen letters, a double-check on spelling, a confirmation. Literally a difference of a few seconds. 

While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

I do see nods to individual choice in your post, but only if you never have to interact with a world where people choose differently than you. 

Women should not have to take their husband’s name, but you only want to marry a woman who will. Men should have the option to take their wife’s name, but you'll never consider it. Children can have either parent's name, as long as yours have *only* their father's. Gay couples need ways to build family identity, but only if you don't have to see a hyphenated name.

You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. 

Also, as a side-note, it is a pretty well-documented phenomenon that people are less likely to change a position after taking a public stance. You begin by saying you have “had a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names.” If you have expressed “joking” superiority or derision towards people who do not like the same names you like, then you may feel compelled to justify that you were just smarter all along, rather than arbitrarily judgmental or dickish.

Tipping essentially cuts out the middle man, and allows you to directly pay the person providing you with a service instead of giving your money to the business, having the business take its cut, and then giving some of that money back to the employees. 

As for why you should have to, well, technically you don't (unless the restaurant/business includes a tip as a part of your bill). If tipping was eliminated then you would probably see an increase in the price of tipped services to make up for the increased wages of servers. In other words, your $10 cheeseburger might go up to $12 to make up for the 20% tip that people don't leave anymore. So instead of paying $10 with a $2 tip for that cheeseburger, you're paying $12 with no tip so the restaurant can pay its servers more than $3/hr. On top of that, the servers don't have as much of an incentive to provide top notch service since they'll be making the same amount regardless. You're drinks might take longer to get refilled, or your food might take longer to be brought to you. You're still paying the same amount, but now you're getting worse service."	10.0	0.0	239	False	False

If people did not tip and servers had to earn their living from only wages, food prices would increase to compensate the additional cost required to sustain the servers.  In addition to this, not tipping is typically frowned upon because the stiff is disregarding the server's humanity.

Eliminating the tip would not save money for anyone in the long run because restaurants will simply up the price of their food. Imagine a scenario in which one had to pay $10 + at least 20% tips, thus raising the price to $12. If tipping ceased, the restaurant would simply raise the initial price of the food to $12. The consumer still has to pay the same amount. However, under the tip system, servers can try to provide better service because they have an incentive for doing so. Tipping helps both the consumer and the server, and as such, it is more preferrable to tip than provide a base wage.

The server is paid a base wage of +/- $2/hour to ensure that they walk home with at least something. It's a protection of their income stability, much like how many salespeople of supermarkets like Walmart are paid much lower than what the skill demands because salespeople make commission. The base wage for a server is not meant to sustain the server. It is only meant to be used as a backup if income from tips is too low. Servers actually earn their money from providing and enhancing a good service by taking away plates and bringing food to the customer. Keep in mind that when consumers pay the price tag for the meal, they are paying only for the cook's labor and the cost of the ingredients. Tips are not factored in because they provide an incentive for servers to give giving a better service. While you may argue that cooks should be tipped too under this logic because then cooks have an incentive to cook better, the action is simply unrealistic to implement because a cook spends most of his or her time optimizing efficiency in the kitchen. To have to deal with tips is to immediately handicap the maximum achievement the cooks can accomplish.

People who serve are doing so to sustain their families. They try to provide the best service because they need something from you: money. A person who does not tip goves everyone else around him or her that he or she is rich, but chooses to spend cheaply anyway. It's a rude gesture, especially when someone else (the server) is expending a reasonable effort to provide the consumer with a better environment surrounding a meal. Tipping shows some respect to the server, which is arguably more important than saving $2 here and there. It's common knowledge that people didn't pay for the service up front and that stiffing the server results in making the server's life harder to live."	1.0	0.0	497	False	True	0.0

In regards to the incentive: this is what frustrates me, there shouldn't have to be an incentive of 'extra money' in my opinion. You are paid to provide a service already and that's your wage. If the wage isn't suitable, then perhaps a call for change is in order? On top of that, if you're doing a shitty job 'cause you know you're going to get paid at the end of the day is surely bad service, and should be fired? 

Why isn't the system changed to meet the requirements and produce a solid pay, rather than the wait staff depending on money to determine their wage?

I would say most servers are happy with this, however. Due to the still-pretty-low minimum wage in the U.S., most servers you come across will actually be opposed to abolishing tipped wages. Even with the criminally low tipped wage of $2.13/hr, a server's tips will, on average, still be much, much higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr

Servers will be more than happy to take the $2/hr wage because it will actually average out to something more like $15-$20 an hour thanks to the tipping culture that has been established here.

If the federal minimum wage was a livable wage and tipping wages were abolished, I'd say there would be a good chance of eventually moving away from tipping culture.


Until this is the case, however, all you're doing by not tipping at least 10% is taking away the wages of the server who is taking care of you, as income taxes and such often take away 100% of the hourly wage of these employees, if you spend an hour in a restaurant and don't leave a tip, chances are the server had to pay out of his own pocket in order to provide you their service, and that's a pretty shitty feeling."	3.0	0.0	257	False	True	2.0

**I. This method is not effective**

I think the most convincing argument in favor of the BLM protesters is that it worked. Sanders was forced/convinced to release a more comprehensive platform on racial violence in this country due to the vast amount of flack he has been given by BLM, both recently and at netroots. 

Secondly, you say

&gt;It succeeds when the minds of the general populace are changed at a high rate toward the verbalized cause. Through the witnessing of such actions and protests, suddenly the people turn their gaze toward those in power, who feel the stare of everyone looking at them, oppressing them with genuine and widespread mistrust of their stances. The people display a collective ""what are you going to do about it now?"" and the power of those at the top is actually threatened by the people who support them from below.

But I think we are already at that point. Most people recognize that there is a systemic problem in the way policing works that makes excessive force more likely to occur and to go without punishment, and most people also recognize that police violence is disproportionately focused on people of color, specifically black bodies.

What we are lacking is concrete policy proposals by those in power to alleviate the distress of the population, and that is what the BLM protesters accomplished.

**II. This method is targeting the wrong people**

I think you are wrong to say Sander's supporters are pro-BLM. The huge backlash on reddit has shown, not only to this event but also to the shooting yesterday in Ferguson, judging by top comments in large/default subs such as /r/news, has been overwhelmingly anti-black, and anti-BLM. You may say this was because of the specific tactic, but more often then not the criticism was leveled at the movement itself with this incident being the trigger for the anger, not the cause.

Secondly, Bernie Sanders has come to represent the new ""champion of liberalism/ progressivism"" in America, and as such needs to be held to a high standard. His comments at netroots and his whole platform of worker solidarity are seen by many to push racial issues under the rug of income inequality or the fight against ""capitalism."" To many, this is not seen as an adequate response, and because of these tactics, Bernie has clarified his views and updated his platform.

The biggest obstacle for Sanders to win a nomination is outreach to minorities, a demographic with which he currently polls very poorly with (I think in large part due to the attitude of his supporters). These incidents and his response have shown to help both sides, appeasing BLM and helping hammer out a better platform on police violence.

**III. These are not mutually exclusive**

Finally, your view states that they did not take certain avenues of action into consideration, however, there is no reason you cannot do both as one does not sacrifice the other. You can raise awareness and confront leaders.

It would be interesting to see what his thoughts are currently, 11 years later. StubHub was only 4 years old at the time of this but it does give a nice look into some of the economics of ticket pricing. It seems to agree that tickets are bit of a different animal than a commodity and also mentioned how the system in 2002 was very inefficient. 

I agree with his conclusion that ticket scalping will always exist. He also addresses my fears of insider trading. I think/hope there will ultimately be an improved system for resale.

At the end of the day Person A who bought their ticket from the original sale and Person B who bought it off StubHub watched the same performance but paid very different amounts. 

I'm a brewer in a state with a three tier system so I regularly deal with distributors, bars, and bartenders all making more money off the product I make than myself. Maybe I just have a thing against the middlemen but I think creators are entitled to a bit more of the pie than they are getting in the current system (don't even get me started on the beer black market, ha). 

If I was an artist and my tickets consistently sold for quite a bit over face value on the secondary market I'd be a bit irked that I'm creating a bunch of extra value for someone that has no involvement in my project or performance. 

When you buy a stock or commodity there is really no way to tell if it will go down or up. If you know enough about concerts you know you're going to win on the ""investment"" every time. If I did this for a living what would your personal views of my morality be?

I just don't see the necessity of a reseller when the show would go on as planned without them. A show with no artist or venue will not.

You're wrong here. There are many technologies that people do fight against regardless of its beneficial potential simply because they think it would be bad.

How are you measuring the potential of the two though? In one case, millions are saved. In the other, millions more can be murdered. 

I understand that you hold a patriotism and that you believe that there are good men and women ready to use this technology for concrete good in our world. However, I ask you to stop and recognize that there are equally bad people ready to use it for its worst potential. The biggest problem with the bad in this scenario is that whoever that bad person/entity is could be doing it without a single person being wise to it until it's too late."	2.0	0.0	392	False	True	9.0

Sugar is not ""in"" food, it *is* food. Sugar, in it's purest form, is the main energy source of your body. It's ""drug-like"" effects include living. Since sugar is a food, it's immediately not a drug based simply on the definition of the word. Having side effects doesn't make something a drug, side effects are a symptom of your body being one giant runaway chemical reaction constantly teetering outside of equilibrium. It's side effects are common across many foods with many different chemical makeups. At it's core, you cannot blame sugar alone for anything you have pinned on it. Obesity can be explained by a shift from physical jobs to sedentary ones, longer commutes requiring vehicles instead of walking, more entertainment sources keeping children indoors instead of playing outside, a media culture that portrays parks and sidewalks as the places where murders happen, and so on and so on. Dental issues can be caused by many things, including tobacco, alcohol, acidic foods, generally poor hygiene, and so on and so on. Diabetes is caused either by genetics or obesity, which, again, has a tenuous link at best to sugar.

Whoops, you're right. One brand of wheat bread had 2 grams added per two slices, the brand of potato bread had 5 grams per roll. That's a whopping 8 and 20 calories, respectively.

I'm not sure why you think there's so much sugar in everything, though. An average day for me, I consume half a teaspoon of sugar between all sources. If people are subsisting on soda and sweets, of course sugar would contribute to their poor health. That's not a result of ""sugar being in everything"", it's a result of poor decision making skills. You can't make stupidity illegal.

As for canned and processed foods, their sodium contents should be the issue, not their sugar contents. Sugar contributes to spoilage, so it would be foolish to sugar up canned goods. All of the canned goods in my cupboard contain 3 or less grams of sugar.

As for soda and juice, if those are your main beverages, you've got more to worry about than just the sugar content. The acidity of those will kill your teeth faster than any sugar content. The phosphoric acid, in large doses, will throw off your body's calcium absorption. Juices, pure or not, have way, way more sugars than any soda, and fructose is more harmful to your health than soda. 

I'm really, really struggling to find your point at all. We need to remove sugar from junk food? Why? That's the point of junk food. If people are stupid enough to live on horrible food, then they deserve their misfortune. The only solution is education. 

In essence, the only valid point you've struck is that there's too much sugar in soda. Soda manufacturers have already put out sodas with no sugar, reduced sugar, and sugar alternatives from natural sources such as stevia. Market pressures work way better than any proposed legislation, your point was defeated before it begun. Every other source of sugary-ness comes from dessert and snack foods, and those should never be counted as a ""daily food.""

It just simply falls flat on its face no matter what angle I look at it from. Soda isn't a daily food. Snack cakes aren't a daily food. Sweet breads aren't a daily food. If sugar is ""scary"" to you because it's addictive and has health effects, all carbohydrates share this same quality. If you think there's more of it and in more sources than ever, I'm seeing neither an increase in quantity nor an increase in sources.

All food and nutrients are drugs in a sense. All are harmful in excess and sugar is not unique in this respect.

Sugar does have powerful drug-like effects, and if used responsibly in an appropriate context it has the potential to massively improve health and quality of life.

For example, sugar powerfully reduces stress (by lowering cortisol, and adrenaline levels, and improves energy metabolism by refilling liver glycogen and increasing thyroid hormone production). When taken after intense exercise, it protects against stress related damage to the body and allows muscles to grow and recover at a rate impossible without sugar supplementation.

It's not right for the government to assume that everyone is stupid and irresponsible, and in the process harm the lives of responsible people that benefit from sugar intake.

I am an active person- I do powerlifting, competitive sailing, and work long hours on scientific research. I fuel this with a sugar intake proportional to the demands I place on my body that prevents stress and fatigue. If sugar was restricted and regulated so I couldn't obtain it, I wouldn't be able to function as well in life. I have a very nutritious diet of mostly natural foods and use sugar as a supplement- usually adding it to coffee or milk before and after strenuous activity. I have experimented with a lot of other diets such as low carb paleo, and none allow me to perform as well or feel as good as I do with a high sugar intake.

It's the unnatural flavors in processed food, not the sugar makes it addictive- and those encourage the over-consumption of any nutrients they're coupled with.

These foods are engineered for unnaturally high food reward specifically to encourage over-consumption.

Like I said, I mostly take sugar mixed into milk or coffee and it tastes good at first but I can't stand too much of it. There are many natural foods with high sugar content (fruit, honey) and they're far from addictive, most people can only enjoy them when truly hungry.

Here is an excellent article on food reward, and how neither fat nor sugar are addictive on there own: http://boingboing.net/2012/03/09/seduced-by-food-obesity-and-t.html

&gt; First described in 1976 by Anthony Sclafani, the cafeteria diet is basically a rat-sized buffet of human junk food, in addition to regular rat chow (9). The menu for a recent cafeteria diet study included such delectable items as Froot Loops, mini hot dogs, peanut butter cookies, Cheez-its, Cocoa Puffs, nacho cheese Doritos, cake, and BBQ pork rinds (10). These are what's known in the business as ‘palatable’, or pleasurable to the taste. On this regimen, rats ignored their regular chow, ate junk food to excess and gained fat at an extraordinary rate, far outpacing two comparison groups fed high-fat or high-sugar pelleted diets. Yes, human junk food happens to be the most effective way to overwhelm the body fat homeostasis system in rats, and neither fat nor sugar alone is able to fully explain why it’s so fattening. Importantly, over time, rats become highly motivated to obtain this diet—so motivated they’ll voluntarily endure extreme cold temperatures and electric shocks to obtain it, even when regular bland rodent pellets are freely available

Gyms efficiently allow us to keep healthy which is hard when you dont have a physical job and big food companies pump most things available in the supermarket full of sugar and fat.

The question about video games is about free time I guess. Simple free time is also an important resource most people have, and it is selfish to spend it doing video games. Everybody seems to be assuming that being selfish is a always bad thing, which isn't true to begin with I don't think. But the real answer for me is that people going to the gym are already motivated and active people. While I think both are selfish, I think it would probably be easier to get people to go to a different location and do a different work out than getting people to put down their video games and go do something constructive. 

Your first question, which others have also asked, is completely distorting my argument. The point of my argument is that if somebody performs action A, but action B satisfies the reason why people perform action A as well as benefiting society, then action B is preferable to action A. What you are suggesting is if action A does not benefit society than it is immoral. So no, that is not actually my argument. The reason sitting at home playing video games is different is also because of this. I am not saying that everybody should change everything they do if it does not benefit society. If there was a very similar activity to video games that did benefit society, than it would be less selfish to do that other activity.

Your third to last paragraph... I'm not trying to suggest everybody could wake up tomorrow and implement what I am saying. There would obviously need to be programs set up to deal with the logistics... maybe the money of a membership would go towards this, and the logistics of this all would replace all the jobs lost to gym membership (addressing a point made in another post). But the fact that there aren't currently programs to allow volunteer workers to work on farms doesn't mean that it is impossible. And for construction, I obviously don't mean going to work on sky scrappers and becoming a professional. You could help build much simpler things, or just forget about construction. It was just an example I randomly used.

The last thing... yes, that is true. But the difference is, the homes that these programs would build wouldn't be owned by banks and huge corporations who would rather see people homeless than lose money on a house. Whatever program oversees the construction would just give the house to somebody who needs it. Property tax would be dealt with. There are already government programs that subsidize low income housing. It would not be a stretch to see them increase funding for such a program. Plus, $20 billion plus that is going into the gym industry could have a hand in this. But again, construction was just an idea. None of this affects my original view.

And in terms of the arguments people are making about it not being accessible in their schedule... why would it be any different than going to the gym? These programs would stay open the same hours as gyms, and would be in the same locations. Instead of doing what is now a normal workout, though, you would do something constructive. There are so many possibilities of what that could be, I did not mean to exclude everything else by mentioning construction and farming only."	-7.0	0.0	583	False	False

As below:

&gt; Conservatism in its most basic form is just wanting things to stay the way things are. [...] Conversely, I don't think it's true that progressives want change for change's sake, but at least embrace change when they see a problem with the current system.

Most conservatives accept change is inevitable, but feel that it should be managed to protect the existing positive aspects of society. Indeed this is outlined thoroughly in the writings of the British politician Edmund Burke, who is often cited as the father of Anglocentric conservatism. 

Progressives may not usually want change for its own sake, but they're often more willing to risk existing strengths in pursuit their goals. Partly this is because progressives often see existing structures as the cause of problems, without acknowledging their positives. For instance, many progressives would point to capitalism as the cause of inequality (a fair point) but would not acknowledge capitalism is superb at generating wealth (in the sense of products and services).

To take your next point:

&gt; This to me seems like they [conservatives] are not very willing to even consider new ideas even if they may be better than the current system/ tradition which is essentially just narrow-mindedness. Traditions are held as sacred and are therefore not compared fairly and rationally to new alternatives. 

At the far end of conservatism you have the view that society is very fragile, and that institutions built up over centuries can be shattered in a short space of time. This is why conservatives have taboos around criticising traditions, though they may not articulate it as such.

To some degree it's arguable the progressive/conservative spectrum is defined by one characteristic: risk appetite. Progressives tend to be willing to gamble to improve society, conservatives tend not to be.

PS. If you're interested in this I recommend looking up Thomas Sowell, an American economist who has written widely on conservatism compared to progressivism, especially in *A Conflict of Visions*. 

*I've used ""progressives"" throughout this, but to my mind the proper counterpoint would be ""radicals"", even allowing that one can have conservative radicals (reactionaries)."	27.0	0.0	381	False	True	0.0

* [It takes a ridiculous amount of capital and time to build a nuclear power plant.](https://www.oecd-nea.org/news/press-kits/economics-FAQ.html) It takes five to seven years to build a plant - aside from zoning concerns and planning, and can run costs of five to six billion dollars before they're finished and you can start to get anything approaching a return on investment - which means that the taxpayers would have to make a long-term investment themselves, because businesses aren't even interested with the normal capitalistic incentives.
* Fissile material is unfortunately a negative point in a world involving [terror attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiological_weapon). It's a decidedly low risk, but it's a big point against public opinion, and it can obviously be catastrophic in case of an issue. Similarly, safety is a concern in the event of natural disasters (Such as Fukushima).
* It requires a tremendous amount of water to use nuclear power generation. Fresh water is protected, Coastal places (Like Fukushima) run the risk of waves/tsunamis and similar difficulties.
* [We still don't know what to do with the end result radioactive material.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository#Earthquakes) Keeping it on-site is a temporary solution, but isn't viable for long-term goals.
* It's centralized. Coming back to the terrorism angle, it works too heavily against us in the way that it would allow a small break to have a wide impact. This also goes back to uranium/plutonium concerns. Fluoride salts are an option, but then it goes back to the water issues. From an economic angle, decentralization (Assuming we can manage appropriate storage) is cheaper to maintain and manage, and reduces loss due to transportation.
* No one wants a Nuclear plant anywhere near them, but solar and wind are much more acceptable to public opinion.

France, in particular, has a very nuclear-driven energy program, whose [details you can read about here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France). Their water use is severe, and generation is limited during heat waves because of the temperature restrictions on the water of the inland plants. In desert environments, it's pretty unfeasible.  In areas that grow warm (particularly near rivers), it's impractical.  And the use of the water in this method can have significant problems with agriculture (Imagine justifying this level of fresh water use in California, for instance).

Some nuclear is okay, mass nuclear will probably not be a viable option for years - we would need significantly better material science, or build locations.

Solar and wind are far more viable long-term solutions than mass nuclear. Nuclear is better than fossil fuels, but we still don't have portable storage for things like transportation (Since oil is so energy dense).  If we have enough battery capability for viable electric cars and diesel trucks, then we have enough for home energy generation and storage, and we might as well go backyard solar/wind anyways."	10.0	0.0	476	False	True	0.0

Most rapes occur between parties where there is an established level of intimacy, in a position where the woman or girl is already vulnerable. Attack positions wouldn't help here.

Admittedly, I'm making an assumption about the kinds of positions which your instructor was referring to. If you would be able to clarify these then I can give you a stronger counter. But I'm assuming that these positions are not things like woman is lying asleep in bed, woman has taken alcohol or other drugs (perhaps without her knowledge) and is compromised because of it. Woman is already in making out position with guy in bed, etc. It also assumes that her attacker doesn't have a weapon, she isn't outnumbered and that she can easily escape from the place she's in, which isn't particularly likely if she's in a private home or hotel room, especially if she is missing some of her clothing or if her children are nearby and she doesn't feel she can leave them.

If my assumption is correct and these positions are more ""how a man would approach raping a perfectly sentient woman from a position that she's not engaging in anything sexual to begin with"" then this kind of self defence is extremely limited in scope, as it ignores the reality of most rape situations. It also doesn't take into account that the natural response to sexual violence (especially when the victim is already in a vulnerable position) is to freeze and/or stop resisting, sometimes mental dissociation also occurs. Similar to the animal instinct to play dead, this is an unconscious instinct which is designed to minimise trauma by allowing the assault to complete with as little risk of extraneous violence as possible. Since men are usually stronger than women, there is a very real danger that a woman responding with violence or self defence will receive stronger violence in return; in most cases this isn't a smart move unless the weaker person is extremely well trained or has the element of surprise.

There is an argument that it's still useful to teach women self-defence techniques against stranger rape because although these comprise a smaller number of rapes, it still helps against that smaller number, which is better than nothing. I disagree with this and think it is more useful to teach both men and women basic self defence to ward off any kind of attacker, because this would be more useful and would also serve to be protective against rape since if a stranger is about to rape you, it's going to be fairly obvious that he wants to do you some violence whether or not his intent to rape is clear. So general self defence would both fulfil the extremely rare stranger rape scenario and also be useful in other situations, meaning it's more useful than only self defence taught with the goal of avoiding stranger rape."	19.0	0.0	495	False	False

It doesn't really matter if there's making out happening already, the goal of the defensive measures would be to prevent penetration. 
Similarly, whether or not the rapist is a stranger is irrelevant to the victim's lack of consent, and to the methods. The physical mechanics of the crime are the same. The defensive actions would be just as effective with a stranger as with a friend or an acquaintance.

The natural response has its purpose, but it shouldn't be the only response available. The training would provide an alternative, more effective method, than the natural response or even a violent response that lacks training.

It may not always be the smart move to fight back but that's any victim's right, and like I said - and I'm not an expert on martial arts - the position a male rapist needs to be in to do the rape, makes him vulnerable to the point that correctly timed action would negate any physical advantage he may have."	0.0	0.0	243	False	False

I'll grant you the fact that psychology is important, which is why it's a big part of self-defence training. And yes, the training must be repeated in order for it to become automatic (they teach that too).

Instinctual responses can be overcome - human beings do have that capacity. A person has a much better chance of overcoming or resisting an instinctual response if they've had training in how to do just that. 
Human instincts are not fixed. The basis of your argument seems to be that this type of training wouldn't be effective with your primary reason being: the instinct to not resist is too strong? You'll need to prove it. "	-2.0	0.0	158	False	False

I smell bullshit here. I can't imagine that such a thing is recorded. Sounds like somebody's IDEA of common rape positions. Unless you can direct me to a source where actual rape positions are documented, I can't accept that this is a thing. It just seems too implausible.

Also, the efficacy of techniques is central to your argument, too, because if the techniques are ineffective, then it becomes illogical to teach them. If the purpose of teaching something is to make a situation safer, then it should actually make that situation safer. If it doesn't, there is no point.

I guess I'm not saying that instinct is too strong to ever be overriden. You're correct that it's not. But to develop something which challenges an instinct as strong as a survival instinct, you almost have to make it so strong that it overrides an instinct and becomes instinct-like itself. To compare, this is like military level training, which seems really extreme in itself. Also, how would this be possible, when rape positions are, essentially, sex positions? The only difference between sex and rape is a lack of consent. How do you develop a new instinct for a situation where most of the time that new instinct is not needed? 

I can only see two possibilities: 

1. Overgeneralisation. You develop the instinct to violently assault anybody who tries to have sex with you ever. This doesn't seem like a good idea to me since most women like sex and want to have sex which is consensual, not avoid all sex.

2. Specialisation. You practice getting into a sexual situation and then introduce an element of fear or psychological trauma, so that the new instinct is associated only with the combination of sex + fear. This seems unhelpful, too, both because it is traumatic in itself, which isn't a great start for something which is supposed to prevent trauma, and it also seems like it would have a pretty high risk of just creating a negative association with sexual situations, which goes back to point #1 - women don't want to be prevented from having sex just because they don't want to get raped."	2.0	0.0	367	False	False

It shouldn't matter, but for the purposes of this argument I will disclose that I am a woman in my 20s. My mother was raped twice when she was in her early teens on two separate occasions - both by men that she knew, i.e. not a ""stranger attack"". It was her who suggested I go to the classes as a way to empower myself. 

There are many things I cannot recall from the classes as it was sometime ago and to my discredit, I do not practice the moves as much as I should. Albeit, I mentally go through what the instructor taught us on a daily basis. I know the basics of what to do in certain positions, and although it seems counter-intuitive, the main lesson is that you aim to get the attacker as close to you as possible. For example, if you are on your back with your attacker attempting the missionary position, your aim is to wrap your legs around him and pull him towards your body. This closeness affords you the opportunity to wrap your arms around his head and use your fingers to gouge out his eyes (ew). 

Thankfully, I have not been in a position to try out these moves but knowing that I have the mental capacity to drive my thoughts to react in this way is an empowering feeling. I am already one-up on my attacker because he is unaware of what I *am* aware of. By thinking about it daily and practicing with a male partner in non-harmful way i.e. just getting the muscle memory in order, a woman can empower her body and her mind to react in a positive, assertive, and strong manner if she finds herself in this situation. 

I'd also like to add that it's irrelevant whether or not the attacker is someone the woman knows or if he (or she) is a stranger. The point that OP is making is that women should be equipped to handle such a situation, although this is not the only way to deal with rape as a society. Sexual repression has got to go. We need open and honest sexual education from an appropriate age. This will take time and money and an allowance of free thinking, but in the meantime we can teach our girls to empower themselves.

Beyond the obvious physical reaction of fear at being startled, a well-executed jump scare adds to the tension of a movie overall by chipping away at your ability to trust scenes that seem safe. In the wake of a good jump scare, you're likely to be more vigilant, which makes you more invested, because that's how fear works in real life. Something startles you out of the blue, and suddenly every shadow that kind of resembles it requires a second look just in case.

1. Realisation of danger.

1. Presentation of danger.

Lets work on number 1. A movie that starts out as a comedy, but gets less funny, and turns into a drama, and finally, it is revealed, after several incredibly dark scenes that it's been about a cannibal all along. An astute watcher would see the small signs that the makers left, and realise the danger to the characters. This tensions, that you know of the danger and they do not generates the horror.

The Silence of the Lambs did this incredibly effectively, showing that Hannibal is the most dangerous character, not Buffalo Bill.

Number two is different. There needs to be no long build up, rather you can simply show that ""there is danger here"". It can be a subtle reveal or a jump scare. Paranormal Activity is a brilliant example. You have a house, which is not a dangerous thing. Unlike an unknown prisoner, there is almost no way for the house to be dangerous.

Paranormal Activity uses the long sequences of little action to entrench this idea, then hits you with the jump scares, presenting that there is something that both the characters and the audience do not know, and it is dangerous.

Movies that rely on presentation of danger work best when the audience accepts that they only know as much as the characters, instead of having the privilege of being able to work out the danger before the characters encounter it.

Imagine waking up and realising you have been surrounded by lions all night.

Imagine a lion jumping out of a bush at you.

If you are any kind of rational person, both should scare you, and both can be elements in a horror movie."	57.0	0.0	294	False	True	0.0

And the last and worse one: Terror, when you come home and notice everything you own had been taken away and replaced by an exact substitute. It's when the lights go out and you feel something behind you, you hear it, you feel its breath against your ear, but when you turn around, there's nothing there...”

She did not ""support"" the war in Iraq. She voted for the Iraq war authorization measure that Bush asked for, because he said that he war authorization would be the leverage he needed with the UN and Saddam Hussein. On the floor of the Senate, while explaining her vote, she said, ""A vote for [this resolution] is **not a vote to rush to war**; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our President and we say to him, use these powers wisely and as a last resort."" Bush was supposed to allow UN inspectors to finish their work and report, but he didn't. War was not used as a last resort but as a first and only resort, plunging the country into a decade-long ground war he had no ability to run. 

&gt;Against universal health care

That depends on what ""universal health care"" means. She is and has always been in support of every American having health care. [She was an important figure in the creation of CHIP](http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-sanders-claim/). She wants to expand the ACA, CHIP, and Medicaid programs. And she still supports a public option for health care -- she just intent on fighting for it at the state level. It says so on her website: ""As she did in her 2008 campaign health plan, and consistently since then, Hillary supports a “public option” to reduce costs and broaden the choices of insurance coverage for every American. To make immediate progress toward that goal, Hillary will work with interested governors, using current flexibility under the Affordable Care Act, to empower states to establish a public option choice.""

&gt;For the 2001 Bankruptcy Bill/Against the same 2005 Bankruptcy Bill

Yeah, that wasn't great. Can't say I agree with her on that one. But the difference between her two stances isn't a flip-flop -- according to her, she voted for the 2001 bill (which did not become law) because she had engineered certain compromises with Republicans on the structure of the bill. She voted for it, but was happy when it didn't pass the House. Because that's how politics works in the real world -- you have to compromise sometimes and vote for things you don't like in order to make sure an even worse thing doesn't pass.

In 2005, the ""same"" bill wasn't the same. The bill had rewritten, her concerns in 2001 weren't a factor any longer, so she opposed it.

 * It's not consistent with the lore of the original movie

A few years back I was at a hospital that saw a ton of celebrities, and one particular 20 something A list female celebrity (you definitely know her) happened to be in the hospital, in the psych ward. The press got wind of this. I was at a party talking to a guy who happened to be some kind of  photographer or journalist or something. We eventually started talking about that celeb and I mentioned that yea, I had seen her in the hospital. He offered me about $40k on the spot if I could get him pictures of her in the psych ward.*

The idea of a physician taking pics of a celeb in the hospital to give to the press, for $40k, is laughable. My earning potential is about $250k to $400k yearly, depending on how much I want to work. Over 30-50 year career that's maybe $10m in earnings, ignoring the enjoyment I get from my job. If I got caught taking pictures of an A list celeb to give to the press, I could easily lose my license, which would mean I would lose all that future earnings and enjoyment.

If you wanted me to take such a risk, you'd have to pay me at least on the order of several million dollars to make it worthwhile. You'd be paying me to take the risk, not for the quality of the job. 

Similarly, the Jackal was presumably a reputable professional who could find steady work doing less high profile hits. If some random undercover cop was getting offers of $200k, presumably a guy like the Jackal could do a couple hits a year in that range. His lifetime earning potential is probably in the range of $10m to $100m. Doing a high profile hit puts those earnings at risk, and on top of that puts his life and liberty at risk. Think about the international manhunt that would ensue after the assassination of a presidential candidate.   You'd probably have to offer him some tens of millions to make such a job worth the risk.

**tldr: You're paying a premium to make the risk worthwhile, not for the quality of the job.**

I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/48usgx/cmv_i_believe_black_people_have_a_lower_average/d0mpy0w) was a pretty good comment that covers most points that come up. (Credit to /u/Doppleganger07)

The tl;dr of this is two things: 

1) IQ is an imperfect measure of intelligence, which doesn't actually have a unified, commonly accepted definition by all the experts. IQ tests show *something*, but it's not equivalent to ""intelligence.""

2) Many, *many* factors other than genetics influence intelligence. It's impossible to eliminate all these factors when trying to find out whether a demographic group as broad as ""all black people"" has lower IQ, and we know in the past that groups with lower IQs and actual genetic differences based on demographics didn't have lower IQs because of genetics but because of environmental factors, which are very much at play with the black population. It therefore seems quite likely that there's no genetically based difference to intelligence at work.

For convenience, I've quoted the whole thing below. The original post has links to sources that are not included in the quote, so please go there if you'd like them.

&gt;This statistic of course, doesn't take into account anything other than race. Let's go through why most of the academic community isn't concerned about this.

&gt;1) The gap we see here is not at all unique. There have been many instances of populations of people with lower than average IQ that have closed the gap entirely.

&gt;For example, women used to score far lower than men on IQ tests. This is no longer the case since women have gotten more educated. In this case, we are starting to see the IQs of women surpass those of men (in general)].

&gt;Another example is the IQ data gathered from East and West Germany prior to unification. East and West Germans were / are genetically indistinguishable, but there was a gap between the two reaching 17 points in some areas. If you take IQ as being mostly genetic, these results are highly problematic.

&gt;A third example (and I could go on for longer but this is already long enough) is the Flynn effect. This is the well documented phenomenon that observes populations IQs rising as they develop economically. The average black person today gets the same score as the average white person did in the US in the year 1950. The average black person's score is 15 points higher than the average white person just 100 short years ago. Unless you think there was a major genetic change in whites in the past 50-100 years, the rise in scores (for both races) was due to environmental changes. Whites have simply enjoyed a higher standard of living (then and now) which leads to them having environments more conducive to learning.

&gt;I know I said that was the last example I'd give, but let me do one more because I think it illustrates my point. Another big difference in IQ scores can be seen between northern Americans and Americans in the South. In fact, there have been studies done where blacks in the north scored higher on IQ tests than whites in the south. Are northerners different genetically than southerners? If not, then why the difference? If we accept whatever that difference is, why are you not using that to explain the black - white difference?

&gt;The above examples give pause to the idea that IQs for groups are set in stone (they 100% are not and that's a fact), and that genetics are the primary determination of a persons cognitive ability.

&gt;2) IQ scores only measure one type of intelligence (poorly)

&gt;IQ scores can only measure one type of intelligence, and it doesn't even do that as well as we'd like. IQ tests don't accurately measure strategic intelligence, or even creative intelligence. 

&gt;This is a huge problem since these forms of intelligence that the IQ tests cannot measure are some of the most important. Creativity lies at the soul of every major invention. It lies in the soul of every song, movie or play. Similar things can be said of strategic thinking.

&gt;Would we think worse of people like Jimi Hendrix and Ghengis Khan if we found out they scored low on an IQ test. If we would, we probably shouldn't.

&gt;3) IQ scores cannot measure potential

&gt;There are certain types of questions asked on IQ tests that you can get better at with practice. For example, pattern recognition and memorization are two things you can improve on drastically throughout your life (if you practice). This has two problems. One, it gives advantages to people who do similar kinds of thinking activities daily (this explains some of the Flynn effect we discussed earlier). Two, we may mistake someone had a low genetic limit based on someone not normally having to perform those kinds of activities, or not having as good of tools throughout their lives. Here is someone discussing this here.

&gt;4) At this point people will often say that when you control for certain variables the differences don't entirely disappear. For one, the differences fall away quite rapidly once you start controlling for things (income and neighborhoods mostly). Second, we have no way of controlling for other things that effect IQ testing scores.

&gt;One such example is Stereotype Threat. This is a phenomena that we've seen in not only IQ scores, but in math, reading, sports and (essentially) any other area where a stereotype exists. Stereotype threat is the phenomena that shows people perform worse if there is a fear that they will further a certain stereotype about themselves. The presence of this cannot be totally corrected for (although it can be manipulated somewhat).

&gt;Another example is cultural differences. We know that there are many ways that different races raise their children that influence their cognitive development. I really want to wrap this up, but one such example is the word gap.

In practice, we don't meet those conditions. First of all, there's a *lot* of gene flow between human populations. As far as population barriers go, we are basically leaky sieves.

Does that mean there are zero genetic differences between ""races?"" Well, there are always genetic differences between demographic groups. There just aren't that many, and the likelihood they can have such a large magnitude in effect on IQ seems remote. 

Second, why would rice farming be so much more difficult than tribalism? A random tribesman from the Amazon rain forest will know hundreds of plants on sight, their use as food or medicine, the animals that like to feed on them or use them for shelter, the behavior and use of the *animals*, and so on. The farmer isn't stupid- he will, of course, know in great detail the process of farming rice, raising *his* animals, the weather and the best time to plant crops, local political conditions, and so on. Farming isn't easy. But why would you assume being a hunter-gatherer is any easier? Surely intelligence is an adaptive trait in both circumstances?

(By the way, lots of Africans were farmers too. So it's not even the case that there's a huge divide between Africans and the rest of the world in how they lived.)

The first thing to accept is that you're making a generalization. That's fine. There can be some conversational merit in generalizations. The problem is, I don't even agree with the generalization. I'd like to put forward one of my own, which I think is much more accurate. 

Having said that, it's still a generalization, and doesn't apply to everyone. 

I think the first factor women are looking for is not wealth, but being a good provider. Women want to feel safe. They want to feel like they will be provided for, and their children will be provided for. And yes, wealth can represent that, and appeal to those instincts in women. But if a man shows he's capable of providing for her and her children, I don't think wealth is the critical factor in most cases. 

I think there are other factors which can be important. The ability to make a woman laugh. The ability to sing, or play guitar. Being desirable to other women can instinctually make a woman attracted to a man. Being an exceptional athlete. Being mysterious. Frankly, being aesthetically pleasing is extraordinarily important.  

None of these have anything to do with wealth. 

Which isn't to say that some women equate wealth with desirability. That's certainly the case. I just don't believe it's the vast majority as you do. All things being equal, sure, more money means more financial security, but if a man is able to provide for his family without great wealth, that's going to be enough in the vast majority of cases.

You can think abortion is killing a person and still be okay with abortion for bodily autonomy reasons. In my country (USA) your right to bodily autonomy is so strong that if you die of a heart attack we won't cut you open and use our organs to save people's lives if you didn't say it was okay before you died. I personally don't like this, but a lot of people do and it's the law. So, let's assume I believe my bodily autonomy trumps all.

But given that it will be a long time before the full details come out, here is the best defense that I have heard - that is at least consistent with (if not slightly supported by) public reports on the matter.

Comey was between a rock and a hard place regarding the initial letter. There was a large enough (or committed enough) cadre of FBI agents angry about the initial decision not to indict that this new development (described only in the abstract) would (likely) be leaked during the election, making the FBI look bad and raising the issue as a speculative unsubstantiated October surprise. So: suppose the leak happens. If Comey followed DOJ policy, he could have clamped down on his agents very hard to minimize the possibility of a leak and stall/not answer - which would lead to attacks on the FBI and complaints from within. Bad for FBI/Public confused/Hearings after election drag out the issue (for FBI/Comey).

Suppose the leak doesn't happen: Then you get angry agents and you WILL get congressional hearings after the fact - that would make the FBI look bad and Comey doesn't want that.

In the case of (DOJ policy-violating) disclosure, the FBI itself just has to live with the political consequences, but isn't dragged into the ""corruption"" or ""rigged"" worries anywhere near as much as they would be in the other cases. Comey and the FBI take less political heat compared to not disclosing, in the long run, despite the disclosure being a stupid STUPID thing to do.

So, while he went against DOJ policy, it wasn't against the letter of the law, he knows that firing him would shift the story away from the mess that lead to this situation (and would be bigger political news than as an indictment - pun intended - against Comey as a leader), and if he isn't fired he must (implicitly at least) have the trust and support of the president.

So, on point 1, the situation within the FBI made particular knowledge moot - it was simply about managing the leak/anger situation. On point 2, he didn't violate any particular law, just advice (as a side note, the DOJ, if they wanted to, presumably could have stopped this and didn't... so it was either within the law or they are also culpable). And on point 3, that's true, but it only would be a firable offense if 3 alone is sufficient to warrant firing, and that seems too strong.

I don't like this, I think Comey ought to resign, and that this was so dumb dumb dumb, but it still might be dumber to fire Comey until this is entirely sorted out, given the mess at the FBI (so... like 2018).

Oh, and why I think this description is at least consistent with reality is Spencer Ackerman in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump?CMP=share_btn_tw)

It would *look* awfully partisan if Obama fired Comey right now. It would seem like he was trying to help Hillary win the election and it would also look like there was some sort of cover up taking place. While it may not be true, it would look that way and it may provide Trump's supporters and disgruntled Republicans something to rally around. In the interest of not getting Trump elected I think Comey should stay on until some time after the election. 

Now I do think that there's a slightly sympathetic case to be made when it comes to Comey's recent actions. There were reports that some people in the FBI were planning to leak information that made it look like there was something on Weiner's computer(s) that made Hillary look bad. I think that Comey, by writing a completely vacuous letter to Congress, successfully reduced the damage that may have occurred if some low-level leaks made it seem like there was something there. Had there been a leak he could not have said that there was nothing there since it would require an investigation to prove it and it would have made him look bad if something came out of it in the future. His letter had its own drawbacks and seems to have affected Hillary's position but think of what could have happened and it doesn't look as bad.

But the Republican Congress is probably the larger setback, given that Obama has pretty much already done what little is possible through executive action. Yet giving up is literally the worst thing to do for a number of reasons:

Firstly: Every. Tonne. Counts. Certainly the 3 to 4 degrees Celsius track that we appear to be on at the moment (with present national commitments) is worse than 1.5 to 2 degrees that the Paris Agreement ""committed"" to, but it's a damn sight better than 7 to 9 degrees under a more lax approach or the 9 to 11 degrees under a 'burn it all' scenario that would likely bring civilisation-ending consequences. 

Secondly, there are many city and state governments that are taking more robust action. This number can and must go up,  and local lobbying can make a substantial difference here. Even with strong action at the federal level the commitment of state and local actors would be required, so it's more than possible for them to go it alone. 

Thirdly, it would take more than American intransigence to blow up the Paris Agreement. There's plenty of countries on board and already talimg stronger action than the USA. One could even make the argument that China is taking stronger action, in terms of emissions intensity reductions (which measure CO2 emissions against economic growth). As mentioned elsewhere, the USA is hardly a world leader on climate change so a Republican victory is not really a global setback. 

So (like with the rest of the Trump platform) there's still plenty worth fighting for, writing letters, donating and protesting for, and making incentives with your own wallet for. "	2.0	0.0	288	False	True	0.0

A company that cares about the environment just takes steps to reduce their carbon footprint.  That can cost more money than using fossil fuels, but that is fundamentally different from a carbon tax.  A lot of co2 emissions come from industries that don't sell directly to the public.  Things like steel mills and energy production, that go towards other manufacturing processes. Steel is traded like a commodity, that is, 1 kg of x grade steel is worth $1.70 USD, for example. Regardless of who made it.  There's not enough financial/market incentive for steel producers, mines, or most primary and secondary goods producers, to significantly reduce their carbon footprint if it increases the cost of production.  

Carbon taxes attempt to alter market forces to tip scales in favor of greener practices and alternatives.  First it gives companies, products and services that use fewer fossil fuels a leg up against dirtier alternatives.  So let's say a carbon tax makes concrete and steel more expensive, while bamboo and pine are unaffected, which may tip the scales to use greener products in certain situations that used to favor dirtier products.  

Second, it provides a greater financial incentive for companies to innovate and retrofit their factories to be cleaner.  What translates to better environmental outcomes doesn't necessarily translate to good marketing, and vice versa.  A Steel mill switches to passive intercooling, hotspot welding, and yransphonic drifting and a half dozen other small changes that all cost money, but put together add up to significant carbon reductions. These are expensive to implement, so It's really hard to make these investments worthwhile on a commodity product.  Carbon taxes put all industries and factories at the same disadvantage, so they all have to implement changes to their processes, or pay higher taxes."	6.0	0.0	301	False	True	0.0

Firstly, allowing government absolute access to everyone's privacy for the reason of stopping bullying and harassment is extremely dangerous; in the same way that violating free speech is dangerous. Free speech and right to privacy exist to check state tyranny. If opposition to the government is disallowed, the state because tyrannous and violates the rights and good of the citizens. If citizens are able to write and talk about the evils of the government they are able to organize and oppose the beginnings of an evil government and thus perpetuate a just government. Privacy is the same. Arguing that no one should have a right to privacy would be the same as saying that I don't need free speech because I have nothing to say. Without privacy any opposition to a government would be impossible and thus a check by the citizens to the beginnings of an evil government would be impossible. An absolute right to privacy is just as essential to an absolute gurantee of free speech. Disallowing it is a surefire way to despotism. 

Secondly, the argument that ""all of this could be avoided if the assailants didn't have privacy either"" is extremely dangerous. You argue that this would be helpful because many crimes would be able to be prevented. This is very similar to the Patriot Act that allows government spying in order to prevent terrorism. Sacrificing human rights for national security is always dangerous. Would you want to live in a society in which human rights are systematically violated in order to save a few thousand lives? No, saving lives isn't worth it if it results in the gross violation of rights.

In particular, there's a very tight balance concerning gun control in the U.S. and for those obsessed with our second amendment.

We also have a third variable, which is Mexico.

A good deal of the reason we don't squeeze for more gun control, is because when you make something illegal or harder to obtain, people seek less legal channels to get what they want. In the case of guns, this is very bad. An illegal gun is not in a registry and accounted for, and is directly a byproduct of harsher gun laws. Normally this would be relatively enforceable but our proximity to Mexico creates problems for us. Since Mexico has a lot of gang and cartel problems they finance their activities selling illegal hardware that is very accessible for American citizens. 

The reason Germany probably doesn't have this issue, is because the surrounding nations probably have less of a financial discrepancy between them. Yes they might not be perfectly the same, but the wealth ratio might be closer to 1:1 than Mexico and the United States which is more like 10:1. This makes it very good for Mexican lawbreakers because selling just a few guns to American buyers gets them a lot of purchasing power in Mexico.

Setting aside the logistical concerns, we deal greatly with the interpretation of the constitution some people want a very firm and literal interpretation of the second amendment. Others think it's obsolete and so on. It's a pretty big hangup in our society."	1.0	0.0	270	False	True	0.0

You live in the woods pretty far from any sort of law enforcement and a bear breaks into your house and starts rummaging through your kitchen.  If you don't have a gun, you have pretty much no options in this situation besides hoping the bear doesn't come after you, but with a gun the result is [a dead bear](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grizzly-bear-shot-dead-inside-kimberley-home-1.3185310).

&gt;If a criminal really wants to kill you, usually you won't even have a chance to defend yourself, as sad as it sounds. I mean if the criminal wanted your death, he would just shoot you in case of a gun or just cut open your throat from behind. He could even just take a big stone and smash it into your head. Of course there are also those who will ""bully"" (?) you and only than kill you, but if I'm correctly informed, it's relatively seldom.

The sort of scenario most people picture where they would be dealing with a human usually does not have the good guy with the gun as the primary target.  A common scenario that is brought up are a house break in where the people breaking in are seeking to steal valuables and be gone before being noticed but the [homeowner getting the drop on them](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/cleared_of_criminal_wrongdoing.html) either because they don't know he is home/awake or just because he knows the way around his own house better than them.  Another scenario often brought up is when someone else is being held at gunpoint and a [third party comes in to solve the situation.](http://www.easttexasmatters.com/news/local-news/police-good-samaritan-stops-robbery-at-cumberland-park-mall/670679572).

&gt;If I got the fact wrong, that people want guns for self-defence, than why are people worrying about ""the bad guys"" having all the guns?

This is where it gets a bit confusing.  Yes, self defense is a commonly listed reason for gun ownership and the people that have this as their primary reason tend to be the loudest, but that is far from the only reason for owning guns.  A much more common reason is people wanting to own guns simply because they intend to use them for hunting or the sport of target shooting.  Each of those on their own are major hobbies in the US that millions of people partake in to some extent.  These people want ease of access to their guns because in is a major part of their culture and leisure time.  In some cases (such as on farms), having guns can be pretty crucial to preventing damage to crops and livestock and in some cases they are used for slaughtering livestock.  Even if you completely take away a self defense scenario from the argument, there would still be many people pretty firm in their stance that guns should be legal.  In my case, I do not ever expect to use a gun in self defense, but I own three guns because target shooting is a major hobby of mine."	2.0	0.0	498	False	True	0.0

On the other hand when a girl has daddy issues, it's commonly accepted she had a rough relationship with her father, if one at all. A girl like that isn't born that way, but it's not a choice for her to be like that either. Maybe the problem with that scenario is, people think it *is* a choice.

Eh no. This applies only to governmental institutions. And institution who have big influence, reach and obligation to public (news, movies, literature, radio, TV, etc...) . That is specifically what Christopher Hitchens is talking about. Every one of his remarks are made in regards to governments and regimes. Since that is his area of interest and framework he is talking about.

However Free Speech doesnt apply to private institution. Or at least not as much. They are dictating the rules, because they are paying for the platforms they give you. Take reddit for example. Any admin can censor anyone's opinion as they wish. And rightfully so. Moderated discussion is the most productive.

Airlines have a strict rules what you can or cannot say in plane or airport. Or even how you can or cannot behave. If you start shouting on plane in air about bomb. Then other people can get angst, can freak out, which can be incredibly damaging in plane. Which is why a personal is perfectly in rights to ""shut you up"".

Theatre is basically a metaphore about the government. Indeed Christopher says that the official said this quote, just a he was locking up the Yiddish speaking socialists.

&gt;One big question is-who will be the one deciding that what is and isn't right to say? 

Ultimately its at the discression of the private companies. And current government. Altho I agree that public / free speech should be given incredible weight. I do not think it should be infallable 100% of the time. There are genuenly times where reducing your right for free speech can greatly benefit the situation. Simply because you filter in only the relevant information. 

A lot of people do not like this view. Because it can mean that this can be missused. But then again, everything can. Its not really argument to say it can be used for bad purposes.

&gt;. That kind of authority would be tyrannical. I would like to give analogy of democracy being imperfect as compared to a benevolent dictator BUT we know dictatorship always end badly.

IF there is a catastrophe. The government will forcibly override the private institution ability to broadcast TV, because they want to get the news about the catastrophe across. Likewise with public broadcasts, etc...

The difference is that the situation is important. And government genuenly works to benefit the people. But is still tyranical after a fashion.

Within 10 years a primarily feudal society had been changed into an industrialized one. And for the first time in history such an advance was due not to capitalism but to socialism.

Cameron, Kenneth Neill. Stalin, Man of Contradiction. Toronto: NC Press, c1987, p. 75

&gt;Between the poverty stricken year of 1924, when Lenin died, and the relatively abundant year of 1940, the cultivated area of USSR expanded by 74 percent; grain crops increased 11 percent; coal production was multiplied by 10; steel output by 18; engineering and metal industries by 150; total national income by 10; industrial output by 24; annual capital investment by 57. During the First Five-year Plan, 51 billion rubles were invested; during the Second, 114; and during the Third, 192. Factory and office workers grew from 7,300,000 to 30,800,000 and school and college students from 7,900,000 to 36,600,000. Between 1913 and 1940, oil production increased from nine to 35 million tons; coal from 29 to 164; pig iron from 4 to 15; steel from 4 to 18; machine tools from 1000 to 48,000 units, tractors from 0 to over 500,000; harvestor combines from 0 to 153,500; electrical power output from two billion kWh to 50 billion; and the value of industrial output from 11 billion rubles to more than 100 billion by 1938. If the estimated volume of total industrial production in 1913 be taken as 100, the corresponding indices for 1938 are 93.2 for France; 113.3 for England, 120 United States; 131.6 for Germany, and 908.8 for the Soviet Union.

Schuman, Frederick L. Soviet Politics. New York: A.A. Knopf, 1946, p. 212

Most people who lived during Stalin say it was a time of rapid growth of healthcare, education, infastructure, and living standards. Healthcare was extended into remote villages for the first time in Russian history. Diseases like typhus, endemic in the countryside, were virtually eliminated. Illiteracy was eradicated, and living standards rose drastically. 


The Soviet population under Stalin Government wasn't slaves. The workers ran their own newspapers, had the power to elect their own factory managers, and had guaranteed vacation time, privileges unknown in the economically depressed Western world at the time. The Communist government, and Stalin, enjoyed mass support among the population. In about fifteen years, illiterate peasants living in borderline medieval conditions with a 50% infant mortality rate (the majority of the Zarist Russia population) saw a great quantity of their sons and daughters, becoming scientists, doctors, or engineers.

Today, Stalin remains popular in the former USSR. A recent poll put him as the third greatest Russian in history.

An artist (or group of artists) may very well develop a performance with a clear intention, vision, and motivation - but the audience is still going to have their own personal interpretation independent of authorial intent. That intent (if it is known) may inform the audience but the fact of the matter is that once your art is out there in the world you no longer own the message.

This applies to all forms of art, no matter how ""subjective"" they may or my not be. Anything can come with clear and documented visions and motivations, from abstract sculpture to Christmas pagents. But the existence of clear authorial intent doesn't impact the power the audience has over the message.

It's like in the Mel Brooks movie *The Producers*, the main characters funded a play written by a neo-Nazi with the intent of creating a bomb and scamming an insurance company. The author of the play created the play to pay homage to Adolf Hitler. Yet the audience decided it was a comedic satire and a hit, annoying the author to no end and putting our main characters in jail. Who had the power? Was it the producers? The author? The director? The actors? Or the audience?

Edit: Another example might be a group of cooks for an event. They all documented an intent to provide satisfying and tasty food for the event, right? But does that intent impact the audience's taste at all? Nope. No amount of cooking an apple pie with the intention of it tasting good is going to impact an audience member who just plain doesn't like apple pies."	4.0	0.0	290	False	False

I would argue, though, that live performance is different. There can't be a *complete* DoA, because it is continually recreated. 

I think we'd have to accept DoA applies to films and TV and recorded music, because they live on long after the people who created it are gone, and a key part of DoA is that the *audience* takes on that role once the art is released. I think when you look at classic movies like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, etc., etc., it's pretty hard to argue that DoA doesn't apply. 

DoA isn't really about there being one vision vs. many (though many directors of films are *so* strong that I would argue that qualify even for the version you're talking about). 

It's about permanence vs. ephemerality. A piece of art that has separate existence from the author takes on a life of its own, and the interpretations of the audiences ultimately become the only thing that matters, because the author isn't there any more.

You can't speculate on how the majority of the people involved in Springtime for Hitler saw the play, since we're not privy to their experiences. But I'm not sure why having more people with a more unified intent means anything to the audience.

I think you're confusing the ability for a larger group to develop a message more likely to be recieved in that way with the notion that the audience still doesn't hold all of the cards when it comes to the message.

I like the idea of being able to differentiate between practical vs creative choices, but in practice I'm not sure how that can be reliably achieved.

As for questioning character motivations in film, some people do actually create their own motivations and insist that they're just as valid as the actual intended ones. For example, an actor can say ""I'm not playing this character as gay – his relationship with this other character is just a friendship"" and I think that's really the only valid interpretation of that performance. Meanwhile, the nature of literature means that characters' motivations are more ambiguous and open to interpretation. One semi-popular interpretation of *The Great Gatsby* argues that Nick Carraway is actually gay, and I think that's a valid interpretation based on the available text.

Edit: I guess my thought is that in performance art, what's going on inside a character's head is much less subjective than in literature because there are multiple people dedicated to explicitly defining it.

It's art, not fact. So the death of the author applies just as much to performance as anything else. I think this sentence perfectly encapsulates my point.

You can claim that their interpretation is more ""wrong"" for all sorts of reasons. But personally I find authorial intent (regardless of how many authors) to be the weakest justification for an interpretation. Textual justifications are much more compelling.

&gt; I just mean that it's invalidated by being able to ask the cast/crew/etc specific character motivations and meanings behind gestures or other subtleties.

No more than anything else is invalidated by the opinions or the author or authors. The text must stand on its own. If you're doing a large production of an interpretive dance meant to represent the changing of the seasons and the audience comes out discussing how your dance beautifully conveyed the stages of life then you can sit there and scream, ""it's about the seasons you dolts!!"" until you and every other dancer is blue in the face. But the fact remains that the audience read it differently than you intended.

&gt; In the case of American History X, I'm not sure that really counts because the general consensus still agrees with the viewpoint of the creators.

General consensus is, like the intent of the author, a moot point. The text stands on its own, that's what the death of the author means.

If you watch American History X and you walk out of the experience thinking that neo-Nazis are cool because of it then you've gone against both intent and general consensus - yet your interpretion is just as valid if based off of the text.

I'm not saying that an individual can't take things like general consensus or authorial intent into account when trying to figure out how they personally interpret something - just that others are perfectly able to throw all of that away.

Interpretation is itself subjective. That's why when doing an alaysis of a work you might very well come to different conclusions than the person sitting next to you.

The fact that two people can see the same work and come to different interpretations of that work is compelling enough for me to consider the author(s) good and dead. The audience decides for themselves what the message of a work is.

Believe me, as an artist I *wish* I could literally force people to see things the way I want them to see it.

&gt; I was thinking more along the lines of people trying to make a propaganda film and accidentally making something that went down in history as a poignant anti-government satire.

The message was impacted by the sound, and this impacted the audience. Had you not bothered to look up what the original line was you might never had known, yet you would have formed an opinion.

There's something about your steadfast adherence to intent when it comes to plays that's been amusing me for a while now, because you keep bringing up stage directions from the script.

Plays aren't *intended* to be read, they are intended to be watched. You're not supposed to sit there and read along with the cast.

The script informs the performance, it isn't some kind of ultimate authority on the play.

Edit: Also universities give a lot of scholarships for music, acting, art, and every other subject that they teach. Every department gets budgets for them to use for scholarships, in addition to the general academic scholarships that the University gives out separate from departments, and there are also a lot of private scholarships funded by alumni and fundraising.

I was actually listening to NPR review this film on the radio yesterday, and while it began with an actual discussion about the quality of the movie as if it were any other, it quickly shifted to discussing only feminism, the lead, and the director. 

Now, first off I agree 100% about your points regarding the Alien movies and how we should view female lead films as a whole. I view it as a discredit to women in the industry when we don't talk about their actual work, and instead focus on the irrelevant fact that they are women. If a female lead film is bad, we should critique it just as harshly as we would any other film, it's disrespectful to do otherwise.

However, many people disagree. One of the big points from NPR regarded  the female director. In the modern movie industry, all a male director typically needs to do to be able to direct in the lucrative blockbuster arena, is one really good smaller film. Patty Jenkins (the director) had previously directed Monster in 2003 to massive critical acclaim, but had to wait 14 years before being trusted with such a big film like WW. If a male director had been at the helm of monster they probably would have been given a much higher budget film way sooner. 

Now, regarding the leads. Obviously there's the group of people who will love a film for having a female lead regardless of how it's handled. But WW supporters also point to Chris Pines character as an example of what feminism should be. Pines masculinity isn't affected by being around WW, and they are both able to look at each other as being equals instead of dominating one another.

I was aware that it was a female director at the helm, and in my opinion I don't think that this movie should in any way impede her in terms of her career. She's obviously capable of making a decent superhero movie and the fact that she had more success than male directors doing the same thing does speak volumes. 

What bothers me, though, is that the patriarchy only seemed to use her to create a movie about women because she's a woman, and I think that only speaks counter to the progress that society might make if the publishers and producers take this movie as a ""one-off"". Until I start seeing more female directors at the helm without any questions really being asked, I remain a little skeptical at the progress that people are claiming this movie will have made. 

I did like how Chris Pines seemed to understand concepts such as equality, and even consent better than most male characters (or male perspectives, really), but (and maybe I'm seeing this wrong), but it still seems to me with that logic that the movie was still ultimately about the man and not about the female lead. On that criticism, I don't know how far I should go because the stories have already been written, there's really only so much that they can do, but then it goes back to the formula problem so I guess I've just reached full circle lol.

I couldn't care less what sex or race the lead in a film has, as long as it's good. However, it's clear by the reviews that many people do care. 

I think for a lot of women specifically, the movie represents their struggle to be viewed as equals in the entertainment industry. We have been pumping out super hero movies by the truck load, and they consistently tell the same stories and showcase strong male leads with females always being assigned a supporting role. 

WW may follow the general formula for it's plot and action, but it's the behind the scenes progress that really have people lauding it so heavily. Just like how Pine and Gadot learn to view one another as equal partners, females want to be viewed as equals in the movie industry. Is WW woman a fantastic film that should make you cry due to how powerful it is? Definitely not, but it broke convention regarding it's director and lead (and unlike Ghost Busters, it actually performed very well). People love this film not just because of it's casting and direction, but because it represents female lead productions finally being viewed as equal to the current standard of film-making. 

As a result, the director now has more political capital to produce more big budget films, and whether or not WW is good when viewed in a vacuum, it sold enough tickets to show the industry that people are craving more female lead and directed projects. So the industry will stop viewing female lead films as being such a gamble. The ultimate goal being that we stop viewing films as being ""normal"" or ""female lead"" and instead just as films."	38.0	0.0	290	False	True	2.0

There are a lot of ways to tell a story, and LOTR is more like an epic than it is a movie. The books themselves are actually broken up into six parts, and it tells the story of Frodo and the Ring in more of an episodic sort of way. It's about the whole journey.

If you enjoy the thing as a whole, then I think it's fair to say its a good trilogy. Do you think the only good television shows are ones where each episode works on its own? Trilogies are a whole, to be judged as a whole. We already have a name for individual works that we judge them by - movies.

&gt;Do you think the only good television shows are ones where each episode works on its own?

Not at all. The story structure is inherently different in those two mediums. But any good trilogy, whether movie or album, has to work in both the state it was released in (separately) and in retrospect (all together). 

&gt;Trilogies are a whole, to be judged as a whole.

A trilogy is just a series of three movies. They might have any number of structures. From very loosely-related like the [Cornetto Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Flavours_Cornetto_trilogy) to very much interlaced like LOTR. I'm not seeing why one is inherently better than the other.

Nope. You can call any set of three movies a trilogy.

A trilogy is a word that has many uses. In this case, LOTR is literally a movie trilogy.

&gt; I didn't say it doesn't work. I said it doesn't serve the function of being trilogy, which I defined earlier, therefore it's a bad trilogy. Just like shoe is a bad hammer.

It serves the function of a trilogy just fine.

&gt; Trilogy of volumes? Please. Or, you know, a good story released in three volumes.

Please what? Why are you king of the word ""trilogy"" all of a sudden?

&gt; It is exactly that! One story, three parts/volumes/movies.

Yes, three movies. A movie trilogy.

Trilogy, as colloquially used for movies, refers to three movies that usually take place in the same shared universe. Star Wars is comprised of two trilogies, soon to be three, and now at least one standalone movie. Or you could say it's one sextilogy. Or whatever. It's arbitrary.

It's not so much about plot, but about character development.  Several characters evolve over the trilogy, but each film also has its mini character arcs. 

FOTR - It's all about Frodo wrestling with the shitty reality of having to be the Ring Bearer even though he'd rather live in peace and obscurity: ""I wish none of this had happened.""  So Gandalf says, ""So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide.  All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.""

Thematically and for Frodo's character, FOTR is about accepting a major responsibility and sacrificing your personal desires for a greater good.  In the end, that also means sacrificing friendships (the Fellowship).  Sam sticks around because Frodo also learns he can't do everything by himself.

TTT - This one is about hope, and the dangers of losing it during tough times.  This is the darkest part of the trilogy because everything is turning against the heroes.  Some would argue Aragorn is the ""main"" character of TTT because he has the most screen time.  But I would argue his arc doesn't change much in this one (we'll get to him later).  Here are the characters who best represent the theme of TTT, in my opinion:

* Theoden - He's lost hope not just in his country, but in himself.  In the end, he realizes that victory is still possible.

* Legolas/Elrond - They've lost hope in Men (to use Tolkien's word and capitalization scheme).  They think they're weak, which leads to Legolas' conflict with Aragorn.  But then they make up and Elrond sends the Elves come to help Men and stand against evil together.  

* Sam - He has no hope in Gollum to begin with, while Frodo does.  Over the course of the film, and somewhat begrudgingly, Sam eventually wants to establish an understanding with Gollum.  Sam talks about the film's main themes in a great monologue in Osgiliath.  He realizes he's being a dick and it's hurting the Mission, so he extends the olive branch to Gollum.  Little does he know, Gollum is going to totally sell them out.  But Sam's arc was still completed.

* Faramir - He's an extension of Boromir in that he's the personification of ""Man"" - greedy, wants the easy way out, etc.  He's lost hope in himself too, if he ever had any.  The Ring is his way of rising above his shitty station in life.  But he realizes that he needs to trust Frodo and have faith in the Mission.  He rights Boromir's wrongs.

In the end, all the characters lose hope and then gain it back again, even if it's only a little bit or if there's still danger ahead.

And ROTK is about a whole bunch of these characters coming to the end of their arcs.  This film is about how underdogs can be heroes too.  Again I see a few ""main"" ones at the forefront:

* Aragorn - We get teased about his returning to the throne and all that, but that's never a real possibility until Elrond shows up and offers him Anduril.  Aragorn is such a badass that he doesn't seem like an underdog, but in the context of the story he very much is.  He leads Men on a suicide mission and eventually becomes King.  He never had faith in himself, but everyone else did.  Eventually, he believes in himself too (except a troll nearly kills him which was fucking lame).

* Merry/Pippin/Eowyn - These guys get shit on for most of the movie but each prove to be big heroes.  We've already seen Legolas/Gimli prove themselves so that's just fun.  But watching these characters come into their own is really satisfying.  You don't need to have seen the previous two versions to understand and empathize with them - especially Eowyn and Merry.  

I'm missing a whole bunch of stuff.  But I think the films stand on their own as 

* (1) I get by with a little help from my friends
* (2) Never give up hope; and
* (3) ""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future""

The firing of Priebus and Spicer is being seen as a huge blow to the 'GOP establishment' in the Trump administration. (Priebus is personal friends with Paul Ryan, and is a bridge to House members)

This is highly problematic for a few reasons:

-The GOP establishment, while maybe not the greatest statesmen in history, are an important counterweight to the... how do you say... nativist wing of the GOP, within the Trump administration. Granted the GOP administration is not the only counter weight, there are I would argue two others, the generals, and Jared/Ivanka. Now, I think most people (including you, I gather from your post) would like to see as many checks on the Bannon wing as possible, these two both have major issues. Trump's reliance on generals is a huge breach of the norms of civil/military relations, and with Jared/Ivanka you have problems with charges of nepotism. So my basic thesis is that both of these important checks on the ethnic nationalists in the administration are somewhat precarious, if the heat against the number of generals, or nepotism increase, we could see these groups sidelined. So a president would stregthen the GOP establishment, which while unexciting for a progressive, is much better than the Bannon wing. 

-Better foreign relations, no twitter diplomacy

-Much lower chance of winning re-election. People who say Trump will never win re-election need to look at base rates, a large majority of presidents of run for a second term win, however Pence seems to lack the political ability and support from the Trump base necessary to win 2020. 

-May encourage bipartisanship in the legislative. Most people, I think, would agree that the legislative works best when parties work together, compare GOP legislative under Clinton, to Debt ceiling incident under Obama. Right now, working with the Trump administration is a poisoned chalice for democrats, they'd get flayed in the media for any 'pro trump' voting, even if the bill had nothing to do with trump (see the thing on 538 that tries to measure which senators are more pro trump than expected). If the GOP manage to distance themselves from Trump, then the legislature can finally start to work again. 

-My last, and I think the biggest point: It will be a fundamental discrediting of Trump style politics. The accusation of any candidate being 'Trump-like' will be a death knell for their political viability, if Trump is vilified like Nixon was after Watergate. The GOP will lose 2020, as discussed above, and they will have to have a serious rethink of the direction their party has been going. 

Or Trump either wins, or comes sufficiently close to winning in 2020 (remember base rates), and it appears as though appealing to nativist tribalism is still a viable (or, worse *the viable*) political strategy for the GOP."	29.0	0.0	480	False	True	0.0

I think your view of ""anti-SJWs"" gets locked into a very specific (and possibly stereotypical) view of people who critique social justice movements. 

To find the value of people who criticize social justice warriors, let's try to find a rough historical approximation. This is an oversimplification, but when feminism flourished in the 1970s, it was largely dominated by well-educated, middle class white women. Intellectuals such as bell hooks would challenge a number of their assertions and the implicit assumptions that many of them made. For example, early feminists might say they wanted the same rights as a man, but they didn't mean a black man or a native American man. Through these efforts, the movement changed and evolved to widen its scope to race, class, etc. (I'm speaking very broadly here, so take this with a lot of salt). 

But I'm trying to lead to this question: would these types of critics fall into the category of ""anti-SJW"" or ""SJW""? Can they really be the former, if they were later absorbed by the movement they critiqued? And can they really be the latter, if they were such outspoken critiques in the first place? I think one of the biggest flaws of your post is looking at SJWs and anti-SJWs as two separate groups in total opposition and completely set in their ways.

* Right and pleasant
* Right but unpleasant
* Wrong but pleasant
* Wrong and unpleasant

Even if you disagree on what is right or wrong on the spectrum of left or right, civility is a whole separate dimension. You don't become pleasant just by being right and by the same token you aren't unpleasant by default if you're wrong. 

I would postulate that being a SJW or Anti-SJW is a separate item from being a decent human being. Sure, individuals are often whipped into a frenzy and become rabid for a cause, but being indoctrinated into an ideology does not perpetuate individuals to become assholes. 

Basically, reverse your thinking. People aren't assholes because they are SJW/Anti-SJW. People that are assholes get labeled SJW/Anti-SJW. Normal people are just left or right leaning individuals with different ways of thinking."	8.0	0.0	201	False	True	0.0

The SJW’s are mostly representative of a parent figure (a parent to society) though some consume the very thing they claim to be against (video games/movies feat sexism/violence).  They’re representing positions that are mostly moral and societal based.  Essentially, they know what’s best/worst for us (in simplistic terms). So, if we look at the SJW’s role as the parent, then through that same lens, the Anti-SJW’s represent the kids of those parents.  The Anti-SJW’s are roles represented mostly of consumers. One could argue that because SJW’s have swayed companies/people in the past, that a voice is needed to represent the other side of the coin.  There’s more that can be said to describe the Anti’s including the SJW’s but I think the point’s been made. So, It’s because of these differences that I believe it’s unfair to consider them both the same.  	4.0	0.0	151	False	True	0.0

So a pig would prefer that I not stab it, rather than I stab it. He argues that if you have the proviso, then you derive rights for animals from a utilitarian perspective. What is wrong with that argument? It seems like you just take animals not having rights as some axiom. Where do rights come from? It turns out to be really hard to explain rights without stumbling on some metaphysical view (like utilitarianism) that accidentally justifies animal rights as well. 	12.0	0.0	110	False	True	0.0

Okay here are the reasonable but incorrect assumptions you're making:

- the statues are old and represent the thinking of a simpler time when mankind didn't know better. 

They aren't. The statues are from the 20s 60s and 70s and coincide with Jim Crow laws, the height of lynchings, and the civil rights movement. They were put up recently to try to intimidate southern blacks. 

- removing the statues is about punishing people who are evil because of slavery. What about Washington, will we remove his statues?

Removing the statues is not about slave owners. It is about not honoring people who literal fought a war trying to kill the soldiers of this country in order to sustain a system that the [whole western world had already figured out was wrong at the time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Slavery_Convention) 

- removing the statues erases history. 

Statues are not history. They are memorials that honor legacies, people, and causes. Historical artifacts of value are being left in place or moved to museums like the national archives and Smithsonian where everyone can see them in their historical context. Most of these statues are not historical artifacts of history and *are* monuments to racism created by racists and attended in their construction and removal by racists. There were no history nerds protesting their removal because history nerds know that these statues do not in historic value. There were Nazis and white supremacist attending their removal because nazis and white supremacist know that they have racial oppression value. 

- confederate heroes aren't defined by their bad actions

Even General Lee thought confederate statues were a bad idea. Memorializing them encourages nostalgia for a wound that should have long since healed. Confederates are traitors to this country as defined by their legacy. Name one other country with statues of the heroes of a failed rebellion. There aren't any because it would undermine unity and social cohesion. Healing is more important. And even General Lee himself knew that. 

When asked to attend the dedication of a statue to confederate soldiers, General Lee replied:

And, consequently, why I'm a bit more conflicted about the removal of these memorials.

&gt; Statues are not history.

Neither is much of history, if we're looking for comprehensive factual accuracy. Our understanding of human history is only as complete as the record of art that has survived to modernity. And that necessarily includes monuments to evil people and publications of lies.

Put another way, human civilization is crucially dependent on the mechanisms by which we evolved into civilizations--the ability to pass on information in fixed media across generations. It is so far the only way we have been able to overcome the generational reset button when it comes to collective knowledge. But, as even recent history has shown, if history is sequestered in libraries and databases, whitewashed by new media, or eliminated altogether, people forget. Extremely quickly. Just look at vaccines. The Clean Air and Water Acts. Trickle-down economics. Allowing people to forget how bad things were--because, we *know* 90% of them will never research these things independently--is almost guaranteed to pull us back into the same problems given enough temporal distance.

To be sure, part of my conflict comes from the fact that, you're right, most of these statues were primarily in recognition of people and are otherwise devoid of express historical significance. And that, by letting these statues remain, it creates the impression that these men were important, when they were in fact just the product of small, ideologically motivated cults of personality.

But they do still say something important: that the South, even as recently as fifty years ago and by all accounts through today, is still a hotbed of crazy racist fanaticism. Crazy enough to build statues in honor of militant, racist shitstains. That is an incredibly important fact that, to my mind, should not be swept under the rug or forgotten.

Like many other historically wrong ideologies, I would rather some public records be preserved. I don't even see why there needs to be such an all-or-nothing approach to these statues, either. We could select a few statues of substantial historical significance to keep and destroy the rest. We could recontextualize the statues by erecting additional sculptures or buildings around them. Or even by outright defacing them and making them into mockeries.

I mean, I enjoy the catharsis of shitting on neo-nazis as much as the next guy. But I can't help but think that all of this is a bit shortsighted.

If there is more space, why build up or down, when you can build sideways? That, plus the fact that the automobile was developed alongside several American cities, means they were designed to be more car accessible and less public transportation. 

&gt; People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity.

It’s not that simple. You have to figure in the choices America made regarding a social safety net, and the effects of wealth inequality in America. Japan for example, has much lower productivity per hour, but has a better average public health. And it can’t be because of driving vs. not driving, because most people in Japan use trains, cars, or non-walking/biking forms of transportation to commute. You are leaving out the factor of diet, which somewhat relates again to the geography. It’s hard to have healthy fish dishes for example, when you are far from a large body of water. 

&gt; Here, the average city has no city center, major monuments, or sense of history.

This is the last one of your comments that struck me, and where I’m going to disagree the most. The reason why the average European city has more history, is because they’ve existed for hundreds of years longer. By the time America started getting settled, Europe was steeped in history. You can’t artificially add history into a city, and I think comparing a city with a 400 year history, and one with a 100 year history, is a bit of an exercise in futility.

However, I don't think American cities had to build sideways, just as European cities didn't have to build densely. In fact, most American cities have laws that require that the city be built in a sub-urban manner. Almost no cities have a density minimum, almost all cities have a density maximum for various zones across the city. Why build up when you can build sideways? By building up and down, we dramatically increase the economic productivity of the land, reduce environmental impacts, and allow more space for agricultural production. This is why the tiny country of the Netherlands can the second to the USA in gross worldwide agricultural production. 

2) You may be right about japan, but I'm not comparing US and Asian cities. Yes- diet, etc, all matter. I don't think they demonstrably matter more than the urban environment. The French have been well known for eating much more saturated fat than Americans, and yet have fewer heart issues than we do per capita. Why? It seems to me the #1 feature is cityscape, which allows for people to bike and walk, not drive. This leads to more passive exercise and less anxiety. 

3) I'll give you a partial  ∆ for this one- You're right that we're young. But even so- when looking around American cities, you're lucky if you see 1 historical monument, and it seems like it's always to the Confederate Dead or some general from the Civil War.

Current research has been pointing to sugar consumption as the major dietary contributor to heart disease, not saturated fat... and Americans eat a *lot* more sugar than almost anyone else in the world.  Medical conditions (chronic inflammation, dental disease, etc.) can also contribute to heart disease, and our lower level of access to affordable health care means that people are forced to let these conditions go untreated for decades.  

Americans are certainly less active on average than their European counterparts, but the walkability of cities isn't the *only* factor.  Americans tend to work more (500 hours more each year than the average German!) and take far fewer vacations.

We don't get to walk much of anywhere. As a result of things like Jay Walking Laws, which don't exist in Europe as I understand it, we've made it illegal to get around many cities on foot. This helps contribute to our over-imprisonment problem, which far-surpasses Europe. http://www.prisonstudies.org/map/europe

Our buildings are impractical, I would argue, because single-use zoning in the USA makes it far more difficult to change a building from a residence to commercial, or single family to multifamily uses. This is very impractical, because it directly hampers adapting uses in response to changing economic and social conditions.

The idea that Americans live near more people they like than Europeans has no support. I don't think Americans get along with neighbors better than Europeans do, but I couldn't find any contrary evidence. In my experience, Europeans dont find it difficult to find people who share interests and hobbies.

I find this comment curious. I suspect we're both basing our perspectives on anecdotal evidence (I know I am), but I haven't found your statement to be true at all in my own experience. As someone who has lived in multiple states and many very different cities, I've been surprised by how easy it is to find historical/cultural places even in tiny towns. I used to live in a town of 8,000 - a poor, blue collar, struggling community - there were historical markers and monuments all over town. We're talking dozens of monuments that I just stumbled upon in a town you could drive all the way through in &lt;2 min, and they were mostly unrelated to war/battles at all. The bigger cities I've lived in have had even more historical and cultural attractions. When I lived in the South, yes, there were plenty of Confederate monuments, etc., but those were FAR from dominant. My point is that - as it's currently presented - it sounds like you might be indulging in some confirmation bias when you compare European cities to US cities. How are you concluding that US cities have so few monuments? Are you making an educated guess based on what you remember seeing or are you actively looking for all the historical places in any given city? I imagine it also depends on where you live and travel.

Hahaha. I honestly agree with this on a deep level, but at the same time it is not what's actually going on in the military. Intrinsic motivation is doing something you enjoy for its own sake. Now, some of the people in the military may fall into such a category, but I'm pretty sure the majority are in it for the perks, which have to be really good to get people to join such a godawful bureaucratic mess full of incompetent people in leadership positions. 

Note that this isn't from personal experience, but reports and complaints from my brother who is in the navy as a nuke. He's also an example of ""in it for the perks"". They pay for education, pay six figure money for reenlistment, and you get all sorts of benefits for having military service history - looks good on resumes, preferential hiring, discounts, etc. etc. 


The argument I'd make for compulsory national service - which would include non-military service - is that if you want to have a functional democracy you should want an informed public, and one thing you want the public informed about is what their government is doing, how it's being run, what it's like to actually be part of it. We have many anti-government people in the US who haven't the faintest idea, but we also have very pro-government people who also haven't the faintest idea. Those people can debate intensely but they're talking past eachother. This isn't a good situation for a society to be in because it's never going to settle on the truth, you'll get no positive synthesis from the discourse.

It also can give people a certain shared experience, something many of us I think lack and which may be important culturally.

Potentially it also takes people who are dumped into real world from a fairly inadequate education system that doesn't teach them shit about being a person in the real world, and puts them in a safer situation than where they'd have ended up otherwise.

It's also meritocratic and fair, in a way, with serious potential to reduce poverty. Everybody has to do it, and if you do well it may allow people who otherwise wouldn't have been given the opportunity some upward mobility. 



There are clearly a variety of logistical problems to solve to achieve such, but I don't think that ""people should operate on intrinsic motivation"" should be your argument unless you're also prepared to argue for a restructure of almost everything about a capitalist society, because that's simply not what most people are doing right now. I am a warehouse manager, do I want to do what I do 5x8hours every week? Fuck no, there is *no* intrinsic motivation. It's only to get money to fund things I actually care about - like drinking and talking, art and music, etc. etc.

There's something called the agent-principal problem. As long as the agent knows things that the principal doesn't then there's no way to ensure that the agent is really acting in the best interests of the principal how the principal would define it.

Just having positive values and wanting to benefit humankind doesn't mean that they will be doing things in a way that's acceptable to us. For example, the AI might decide that removing someone from the house might be beneficial to humanity as a whole because of some unexpressed genetic predisposition to violence. You know, something that looks really bad but we should just trust it even though we're sacrificing one innocent person for the greater good. Or, it might just be a bug that develops in the code and that sacrifice and suffering is really unnecessary. We, as average persons, can't tell the difference between those two cases.

As it stand, we are operating on a premise that permits some crime to prevent unjust punishments on the innocent that's only partially successful. The AI might err on the other side, taking the line that preventative punishment is acceptable or even a positive good. I, personally, don't want to be in that world. But, if the benevolent and (mostly) positive AIs decide otherwise then would it even be possible to accommodate me or would I have to be removed? Consistency and predictable results are essential to a properly functioning legal system. I have to know that something is illegal in order to avoid it and if something is illegal but unenforced then I have to know that as well. If I do something and the legal response is not at all what I expect then we have a problem. The preventative function of punishment isn't working, or the arbitrary enforcement has signaled me bad information or whatever. Very often pursuing two strategies spoils both.

But, on a deeper level, this looks like a ""enlightened despotism"" argument. That if you have an enlightened and just ruler who has literally all the power and authority and no one can get in the way then that's the best government. As long as the ruler is perfect and infallible and just then I guess the argument works... but it doesn't work in practice for a variety of reasons. One of the big ones is that people rip those systems apart even if they are right but don't communicate how and why they are right in a way that the average person buys. But the big reason I'm against those systems and will be forever is that it requires perfection. We will never have perfection. An infinite number of AI generations won't get us to perfection, and what is ""right"" will be constantly changing. At best, we'll have an AI that's chasing an ever-shifting mix of needs and values that overshoots one way before correcting the other way. At worst, the AI screws up (probably because a person screwed up) and we're stuck in a regular old despotic political system.

I prefer separated powers. The sort of thing that requires compromise and an acknowledgement that those involved aren't perfect and are representing different acceptable paths forward. The more power reserved for the individual to make the decision that's right for them the better. This often isn't what's best for humanity, but we can get pretty close by manipulating it through taxation and regulation."	5.0	0.0	575	False	True	2.0

Most problems I can solve myself and all I need is to release pressure, hanging out with guy friends helps me do this more than support offered by female friends. 

Despite this being more common among guys doesn't mean guys cannot or will not provide support and let you talk about personal issues. 

&gt; Plus when with the guys it can get annoying as I'm not out as trans and they can tease me in a friendly way for being effeminate using the gay slur. I know it's not meant to be hurtful, but I really disagree with using gay or anything similar as an insult even a teasing insult or whatever.

This is something you should talk to them about. I don't know your situation or age but that is generally unacceptable to men. 


&gt;It can also get annoying as they talk about women sexually...a lot, with the girls they do talk about guys, but talk about relationships, relationship issues etc. Stereotypical I know, but this is my experience.

This is more of a preference when it comes to annoyance. My friends and I don't talk about women sexually a lot, but I don't think I could stand constant talk about their relationship troubles. That is not something I want our general topics of conversation to be about. 

I think maturity comes into play here again, again I don't know how old you and your friends are, but constant sexual talk about women is more of a teens early 20's kind of talk. It also hints at sexist behavior.

  


&gt; It can also be annoying as they are in general a lot more crude, rude and well laddish

Point 3:

Its not safe. A turned off car can't move. If there is an emergency vehicle or an accident or something that you need to respond to quickly, you can't. You are effectively leaving an inoperable vehicle in the middle of the road.

That said, people often use 'culture' in the way you are trying to use race (see: 'culturally jewish'), and use 'race' to refer to biological traits in the way we use 'sex'.

So, while you're correct that we theoretically *could* disassociate the biological and social aspects of the word 'race' into two different terms, one of them being purely a social construct, the fact is that the word 'race' is not currently defined this way, and if we *did* use two words to dissociate these concepts, it's more likely that 'race' would refer to the biological traits and we'd use some other word for the social construct concept."	50.0	0.0	212	False	True	0.0

Social constructs are very real, and can be very rigid.

For example: France is a social construct.

There's a bunch of dirt and rocks and farm fields and buildings and people in north-western continental Europe.  Those aren't social constructs.  But the idea that those things constitute ""France"" is a social construct.  The idea of a person or thing being ""French"" is entirely a social convention.  The borders between France and Germany and Spain and Italy are purely socially constructed things. 

And yet, becoming French, or changing those borders, is not something which one can do on a whim.  If you declare yourself to be French nobody need recognize that, and if you show up at a an airport there and claim to be French without meeting the French government's standards of French citizenship, you'll be laughed at and forced to get on a plane back from whence you came.

If you, or even the French government, wishes to change the land area which constitutes ""France"" they would traditionally have to go to war with another country to do so, because otherwise their attempt to make that other place France would be forcibly resisted by the non-France government whose land it was.

Not quite.  Gender is not divorced from the circumstances of ones birth, nor from ones biology.  People's gender and sex are correlated but it's not 1 to 1 (this is setting aside other cultural conceptions of third genders) because there are many other factors involved.

&gt;Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it ""shared experience"" and ""lived experience"", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 
&gt;
&gt;But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

The main reason that this is considered so taboo is that changing ones race can sometimes be seen as dismissing or ignoring the shared cultural struggles of a racial group. Rachel Dolezal wasn't considered offensive because she ""identified as black"", it was that she was changing what is generally considered an immutable characteristic linked to cultural experiences, many if which are negative. 

To put it simply, I bet there were a lot of black (or mixed race) people during slavery or the Jim crow era that wished they could identify as white, but they didn't have that luxury.  Even today black people in America face all kinds of adversity.  Rachel Dolezal minimized that kind of suffering by essentially joining a group without paying the price, for lack of a good way to phrase it. 

If there are people who ""identify"" as a different race, I would have to look more into the issue before forming a stronger opinion about how they should be regarded because I'm not totally sure what Kinds of factors would cause that.  But if it does turn out that being ""trans racial"" is a thing, and there is some kind of ""race dysphoria"", then I'd be totally for finding effective ways to help them, even if it means ""transitioning"".  At the moment, though, there is no evidence that that's the case, so it just looks like somebody is minimizing the struggle of black people by deciding what race they want to be. 

**edit:** Many people have replied to this comment by essentially saying that I'm claiming black people have it worse than women and that's why I think being ""trans-racial"" is worse.  To clarify, I do not think either is worse. The nature of oppression experienced by black people is rooted in a specific history. Not just a history of oppression, but a specific, traceable history, which is why I think it is different than the oppression experienced by women in general (you could make an argument that certain groups of women have specific, traceable oppression, though). My point here wasn't to try and convince everybody that one is worse than the other, just that there is a difference between how oppression relates to racial identity and how it relates to gender identity, and that that difference is likely a part of what causes such distinct reactions.

Social constructionism is one of these areas. So is race.

Gender is not really a social construct. Yes, there are *elements* of gender that are social constructs, but it a complicated topic. Let's start with what it isn't. I keep seeing this meme about ""sex"" being biological and ""gender"" being psychological and social, as if those things are mutually exclusive. People confuse ""biological"", ""physiological"", and confuse ""genetic"" and ""unchangeable"", and confuse ""psychological"" and ""social construct"". Both your physiology and psychology are largely biological, are mostly genetic, and much of society and culture is an emergent property of our biological tendencies. And our biology, psychology, personalities, and behaviours include portions that are from the environment around us, even moment by moment, and that environment includes social environment, which is in large part fed by our biological tendencies. To try to decouple these as being independent is madness, and ""social construct"" does not mean ""arbitrary"" or ""infinitely maleable"".

Let's take a specific example: women wearing lipstick. Clearly we have no genes for lipstick. Clearly lipstick is a social construct. It didn't come from nature and we didn't evolve with it, right? Sure. Yes. But if we removed all traces of lipstick, of ever wearing lipstick, eliminated it from our memories, and started societies over from an amnesiatic state, we'd reinvent lipstick, it would be women wearing it, and it would tend to be shades of red.

Why? Because of *why* we invented lipstick in the first place. It's because red lipstick on women's lips triggers an innate response in men that women want. Why? Because male mammals (especially primates) evolved an attraction and arousal response to seeing engorged red lips on females and we human males still have that instinctual response. OK, it's the wrong lips, but our arousal mechanism isn't a cognitive decision. It is a simple trigger.

It's like chocolate cake. We didn't evolve with cake. We invented it (a social construct) because it fed an innate response that we did evolve for sweet tastes, because high sugar/calories were rare and valuable in nature. When quick and easy calories were scarce for us, it improved our survivability and reproductive success. In an era where we have an abundance of quick and easy calories, that same innate response is bad for our health. We don't *decide* to want to eat it; it just tastes really good to do us and most people have cravings for high sugar foods (i.e., a ""sweet tooth"").

Lipstick feeds a similar desire. Men innately respond to women with red, pouty lips. Women innately (statistically) want to attract men as mates/partners and so do the things that attract them. Some of this is also innate (via sexual selection), and some of it is pattern recognition of what works (memetic/cultural evolution).

Women don't have the same innate attraction triggers. They don't tend to be aroused by red, engorged lips on men because males don't have body parts that this would arouse. This is why a new society would tend to re-invent lipstick, why women would wear it, and why it would tend to be shades of red.

(There are plenty of exceptions, but they aren't *statistically* significant and tend to come from other properties of humans. E.g., women wearing other shades like blue or dark black are exhibiting counter-culture and most men would not see them as attractive as wearing red lipstick. Some men wear lipstick in some rituals or activities, but again it's not regular, not the same cause, and not statistically significant in comparison. Also, it's not necessarily just red, but body tone shades that appear like blood has engorged the lips, which can vary by skin tone. 

Now, everything I just described about lipstick could be factually incorrect. I have no intention of presenting a scientific case for as this isn't a post about lipstick. Rather, I've used this case as an example of how genes, biology, psychology, and social behaviour interact with each other.

Wearing red lipstick very much a part of the female gender behaviour. It is a social *behaviour* that is rooted in our biology, rooted in sexual selection between males and females, and is a stable behaviour. It is associated with a female biological sex, corresponding to having vaginal lips, and corresponding to males being attracted to it. Just because there are a subset of exceptions to this does not change that because genes aren't like programs that dictate an exact response; they are more like subroutines that interact with other subroutines that are aggregated, usually aligned with each other, but not always for a variety of reasons.

Race is different. Biologically speaking, race comes from groups of humans that evolved in separate geographic locations for long enough to show some physical (and possibly psychological) differences. 

A ""perfect"" division of people into races could hypothetically happen if they all only reproduced within the same isolated groups for long enough. If you were to plot the statistical distribution of their features it would look like a series of mountain peaks with valleys below -- all of one race in one distribution associated with the geographic location and ancestry -- and few individuals or none with features between two ""races"". (The ""valley"" between the peaks.)

It isn't necessary for them to be completely isolate though, as long as the gene flow was a small enough percentage of the group they would still evolve statistical differences. The more they interbred, the more those peaks would become lower, the width of the distribution ""hill"" would widen, and those valleys would raise, creating ""undulating hills"" of distributions of traits.

Since global travel started growing, we see more and more of that, but we do still see a lot of homoegenous regions and subcultures in multicultural societies that mate only with others of their same ""kind"". That keeps the hills from flattening out completely, but they will tend toward continual erosion into one large, flat, mixed race eventually.

None of that is social construction so far.

We also have genetic tendencies though. One is ingroup/outgroup tribalism. We don't have genes for racism, nationalism, or similar group separations; what we have is a genetic tendency toward identifying which ""tribe"" we belong to and who belongs to other ""tribes"". We do this for mathematical reasons of our history. There is safety and value in numbers vs being a lone individual, particularly in certain environments as far as food, mating, and predators. In times of scarcity, if there are too many people fighting over too little resources, there's value in ganging up -- two people taking the food of one person and splitting it is better than both going hungry. But only to a point. Too big a group means fighting again for the resources. There is a maximum size for the group based on available resources. That leaves some people as rejected out of the group. Their best interests are to form another group to fight back against those taking things from them. Gang war, basically. Chimpanzees do this, as do humans.

You can trigger ingroup/outgroup tribalist behaviour very easily by identifying people into groups and putting those groups in conflict, e.g., using eye colour from [Jane Elliott's classroom experiment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201012/in-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds), random assignment to groups as in the [Robbers Cave Experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html), or any random thing: favorite sports team, city, country, language, political leanings, Android vs iOS, Coke vs Pepsi, etc. This has been repeated thousands of times and is well modeled, such as by [Realistic Conflict Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory). You see it triggered all the time with even simple insults like ""black criminality"" or ""white privilege"", which includes both tribe identifiers (skin colour) and a conflict between groups by throwing insults aimed at all people of that skin colour. That creates hatred immediately out of nowhere.

What does that have to do with race? Well, physical features are an obvious grouping that people can easily define ""tribes"" based on, combined with familiarity and relatedness, so people tend to congregate more, and live around, people of their own race. That's why you get ""Little Italy"" and ""Chinatown"" areas of cities. 

And, *culture* tends to be of similar nature of geographic location. Ergo there is a tight correlation between race, ethnicity, and culture. But there is no particular reason for them to go hand in hand. An Asian child brought up in a mostly black neighbourhood will tend toward the local culture, and vice versa. Culture is what we grow up around, not about race or ethnicity. There is no ""white culture"" or ""black culture"" or ""Asian culture"". There is, however, culture from regions and neighbourhoods that tend to be statistically more one race than another because of our groupish tendencies, not inherently due to race.

So these are different causes, and different from gender. Most of it is biological but huge social factors that combine a bunch of our innate tendencies, and the creation of correlations that we tend to recognize as patterns and associate together. So sometimes people mean physical features when they say ""race"", and sometimes they mean cultural features, the latter being correlative and less accurate. The former is not a social construct per se, the latter sort of is. And, the boundaries between races are fuzzy and getting fuzzier.

These are complex topics that too many people try to oversimplify.

The frustrating truth is that every ""social construct"" is unique and some may have a closer correlation with natural circumstance than others. I think this dilemma stems from a false equivalence between these two concepts that have critically essential nuances that differentiate them.

I've always thought of ""gender"" as a set of behavioral characteristics that, for the most part, correlate with natal sex. There *is* a biological basis for this association, and that is brain structure. We, humans, know that there are structural differences between male and female brains that, for the most part, correlate with natal sex. Sorry for the repetitive sentences, but my point is that your behavioral characteristics and your thoughts are all a result of something very physical, your brain. Gender Identity Disorder occurs when the structure of one's brain more resembles that of the opposite sex than natal sex: it is a medically recognized condition with a secure method of treatment; plenty of research is available via Google. Based on this, it seems reasonable to say that gender is the ""sex of the brain,"" which is capable of being opposite from the genetic trait of sex, albeit a rare occurrence. By this definition, a ""social construct"" is not even necessary to explain the concept of gender and the occurrence of transgender people.

Many people are conflating actual transgenderism with different personality disorders and what I'll call ""special snowflake-ism,"" which seems to be exclusive to people who grew up in the digital age. Many people tend to hyperfocus on the single trait of gender, resulting in people claiming to be Nth gender; they are mistakenly associating their unique personality traits with their gender.

It is also important to remember that gender dysphoria is not exclusive to transgenderism, which is why there are, and should be, many hoops for those claiming to be transgender to jump through before making any serious decisions. It's not as simple as saying, ""I'm the other gender now!"" There is an institutional ""skepticism,"" so to speak, to keep it from being that simple.

The issue of ""transracialism"" is not comparable because there is no ""race of the mind"" to come into conflict with the genetic characteristic of race; or, at least, this has no scientific basis. The concept of a ""race of the mind"" seems to coincide more with the cultural experience of growing up as a part of a certain race. Of course, its silly to pretend you are a part of a culture that you are not, regardless of skin color. As far as I'm aware, and do correct me if I am wrong, it would be impossible to discern skin color from observing a brain scan, unless you were to make an assumption based on common mental conditions within a demographic, but that's ultimately beside the point.

It seems to me that ""transracialism"" is nothing more than another attempt by people with weak self-identities to find a new, exciting label for themselves. Unfortunately, this type of culture-hijacking and self-diagnosis behavior gets conflated with genuine transgenderism, which is a studied and well understood medical condition.

In short, nuance nuance nuance.

As an aside, why are we always hyper-focusing on arbitrary physical traits? Who cares? We are all humans, meant to be individual and real to ourselves, not our genetic traits. We should not be so obsessed with these characteristics that we forget to see the humanity in others *and* ourselves."	5.0	0.0	589	False	True	0.0

Just googled a bit, and I saw that infidelity primary definition is different in french and english. In english, it's quite simple, it's having sex with someone who is not your husband / wife / regular partner. In french, it's the ""Lack of respect for a given commitment"". 

&gt; It would be better if this was discussed with openness instead of men or women going behind their partners backs

Given my definition, only the ""behind their back"" is a case of infidelity, as in the 1st case, you can do whatever you want in your relationship as long as both partners agree on it.

Anyway, that was for in introducting a bit what I understand of the word ""infidelity"". As for the reasons why these are seen as really bad, I think that's because : 

* It break trust.

A couple is ""normally"" based on honnesty and discussions to take the better decisions and compromise for a good life together. When cheating, you're telling your partner ""Ok, but when something is not good for me, I'll do whatever I want behind your back and not talk to you"". This is quite a heavy blow on the other partner for its expectations toward the relationship future.

* It make the cheated partner take sexual risks he wasn't aware of.

When you have sex, there is always a risk of STD, that you can control if you are in a exclusive relationship, but can't if one have extra conjugal relationship. Even with protections, you can catch something, and you're putting your partner at risk without telling him/her, what is pretty jerkish toward someone you're engaged and supposed to love.

* Social stigmata

Finally, most communities are seeing infidelity as a stigmata. Sometimes, it can be even worse for the one that has been cheated on, that for the cheater. Cheating on your partner put him/her in a position where he/she can suffer for a big social stigmata, and you did that only for your carnal pleasure.

 * Distancing characters from comic books. Comics have a reputation of being complicated to buy into - you have to track down old stories to get the full continuity, fans tend not to be very casual, plots are complex and span weeks, etc. The new movies are designed so that even if you've never heard of a franchise you can watch any of them and you're usually fine. Breaking from the comic-book aesthetics is a way to signal this to potential audiences.

 * Live action action scenes inherently look better to most. While you can achieve better expressiveness, extravagance and precision with animation, there's something more appealing in live action, because you can more easily place yourself in the building that's being destroyed or on the street being flooded with lava.

 * Many modern superhero films attempt (to varying degrees of success) to make their characters human. I think this is also done to widen the appeal of the characters to people who'd rather view superpowers as a metaphor, or who are more interested in a human story. This is obviously easier to do when people are live shot.

I generally agree with you that by shifting to animated superhero films, studios could focus more of their time and money on story, character and aesthetics, and we'd end up with a potentially better result, but I think this has many drawbacks for the non-comic-literate general public, and that's why they don't choose this path."	17.0	0.0	269	False	True	0.0

I've put a lot of thought into the distinction between subjective and objective, and I hope I can convince you that musical quality is an entirely subjective experience.

**Is quality a measure of the producer's skill?**

You say: 

&gt;Music quality can be determined roughly by the question ""If I were to sit down with an instrument (guitar,piano,midi keyboard, DAW, etc.) for 30 minutes, would I be able to make this song?""

This seems to suggest that you would measure quality of music based on the difficulty of producing that music. I'll bet that a brief consideration of your favorite music will put that idea to rest. I don't have the technical experience to produce most of the mixes and distinct timbres that I hear in hip hop music, and yet I love Bach's Prelude #1 from The Well Tempered Clavier, incredibly simple though it may be. I value that first prelude (and other ultra-simple pieces like The Merry Peasant, Clapping Music, or many two-part inventions) over half the grand orchestral works I hear, even though the orchestral works took orders of magnitude more effort to produce.

**Is quality a measure of innovation?**

You say:

&gt;How much of this song is just a copy of some melodic ideas that someone else already explored before? How much is just copy paste from standard western music theoretical frameworks?

This suggests a different standard: that musical quality should be measured by how unique the piece is, and how much it diverges from past frameworks. This, of course, means throwing out Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc, each of whom were firmly steeped in the musical traditions of their past (and even saw themselves this way. Mozart, for example, saw his music as merely an attempt to slightly improve on Haydn.) This would also mean that *avant-garde* music would very obviously always be the best quality, no contest. I don't think most listeners would back up that point of view.

**Is quality a measure of planning?**

You say:

&gt;Could I improvise this song? Or better yet, did the person basically improvise this song? 

This suggests a third standard: that the quality of music is determined by how well-planned the performance is. Again, I think a brief review of music would show this to be false. Expert jazz improvisations seem to be much more moving, exciting, interesting, and passionate than a lot of boring-but-well-planned string quartets. 

**Wrap-up: What is subjective?**

Altogether, let me suggest to you that scrambling between different objective standards is a dead giveaway of subjectivity. Yes, you're right that there a ""Can be an objective nature"" to music quality, but with such vague language, this observation could be applied to absolutely any subjective measurement. There ""can be an objective nature"" to the question of which ice cream is tastiest. There ""can be an objective nature"" to which Gilligan's Island character is 'the best'. But by any reasonable split of what is  'subjective' and what is 'objective', these things are best classified as subjective. And so is musical quality.

There is no necessary reason members of a group must be especially similar to each other, especially if those groups were created by someone else (like a boss). 

I'm guessing you are more of a loner than a social person. If so, this would account for why you see such differences between people who prefer to be alone and people who are more group-oriented. The idea of in-group heterogeneity says that people believe their own groups consist of people with varied characteristics who are not all that similar to each other. Here, you aren't talking about being a member of a group. But if you identify as more of a loner, then you likely fall victim to this bias when thinking about other loners.

'Conscientious' means ""meticulous, careful, governed by or conforming to the dictates of conscience."" Basically, someone who actively tries to do the right thing. It's often used to refer to people who think about others' needs and wants. I suppose you can be conscientious in an ambitious way, that is, you try hard to do the right thing because you believe it will help you succeed, but ambition isn't a necessary quality of conscientious people or of extroverts in general.

I guess my main question would be what you think the qualities of extroverts are. 'Extrovert' just means someone who draws energy from being with others.

Since this latter one is better defined and more widely known than the detailed ideas in the field of psychology, I'll use it to illustrate. 

MBTI says that people can be characterized on 4 axes (text copied from the MB website). 

There's a lot of controversy about the usefulness of these *specific* four axes... but the point remains that people are different in more ways than liking to be alone or not. 

&gt;Favorite world: Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world? This is called Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I).

This is basically the axis that you focus on in your view. Yes, some people are energized by being in groups, while other people prefer to rest by themselves. 

But it's important to note that this is an *axis* not a binary. You can be in the middle, and in fact, most people are not at the extremes of this axis, but prefer some alone time and some time with people, with only the *amounts* varying. 

But there are other personality type axes that you can recognize if you really look at people and try to understand them: 

&gt;Information: Do you prefer to focus on the basic information you take in or do you prefer to interpret and add meaning? This is called Sensing (S) or Intuition (N).

Surely you have met some people who are ""just the facts Ma'am"" types, vs. people that don't care that much about facts but like to go on intuition. An example would be scientific people vs. some kinds of religious people, for example. These are huge differences in world view and personality. 


&gt;Decisions: When making decisions, do you prefer to first look at logic and consistency or first look at the people and special circumstances? This is called Thinking (T) or Feeling (F).

Again, I'm sure that you've found that some people are more interested in logic, and that some other people are more interested in feelings. Stereotypically, this is a divide between men and women, but of course both sexes have these focii to different degrees even if there might be a cultural reason for a statistical difference. 

&gt;Structure: In dealing with the outside world, do you prefer to get things decided or do you prefer to stay open to new information and options? This is called Judging (J) or Perceiving (P).

Again, surely you've seen that some people like to plan things out, and other people like to be spur of the moment... and that this is true both for loners and in-group types. 

Often, in groups, such people will take charge, and organize the group activity, for example... 

Ultimate, look at all the differences between people, not just introversion. Don't get hung up on whether this particular framework is ""correct"". Think about it more generally.

For example: if you think that men and women are different, then this pretty much refutes your idea that ""in group"" people are ""all the same""... unless you think that all groups are solely male or female, but I'm sure you can find many counterexamples. 

Or take another example: intelligence. Surely you don't think that everyone is the same degree of being smart... and that's a pretty big difference between people. I can assure you that not all smart people are loners.

I'm very glad to hear that your book searching skills are up to shape. I wish that I could say that the students I work with on a daily basis are there. 

It is very common for me to encounter students who have not searched for a book since elementary school, if at all. The catalog is a fairly complex instrument. I would think that a call number is not, but I've helped about a dozen students so far this week who thought that a call number should be read from right to left or from the middle outward. They were lost in the stacks as a result. Once they get the books, the work has just begun. I have to introduce them to the table of contents and the index. Although most students know what a table of contents is, a subject index is often a new concept.

These students are, I should emphasize, not stupid. They're just not familiar with these tools.

For most students that I work with, their first instinct is to go to Google. The job of us librarians is to make searching the catalog and subscription databases (where they can find periodicals and full-text ebooks) as straightforward as possible. A professor requiring a certain number of books, both print and electronic, and periodical articles from the databases, helps us teach students how to use these tools. Otherwise, most will go straight to Google and never learn how much information is not available on the World Wide Web.

It's possible that some of your classmates are not as ready for book searching as you are. They may need this opportunity to learn. Hopefully your library print collection provides better sources than drug policy texts from 1993."	152.0	0.0	335	False	True	0.0

You make a good point that political beliefs and religious beliefs should be treated similarly, which is why I think the word “creed” is included with religion.  A “creed” is not necessarily religious, but instead can be broadly defined as “a set of beliefs or aims that guide someone’s actions”.  A political ideology can be considered a “creed” and can be protected accordingly. 

This mostly happens at the state level; most states have laws that protect people from being fired from jobs or otherwise discriminated against on the basis of political affiliation.  Most of the legislation seems to be concerned with protecting the rights of workers to organize unions or advocate for better working conditions.  There doesn’t seem to be much protection for other forms of discrimination, like being refused service at a restaurant, and I think the obvious reason is that it’s just difficult to even discriminate in that manner.

Did a bit of reading on the issue just now, and two points arose immediately in my mind:

First, the issue is being litigated.  California law does prohibit being fired for political discrimination, and political discrimination is being invoked in the lawsuit, alongside racial and gender discrimination against white men (snort).  The lawsuit is going to hinge on the factual matter of whether or not the employee was actually fired for his politics, his race, or his gender, or whether Google fired him for more legitimate and legally acceptable reasons.  In any case, the letter of the law in California still holds that firing someone for their political affiliations would be illegal.

Secondly, there is an interesting crossfire of issues going on in this case.  If the political affiliation being discriminated against is one which itself is accused of being discriminatory, what happens then?  This is what Google is going to argue: they fired an employee who himself was circulating memos that were discriminatory in nature.  If discrimination is a part of someone’s political creed, does discrimination against that political creed become acceptable?  And if so, how far do we need to go down somebody’s political rabbit-hole to determine whether they are actually discriminatory?  Hypothetically, you could have some weird Neo-Nazi who says, “I’m not discriminatory, I think all races should be included in my ideal political structure; it’s just that they should all be subsumed under the control of the master race for their own good, but I still believe that they have rights that should be protected and that they should not be completely discriminated out of the picture” – would this wacky viewpoint contain discriminatory elements that would justify an employer firing them?  How far would we have to indulge their views to reach that conclusion?  (Note: definitely not saying that I have any answers, I just think the questions are very interesting)

But I do think taken together they at least leave a bi-omni (or indeed tri-omni) god as a possibility.

First we have to break down omnibenevolence and omnipotence.

When we talk about benevolence in more general terms, we're talking about an interest in what's best in a broader scope. A parent may make their child eat vegetables they don't like, or get a painful innoculation because the temporary and minor unpleasantness is dwarfed by the downsides of malnourishment or deadly disease. It is considered benevolent to create discomfort or even pain when the long term effects are bigger. And since most religions with a tri-omni god believe in an eternal afterlife, then any pain felt in our finite lives is dwarfed if it is necessary to avoid infinite negative consequences.

The obvious rebuttal is that inflicting temporary pain for greater good is only a necessity for a parent because that parent is not omnipotent. If a parent could make their kid grow up strong eating only things they loved, they probably would. If a parent could wipe out infectious disease, or make a child's tastebuds love veggies, they probably would.

So here we get into a definition of omnipotence. It can't be the ability to do anything we can state, because that would include things like creating a square with three sides, logical contradictions. If our bar for omnipotence included that ability, then omnipotence would be an illogical quality and we wouldn't need a problem of evil to challenge it.

So taking as our bar logical possibility, could there be a logical necessity, unseen by us within the vastness and complexity of the universe which makes eternal happiness impossible without temporary suffering on earth? I'm not asking if such a thing is likely, or if you believe that such a thing exists. Since we're overall talking about whether the idea of an omnibenevolent and omniscient god is POSSIBLE, then we only need to agree that such a logical necessity could POSSIBLY exist. Unless you know of a reason that it can't, it follows that the tri-omni god could be constrained by such a logical necessity and that the current world is the least amount of suffering such a god could logically allow to achieve a much greater payoff for humans.

Personally, I don't believe in such a necessity or such a god, but there is no reason they couldn't possibly exist. They're just incredibly unlikely from the available evidence."	2.0	0.0	423	False	True	0.0

Have you ever heard of Leibniz’s “best of all possible worlds” argument?  Check this out:

https://www.britannica.com/topic/best-of-all-possible-worlds

The real fulcrum of the argument is the idea that human beings are incapable of actually imagining a world with less evil and suffering because of our limited perspective.  We erroneously assume that better worlds are possible, but when we imagine those better possible worlds we must be blind to how they would yield an even greater evil and more suffering than what currently exists.

If there are certain things that are required for the sake of pleasure, in every possible configuration of the universe, then a being could still be able to do anything that’s logically possible...and yet face real restrictions in being able to help.

Scott Alexander popularized what might be the best counterargument to make, in both his blog SlateStarCodex and his web serial Unsong.  He says that if god’s goal is to create as much happiness as possible, then he ought to create every universe that contains happiness, where the happiness is enough to make the pain worthwhile.  So, if there’s a possible universe where people can get tortured, but also most people throughout all of history can be deeply happy to a large degree, then the people of that universe deserve the chance to exist.  Kind of like a cosmic Omelas argument.

Not to say this isn’t controversial: in reality, I actually agree with you, for reasons I can clarify below if you like.  But it does make sense that an omnibenevolent god might, by virtue of knowing everything, be in a situation where it needs to create a world with some suffering in order to allow for the existence of even more joy.

1) We are working off of presumptions that we have no proof of for the sake of this whole conversation — “God” is omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, omniscient. 

2) We are working off of unspoken presumptions that out of all possible choices, numbered to infinity, we are stuck to one god for all the known and unknown that exists. 

What if it exists that there are gods who make gods?Then, out of all their power and knowledge, they made everything that the beings in their systems are ever capable of touching, seeing, or even able to contemplate? What if our assumed god is limited in comparison to the scope of what other gods can do in ways beyond our human comprehension?

This is a rabbit hole that has no answer. 

For us to even have conversations, it’s a basic need for our human minds to make and run off of assumptions. These assumptions that we talk about come from men of religions who have thought about this before and written about it. 

I personally believe there is a creator. The reason why has to do with the balance found naturally everywhere. The laws of physics that we know thus far that suggest for anything to function in our “realm”, balance is needed. Balanced is achieved through creating a range on a spectrum. (Maybe the range is decided on by the creator)

Balance is needed for human emotion. It’s needed in order for us to know how we are feeling. Thus, a spectrum of human emotion is needed. If we only ever know one place on the spectrum between happiness and sadness, we wouldn’t even know what happiness or sadness is. We have to experience all of it to know it. We can’t even have this conversation of “why did god create suffering” without the whole spectrum of human emotion already being in place. I have to have been sad to know when I’m happy. I have to have been happy to know when I’m sad. Depression doesn’t torture a person because they’re only at the lowest point of sadness in their life. It’s torture because in at least one point of their life, they learned what happiness was and currently don’t know how to get back to it. 

Suffering is needed. Range of spectrum is needed.  We’re all dead in one way or another without it. 

This is why I really don’t believe in a heaven or a hell. If there is an afterlife, I feel there must still be the full spectrum. Being happy all the time seems boring. Being sad or tortured in the same exact way for eternity seems boring. There’s no point. A spectrum was created and a balance was struck in all aspects of what we know as humans. We have swings from one end to another, but it’s needed to know where we are currently. "	1.0	0.0	490	False	True	8.0

If you’re accused of something with any political potential this could provide a bias for the judge. Not saying the judge is likely to throw you in jail when he absolutely believes you innocent, but he now has a bias that could turn him against you. Example: you’re in a drunken fight antagonized by the other guy. He files criminal charges the next day and you do not.

Let me start with ""if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?""  Illegally obtained evidence is actually a point toward juries in my opinion.  If there was illegally obtained evidence your attorney will likely make a motion to suppress before the trial.  Motions are heard without a jury with only a judge.  If you're having a bench (judge) trial, the judge will consider the legality of the evidence and then simply exclude it from his consideration.  If you're having a jury trial, the judge will exclude the information pretrial and the jury will never hear it.  We like to pretend judges can simply not consider what they hear, but they're people and I don't always trust them.  If the case has a lot of legal issues that can be resolved pretrial, I would lean toward jury.  

Juries also tend to be more prejudiced than judges do.  That can be really bad if you're a black man in a rural white community, but it can also be good if you're a white man in that same jurisdiction and the chief witness against you is a black man.  More common is if the chief witness is currently incarcerated and will come in to testify in a jail uniform and the defendant is also in jail.  The judge will know you're both in jail, but the jury won't.  The jury will see a witness in peels but a defendant in court appropriate attire.  Juries being bad can be good with the right circumstances.  

The vast majority of the jury trials I set however are for people who I think are innocent....or at least the people I don't think there is enough evidence to convict.  Setting a jury forces a prosecutor's hand.  Juries are a LOT of work.  Setting a case for jury often gets better offers, and often a straight up dismissal.  Setting it for jury is sometimes like a game of chicken, and if you're willing to go to trial the best bet for getting it dropped without the risk of a trial is to risk the jury and hope the other side is too lazy or too scared to take the case to trial.  

Basically, choosing jury or judge is not so simple as actually innocent or not.  There are a lot of things to consider, and while bench trials ARE often better, there are situations where a jury may be more likely to get you the result you want.  Guilty or innocent, you should never firmly make the decision as to judge or jury without consulting your attorney.  "	601.0	0.0	470	False	True	0.0

I realize that the latter option would still have the end goal of having a PhD. However, if you are able to partake in option A, it is worth pursuing before you consider pursuing PhD. The market is becoming over saturated with advanced degrees; such degrees do not guarantee better employment. In fact, many colleges will opt to hire those with a masters degree. You can still get tenure with a masters degree too. Now you may not want to work in academia, but this is still a good indicator of employment in general. 
The advantage to obtaining a masters degree is that it isn’t as time consuming, still makes you more competitive, and will give you an idea of what a doctorate program will be like. If credits can apply to PhD anyway, then it would be like a bridge.

My current understanding is that the process of transferring credits between graduate courses is not as simple and streamlined as how you have it laid out. There are complications from school to school, across different states and across different countries. 

Regarding option a, there will eventually be some dead weight between the process of an initial master's program and then a separate PhD program after. Applying for programs, waiting for semesters to start, etc. it is less efficient than simply enrolling in a PhD program from the get go. The longer a PhD program is put off into the future, the less the ROI. Even if I start a PhD at my current age right now, when I finish, it's estimated I'll be several years older than the average age of a newly PhD grad.

As a follow up, would you be okay living anywhere in the country? One thing to consider is that after you earn the degree, if you choose to be a professor like you mentioned above, jobs are highly competitive in academia; the institution chooses you instead of vice versa. There are many more PhD candidates than there are jobs as professors for many reasons now more than ever. Researching the job outlook would be a good idea. If you’re willing to live anywhere, single, and willing to take the risk that you might not land a job in academia, then PhD might work out. 
One risk of obtaining the PhD is the word “overqualified.” If you don’t get a job right away in academia, many employers will turn you away simply for the fact that you have an advanced degree and they don’t want to pay you more. Even if you tell them you’ll settle for a lower salary, they fear that you will leave them later on in pursuit of something like ... a job in academia. 
The above reasoning is what convinced me not to pursue it. I wasn’t necessarily willing to live anywhere, I wasn’t willing to take the risk of not landing a job in academia, and I didn’t want to hear “overqualified” especially given the fact that I already heard it after I earned my masters degree. 
I worked for a recruiting company for several years, and many employers told us to essentially toss any applications that had advanced degrees listed for the reason above. They valued skills and experience over degrees 
Here’s something to consider instead: go for a masters degree. 
Reasons: 
1. Two years is less time to commit. If you hate it, then it’s a short time.
2. You can have time to research and see if you enjoy it. I bet you would, given your self-description. You can learn research skills via writing a thesis and get yourself published. 
3. You can most definitely get a job in academia. Sure, you likely won’t be working for a place like MIT, but a masters degree can mean everything at a community college: tenure, department chair, or even just teaching. You would have the chance to be more picky on geographical location, and still do everything in academia. No, comm colleges aren’t as prestigious as universities. But you could use the community college to really make an impact in your field through teaching AND having an institution to help fund research and conferences. "	1.0	0.0	438	False	True	4.0

One fantastically important advance that's happening now is the eradication of polio. There used to be hundreds of thousands of cases annually, with high fatality rates, and many victims left permanently disabled. 

Last year, there were 27 cases worldwide. 

The Big Bucks response to Polio would have been expensive interventions in hospitals, and expensive patented medication. The actual response - eliminating polio via a thorough vaccination programme - has been much more effective, but involved *spending* money. There's no cash in eliminating disease. 

Malaria cases have dropped by 67% in the past two decades, from 1.5 million annually to 500,000 annually. The Big Bucks response would have been experimentation with expensive medication - but since Malaria is almost unknown in the wealthy parts of the world, there was no money in that. Instead, astounding progress has been made by distributing insecticide-treated mosquito nets to affected areas. There's no cash for wealthy health companies in that.

In the developed world, perhaps the biggest health crises now is obesity. The Big Bucks solution would be new cholesterol medications, or surgical treatments. However, the most effective treatement for obesity is diet and exercise, which also reduces your chance of a huge number of expensive and dangerous illnesses. There's no money to be made in educating the public about the need to eat healthy and walk 30 minutes a day.

An upcoming health crisis is antibiotic resistance. My mother-in-law passed away in January, when a wound on her knee got infected by a normal skin bacterium that happened to be resistant to all the antibiotics they tried. There are already strains of tuberculosis which are resistant to all known antibiotics. Google tuberculosis. It's a very unpleasant illness, and we may soon have no way to treat it. 

The world urgently needs research to discover new antibiotics. And, when new antibiotics are discovered, and found to be effective and safe, they need to be *not used*, but kept in reserve to fight the strains of disease that are immune to all the others - because if the new antibiotics get used, the bacteria become immune to them as well, and we're back to square one. 

There's no money to be made in investing hundreds of millions of dollars to discover new medication that is then only sparingly used. 

In all these cases, keeping the American Healthcare system only promotes certain types of innovation - specifically, innovations that discover expensive treatments, where a market for the treatment exists. In many important cases, there are cheaper treatments that are more effective. Either medical advancement is rolling along just fine without Big Pharma, or medical advancement has stalled anyway, because Big Pharma can't see a way to make money there.

However often what we say is immoral even if it is still protected. The body of your post only seeks to establish the immorality of birth, but you are missing the arguments that would establish the relevance of this immorality.


That being said I would agree with you that having children is not a basic human right, and that seeking to contol that is a violation of your rights. Strictly speaking rights are more philosophical not practical. Functionally they are more or less the same though. People also do not have the right to breath, however any thing you do to prevent someone from breathing would be a violation of their rights. 


As to the morality of having kids, that comes up in CMV a lot and I would encourage you to search old posts. 
To address your anology specifically, 

&gt; We can take this principle and apply it to human babies. By having a child, you are creating a conscious entity; you've taken control of its life.

I don't think I follow this part. The goal of most parebts is to have their child become and independent adult, not to live a life of slavery only to then by killed the parent. If you only seek to use your kid for personal gain then kill it, I think everyone would agree that your being immoral. Would you feel it is immoral to make AI with the intent that they grow and learn then eventually take control of their life and find success and happiness.


&gt; Every new human life also means new suffering. We find that inflicting suffering upon someone is immoral, and even allowing someone to suffer is widely considered immoral. 

We generally accept that it can be moral to cause suffering or allow them to happen at certain time. For instance when the suffering will bring about something good. An example would be a coach. Their job is basically to make their team suffer so that they can get better and win games. if all suffering ass immoral then coaches would be Hitler.

(For the following, I will assume both that there are no practical impediments to your prohibition and that it would be accepted as legal by the relevant parties. FWIW, I'm an atheist.)

At heart, religion is a set of non-empirical statements. ""God exists"", ""After you die, you will go to heaven"", ""Jesus rose from the dead"", ""If someone strikes you on the cheek, do not retaliate, instead, let them strike the other cheek,"" etc. are all religious statements that cannot be verified as true. In claiming that we should prohibit children from being taught religion, the axiom of your action appears to be, ""We should not teach children that statements which have not been verified to be true are true."" This sounds perfectly defensible. Until you remember the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem).

In brief, the problem is that *no ought-statements, whether secular or religious, can be verified to be true*. I can empirically say that, ""Shooting someone in the head will kill them."" I cannot empirically say that, ""Shooting someone in the head is wrong unless they are putting you in mortal danger.""

So, if we are to both prohibit the indoctrination of religious creeds to children and be intellectually consistent, we must also prohibit the indoctrination of secular value systems. That outcome is unacceptable for reasons that I hope are self-evident, therefore we must permit the religious indoctrination of children.  "	10.0	0.0	244	False	True	0.0

Feeling compulsions and/or being somewhat obsessed about something does not, by itself allow for a diagnosis of the condition.  Only a significant amount of distress, impairment and/or loss of functionality, when diagnosed by a trained professional (psychiatrist), represents actual OCD.  I'm afraid your example is trivial and fails to meet the definition in the DSM.  While the man feels 'uncomfortable', or 'small anxiety' is is able to to continue the activity, continue interacting with his friend, and is not compelled to complete a ritualistic behaviour.  Bluntly speaking, our hypothetical man does not meet the clinical definition of OCD, and thus, does not have the disorder.  This is the key distinction.

To explain the source of displeasure created by the expression ""I'm OCD about ____"", those of us with diagnosed with OCD have often endured years worth of time lost to irrational compulsions in response to obsessive thought patterns we are unable control (without treatment).

If it's the latter, I'd really encourage you to at least consider the possibility that a police officer under investigation by both his own department and the FBI might have an incentive to ""remember"" circumstances justifying the shooting.

In particular:

&gt;he tried to take a cop's weapon, and that he attempted to charge said officer after attempting to evade arrest again

From where do you find this uncontested ""fact""?

And how do you explain the officer's conduct in washing his hands (you know, like how you would get rid of evidence) and bagging his own gun into evidence (you know, like no other suspect gets to do because they might tamper with it)?

And how would you like to approach the prosecution's handling of the grand jury?  Wherein the prosecution acted much more like a defense attorney for the accused (with harsh questioning of witness accounts and attempts to discredit prosecution witnesses) rather than following the standard practice of a prosecutor putting on the best evidence to support indictment?

Doesn't that sound an awful lot like bending procedure to help out a police officer accused of killing someone?  But...  Why would the prosecutor bend over backwards to help ensure the officer wasn't indicted if everything was as clean and tidy as you seem to believe?

That last bit isn't just me (I am a lawyer, but I don't work in a grand jury state).  To wit:

[""The officer’s testimony, delivered without the cross-examination of a trial in the earliest phase of the three-month inquiry, was the only direct account of the fatal encounter.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/ferguson-grand-jury-weighed-mass-of-evidence-much-of-it-conflicting.html?smid=pl-share)

Why didn't the prosecutor cross-examine the person accused of the crime?

(same source) ""the sharp challenges prosecutors made to witnesses whose accounts seemed to contradict his narrative""

Why did they cross-examine other witnesses?  Are police officers just more reliable?

""the prosecutors did not press Officer Wilson and other law enforcement officials about some contradictions in their testimony.""

That seem legit to you?

[Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor, believes the state wanted to avoid presenting a clear-cut case that would have led to an indictment. ""Prosecutors generally present very streamlined cases to the grand jury,"" she says. ""**As a prosecutor you should not present witnesses in front of the grand jury that you wouldn't present at trial**.""](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/14/justice/ferguson-witnesses-credibility/)

I'd imagine she'd include ""or refuse to cross-examine witnesses you would cross-examine at trial.""

If you really think the facts are so clearly on the officer's side (and I assume are aware of all of these criticisms of the lack of any real pushback against his account), why do you think the prosecutor went so far out of his way to make sure the result went this way?"	14.0	0.0	554	False	False

As for your middle bit, yes, he did strike an officer and attempt to gain control of his weapon. That right there, full stop, should say something. If anyone, of any race, manhandles, strikes, and attempts to take the weapon from a police officer, they should be *very* thankful if they survive the encounter... but they shouldn't expect to. On the long list of things you *shouldn't* do if you're not trying to get killed by a cop, assaulting them and trying to disarm them are probably things 1 and 2. 

There really isn't much conflicting evidence on which way Brown was facing or moving when he was shot. He did attempt to flee, yes, and Wilson pursued him, which only makes sense. Brown (who had just demonstrated ample ability to violently manhandle Wilson and a desire to take Wilson's gun) then charged Wilson. There were no entry wounds on Brown's back. [""Brown’s blood in the roadway demonstrates that Brown came forward at least 21.6 feet from the time he turned around toward Wilson.""](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf).

Not at all. Most of the ""facts"" I presented (and I'm realizing now I probably should have gone with a more wordy but more accurate ""what we can best tell happened based on the evidence"" or something like that) are contradicted by someone at some point or another. Eyewitness testimony isn't exactly bulletproof. Witness 105, for instance, corroborated Wilson and forensics, but also said Wilson was driving a car, not a SUV, which he was in fact driving. So yes, of course some witnesses deviate from the statements of other witnesses, Wilson's account, forensic evidence, or the autopsy report (and even hard facts, like car vs SUV). 

But in general I'm leaning not just on Wilson's account but the compilation of other forms of evidence, most of which *do* seem to corroborate his account. 

&gt;If it's the latter, I'd really encourage you to at least consider the possibility that a police officer under investigation by both his own department and the FBI might have an incentive to ""remember"" circumstances justifying the shooting.

Well of course. Maybe he was really just some racist Neo-Nazi scumbag who only joined the force to unjustifiably kill back people, and lied his ass off at every turn. But that doesn't seem to be the case. 

&gt;From where do you find this uncontested ""fact""?

The DOJ report would be one. And again, not ""uncontested."" But if you have, say, 10 witnesses, Wilson's account, forensic evidence, autopsy evidence, and DOJ findings that all pretty much agree on what happened and on the other side you have 2 witnesses who hate the cops and keep offering wildly different accounts of how Wilson is a cold-blooded murderer, I'm going to tend to agree with the former group. 

&gt;And how do you explain the officer's conduct in washing his hands (you know, like how you would get rid of evidence) and bagging his own gun into evidence (you know, like no other suspect gets to do because they might tamper with it)?

I can't. I'm not Wilson. I don't know. IIRC he said it was because he was quite shaken up after the incident and wasn't thinking clearly. And I don't exactly find that too hard to believe. We all have our fields of expertise: you're a lawyer, I was a first responder for many years. Trauma and shock can really fuck with your head. Even hardened, well trained veterans make mistakes when shit hits the fan, and Wilson was a 28 year old kid and, AFAIK, this was the first time he ever killed anybody. Again, unless we're asserting he's a racist piece of shit who revels in killing black people, the dude was probably operating in an adrenaline-educed haze for several hours after the event, and probably fucked up over it for months or years. Maybe he washed his hands as part of some malicious coverup for a race-based murder. Maybe he was in a heavy state of shock, saw his hands, and thought ""oh, blood, I should wash that off."" I don't know. But what's that saying about not attributing to malice what can be blamed on incompetence? That concept has to apply even more when the person is in shock. 

As for the rest of your comment, I'm a bit out of my league as to why it's significant. Obviously as a lawyer you're probably seeing some glaring issues with this stuff that I'm not.

That cuts both ways.

You can’t say “we know from the evidence” when the evidence is witness testimony, and then claim that witness testimony is unreliable. The primary source of the officer’s version is what he said (and was never properly questioned about), which is also witness testimony.

&gt;the compilation of other forms of evidence, most of which do seem to corroborate his account.

*Many* of which corroborate *parts* of his account.

To wit: the witness who said that he *did* see the victim moving slowly towards the shooter, but with his hands held at chest-height and away from his body in what the witness described as communicating “see, you got me, I’m hurt”.

It corroborates some of Wilson’s account, but contradicts big parts of it.

&gt;Well of course. Maybe he was really just some racist Neo-Nazi scumbag who only joined the force to unjustifiably kill back people, and lied his ass off at every turn. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

It’s odd that you felt the need to jump from “his story might not be accurate and he has an incentive to have a story that justifies his actions” straight to “well it doesn’t seem like his entire career was a sham, so...”

If I can speculate just a bit, it seems like you’re uncomfortable directly addressing the possibility that the shooter (while not a snidely whiplash kind of villain) didn’t have a good reason for the shooting, and altered events to be able to keep his job, livelihood, and reputation. 

Instead your response here amounts to “oh, sure, it could be something completely ridiculous, but it doesn’t seem like this ridiculous scenario I made up, so that’s it.”

&gt;But if you have, say, 10 witnesses, Wilson's account, forensic evidence, autopsy evidence, and DOJ findings that all pretty much agree on what happened and on the other side you have 2 witnesses who hate the cops and keep offering wildly different accounts of how Wilson is a cold-blooded murderer, I'm going to tend to agree with the former group.

And if that was how the evidence stacked up, you’d be justified.

But the DOJ didn’t find that the shooting was justified or that Wilson was telling the truth, only that it would be difficult to prove in court.

“Difficult to prove him guilty” and “actually didn’t do it” aren’t the same thing. And that’s even as someone who worked as a public defender for a spell.

More than two witnesses (including a number who were credible) corroborated the account that the victim had been shot while surrendering and/or while posing no immediate threat to the shooter. And of those witnesses who unambiguously supported the shooter, some indicated that they felt pressured to support him due to to his position as a police officer.

I don’t know from where you read that the DOJ investigation cleared Wilson. It didn’t.

&gt;I can't. I'm not Wilson. I don't know. IIRC he said it was because he was quite shaken up after the incident and wasn't thinking clearly

So he might have tampered with evidence, but only accidentally?

I don’t mean to be glib, but I can only hope that if I shoot someone my “shaken up” reaction is to destroy evidence and circumvent chain of custody in such a way as makes it more difficult to find evidence about the shooting. That’s just damned good luck.

&gt;Maybe he washed his hands as part of some malicious coverup for a race-based murder. Maybe he was in a heavy state of shock, saw his hands, and thought ""oh, blood, I should wash that off."" I don't know. But what's that saying about not attributing to malice what can be blamed on incompetence? 

You keep going back to “either it was a race-based murder or it’s fine”. Why would the only way for the cop’s actions to be suspect be if he began with the intent to shoot a black suspect? As opposed to that implicit biases influenced his decisionmaking subconsciously, and then the system which is skewed heavily towards police officers protected him?

&gt;Could you do an ELI5 summary on the latter bits? And I hope you don't begrudge a layperson from holding an opinion about this stuff.

I can give it a go. And, no, I wouldn’t begrudge laypeople from having an opinion. Though I would caution a bit more restraint in how strident a lay opinion should be.

So, let’s talk grand juries!

Typicallt, a prosecutor in front of a grand jury presents their best possible case for indictment. There’s no right for the accused to give testimony, no right for the accused to have witnesses who support their defense, and no right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.

So, in essence, the case presented to the grand jury is in almost every case: what if you took every prosecution witness at face value, heard do no other testimony, and saw only the evidence that supports the prosecution’s case?

One of the huge complaints about the grand jury system is that a thing meant to protect against unjust prosecution ends up being a rubber stamp for indictment.

Which makes it downright *odd* that in this case the prosecutor presented not only a whole lot of evidence against indictment, but impeached (it’s a term of art, basically “questioned the reliability of”) his own witnesses. 

In particular, he both allowed the accused (who has no right, remember, to give evidence at *all*) to give his side of the story, he didn’t question the accused at all. Which is weird, since that would imply to the jury that there’s nothing to question in the shooter’s own statement.

And, perhaps worse, he allowed the accused’s unquestioned account of the events to be the first thing the jury hears. This gets more into trial practice theory, but there’s a lot of research into concepts around how juries interpret facts. Once you give them a narrative, they will typically treat that as the frame through which they view all of the evidence. It’s very difficult to actually move a jury away from a settled script.

So if the first thing they hear is the version of events from the accused, and no part of it is questioned..."	9.0	0.0	1046	False	True	2.0

They are roughly as smart as a toddlers when it comes to problem solving, they are not emotionally toddlers.

&gt;To add onto the previous point, they can live eighty to ninety effing years! Cats and dogs can live around twenty years, and that's a reasonable time commitment, but for a pet with the kind of lifespan that a parrot has, even if they have the very best outcome and have an owner who makes a lifelong commitment to them, there's still a good chance that they'll be uprooted from their home at the very end of their life.

Isn't that a good thing? No one like sing their pet die. I don't think anyone with a dog has ever said ""I'm so happy he is going to die soon, if my dog lived longer it would be so annoying"".

They seem to be messier and more expensive to take care of than dogs and cats, and after all that work, you can't cuddle them like dogs and cats.

Its not that much work, you don't have to take them on walks. Also plenty of them do cuddle, but it varies bird to bird, like cats. 

&gt;They're loud and neurotic. If you don't devote a huge amount of attention to them, they screech all the time and pluck all their feathers out. I've heard a cockatoo screech, and I think I'd go insane if I had to listen to that sound in my house constantly.

Well most dog and cat owners don't get one in their lifetime and call it done. It's arguably beneficial that they live so long as you can train them longer and build a better connection. If people don't want the parrot after a while there are human and inhumane ways to get rid of them.

Sure, but this is known by responsible parrot owners before purchase yet they still find them to be worth the effort. You can absolutely be affectionate with a parrot.

Properly trained birds don't screech outside of set times during the day, but yes they are very loud animals.

&gt;It's neat that they can talk, and maybe for people who are not me, the novelty of them talking wouldn't wear off after ten minutes.

A lot of parrot owners have a love for birds that you and I probably don't have or understand. But that doesn't mean they can't be good pets to people who have a passion for them.

I think that the idea of “born this way” is in essence the idea of “I didn’t actively choose who I am attracted to.” What you are saying is basically the same thing: that you are the product of things you don’t really have control over. I think you’re getting hung up on the semantics of “born this way” when what folks are generally communicating is “I’m not actively choosing to feel this way.”

Pretty hard to pinpoint the degree to which genetic predisposition vs external influence has on sexuality, and people aren’t really choosing either factor...thus the simplification of “born this way.”"	27.0	0.0	116	False	False

While I agree that high heels are a sexist expectation in some parts of society (e.g. certain jobs), you don't generally hear about families where the husband won't let the wife leave the house without wearing high heels.

Some examples of forced niqab use:

* [Her husband is forcing her to wear niqaab and she wants advice](https://islamqa.info/en/20910)
* ['Hell' for wife forced to wear a niqab by husband](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/341449/Hell-for-wife-forced-to-wear-a-niqab-by-husband) 
* [My New Husband is Forcing Me To Wear Niqab. Must I?](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https%3A//aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/husband-forcing-niqab/)

In Saudi Arabia, women have even been called on to wear a [niqab that only reveals one eye](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7651231.stm). "	13.0	0.0	141	False	True	0.0

It covers up the most expressive part of her body – her face – and hinders her ability to show emotion. A huge amount of communication is done through nonverbal cues, but a woman wearing a niqab isn't able to convey these cues and therefore her ability to participate in public life is limited. Imagine listening to a presentation at a meeting at work - who do you think would be the more compelling speaker, someone whose face and hands are free to be expressive and interesting, or someone who is muffled by a sheet and a veil and whose face you can't see? Almost certainly the former, which gives a tremendous advantage to men in a society where women are expected to wear the niqab. 

Additionally, the niqab forces anonymity on a woman. It steals a woman's individuality, dehumanizes her, and turns her into a faceless figure. When you look at her, you don't see a person - you see a dark ghost with eyes peeking through a slit. This stands in contrast to men, who just look like human beings. All women wearing a niqab look more or less the same, with the result that they can easily all be treated the same and lumped into one single faceless and insignificant category by men. 

A niqab is also a constant reminder that, in the view of the oppressive societies that expect them to be worn, women and men must be kept fundamentally apart. The niqab is a barrier between the woman who wears it and the outside world. Men, however, don't need such a barrier because they FORM the outside world. The outside world is a place for men, and women who enter it must hide themselves to avoid disrupting or tempting the men to whom it belongs. I would argue that nearly all women who choose to wear the niqab are doing so because they've absorbed this oppressive ideology, so the fact that they technically choose to wear it doesn't mean it's not oppressive. (Others wear it because they're in a place where they will face harrassment, shaming, and physical danger if they don't.)

Heels, on the other hand, don't hinder a woman's ability to interact in public, either socially or professionally. They don't separate her from the outside world and they don't set her apart as some ""other"" who must be kept hidden. Like neckties for men, heels for women are a gender-specific part of professional or formal clothing. (And [heels have historically been worn by men](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21151350); they weren't invented to damage women's backs.) 

You mention throughout this thread that you worked at a place where women were required to wear heels. That's sexist, because as you point out that forces a health risk on women. But it's nowhere near as fundamentally oppressive as the niqab, because the heels aren't designed to limit how effectively a woman can participate in a public/professional sphere, or to force her into faceless anonymity. A woman in heels is able to take part in a board meeting just as easily as if she weren't wearing heels (and heels actually sometimes lend an air of power or professionalism). But a woman in a niqab isn't able to show visible reactions or facial expressions, and is wearing clothing that makes her seem less significant and less present than men whose faces are bare; and the niqab also serves as a constant reminder to everyone in the room that she's a woman and that women are in a fundamentally different social class and category from men.

The physical damage from heels occurs over the long term and isn't visible to or desired by employers who require heels (many probably aren't even aware that this damage occurs, or don't think their employees walk enough to develop this damage). Like I said earlier, that's absolutely sexist and I would either sue my employer or quit in protest if they started requiring heels. But heels at work don't prevent a woman from participating equally in society, nor do they dehumanize her and turn her into a faceless figure, so they're not ""oppressive"" in the same way as a niqab."	1.0	0.0	714	False	True	0.0

The President briefly talked about punishing women for abortion &amp; when everyone rightly freaked out, he recanted. But I think his remarks showed his inner thought process. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html). 

In addition, Republican representatives have often called for the punishment of women, in addition to their doctors, for abortion. 

An ID rep. called for their execution, but then similarly walked it back. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/3/bob-nonini-idaho-gop-candidate-suggests-punishment/)

Another ID rep. tried to introduce legislation that would charge women for 1st degree murder just last year [&lt;Source&gt;](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx).

A number of OH representatives have introduced a bill that, while currently under revision, would currently criminally punish women &amp; doctors with the same crime [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-HB-565).

I would posit that the politicians who say that they would not punish a women for an abortion, but only punish their doctor, are playing a politically expedient game. It is the reason they ""accidentally"" tell the truth &amp; then have to walk it back. The party's actions as a whole in other avenues of this question seem to show that they would change their hand if the political wind blew differently, or if they had more power. 

Indeed, since Planned Parenthood v. Casey sets the state's right to ban abortion at ""viability of the fetus,"" and due to advancements in medical science, viability is therefore a moving target that is always waxing backward (from 24 weeks at the start of the millennia to around 20 weeks now). Because of this women are being prosecuted as we speak [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indiana-has-now-charged-two-asian-american-women-feticide-n332761) &amp; that is likely to continue &amp; increase. 

Furthermore, pro-life individuals often frame the argument as one of a binary choice between if a fetus is a ""human life"" or not (ignoring the spectrum of viability in Planned Parenthood v. Casey). This is almost always to focus the argument in such a way to quantify ""abortion as murder."" The logical conclusion to that construction of thought is that murderers should be punished. This is a shocking, but logically consistent framework for those self-identifying as ""pro-life"" &amp; is likely the reason why their representatives do what they do &amp; will likely punish women &amp; feel justified in doing so. 

Finally, before 1973 laws banning abortion almost always had provisions for the punishment of the women for their abortions. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#History). Women were not ""protected"" by anti-abortion laws, they were pursued by the state for violating these laws. If the supreme court were to invalidate their own previous abortion rulings, chiefly Roe v. Wade &amp; Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the status quo ante would prevail &amp; abortion would be illegal, in admittedly various forms, in 38 of 50 states immediately [&lt;Source&gt;](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx).

I could actually go on, but to say that those who self-identify as pro-life don't want to punish women is to admit that you simply don't fully understand the history of the topic in which you speak. "	3.0	0.0	485	False	True	1.0

Individual channels would need to charge quite a bit, maybe $3-5 each (ESPN charges $6 now).  You'd end up paying for the core channels you watch, then you'd have a tough decision on some (e.g. for me it'd be AMC, I find a movie on that I want to watch maybe every two weeks, and I keep meaning to watch Better Call Saul... is that worth $4/month?).   Each channel would want to maximize its revenue, so it's going to price right around your willingness to pay.  Right now you're subsidizing someone watching HGTV, but they're subsidizing you watching comedy central. 

Inevitably, you'd stop getting channels you barely watch, but maybe you would occasionally.   You wouldn't discover new shows or channels.  A bunch of niche networks that don't cater to wealthy folks would die off.

I’ve got a history of explaining things poorly so I’ll use an example: A bad guy who went to jail for 2 years goes to a gun shop and tries to get a gun. They do a background check and find out that he is not legally allowed to be sold a gun. He leaves and goes to an unlicensed seller. The seller gives him the gun, and the man walks off with a new gun. He is later found by the police to be in possession of said gun, and the police track it back to the unlicensed seller. He is arrested for selling a gun to someone who went to jail for a year or more. This is why it isn’t illegal for unlicensed dealers to not do background checks, but it is in their best interest to do so because they will be punished if they sell to someone who would fail a background check.	6.0	0.0	189	False	False

A good album cover ought to tantalize a listener and make them listen to the record. It can convey the tone and content of the album ""loudly"" with blunt and bold symbolism, or it can be mysterious and subtly hint at the content with a minimalist design.

&gt; Additionally, it should be aesthetically appealing to some degree. This is important if you own a physical copy of the album, whether it be vinyl or cd, as it encourages you to preserve the quality of the casing. Additionally, it can be appreciated as you would appreciate any other piece of art. It also makes the band look more serious and professional about their work.

Aesthetics and a listener's interpretation is highly subjective though. For instance, if I see an album cover with the artists face with no makeup, from an artist who generally doesn't do that, then that suggests to me that I'm looking at a more introspective album. The type of makeup may modify this.

&gt; In my opinion, the portrait album covers I provided as examples have none of these qualities. First of all, they don't necessarily stick out. If it wasn't for Collins's and Swift's fame, these records could easily be passed over in a record store. They don't have any unique or noteworthy qualities to them- they're quite vanilla and inoffensive. It's just someone's face without any particular unique makeup or costume.

If an album tells a story or has a deeper meaning, than I agree with you. But if an album is simply a person's outlet or their own personal expression, then I see nothing wrong with using their image on the cover.

We'll use the Phil Collins album *Face Value* as an example. The album is simply about his personal life and his own thoughts and feelings. He's presenting his feelings at ""face value"". I believe the cover fits that. It's his face, because *his* expression of *his* emotions in musical form. The cover being in black and white represents that his ideas are presented in black and white. He's not trying to color anything up, or try and dress up his ideas to make it more presentable. He wants to express himself as straightforward as he can.

Another example is Selena Gomez's album *Revival*. The cover is simply her, naked, in black and white. The album is meant to be a ""naked"" or ""stripped down"" version of her feelings. I'll admit while it's not overly creative and the idea for the cover can be considered overused, it still fits the entire point of the album, and fits it well. The same can be said for the Phil Collins album. 

I think an album cover is less about being creative and more about being representative of an album. Doing both of course speaks volumes about the artist(s), but if an album is a simplistic expression of the artist, then why can't the cover reflect that? "	3.0	0.0	279	False	True	2.0

We can't take that to be true, however, as it is entirely possible that that system definition was part of the ruse he was selling the humans.  We have only met one truly neutral party (the Judge) thus far (I'm not counting the Doorman) and she didn't give us specifics about how people are evaluated in any real detail.  Everything we know from Michael is suspect.

Your CMV is based on the idea that the universe is a purely utilitarian model, where it is only the outcomes of choices that matter.  However, as many moral philosophers have pointed out, utilitarianism has pretty glaring flaws that make it a poor moral system in a vacuum:

- If we discount the intentions of actions, it is possible that someone who is trying to do good may end up doing bad by no fault of their own.  If you give someone a peanut butter cookie to make them happy, and they end up dying of severe anaphylaxis (despite the fact that neither of you knew of their allergy) you have done a net ""bad"" and would be morally deserving of punishment for that net bad action.  That hardly seems fair, though, as that net bad was not your _intention_ to do bad.  No one would really blame you for what happened, despite the fact that it still happened.

- It allows for weird edge cases.  One of the critiques of utilitarianism is that it allows for the creation of ""utility monsters"" - beings that derive so much pleasure or benefit from a specific action that it would justify causing suffering to every other being on the planet.  When one only concerns oneself with ""net good"" then you can justify any number of horrible things based on how you define ""net good"".  

It seems that the universe is far more Kantian in practice.  Kant's morality puts all of the focus on the intention of the action and disregards the actual effects.  So long as you intended to do good, then you get the moral points for your intention even if the action results in bad outcomes.  In my cookie example, you would get none of the blame for the person's death, because you did not intend to cause it.

Now, Kantian philosophy has issues as well, which is why universe seems to be a balance between the two - you must intend to do good, and actually do good, for it to count.

In that system, it is clear why both Chidi and Tahani are in the Bad Place.  Tahani is obvious - she did good for purely selfish reasons so, per Kant, she gets no points.  She broke one of the Moral Imperatives - she used people only as a means to her own ends (impressing her parents, showing up her sister) which means that her actions were not moral.  Perhaps they were still ""good"" but ""good"" and ""moral"" are not always the same thing.

Chidi is a bit more difficult to explain, but his motivations were also corrupt.  While he was striving to do the most net good, he disregarded the impact on the people close to him in the process.  His quest to do go resulted in suffering to those who interacted with him and we never see Chidi really caring about that.  He knowingly causes suffering to others and - here is the real kicker - never actually ends up doing any real good at all due to his indecisiveness.  He was the closest to being moral (Michael says as much) but he still doesn't meet our standards in a blended moral system.

Of course, the point of the show seems to be that even this blended system has flaws, so it seems to be pushing the narrative that most people _don't_ deserve to be in the bad place at all.

&gt;I am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of ""we must respect all cultures"". 

This actually reflects a popular misunderstanding of the concept of cultural relativism as it was devised.

Cultural relativism was a philosophy developed by the anthropologist Franz Boas in the early 20th century to guide cultural anthropologists in studying, describing, and analyzing other cultures. It actually has nothing to say about ""respecting all cultures.""

It was pushback to earlier anthropologists' approaches, in which non-Western cultures-- and cultural practices / beliefs / norms / values-- were typically described in direct contrast to Western cultural norms and ideas. And usually they were depicted as somehow lacking.

Boas proposed a cultural relativistic view. Not that other cultures' practices ""should be respected,"" but that in describing and writing about a culture, those practices should be viewed from *within* the cultural and historical context in which they developed and exist, rather than holding them to the moral / ethical standards of another culture.

That's all.

In fact, most cultural anthropologists today readily acknowledge that there are practices in *every* culture that are maladaptive, dysfunctional, and harmful. One of the things anthropologists do is work to understand the social processes and history of those practices, because if you don't know how and why a ""bad"" practice develops (the context-- the part that cultural relativism is really useful for), it's very difficult to actually develop a solution. Today, many anthropologists are actively engaged in working with community members to develop effective and constructive solutions that can be implemented within communities to address those practices (e.g, FGM). These solutions include (among other things) social engagement and education.

**tl;dr:** The people who actually adhere to ""cultural relativism"" don't hold the view that you're attributing to them. I don't know whether this changes your mind or not, but hopefully maybe it better explains what the term actually means. (**source: I am a professional anthropologist**)"	68.0	0.0	342	False	True	0.0

Even if people don't spend a lot of time explicitly writing down algebraic equations, ""solving for x"" is a regular occurrence in my life and the life of most (all?) functioning adults. You realize scaling a recipe is algebra. And so is figuring out the per-unit price of something (e.g. to figure out if it's better to buy the 3, 6, 9, or 12 pack of toilet paper). Calculating (or understanding) interest and rates. Currency conversion. Metric conversion. Figuring out a discount. Figuring if there's enough gas in your car. Buying the correct amount of paint for the walls (and that requires geometry, too!) or of materials for any project. Figuring out how drunk you are as a function of liquor and time. Figuring out when you and a friend need to leave to meet for dinner. Working through how much withholding you should ask for on a W2. Anything involving proportions and ratios. Any calculation remotely touching on affordability. Of the things you listed as ""more important,"" managing finances, actually calculating anything about your nutrition, cooking anything other than exactly what the recipe specifies, and even family planning all absolutely require algebra, even if you don't think of it that way. Understanding the value of an unknown variable is a extremely prevalent and if you wanted to pick a ""useless"" subject, you failed rather spectacularly. People that I encounter needed to spend more time getting a *better* grasp of algebra, statistics, numerical literacy in general, not less time getting worse. 

The basic tools schools are meant to teach *are valuable life skills.* Literacy (and higher level reading comprehension) are valuable life skills. Algebra and numeracy are valuable life skills. Research and writing are valuable life skills. Speaking new languages and understanding people and their current and historical circumstances are valuable life skills. Scientific reasoning is a valuable life skill. Hell even memorizing a pile of information is a valuable life skill! People who denigrate things like algebra are people who utterly failed to grasp what algebra is and who shouldn't be allowed to talk shit about it. 

And this doesn't even touch on the logistical and ethical problems of actually finding and staffing this many therapists and expecting parents to consent to a stranger they didn't choose advising their child (who is likely perfectly mentally healthy--and you do know therapists don't teach ""Things like managing finances, nutrition, cooking, and sex ed. ... financial stability, fitness, and family planning play a huge role in your quality of life as an adult,"" right?) about their feelings without their input and consent. We need the hours we spend in school to teach kids the skills to actually figure these things out for themselves. Including algebra.

Unless you use something in your career or trade, you won't retain it and it won't benefit you in any material way.

As far as parents go, they don't really get to consent to the teachers who educate their kids so I don't know why therapists should be much different.  There is inevitably going to be conflict here but that doesn't make it a bad idea.

And yes, I am aware that therapists don't teach those topics, but the mental health ramifications shouldn't be ignored.  Adults are not ""figuring these things out for themselves"" as evidenced by the prevalence of poor lifestyle choices in our country.

so I hardly think my defense of it is ""punching strawmen."" Your claim is blatantly false. People touch algebra on a weekly if not daily basis. If you weren't being willfully misleading, it's ignorant or indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of what algebra is. Any and all of which suggest we need to spend more time teaching algebra, not less so we can send our children to therapists who absolutely don't teach cooking, family planning, or financial planning anyway. The mental health ramifications of not being able to take care of yourself can't be staved off in advance, but children don't really suffer from not being able to cook and financially plan until they're responsible for it. So not in elementary school, but in college maybe? After college? The best thing we can do is when they're children is not give them some kind of advance therapy but actually teach them how to do those things, which 1) doesn't happen in therapy at all, and 2) has academic fundamentals underlying it which you think ""most people don't touch""

And I would treat my children's teacher and my children's therapists very differently. Someone responsible for teaching my kid algebra forms a very different relationship with them than someone resolving my child's mental illness, potentially diagnosing them, expecting them to be deeply emotionally vulnerable, etc. Find the most ardent supporter of widespread therapy and even they'll be adamant that the therapeutic relationship depends a lot on the personality/methods of the therapist in a way that teaching algebra does not.

Regarding Afganistan I assume you are talking about June 26, 2008. Iraq and Afganistan war funding, Unemployment Benefits, Extension and GI Bill?

If you read that bill. It is a standard timetable stuff regarding military in mainly Iraq, and partly in Afganistan. A ton of funds went to the funding of security, economical independece and security training in those countries.

By voting no. The GI bill (money to soldiers, veterans, and their families), and the Unembployment benefits would be killed. Well they wouldn't, this bill passed 92-6. All of nay's were republicans. I mean if you are angry they got the 3 bills together to get democrats on board with the other Bills, then I agree. Politics is sleazy.

If this is the worst thing you got on Bernie, then it's really, really cute.

There is, however, one component of the just war theory—the means of war—where international standards and measures do exist and a provisional assessment can be made. This suggests that the United States has missed several opportunities to establish a reassuring normative tone and presiding presence in this conflict. Instead of rooting its engagement in international humanitarian law it has emphasised the dastardly outlaw nature of its enemy to justify a need to keep its tactical options open. With the whole world watching, persistence in this mode may prove to be shortsighted.

I think, at the start of the war, it was framed as a just war, but it devolved into, I believe the technical term is ""a shitshow."" The example of the Soviet failure there could have been instructive. However, the pressure was high for the US government to do something in response to 9/11. I cannot defend the war in Afghanistan, really. I would be going against my own principles by doing so. That's one of the million reasons why I'm not a Senator. There's no credible way I can tell you Sanders has voted 100% correctly on all issues related to war. Anyone who says they can is not being honest. Being less war-like than Clinton is a low bar, though."	2.0	0.0	336	False	False

US used the AUMF bill to set up resources in Afganistan to communicate with Al-Qaeda, so they would give up bin Laden who was connected with 9.11. And to cease supprting terrorist's against US.

First of all, 'good review' != 'higher wages'. Giving a good review is absolutely easier than replacing an employee. It costs nothing, other than 10 minutes of the manager's time.

Even in the event that giving a good review necessarily leads to a raise, it's not like we're talking about doubling someone's salary. Say you have to give them a 10% raise.  I think you're underestimating how easy it is to hire decent people. Of course it will vary depending on the complexity of the job, but it seems very conservative to say that it would easily take a month or more to hire someone new *and* train them to the point that they were as productive as the previous (good) employee - particularly when you factor in the fact that some percentage of new employees will be terrible. Ok, so that's a month or more of lost productivity. That will cost the company at least the 10% pay raise that they didn't want to give, since 1 month is about 10% of a year and the value that the employee generates for the company is definitionally greater than their salary (otherwise the company wouldn't hire for the position)."	1.0	0.0	228	False	True	0.0

Part of it is that you're eating a distinct portion on a regular schedule, so your body becomes more accustomed to a standard amount of food. Cooking a meal from a recipe yields a precise amount of food, while snacking is perpetual until you choose to stop or until you run out, increasing the odds that you overeat.

&gt;frankfurthers, dry sausage, raw salted herring or make a hamburger

Herring aside, eating exclusively red meat for your protein is not good for your heart. [Burgers and hot dogs are some of the worst offenders.](https://www.webmd.com/g00/food-recipes/features/the-truth-about-red-meat?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&amp;i10c.dv=20) Herring is better, but eating it salted is just a direct injection of sodium. Fish and poultry can be prepared in low-sodium, high-protein ways. 

&gt;all peppers, tomatos, oranges, cucumbers, pineapples and grapes 

Bell peppers and cucumbers are good vegetables, but they're so high in water content that you've got to eat a lot for nutritional value. Oranges, pineapples, and grapes aren't unhealthy *per se*, but they're high in sugar, and if they're a large portion of your diet this can be a problem. You're missing leafy greens and root vegetables, where the healthy fiber and vitamins really lie. 

Ultimately, you're right that it all turns to shit when we eat it - but you'd stand to benefit by diversifying your food intake, and establishing some regularity. That regularity does not have to be 3 cooked meals a day, but it *does* have to (1) maintain food diversity (2) meet daily caloric and nutritional needs, and (3) maintain portion control. Snacking as you please, or ""grazing"" as I like to call it, is a poor method to meet these 3 goals.

Cheers mate. My question would be how old you are. Assuming you're a young man, your metabolism can handle much more right now than it will be able to as you age. These habits won't serve you well in the longer run, even if they don't seem to have an impact now.

I am thinking of a scenario more along these lines:

Suppose we have two drugs, A and B. A was initially researched in a public university and was eventually taken up by a pharma company, developed, and patented. B was purely conceived of, developed, and patented at a pharma company. My claim is not that the government has no right to regulate prices for either medicine- rather, I believe that the government has an equal right to regulate prices for *both* drugs. The government should have no special claim to regulating drug A because it utilized publicly-funded research to get started. 

The reason I think this distinction is important is because it informs how we make our public policy. If we think that we can modulate drug prices because of initial public investment then we will discourage the use of public research by private corporations because they will factor this final consideration in when they choose what drug candidates to go after.

If I bury a million dollars somewhere such that only I know where it is, it's pretty safely mine. On the IP side, if I am the only person that knows the recipe for Coke or KFC, then it's also mine. Aside from that, private property is based on what you can defend, or convince others to defend on your behalf.

We can layer in growing ideas of private ownership. We can say that people can own land. We can say people can own factories. We can say that people can own businesses. We can say that people can own arbitrary concepts of value like cash, bonds, derivatives, etc. We can say people can own patents. We can say people own entertainment content. But the further you get down this path, the weirder things get. 

For example, who owns [this embarrassing photo of Beyonce](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/2/5/14514466/beyonce-super-bowl-halftime-how-photos-lmao-never-forget) from the Super Bowl? Does Beyonce? Does the NFL? What about the photographer? How about the people who created memes online of it? What about the people that took those memes and put them on for-profit Instagram pages? Does it belong to the general public?

At a base level, the entire concept of ownership is meaningless. After humanity goes extinct, my property is no longer mine. In 100 years, my property is no longer mine. That means that property only exists temporarily. And the real basis for property is whether I have special access or am willing to use violence to enforce it. Then when we create a society/government, it's really just us coming to an agreement on how to maximize the benefit for all people.

Patents exist because we want to incentivize individuals to invent things. That improves society. But today, patents are used to find ways to block other companies from competing. It's more-cost effective to extend the patent on a drug than to invent a new one. Disney used a lot of characters (e.g., Aladin, Rapunzel) in the public domain without paying the estates of the people who created them (e.g., the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen.) Meanwhile, they fiercely guard their trademarks (e.g., Mickey Mouse) even though they are almost a century old.

Most people are willing to abide by laws that protect content creators, but they aren't willing to do so for people who aren't actively generating any new value. People were happy to praise billionaires when they were creating far more value than they took for society, but are unhappy when they feel that the wealthy are taking more than they are returning.

Jonas Salk took public money to invent the polio vaccine, and then made the patent available to the public. As such, Americans have been willing to fund research without getting a direct profit because they believe that the drugs alone are worth it. Now that the research has become much more valuable, but the public isn't getting the value they expect out of it, they want to see a greater return. Namely, they want a direct return on investment. A cure for a deadly disease is worth funding no strings attached. But if public funding is going to be used to fund profitable baldness treatments, the public wants some of that money back. 

Ultimately, even if you start with the premise that property rights are invaluable, we are layering in providing extra government funding to certain people, not just protecting existing rights. At that point, the public can structure that extra service however they want.

Ultimately, you have the right to do whatever you want. But if you want me to help you, you have to be willing to do it my way. And I'm going to find the balance that grows the overall pie the most while still giving me a large slice. "	0.0	0.0	637	False	True	0.0

The government has a specific incentive to foster inventions and new products that are successful in the economy.

How? Germany's blank check started the whole conflict and had wrecked half of northern France to the point scars can still be seen today. It makes sense they should pay for what they broke.

[Just look at this](https://brilliantmaps.com/zone-rouge/), there are places of France so badly damaged nobody is allowed to live there to this day, after over a century of attempted clean up.

&gt;The hyperinflation that followed as a result of this Treaty

The hyper inflation was caused by the great depression, almost a decade after the treaty came into effect.

&gt;caused the German economy to collapse.

[They still had one of the highest GDP/capitas or western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#Europe_1830%E2%80%931938_(Bairoch)).

&gt;The [Polish Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Corridor) was also a joke.

The Germans should have been glad the allies had been so kind after all the millions of deaths they caused. Instead of dividing up Germany into nice manageable puppets and getting rid of east Germany all together they made them a fee independent state, only took away a tiny sliver of land (that had been polish majority anyway) and asked them to pay for the land they wrecked.

In my opinion Versailles was far to lenient. A unified Germany was far to powerful, think of how many lives could have been saved if they where split up into four or five more manageable chunks.

&gt;and there was no other option than for Germany to start invading or suffer from severe consequences such as economic collapse, overpopulation, and continuing to be bullied by the Allies.

What? Germany wasn't over populated by any measure and their economy was the largest in mainland Europe when they started invading stuff.

And what do you mean bullied by the allies? Ask the Indians or any of the other colonies, they knew what being bullied was like. If Germany was being bullied by the allies they would never have gotten the chance to build an army. Saying Germany had any idea what being bullied was like is the peak of a first world problem.

&gt;The only way out of this situation was to create infrastructure geared towards war, which would enable a lot of jobs to be created and for Germany to annex areas such as the Sedetenland and Rhineland which were important strategic areas, as well as reuniting scattered Germans.

The fact that Germany had enough resources to fight world war two showed they did have options. The resources that went into making so much as a single panzer could have fed a family for more than a year. The metal in the Tirpitz alone could have built enough factories to employ hundreds of thousands of people."	45.0	0.0	448	False	True	0.0

""The strategy of world conquest of the Soviet Union springs from the premise that it is not yet strong enough to risk war with the United States but must build up its domestic war potential and bring new strategic areas, resources, and peoples under its control before attacking us. In preparation for attack on the United States, it is, therefore, consolidating its hold on the 130,000,000 Europeans it has dominated since 1939; striving to seize France and Italy by action of its fifth columns; pressing on Greece, Turkey, and Iran; and—using the Chinese Communists as its instruments-attempting by war to conquer China. Communist conquest of China would lead rapidly to Communist victory in Indochina, which is the extension of south China; and Communist control of Indochina would almost inevitably be followed by Communist subjugation of Thailand and the Malay Peninsula.""

So France and Germany had a history of trading harsh penalties for losing a war against the other.

And you know what?  The French dug in and paid their indemnity off in a couple of years, even though people worried it would cripple France for a generation.

So why did the Germany economy tank under Versailles?   Because the Germans horribly mismanaged their own economy.  They paid for the war entirely with debt, anticipating they would pay it off with the vast riches that would come with winning.  When that didn’t turn out so well, they started printing even more money to pay for reparations, rather than, you know, tapping into their relatively unscathed economic might.  When they eventually failed to make a payment, France responded by occupying the Ruhr.  The German government responded by calling a general strike and then print the even *more* cash to support the strikers.  So it was German choices about responding to the treaty rather than the treaty itself that was drove the hyperinflation of the ‘20s.

All of which was more or less under control by the end of the decade.  Then, *bang!*, Great Depression!   Which had some roots in the war but wasn’t caused by the treaty.   

Of course, Germany still had reparations due, and the western powers recognized paying them would be a problem.  So what did they do?  Suspended payments [in 1931](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Moratorium) and then cancelled them all together [in 1932.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_Conference_of_1932)

So by the time Hitler is rising to power in 1933, Germany isn’t paying anything.  In the end, they only paid 1/8 of what they owed under the treaty.   

The Germans weren’t bitter about Versailles because it was so harsh, they were bitter they lost the war.  The war was all in France, so the average German experienced no particular immediate consequence during it.  They had beaten the Russians and almost beaten the western powers during their last great offensive.  And then it all falls apart within months and the whole country collapses.  

So who is to blame for that?   Well, certainly not themselves, everything had been going great!    It must have been those [damn politicians and their devious Jewish masters,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) and those evil vindictive foreign powers and their unreasonable treaty."	16.0	0.0	407	False	True	0.0

The first world war started as a response to British empire spreading across the globe. After the WW1, nations fucked over Germany. Que WW2.

But what was before. Why were British so imperialistic. Well they were in brutal conflict over the church with Spain. (inquisitions), and was nearly destroyed, if not for the doctrine of strong navy. That naturally evolved into expansion and then trade.

Okay, so why did the Inquisitions happened. Why did the parts of Catholic church rebelled and split?

Because Catholic church was affraid of loosing power, in spite of the blossoming spanish trade (from which nobilities prospered). Most nobles, and powerful people just happened to be Jewish. Que the hunt for the wicked.

If someone says, ""All the jobs are going to illegals,"" you know they don't mean illegal dumpers or illegal sellers, they mean illegal immigrants. While from a technical standpoint all of those examples should be equivalent, when it comes to how we actually use the language, they're not used the same way. 'Illegal immigrant' is the one that's morphing in a way that makes us flag it and say hey, be careful with that. And the reason we need to be careful with it is that throughout history, the first step to genocide/oppression/ethnic cleansing has been to declare certain people's existence illegal. It's not a far jump from ""this person's existence here is illegal"" to ""it's okay to do horrible things to this person."" We need to recognize that all people, regardless of how they got here, have human rights, and labelling people illegal is often the first step to infringing upon those rights.

The term 'undocumented' points to the fact that immigrating illegally is a crime because of the system in place, not because it's inherently wrong. Some things are inherently wrong: theft, murder, assault, abuse, rape. Other things are wrong only because we've decided we want society to work a different way: jaywalking, speeding, tax evasion, forgery. These things are crimes, and may be immoral in certain situations (some of them even in all situations) but they're different from the previous category because they don't infringe directly on the rights of others, but rather go against systems we've created and agreed upon as a society. Tax evasion is wrong because it's unfair to benefit from everyone else's contributions without contributing yourself, but if we had a different way of funding the government then tax evasion wouldn't even be a thing that existed to be wrong.

Similarly, entering the country illegally isn't inherently wrong, it's just a violation of the system we've put in place. Calling someone 'undocumented' emphasizes the fact that what they did is come into the country without telling the government. That places the emphasis on the system and the avoidance of it, which thereby invites us to examine that system. Do we think it's a good system? Do we believe the person's actions were immoral given that the system exists? Is there some other action we believe they should've taken instead? Even if the answer to all those questions is yes, it's still worth asking them. It's worth recognizing that the crime of an undocumented immigrant is an avoidance of the system, not an assault on another person's rights."	3.0	0.0	441	False	True	0.0

If I illegally sell cigarettes in the park, I may very well be referred to as an illegal seller.

The fact is that these are not terms that people actually use with any real frequency to refer to people who commit these crimes. The only one that is used with any frequency is ""illegal dumper"" and even this appears in only 13,600 Google search results compared with over three million for ""illegal immigrant."" The terms ""illegal seller"" and ""illegal grower"" are even less common, and appear to refer almost exclusively to corporations (which can, in fact, be illegal), not natural persons (who can't).

&gt;This leads to whitewashed terms like ""undocumented immigrant"" which sounds like there was no illegal act performed. 

""Undocumented immigrant"" is a parallel term to things like ""unlicensed doctor"" (a term people actually use with millions of Google search results), ""unlicensed lawyer,"" ""unauthorized seller"" (which, from Google search results, is an order-of-magnitude more common than ""illegal seller""), ""unlicensed gun owner,"" etc. We don't call any of those people illegal, and it's completely consistent to follow the same convention by not calling undocumented immigrants illegal."	1.0	0.0	232	False	False

Those terms seem to pop up commonly enough compared to how much those groups are discussed online. If the EPA refers to people who dump toxic waste illegally as ""illegal dumpers"" and so on for the rest of the examples when they were just examples that I came up with off the top of my head, that is enough for me. 

Accordingly, the term ""unauthorized immigrant"" is an equivalent term to ""illegal immigrant"" in my book just as the term ""unauthorized dumper"" is equivalent to ""illegal dumper"". I don't think that one term popping up more frequently, even orders of magnitude more frequently implies any malice in the use of the term ""illegal immigrant"".

I would like to challenge this assertion. The term ""undocumented immigrant"" gives no indication of the nature of the immigration of that individual unlike the term ""unauthorized immigrant"". 

If you referred to unauthorized individuals as a group, you would only be referring to people who immigrated without authorization which is against the law (illegal). It is very clear what you are talking about. 

When you refer to undocumented immigrants as a group, you are referring to any immigrants who have not yet received or misplaced their documents as well as unauthorized immigrants who do not have documents by default.

One of the things that makes this sport unique is the use of advantage laws. This is to say that if a foul is carried out but the team who were fouled still have the ball, with the discretion of the referee the game can be continued- but called back for the original incident if no advantage is seen. If we were to stop the clock, it would make it very difficult to apply this rule. If the rule was removed in favour of clock stoppages it would encourage players to play for fouls if they had the ball and were in situations they couldn’t get out of, or would encourage defending teams to foul and stop play if they were not in prime defensive positions.

Another thing to be considered here is what actually counts as a stoppage. The game is not considered stopped at the moment the ball is dead, the ball going for a corner or goal kick is considered part of the game, only if the player takes what we deem as an unreasonable amount of time to get the ball back into play do we consider it a stoppage, otherwise it’s just part of the game. Remember, a game is 90 minutes, this is quite a long time and some of that time is because that is set aside for stoppages.

Are you seriously saying that soccer is less attractive than football because of stoppages? Think of a football game, consider the time on the clock and how long the game actually takes to play, there’s an amount of showmanship in stoppage there, whereas in soccer the game does accept a certain amount of gamesmanship- at the discretion of the referee. If a player is taking too long it is up to the referee whether or not to reprimand that player.

If there is an injury, it’s normally monitored either how long the physio is on the field or how long it takes the player to get off the field for treatment. Time keeping isn’t always the most accurate, but the game would be considerably slowed down if there were persistent clock stoppages- knowing that it allowed a break players would be encouraged to take more time than is necessary, whereas with the current rules they don’t have that freedom knowing that the referee can call them out for time wasting."	25.0	0.0	418	False	False

One of the flaws of football, in my view, is the constant stoppage and lack of actual action (though the action that exists is pretty exciting).

I am actually pretty happy to hear from a ref who deals with this at field level. The advantage argument is compelling, but hockey already deals with this using the delayed penalty, as I’m sure you know. Additionally, why is it bad to play for fouls? If you have an advantage, the onus is on the defense to make up for it legally, without committing a foul. 

I also ref in a sport (ultimate) where the clock doesn’t really stop (for other logistical reasons). Teams have a strict time limit to continue play during live stoppages (turnovers, etc), and we police dead-disc stoppages to minimize delay. In basketball, you have five seconds to inbound the ball (being guarded) or else you lose it. 

If you can expand on the advantage argument, or provide more situations where stopping the clock adds logistical problems, I might be open to changing a view here.  "	0.0	0.0	190	False	False

One of the most common fouls that you see at the levels I officiate is a foul to stop a break, this is to say the defending team are backtracking with a numerical disadvantage and rather than risk tackling and straight up losing the ball, they will play for a foul to stop play and allow players to get back into position. At the speed the game is generally played, players are generally keener to stop play than to allow play to continue, in these situations it is rare to play advantage. It’s not bad to play for fouls, however, I would argue that if there was a total clock stoppage it would encourage players to take more time to reset the game and if this happened it could encourage a team to make more fouls to slow down the pace of the game or change momentum- this could become an element of the way players play the game, but I don’t think it would improve the game, if anything it would be detrimental to the quality of the game and the viewers experience.

To be honest I can’t claim to be aware of all the ins and outs of your sport but from what you say it does seem similar, though the time limit is not applied in the same way. Basketball is an interesting example in terms of getting the ball back into play, the ball is often out of reach of the player, it could be in a stand and as we don’t tend to use a multi ball system at most levels it’s not always practical to impose a time limit. The system generally used is discretionary, that is, did the ball make it back onto the field of play within a timely manner, if it did then there is no time added on, if the ball remains in the stands or players are kicking it away then time will be added on. The ball going out of play is expected in the game, I suppose you could allow the clock to run arbitrarily for 10 seconds before stopping it.

Playing advantage is a key part of the game, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph and I think in a response to an earlier comment, timing of an advantage is discretionary. For the referee on the field, or a fourth official- when they are available, to time all stoppages is not necessarily that easy. From refereeing yourself you’ll know that your job as a referee is not just to watch where the play is happening at that point, to keep the pace of play up or to stop infractions on the field, there are so many different jobs involved. I wear a timer on my wrist in all games, it’s pretty simple and I take a look when I make a stoppage and I take a look when the play resumes, I make mental note of that time and generally an off field referee will also keep a note of stoppages, as I said, the period of time for a stoppage varies depending on the situation, so imposing time limits would be difficult. If the clock were to totally stop when the ball was declared dead by the referee and there was a way around stopping the clock in an advantage situation then I would recommend shortening each half.

Also, not all matches can be played with a huge number of officials, it’s the most widely played sport in the world and there isn’t always enough money in the game to have official time keepers at every game. There are also more grey areas in the sport than most others, introduction of VAR, which seems as though it will happen in at least the upper echelons of the game mean that play could be called back, this means that external timekeepers have to track the moment a foul was made, and this means that a device has to simply be created whereby the clock is stopped NOT by the moment a referee blows their whistle which communicates with the timer in the auditorium and the timer on the referees person. It’s not impossible, but logistically this isn’t easy to impose at all levels of the game in all countries."	2.0	0.0	742	False	True	2.0

For example, many remixes are done so as rap remixes or techno/ dance remixes. The intention isn’t for people to go “hey this one is way better than the original, I am going to listen to this version instead”, but the intention is for that good song and tune to be reconditioned for a different environment such as a night club, as a more appropriate basis for dance routines, or simply to attract people to the song who didn’t like the original style. I would even argue that by doing so it can really only ever be a good thing as the original still exists in its entirety, and is fully accessible to anyone who wants to only listen to the original. By the remix existing and appealing to a wider audience, it only ever broadens the appeal of the song and inherently makes it better in the process.

So, obviously, these remixes offer better sound quality since they are not limited by the old hardware of retro games, but I think there's more to it than that. Many of these remixes bring a new style to the song that people, like myself, may enjoy more (especially the Latin feel to Basilisk run). 

I would also like to bring up the musical concept of theme and variation. ""Remixing"" isn't really a new concept. Classical music would often introduce a melody and then play several variants of it throughout the piece. This is effectively a remix. Modern pieces tend to be much shorter than classical ones, but when somebody does a remix, haven't they really just executed a variation on a theme? "	4.0	0.0	176	False	True	0.0

No, but it will make *a single decision.* Right now, developers are forced to deal with every decision that every browser vendor makes.

When Firefox takes a long time to implement a new feature in Javascript, developers need to create workarounds.

From the web site developer's perspective, introducing a new ""reference implementation"" isn't particularly helpful.   You're still looking at the same ecosystem of web browsers (or maybe the same ecosystem plus one.)  I still occasionally look at stuff using lynx.  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29 )   Is this ""reference implementation"" supposed to convince me to stop doing that?   Alternatively, web developers who feel like they can dictate which browsers their clients use, are already doing that.   Tracking cross-compatability in some systematic fashion would be a mess.

For the web browser developer the situation is much the same.  The ecosystem of web site developers is just as if not more uncontrolled than the system of web browsers, and there are legacy websites with propriety and browser-specific implementations.  So you could build a ""reference implementation compatible"" browser, but that doesn't guarantee that it will work well with existing web sites.

In addition to the effects of simple entropy, the web is full of people trying to play the ""embrace, extend, and extinguish"" game.  As long as businesses have incentives to play that kind of game and there's no compelling reason for people to move away from legacy systems the ecosystem will continue to be fractured.   There are benefits to be had from a regulated web, but to make that happen you would need a whole lot more than a non-profit with a reference implementation.

From 1949 until 1987 there was something called the fairness doctrine that the FCC require for all public broadcasts. The reason it was done away with, ostensibly anyway since it is hard to say that the large media companies had nothing to do with it, was because by 1987 the public had a wide variety of sources for their new, which was not nearly as true in 49' when the law was created. 

But there was also a change in how journalists looked at things. The journalistic thing that was predicated on as much objectivity as possible embodied no notably by Walter Cronkite, the man on the street who doesn't even have an opinion, it is one way of approaching news and not a bad one, it did a lot of good. But it is not the sole way it has been looked at. Up until and through the 1930's a far more editorial and sensationalistic form of journalism was predominant, it was attacked with the word muckraking, and in its worst form is called yellow journalism. 

The reporters from the 70's, 80's and 90's do not want to return to yellow journalism at all. They are attempting to approach it in a far more responsible way. The issue with the man on the street, objective approach is that it is not really objective, and was not adopted by newspapers and reporters for objective reasons. It was adopted first by newspapers, then by television, because it worked best for their advertising model. This was really only adopted in the 40's by most successful publications, yellow journalism was the norm prior to that.

Big corporations and advertisers knew reporters had to do their job, so a ""I don't even have an opinion, these are the facts"" idea made the most sense for everyone. But at the end of the day there are choices being made here. Objectivity is simply impossible. Just the facts is fine, but what facts to show, to emphasize, to lead with, these are all choices. A man on the street approach is naturally conservative, generally accepting of the status quo and entrenched interests, naturally. Such an approach for reporters is always going to view new ideas or even mildly radical policies with suspicion, and often any large reforms or genuinely radical changes with derision. The theory today instead is transparency. 

There is no way the reporter, or his editor, or the publication as a whole does not have an opinion. Separating what is primarily editorial from what is primarily news is important, not doing so has been the most serious criticism of Fox News or any more overt left wing equivalents. But in the end the idea is to be open with core opinions, basic biases the reporters or publication is aware color their view at any time, and simply an acknowledgment of where they are coming at the reporting from is the idea. To be perfectly frank I preferred the objective seeming, man on the street approach. 

But there are real criticisms of it, it does favor the status quo by its nature, and the current model is a real attempt to do things responsibly, I feel it has merit as well. I would be more in favor of returning to the old system, see them as more equal as ideas, if it were possible. It is not though, not with current technology and social media and such, the old way is essentially impossible as a practical matter at this point. I just see the current model based on transparency as the best path forward considering everything, that it is valid, and that the old way was valid, but that as splintered and intense as the media climate is today going back is impossible."	1.0	0.0	653	False	False

If you're saying that learning about historical facts, which is mostly memorization, doesn't do much to advance a student's critical thinking then sure. But understanding one's historical context offers plenty of educational value. Understanding how things played out in the past teaches a lot about how and why things are the way they are in the present. You seem to only value critical thinking but was that ever the purpose of high school history classes? I don't think so. There isn't much critical thinking involved in learning basic facts like the alphabet, or grammar, or the multiplication table right? And that's fine. Likewise I think history - at least at the highschool level - can be seen similarly as a survey of the necessary base set of historical facts to learn that makes one culturally literate.

If you want to become a historian then yes there's lots of critical analysis of texts and arguments for what the actual historical facts are but people can devote their entire lives to analyzing a single event. To think there's enough time in high school to go through that exercise that while also building a baseline of knowledge of historical facts is unrealistic. I wouldn't be against adding a semester on ""how we decide on historical facts"" outlining the methods that academic historians use but I also understand that they have a very limited amount of time to cover a whole lot of ground.

Again, I'm not as well versed in literature but I imagine the situations are similar with lots of ground to cover and not very much time to cover the more advanced and more critical thinking heavy aspects of literature.

I think the solution that would address the core of the very warranted concerns that you raised is to add a mandatory philosophy class in high schools. Every student should at the very least learn formal logic and the classical arguments. I don't think the solution is to cast aspersions on history classes or literature classes because they don't meet an ideal that is supposed to be addressed by a philosophy class."	153.0	0.0	369	False	True	0.0

But, what I think is important about the way History tends to be taught currently is that it contextualizes a lot of things that people learn in later high school and college, and it sort of creates a shared framework for everyone to at least have a minimum level of understanding, if that makes sense. Like, providing a rough, chronological timeline with basically memorizing dates, and briefly talking about how the events relate to each other creates a sort of metaphorical framework on a metaphorical canvas, for people to fill in at their own pace l, whether it be through higher education, or independent research, social and cultural events, etc. That said, I do agree that it's not the best at teaching kids to critically think, but I'm not sure (not a teacher or admin) that that's the point?

As for literature, I think it's something similar. I think it's more about showing kids what well constructed syntax looks like in a fun way, as well as fostering creativity, and shaping peoples writing and reading skills. I dont think the opinion that they dont exactly foster critical thinking is wrong, tbh, but again, i don't necessarily think that's the point. Kindergarten through HS is designed to make successful people. It's designed to give people the tools they'll need to succeed in life. I'd argue that most math and science teaches critical thinking, as well as sports, and foreign languages, and even some history and English classes. I dont think critical thinking is the goal of any specific class unless its stated as such. I think that's what exercises are for. The classes themselves should be more focused on making sure that everyone at least has an option to access the tools for success. 

And seeing as how most developed countries have literacy rates of around at least 90%, and most people know about past major world events and probably also the ones that are significant to their own country, I'd say that the purpose is being served. Does that make sense? 

TL;DR- I agree with you, but I dont know if that's actually the point. I also dont know if it's not, but those are just my thoughts."	7.0	0.0	389	False	True	0.0

I will start by saying that there is a lot wrong with the educational system. I am finishing up my masters in social studies education (I’ll be mainly focusing on history in my argument since that is my background) and have some experience teaching both middle and high school history classes. I will be the first to agree with some of your points; history has a horrible reputation (deservedly so in some cases) for its focus on memorization and there a TON of terrible teachers that do not focus on critical thinking. However, your and my issue with education is solely with how it is being taught, not with what is being taught (i.e. pedagogy). I do want to say that my views of education might be considered “radical” from mainstream educators, however, I believe that mainstream education is not reaching many of our students, especially our students of color. For example, MN (the state I live and plan on teaching in) has the highest academic achievement gap between white students and students of color. While my views are probably not mainstream, there are many educators who will agree with me and the points I make. Anyway, back to your argument. 

Your argument is that because of the focus on memorization, history and literature offer little or educational benefit and little opportunity to develop critical thinking. The focus on memorization isn’t unique to history or literature; in math you need to memorize basic multiplication and equations, in science you need to memorize basic principals. However, history often gets assessed through multiple choice questions where you need to memorize facts, dates, events, and people. Pablo Freire describes this as the “banking” model of education where students are “containers” that educators “deposit” information into, only to have students regurgitate that information verbatim on tests. This is not a good pedagogy. It forces students to be passive in their learning and encourages memorization of facts instead of critical analysis. Unfortunately, high level history classes, especially AP Histories, favor this model because they are teaching for the test.

Freire offers another approach to teaching. He argues that a teacher should instead collectivize learning and structure the classroom as a learning community. In this scenario, the students are made the center of the classroom and are actively shaping and guiding their learning while the teacher de-centers themselves form the center of the classroom, serving more as a guide that provides structure and support for the class instead of being that “all knowing individual” that is there to dispense knowledge into students. In this classroom, students are active participants in creating knowledge and have a say in their own learning (I am summarizing the points of Freire’s book *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* so I somewhat simplifying his view). 

This model requires the use of inquiry to work; i.e. students are given a problem or issue and must use their skills to find answers and solutions. History is a great space to do inquiry based research and projects. A simple question like “Why was the the I-94 highway in Minneapolis built where it was?” or “Why is there a group called Black Lives Matter?” provide opportunity to learn about the past and make modern connections to the future. 

Furthermore, history need to focus on teaching skills, not content. I would argue that learning anything that can be googled is a waste of time in the classroom. History should focus on teaching reading, writing, and speaking skills. To start, since the academic gap between white students and students of color is with reading and writing and speaking, that should be a point of emphasis in class. Next, these skills are required to do well in a history class (reading primary sources, writing about those sources, talking about those sources), so students need these skills just to do well in the class. Lastly, these skills translate over to other subjects as every academic subject, most jobs and careers, and everyday life will require some reading, writing, and speaking.

Students should then be assessed on these skills over time. Their reading, writing, and speaking skills should be monitored over the year to see how they have improved and note areas of strength and areas that need growth. Multiple choice tests do not adequately assess these skills. Instead, assessments must be more open and accessible. Things like Socratic seminars can be used to assess speaking and Document based essays (students are given 5-10 primary sources and must create a short paper with a thesis based on the documents) for reading and writing, etc. Additionally, project based assessments allow for critical analysis to develop and be assessed as well.

The content we use to teach these skills is also equally important. It is hard to develop the skill critical analysis if the content you look at isn’t critical of history. Content cannot focus on the whitewashed and Eurocentric version of history that is often taught. We must bring in counter-narratives and opposing viewpoints to critically examine history. For example, what did African-American, Latinx, and Native American people think about the Declaration of Independence. How did the Great Depression impact already marginalized groups? We need to incorporate stories or resistance and triumph of people of color and those who have been historically disenfranchised into our content. The MN Social Studies State Standards are broad enough that incorporating these stories into the classroom is fairly easy.

To summarize; History (and all of social studies) has as much educational value as STEM subjects when taught using good pedagogy (I would argue memorization is not good pedagogy)."	4.0	0.0	951	False	True	0.0

* in math, you are learning to develop logical problem-solving by means of symbolic representation
* in the sciences, you learn how to get and understand data and how to interpret what lies behind what your senses are telling you
* in the humanities, you learn how communication and texts work, both written and oral.

Take your own post, for example. You have clearly set out a goal and identified a problem, defined some caveats and criteria. Your text is clear, well structured and intelligible. You write about an abstract topic with an appropriately abstract vocabulary. You also display some awareness about your own fallible judgment, otherwise you wouldn't post here in the first place - you are aware that there is a 'space of reasons', a broad spectrum of opinions, arguments and reasons in which you have situated yourself.

A ten year old kid could not have written a text like that. A person that never went to school would usually not be able to write a text like this. *Somewhere* down the road you have acquired the cognitive and intellectual skills required to make such an argument. I do not know anything about your upbringing, but usually people learn this in school. Usually not in the science classes, although they might figure in somewhere as well to a smaller degree. You learn to write such a complicated and abstract text in your literature and history classes. Even though you (and I) do not understand the details of the process at stake, going through all your humanity classes has *somehow* given you these cognitive abilities that ten-year old you did not yet have.

Do you *need* literature and history? Probably not; you could probably acquire the same skills through, say, politics, social studies, philosophy, learning latin, etc. Anywhere you comprehensively deal with texts and communication in a broader sense.

So there are further, additional benefits to be gained from each humanity. Let me briefly check the advantages of learning about literature. You can probably fill in the gaps for history by yourself.

By learning about literature you also learn something about the topics of literature. The big advantage of literature over the other arts is that it can deal with the inner perspective of someone, their experience, their thoughts and feelings, their values, etc., while other arts (movies, opera, paintings etc.) are more constraint to the outer perspective, which captures only actions and appearances. (The other arts sometimes mix in some techniques of literature to deal with this problem, but that is a different topic.)

By learning something about literature, you develop *a mental map of culture* that allows you to navigate through the nexus of human history, society, morality, and the problems of 'heart and soul', if you will call them that. Shakespeare and Joyce are great examples. No matter how boring that might have been to you, you still get an impression of *what it is like to be someone* *else* at another time. Their problems might not be your problems, but by understanding that difference you also learn something about yourself, since you are better able to situate yourself in a broader context. By learning about these selected texts, even if you do not enjoy reading them, you construct a mental map that still allows you to navigate our current culture better than someone who is not acquainted with it or who simply hasn't gone to school. There are many aspects to this, for example which discourses you (can) perceive or participate in, how much empathy you have for someone who is in different shoes, how you evaluate and organize your own value system.

Is this what I wrote above all just fancypants artsy-fartsy bullshit that has no measure, no application or method of being verifiable? Let me tell you this: When in the 1920s in Germany the Nazis came to power, it mostly wasn't the STEM-people who saw what was coming or who spoke out against the Nazis. It was rather the writers, the historians, the theologians, the journalists etc. who were able to read the signs of the time and who spoke out against Hitler. The engineers and the scientists, they went along with Hitler, to a much higher degree at least than the people with a background in the humanities."	12.0	0.0	740	False	True	0.0

Your premise is basically that bad curriculums are bad. Any quality teacher would agree that just rote memorization of facts and reading literature without real analysis doesn't teach much.

So what I'll say to try and change your view is that your view rather than taking on the classes should be taking on the education system as a whole. Our education system is largely still structured around farmers' kids learning during the off season to give them something to do. It's not individual and it's not really preparing people for anything. It's not the classes fault, it's the states that have testing on rote memorization rather than analysis or critical thinking.

A US History course can have plenty of important things to learn. Why did the country turn against alcohol enough to make an amendment to ban it then change their minds? In what ways did slavery get perpetuated even after it was ""outlawed."" What set of circumstances REALLY led to the US joining WWI and WWII beyond just single events. What did those single events spark?

A general literature course can teach you plenty too. You called out Shakespeare as not helpful to learn. But what is the implication of gender in Twelfth Night? Who is meant to be the antagonist in Merchant of Venice? What's the difference between the idealization of love and the reality of love in Romeo and Juliet?

You get my point. There's nothing wrong with these courses, but teachers have to make sure their students follow the curriculums as given. Take it up with the system not the teachers and their classes."	123.0	0.0	290	False	True	0.0

I work with and go to school with (returning college student) recent HS grads. There are two main reasons I think they should be reading probably 2x the amount of literature they currently read. The first is that reading is a skill you don't really perfect until your late teens and your vocabulary improves markedly into your 20s. The more reading you do the more you are exposed to unique words and the more efficient you become. The second is that it is really hard to teach reading comprehension if you are not pushing people to read things that are just that much further out of their comfort zone. You can almost always spot a well-read individual, they listen well, they write well, they can be more empathetic, they understand subtext and connotation well, they have broad cultural understanding, and they are good conversationalists. It isn't a magic formula, make people read X amount of books and they will be X percent sophisticated, but I know that it is wholly more than we are doing now.

I think it's just that, as you said, your career is in STEM so you didn't get the chance to see how further education builds on the high school classes.

What is the point of a high school chemistry class? To give everyone a base level understanding about how the stuff that makes up our world works, and lay the groundwork for those students who want to go on further. Is there ""value"" in all students learning how to work through stoichiometry problems? Probably not, as 99% of people will never use it again, but it's part of the base knowledge for people who WILL go on in the field. And, if nothing else, it adds some level of understanding about why chemistry is the way it is.

What's the point of a high school history class? Same deal, only more people will be directly affected by what they learn. Establish a baseline of knowledge, set up the building blocks for people who want to delve deeper, and give an understanding of why history is the way it is.

It's that last part that I want to focus on. Why is history the way it is? Well, because of the history that came before it. In your OP, you said 

&gt; I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understanding society, culture, and history that still affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s.

Name a piece of history covered in high school that hasn't seen its effects propagate to the modern day. I'll wait.

It's those details that make history understandable. Imagine trying to teach programming without bothering to teach about the difference between ints and doubles or how IF AND and OR work, instead just jumping directly into functions. Ignore the rest, that's just details, you can learn more about them in college if you want. It wouldn't work. And history is no different.

The Battle of Gettysburg was July 1-3 1863. Why then? How does it fit in to the larger narrative? It's no coincidence that the largest Confederate push northward happened the spring and summer after Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation (January 1 1863). Suddenly it was explicitly a nation opposed to slavery fighting rebels who approved of slavery - the Confederacy suddenly saw their support from England trickle and stop. They were running out of options, couldn't keep up with Union manufacturing, and needed to push hard to win. When it happened is an important part of the narrative.

The politics of the early 1800s aren't important today? Don't make me laugh. We're literally having the same arguments today that the Federalists and Anti-Federalists were having in the late 1790s to early 1800s. Should we have a big government or a small government? What is and isn't the government allowed to do and pay for - and even if they're allowed to, do we want them to? The exact issues were different, sure, but the argument over a national bank in the 1790s is fundamentally the same as our current argument over national healthcare. What were the arguments made back then? How valid were they? How valid are they today? 

We need to know where we came from. Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it, and all that jazz. And there's really no way to even start to look at how we got to where we are without some level of digging through the weeds and the details of history. Otherwise we end up in a world where fully half of Americans think the Civil War wasn't mainly about slavery.

It may be possible to go with a more generalized view of history in some areas, but there are a lot where the details are important for everyone to know. For example Reconstruction shouldn't be glossed over, as many of the policies set in place during that era led directly to Jim Crow laws and the current systemic racial inequalities we see today. Sure, we *could* just say ""And then we helped the South rebuild after the civil war, but it wasn't really equal for everyone""..... But does that really teach anything? In order for it to have value, the details are necessary."	2.0	0.0	751	False	True	0.0

Right now, streaming is operating under an oligopolistic competition. There are a few companies offering streaming services, all priced fairly similarly, and they compete through things such product differentiation - i.e. Netflix has these shows, Hulu has these different shows, and Prime Video has these other different shows. If a few streaming services dropped out, then there would be one or two services left, who would either find a common middle ground for pricing (likely well above what we pay for each service now), or engage in a price war until one closes down and the other can charge whatever it would like. Conversely, if you add more streaming services, production companies would see how beneficial it would be to not exclusively contract with one service, and begin offering their shows and movies to more services, thus solving the issue you have with streaming right now. 


This is a basic economic concept. Oligopolies work very well for things such as cell phones, and cars. Physical objects where there is tangible benefit from one over the other. They don't work as well for services such as cable, internet/cellular, and now streaming. These would all be much better as perfectly competitive markets, with relatively little product differentiation. The issue with how it applies to streaming is that streaming is resource heavy - you can't just open a streaming company on the dime. It takes a lot of server resources to do well. And that's the primary issue. There are very high barriers to entry for the streaming market. So while us as consumers would benefit a great deal from having 10 or 15 more reliable options, it doesn't seem plausible for the time being."	1.0	0.0	290	False	True	0.0

How would you prevent parents from expressing / discussing something that they believe deeply in with their children? Especially when they believe that their belief is a net positive in their lives, why would they want to exclude their children from that?

I don't disagree that religion can be problematic. I'm lifelong atheist myself, and my family never attended church or was otherwise religious. But that should be a personal choice for parents to make. Should parents also be banned from allowing their children to play video games, watch movies, or listen to certain kinds of music?

Should they be banned / prevented from discussing Cartesian philosophy with their children?

Religion, whether you agree with it or not, is part of many peoples' world views. You can't pick and choose which ideas parents are allowed to pass along to their kids. 

If you want to talk about banning harmful acts in the name of religion, fine. That's a different story.

But you can't prevent parents from talking to their children about, and even involving their children in, things that are not objectively harmful and potentially (at least in the parents' eyes) beneficial.

I think that it is a misinformed position. Generally when you break up companies, it is because they have acquired too much of their competition. That is not entirely the case with technology companies. Facebook, for example, isn't the most popular social media site because it has acquired all of its competition, but because it is simply the most popular. Same with Google. It hasn't acquired all the other search engines, it's just the most used and quite frankly, the best. How do you even break these companies up? And if you did, how would that affect the massive number of jobs these companies offer?

If it ends up being like Sanders plan, then it would get rid of private insurance and with it, millions of jobs. I think this is government overreach in the economy.

Splitting companies would create more jobs if anything because the companies still need to exist, but they have a smaller talent pool to pull from so they in theory need to hire more people to do the jobs that 1 person covered for 5 companies before. Like splitting up monopolies has happened a million times in the past and the world has not ended.

&gt;  
&gt;In what way?

Here was my response to another redditor who asked a similar question :  My issue with it is that it is not a tax on their salary but on their net worth, but most of billionaire's and ultra-millionaire's net worth is in investments. So let's take Jeff Bezos for an example. Let's say he is worth $100 billion. Now he is taxed 5% on 99 billion of that (which I believe is what the ultra-millionaire tax would do). That is close to $5 billion, but he might not even have that much money in cash. So then he has to go and sell a ton of his stock to get enough cash to pay that money. Now extend this to all billionaires and ultra-millionaires. If they are all having to sell lots of their stock in order to pay this tax, how does that affect the market? Additionally, what if someone's net worth remains constant? This is a tax on total wealth, not annual income, so if someone isn't increasing their wealth, they could have their wealth consistently reduced every year until they are below the threshold for the tax. 

&gt; How does worker ownership change anything? 

It would be harder for companies to be successful if they are forced to be owned by their workers. Workers might not make decisions that are in the best interest of the company, but in the best interest of themselves. I understand that workers need to have a say, and that's why I support unions, but I think giving them too much power would create problems just as giving corporations too much power would.

&gt; I understand that you see socialism as this boogeyman, but are you aware that socialism and capitalism can actually exist at the exact same time? One is an econ system and the other is a way of governing. 

In what way is public ownership of the means of production compatible with capitalism?

&gt; You are aware that Facebook does in fact own a massive share if the social media platforms right? They own Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to name a few. 

Yes, but Instagram and WhatsApp are distinctively different services that wouldn't have offered direct competition. And there are still plenty of other social media services out there that aren't owned by Facebook.

By having the prices of goods, and the survival of companies dependent on a free market? Who owns the company doesn't matter as long as the market is free to work like it is supposed to.


&gt;It would be harder for companies to be successful if they are forced to be owned by their workers. 

Do you have any proof that this is true, or is it just a feeling you have?


&gt;Wouldn't they also have less access to resources, though?

I mean kinda, but not really? Restructuring companies obviously isn't easy, but it also should not cause them to collapse and lose all of their jobs. If it does then the anti-trust shit failed hard because instead of 2 possible choices you still go back to 1.

&gt;&gt;Why is this a bad thing

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well it is a big step toward worker ownership of companies, which is a major component of socialism.

Corporations, as they currently exist, are not a natural result of the invisible hand. They are not simply a byproduct of capitalism. A business does not become a corporation until the government issues a corporate charter. This allows an organization to act independently as a legal person. 

It also shields investors from liability exceeding their initial investment for anything done with their money. This is known as limited liability. 

There are trade offs for this limited liability though. First and foremost is a corporate income tax. In addition to this there are corporate regulations that must be followed. 

If the government were to determine that 40% worker control of leadership of a corporation as a condition of incorporation would be beneficial to society or the economy or whatever, then I dont really see the problem there. If such a prospect were too onerous, said organization is perfectly welcome to forego the benefits of limited liability. 

&gt;I think that it is a misinformed position. Generally when you break up companies, it is because they have acquired too much of their competition. That is not entirely the case with technology companies.

You know, we used live EXACTLY like this, right? We have it even MORE strict than before? And you want to know what happened? Women were oppressed and forced into unhappy marriages.  People were forced to live a certain life with zero freedom of choice. 

&gt; That's the thing though. While these women are forced to wear this apparel, there's one thing that is certain; they will never be accused of being raped because of what they are wearing. 

Clothing has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with rape. Rapists do. Women have been raped wearing revealing clothing, and modest clothing. Children, who are completely innocent, have been raped by complete strangers. Clothing will NEVER provoke a rape. That's like saying wealth will provoke robbers. It's the ROBBER'S fault you got robbed, not because you're rich. Same applies to rape, and ALL crimes.

&gt; Which is another point; Muslims would never take this kind of shit. They have their culture locked down so hard that the mere idea of even being criticized by the very people who claim to be oppressed by patriarchy, despite the fact that the Muslim culture is extremely patriarchal, actually causes feminists to rear their heads in defense of said culture. It gets to the point where they even claim that forced garments are ""empowering"" to women. 

I am a feminist. I hate theocracies. Most sane people can realize that theocracies are horseshit and ruling a COUNTRY based off a religion is dumb. But Islamophobia refers to people hating others because of the fact that they're Muslim. This has nothing to do with government system. People can criticize a religious government without discriminating against the people who follow that religion. Remember, Christianity is a well respected religion even though most countries back in the day oppressed people under the guise of religion.

Forced Modesty doesn't ""protect"" anyone. It only encourages women to believe they are at fault when people violate their bodies. I truly hope I can change your mind, because the idea that women should be forced to wear thing to ""reduce"" male urges is a silly idea.

ps.

Consider a uniformly conservative, Christian, western society or social group.  Will you see women parading around half-naked?  Highly discouraged.  One-night stands?  Nope, or at least not much.  No arranged marriages, but generally early marriages where it is both people's first sexual partner.  Divorce?  Highly discouraged.  Drinking?  Some Christian variations prohibit it, too.  Paying any attention to the social justice stuff?  Nope.

A good example, from what little I've observed, would be the mostly LDS (Mormon, but apparently they don't want to be called that any more) communities in Utah.  As far as I know you'll find very little in the way of drinking, sexual liberality, etc there—I think their major university, Brigham Young, even prohibits such things in its rules.

And, in such communities in modern western democracies at least (e.g. LDS in the US), they typically achieve all of this without executing or imprisoning people over it.  Ostracization is just as effective and causes a lot less damage.  Those LDS I've met in person have been excellent models of socially-conservative citizens who achieve everything you want to achieve, but without violence.

And you may be correct that such practices can enhance social cohesion.  In fact, that's precisely the difference between conservative and liberal moral values: conservatives emphasize social cohesion, whereas liberals emphasize individual autonomy (see Jonathan Haidt's book *The Righteous Mind*).

Being nude in a professional environment is completely unacceptable. But not because men might get turned on. It's because underwear isn't included in a professional dress code.

Do you really think that the majority of the women in those countries have a real choice in the matter? Where if they wanted a divorce they could actually get one? 

Firs consider whether the women in some of the countries you are looking up to even have the right to travel outside without being escorted by a male relative. Let alone making it to a court house to file a motion for divorce. 

Secondly consider, even if a women was able to make it to a courthouse and file the papers, would her husband let that be?

Also, yes women can rape, but the dynamic is much different. A woman attempted to rape me once, and I was able to simply over power her. This option isn't present for most women. Again, because men and women are different, as in men are physically stronger in most cases.

Statistically poor people ARE much more likely to be robbed than rich people.  This is why the windows in the Projects have bars on them, but rich people's houses do not.

&gt;Seems like a no-brainer to me, and I'll follow up with a question. Which do you think is more likely to make a man horny - a woman wearing full robes, or a woman in a bikini. There is a reason why Playboy doesn't have pictures of women in full snowboarding gear in their magazines.

Men are turned on by seeing a part of the woman that is not commonly seen.  In tribal cultures where women go topless all the time, seeing breasts is usually not considered to be sexual at all and doesn't turn men on.  In a highly conservative culture, seeing a glimpse of a woman's ankle or neck is just as arousing to a man as seeing a topless women might be to an American.  Men are turned on based on societal norms, not based on any objective standard of dress.  So if all you see is women in full burka, that will turn you on just as much as an American seeing a woman in regular American clothes.  Societies with higher standards of modesty do not see less rape - statistically the opposite is the case.  As many have mentioned, Islamic countries with extremely high modesty requirements have much higher rates of rape than western countries."	2.0	0.0	325	False	False

Sexual assault is even more complex.

&gt;According to that Wikipedia page, none of the top 10 countries (per capita) are Muslim.

Studies have been done on this and rape statistics are higher in a lot of western countries because people are much more likely to report that they were raped in western countries, and a lot more things are legally considered rape in western countries (spousal rape, for example) which are not even legally considered rape in Muslim nations.  Women in Muslim countries rarely report that they were raped when they were, because women are frequently literally murdered for having been raped.  And even when a woman does come forward to report a rape, in many Muslim countries, a woman cannot give legal testimony, so unless there was a male witness who will testify (women are not usually raped around impartial male witnesses), it's legally not considered to have happened.  Obviously this will produce MUCH lower official rape statistics than the actual number of rapes happening.  More detailed studies have found that there are high rates of rape - the vast majority of them just don't end up legally recognized as rape."	3.0	0.0	237	False	True	6.0

That first Big Daddy wrecked me, but I never felt like he was just smacking me down and I never knew what to do... I felt frantic, like I was running around trying desperately to survive, and I think that's exactly what I was supposed to feel.  I was given this big open space, so staying away from him wasn't too hard.

&gt;  I mean, yes, I could waste 40 machine gun bullets taking them down, but that hardly seems like the optimal solution and I also feel like that is not the way it should work as a survival horror.

It's not survival horror; it's action.

&gt; You have to go get a plasmid to melt a lump of ice blocking your path so you can get a plasmid that will let you clean obstacles out of your way so you can go Dr Steinman so you can get a key from him so you can open a locked door. If that isn't contrived storytelling, I don't know what is.

See... this stuff is just there to teach you how to use the plasmids.  I feel like your two points here contradict one another... they have parts where the story slows down to teach you the gameplay.

&gt; Any kind of exposition is given to you in the same format of an audio diary. Don't get me wrong, I do like the inclusions of audio diaries and I think they can be used to great effect, I don't think they should be used to give exposition for every single thing in the game.

The atmospheric effect of the audio diaries is to present to you that you're in a graveyard.  Everyone's dead.  You're forced to listen to all these tragic stories to get information you need, and you can't do anything to help anyone you're hearing.  (I don't think it works quite as well as in System Shock 2, because it actually gets really unclear how sentient these enemies you're fighting in Bioshock are, but that's the goal.)


&gt; Will there actually be any character development? Will there be any real interaction?

Yyyeahh, I feel like someone misrepresented this game to you, or something.  The game isn't about characters; it's about IDEAS.  It's a theme-focused story.  Of course there's no interaction, because your character's a cipher... he doesn't have an arc, because the PLAYER is meant to have the arc.  You're supposed to go, ""Oh wait, huh, all those times I thought I had a choice of what to do, I didn't,  Huh, maybe even outside of video games, choice is an illusion...?""  It's a critique of objectivism: fetishize freedom, and most of the time, you're fetishizing something that doesn't really exist.  


&gt;  Fontaine is constantly throwing insults at the player in a way which reminds me of a moustache twirling villain who is just doing it for the sake of it. 

Again, this is best seen through a thematic lens.  Fontaine is the flaw of objectivism: a smart monster whose ruthless self-interest ends up destroying the self-interest-loving world he lives in.  He's a natural product of Galt's Gulch and Galt's Gulch also cannot survive with him there. 


I do agree with a couple of your criticisms.  Turning into a Big Daddy really is pointless and whatever impact it was supposed to have, it doesn't.  And yeah, there's definitely problems with the endings... though I get what they were going for.  The ONE THING you have choice over is to do the rational Randian thing or to actually be compassionate.  Go the former route, and you're embarking down the Fontaine path. (and I don't have a problem with them being so conservative here.  Yes, killing one little girl SHOULD be damning.)"	15.0	0.0	642	False	False

Well yeah, that's for two reasons.  They're talking to YOU, the PLAYER. ""Interactions"" aren't going to happen, because in an interaction *you can choose what to do*.  In a video game, you can't... at best you can choose one of four complete sentences.  The game is partly ABOUT this lack of choice.

 And, it helped them avoid focusing on close-ups of the character models, so they didn't have to waste resources on lip sync or attractive faces.

&gt; Well what kind of game is that? Not about characters? Really?

Yes, really.  Why are you acting like this is weird?  Plenty of narratives are driven by themes and not characters (one author, who went so far as to devote pages to screeds about the way she thought society should go, comes to mind especially easily right now).

&gt; I think you're over-complicating it. It's a simple plot twist: You thought you were free, but you're actually not. It's interesting at first, but like I said, there's no character development and nothing changes.

What about the entire premise of the game, where a guy whose name is almost an anagram of Ayn Rand establishes Galt's Gulch at the bottom of the ocean, and everything goes to hell because there wasn't a government regulating the stuff they were doing down there?  I'm not sure you're on solid ground if you think there isn't a whole lot going on about freedom, choice, and agency, both in video games and in politics.  They sure spend a helluva lot of time talking about it.



&gt; For a game that is praised for it's supposed moral choices, the fact that its only moral choice is a black-and-white-kill-or-not-kill choice is inexcusable.

It's not praised for its moral choices, it's praised for its *thematic examination of morality vis-a-vis freedom*.  ALL video game morality is simplistic... there's a literal formula calculating how good or evil you are!  That's what this game is trying to EXPOSE... all that ""freedom"" in those other games is an illusion.

Even the most morally complex and interesting games (like KOTOR2 or Planescape: Torment) have absolutely 0 things interesting about the character's ability to choose morality.  They just have good writing when the characters DISCUSS morality."	7.0	0.0	501	False	True	2.0

Now, allow me to answer your criticisms *through the lens of Objectivism*, with which the game should be judged:  


\- **Splicers, Daddies, and Little sisters have almost no personality** \- this is on purpose, they are supposed to be ""moochers and looters"" as per the game's philosophy; degenerate creatures created by fall of Rapture's ideals  


\- **Big Daddies too hard** \- again, this is on purpose. As Rand/Ryan would say, life is what it is, it is your fault that you are not good enough of a player, not that Daddies are too hard. This is a fight for survival, nobody said it would be easy  


\-  **story feels really contrived and convoluted at times.** \- the overly complex problem are caused by the fall of Rapture's philosophy: it used to be a technological and capitalist utopia, in which everything was straightforward and reasonable, it was the meddling ofthe moochers and looters that fucked it up. If you feel frustration solving these quests, congratulations! You now understand what it feels to live in a world ruined by collectivism and irrationality.  


\- **characters do not feel real**; because they had stripped themselves of their ""realness"" by their own bad choices. It is telling that the only real human interaction you get is with Ryan, because it is his final cry of defiance.  


\- **Fontaine a  moustache twirling villain** : this is because Fontaine betrayed the Objectivist values Ryan based Rapture on. He is a Looter type villain and thus, in the end, when his only weapon of criminal cleverness is stripped, he has not much more to say than insults, and not much in actual combat valour and prowess. He is all talk and little integrity in the end.  


\- **You become Big Daddy, but then become normal again**: you assume the ""role"" of a guardian of a fallen looter system , but strip it before the final confrontation to fight the ultimate evil with your own hard earned merits.  


\-  **The moral choice for this game comes from the save/kill little sisters,  but this fails because all of the little sisters feel void of character;** they are like that on purpose, you are not supposed to save them because you like them, but because IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. *Using kids as enslaved tools is objectively evil,* it is against basic moral values of liberty and non-violence. There is no moral justification in hurting a child even once, or profiting from it's slavery. There is no black and white here: killing kids is always wrong. Considering child murder or abuse a ""gray area"" is typical collectivist mentality, using people as means to an end.  


**THe ironic/awesome thing** about this game is that Rapture was based on Objectivism, but ultimately failed due to human flaws, but if YOU, the player make all the choices in the game according to the basic rules of Objectivism, you not only get the good ending, but the game is really easy. The game constantly punishes you for being lazy, not rational, acting immoral, not paying attention, etc, while it also rewards you for hard work, focus, rational actions, good resources and money management, and moral actions.

Capitalism in the world has changed a lot though since it first started to be used. Regulations and social programs are proof that capitalism has some failings.

Its why labor laws were created after employees were nothing but wage slaves and kids were forced to work in horrible conditions. Its why environmental laws were created when companies found it cheaper to pollute and poison an unsuspecting populace because it was cheaper than proper disposal. Its why social welfare was created that protects those that were fired to increase profits and protect against another great depression.

Today, the wage gap is growing. Young people are being priced out of owning homes. Climate change is approaching its point of no return. Globalization making the world smaller changed the whole landscape for manufacturing employment.

&gt;	Gaza’s economy has particularly suffered as a result of the 2007 blockade. Israel substantially tightened movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza in 2006 following the January 2006 victory of Hamas and the formation of the Hamas-led PA government in March 2006.15 In 2007 a full blockade was imposed. Consequently, between 2005 and 2008, Gaza’s gross domestic output was reduced by a third, first primarily as a result of a drastic drop in government consumption and investment and then after 2007 also a substantial drop in private consumption and investment, but also a virtual elimination of an already ebbed export sector.

I mean like it or not, the blockade is doing exactly what it's intended to do - reduce the violence in Israel coming from Gaza.

That simply isn’t true.  The conditions in Gaza exist in large part because Israel has imposed a blockade on it.   They may or may not be *justified* in imposing the blockade, but that wasn’t OP’s original arguement.    Ending the blockade would immediately improve conditions in Gaza.   The impact that would have on Israeli security is a separate question.

Hamas’ poor economic policy may also be terrible and would also leave Gaza poor, but its hard to test that premise under the shadow of the blockade’s effect on the economy.

Edit: Clarifying on rereading—OP *is* arguing that the blockade is justified for security reasons, but he doesn’t really expand on that premise, just accepts the argument.  His title and first paragraph still put most of the concrete blame on Hamas for the material conditions, though.

Edit2: Further reflection on how to stage it more clearly. OP basic idea is that Israel is not the “primary” cause of the humanitarian situation.   It really depends on what is meant by “primary.”   The causal chain basically goes:

Hamas seizes power—&gt;Israel faces a security threat from Hamas—&gt;Israel imposes a blockade with the dual goals of minimizing the threat and pushing Hamas out of power—&gt;the blockade results in humanitarian crisis

I’d argue that Israel “caused” the humanitarian situation through the actions it chose to take after Hamas took power.  Gaza would still be poor without the blockade, but it wouldn’t be absolutely destitute as it is now."	5.0	0.0	293	False	True	2.0

I’m gonna simplify what you’re saying to the extreme here:  
1. The standard of living in Gaza is worse because of the blockade.  
2. But the blockade was put into place by Israel because Hamas did bad things to Israel.  

And there you end. Any further causal connections backwards you reject, because you want to look at the “current” situation. But why is where you cut off the limit of “current”? Why isn’t after 1? Why isn’t after 3, that Hamas did bad things to Israel because Israel did bad things to Palestinians?

One problem is that Israel actually has two goals with the blockade—directly improve security by denying Hamas access to militarily useful supplies, and then to undermine Hamas rule by functionally making Gaza ungovernable for them.   

They just don’t like to talk about the second goal, because starving people out to force them to change their government isn’t really a legitimate policy tool.

If the goal was purely to ensure security, there are options for that like screening incoming shipments for weapons, finding ways to monitor the end use of supplies, etc.   Now, maybe Hamas rejects those, but then it becomes easier to argue that this is all Hamas’s fault and not just a punitive strategy."	3.0	0.0	131	False	True	2.0

All reviews serve a purpose just as all news sources serve a purpose, regardless of bias. Together, they build a collective picture of an experience. 

Do I trust the NYT critic of cold sesame noodles more than I trust the Yelp reviewer who thinks it tastes like Skippy peanut butter? Maybe. Do I trust my friend’s opinion of a movie more than the Academy that feels in service to an agenda? Maybe. But together, all these reviews help paint a picture. I actually think individual consumer reviews have a greater sense of bias within them. Additionally, consumer reviews often lack the experience to tell a full story. An “expert” from IGN on a video game comes from someone that plays a ton of games and recognizes the variety within them. A review from my friend Trent comes from someone who likes puzzle games, so I end up playing Uncharted and Tomb Raider for weeks. 

Regardless of information source or purpose, solely trusting a single source of truth is madness. Look for biases. Find supplemental sources. Lean into sources you trust. But use the collective information you have readily available, even the “experts.”"	4.0	0.0	220	False	True	0.0

Here are some of them:

* Critics often talk about society using the movie as a backdrop or prompt. For example, here's a review of the [Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/candy-girl) (Ironically, the critic herself won a Pulitzer Prize for it, along with her other work).

* Or they talk about the craft of movie making, writing, or game making. Here's Roger Ebert review of a [good movie](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/schindlers-list-1993) 

* Or they use it to write piece of humor. Here's Ebert's [review of a bad movie.](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/milk-money-1994)

* Or they reveal little details about the show you may have missed (most of the AV Club reviews are like this).

In this way, good reviews are the real life versions of high school English classes. In those courses, you had to read great literature and discuss them, write essays, make connections, etc. We don't usually do this as adults, but reviewers do it for a living. And the usually have something interesting to say. At the very least, they can help us avoid garbage and find movies that we might have otherwise missed."	8.0	0.0	200	False	True	0.0

God also can't want things, otherwise God is limited and not God insofar as God is supposed to be perfect or complete in any sense which theological accounts presuppose or explicitly assert. Wanting is tied to lacking. 

It seems like you're dealing with some exoteric watered down Christianity that's been oversimplified and reduced into absurdities. Complete waste of time. Some Christians understood what I said, others did not. You want to focus on the ones who understood, because they're the ones articulate enough to explain their positions reasonably as opposed to reciting scripture at you and/or just appealing to faith or revelation or whatever. 

I am not a Christian but I think if you want to deal with the matters of freedom and God, you shouldn't be concerned with summations of material that are mostly aimed at the unphilosophical general public and need to look into Aquinas, Augustine, or Kant - or comparable philosophers or secondary works on these sorts of philosophers. And I say that not as an Aquinian, Augustinian, or Kantian either - their work on these matters is valuable however even if they aren't the ""end of the story"" so to speak. 

Right now you're likely just dealing with several degrees of seperation from the works that inspired these kinds of watered down summaries, and you won't get anywhere in understanding why people relate freedom to God or why they think there is free will by doing that.

I am not so much aiming to change your title view here, but just saying you are looking completely in the wrong places if you want to understand ""Christian perspective"" or ""God"" or ""free will"" or their relation."	12.0	0.0	302	False	True	0.0

It's like a kid asking a parent why they don't just quit their job if they're unhappy. The logic seems flawless but it's a nuanced and complex situation that requires a much deeper understanding of desire, money, capitalism, love, taxes, life in general, etc. So while it's a fair point to ask ""why wouldn't God just do ___?"" you have to at least acknowledge that it's coming from a place of extremely little knowledge of an infinitely complex issue. 

Secondly, if all God wanted were entities to worship him endlessly and without resistance, he would have never needed to create humans, or the universe even. Angels fill the role much better than humans ever could. Granted they don't fit the role perfectly as they did have a chance to disobey, but they were given one chance instead of endless chances like humans.

So we can assume that humans were created with a different purpose in mind than being programmed robots that sing his praises day in and day out. Most theologically savy people would tell you he created us to love him and love others. Love by definition is a choice, so at the very root of the why we were created revolves around choosing to love or hate. Having a choice creates a true relationship, one that actually means something and isn't a Furby repeating how much it loves you. 

Lastly, determinism is a big part of certain Christian theologies. Predestination is the term that's used more frequently. This creates a whole new argument about whether it's fair or just for God to determine your life choices for you, but God and determinism don't conflict as much as a lot of people assume."	9.0	0.0	307	False	True	0.0

I don't think it's significant enough to pin it on increasing minimum wage. I think the lower cost of living and labor force outside of the US will lure the jobs away regardless.

Your workers will need $7/hr to be able to sell their labor. If you pay them $4/hr, they can't afford food, utility, etc and they will cease to exist so there will be a ""natural"" cost of living minimum wage even if we have no federal mandated minimum wage. Comparing this barrier, if you go to Thailand or Malaysia for manufacturing, they can live like kings with just $1/hr. There is no way US labor force \*can\* be competitive when the cost of living is just that much higher.

Because the cost of standard of living has risen so high in comparison to China, the minimum wage has had to try and catch up with it (but not all the way).

There is no ownership of any individuals, so it isn't slavery. The servitude isn't truly involuntary, since membership in the community that imposes these laws is voluntary.

If you wish to speak colloquially rather than literally, then this argument quickly becomes a meaningless one. Every single guarantee that any legal system offers us has got conditions attached.

America's democracy was founded on raging debates, name-calling, smears, and sabotaging of opposing ideas, and we’ve withstood almost 240 years of push and pull without completely unraveling the thread that binds us as a society. I wish we could have heated debates without the nastiness of trolls, doxxers and general ugliness found on Twitter/Facebook/Reddit, but the ‘high road’ progressives have taken for the past couple of generations have lost out to modern media, especially in the echo chambers of cable news and bespoke content on social media. This is where push comes to shove.

Everyone now has a microphone and platform to broadcast from, and our conversations have turned from heated arguments over traditional things like taxation and healthcare to systemic crises like equality, civil/social rights, and science denial. Marches, protests and published opinions are much less effective than they were, and now encourage flame wars and shout-downs from the opposition. It’s fair to call out and shame anyone attempting to drag us back into Jim Crow or endanger the whole of society for small inconveniences at a personal level. I love seeing someone being shamed after throwing a tantrum in a Target over their mask display, coughing on folks who observe social distancing or calling cops on a bird-watcher for the crime of being Black. If outing these folks creates a ripple effect where their employer decides actions don’t match their values and people lose their jobs, well, too bad. These would be the same folks who call for strong, hard justice coming down on people breaking our laws or tenets of their faith. It makes me queasy to see families and (especially) kids dragged into this. and I don’t have an answer for that.

For decades we all shared the same sources for information — courtesy of airwaves licensed by our government, and required to provide news in a neutral way in exchange — and as result, we were debating from a common starting point. That no longer exists and we have to find better ways to come back to the middle and resolve our differences. Until then though, this deeply liberal, middle-aged, and privileged white guy will celebrate anyone who turns weapons so effectively, brilliantly used by the extreme right against them. I may like it, but I support it.

Trump can’t even get $5 billion for a stupid wall, he can’t force a state to open or close, he can’t send in the national guard without a governor requesting it, and he will face legal challenges for the actions of federal officers recently. He doesn’t get to do whatever he wants, and if you think concrete steps have been taken you are welcome to list them, I would be happy to discuss them.


Second, his acceptance of the outcome is ceremonial, it has nothing to do with the transfer of power.


The USA has robust checks and balances in place, and the reality is that there isn’t any way for him to try to stay in power after noon on January 20, 2021 if he loses, or January 20, 2025 if he wins.

* If he loses, at the moment the new President is sworn in he has no more authority. The secret service don’t work for him anymore, and the US Marines on grounds are constitutionally obliged to ignore illegal orders.

He doesn’t have a choice and he isn’t stupid, our constitution was written by anti-government crazies who hated tyranny more than anything. 

His people will be very clear with him if he has any doubts. Trump may leave threatening legal action, he may leave pouting and crying, but it is highly unlikely force is required to remove him.


* If he tried to delay the election on some COVID19 nonsense, and the electors could not be seated in time, he would still stop being President on January 20th at noon, we would have President Pelosi, should she still be speaker of the house.

And his people have already probably told him that.

* If he wins, we will hear this same argument in four years, that Trump wants to stay in office, and that will not happen. I would go so far as to say constitutional changes cannot happen in today’s divided political environment, getting enough votes is currently impossible. Getting enough states to agree is currently impossible.

There are very few schools (comparatively) who make millions of dollars off their athletes. Big 10, SEC (the best conference), ACC (second best conference), Big 12 &amp; the other 3/4 big ones do make millions. 

There are **thousands** of schools out there. Division 2 &amp; 3 schools that do not make money off of athletics. A vast majority of sports don’t make money. Football and basketball are the main ones. Female sports don’t make money... unless if your UConn women’s basketball team or Duke. Most will not make money to pay for their operation cost. Collegiate gymnastics, swimming, climbing, rowing, track &amp; field, golf, trap, polo, lacrosse &amp; so on are not televised events that take in money like men’s basketball and football. I’m not sure how man’s hockey, soccer and baseball do. I know it isn’t as profitable as the other big two though. 

For most schools, having successful alumni is where they will get a lot of donations.


Look at the schools with the largest endowments... they mostly are not the schools that get prime time game slots or televised bowl games. They don’t have the top picks in the draft.

Further, shouldn't we be more concerned about actual survival than economic survival?  Also, would you apply the same economic survival argument at the individual level?

This implies that there is a significant risk for college aged students going back to school which is not true. Also if you give any business the opportunity to continue their business or go bankrupt they are obviously going to choose to continue. 

&gt; Would you apply the same economic survival argument at the individual level?

Your analogy here isn’t really correct. Obviously on the individual level we have government supported options to make that choice not have to exist. For a college this choice doesn’t exist. They either open up in the fall or go bankrupt.

But to modify your view here:

&gt;CMV: The ""root"" of the US healthcare crisis could simply be the food we eat.

I'd say that the ""root"" is deeper, and has more to do with economics, which strongly impact people's choices about what they eat.

In particular, relative to many other advanced countries, the U.S. *massively* subsidizes sugar. A candy bar in many Western European countries will cost you 2-3x what it does in the U.S., and that is majorly down to U.S. sugar subsidies.

Beyond sugar:

""Writing in the 2004 *Annual Review of Nutrition*, James Tillotson, a professor of food policy and international business at Tufts University, argues that U.S public policy encourages obesity at the expense of sound nutritional practices. “You have a whole régime here that’s worked to increase agricultural efficiency,” Tillotson says. And what U.S. farmers are most efficient at producing, he says, are just a few highly subsidized crops—wheat, soybeans, and especially corn.

Support for these few crops, critics say, has compelled farmers to ignore other crops such as fruits, vegetables, and other grains. The market is flooded with products made from the highly subsidized crops, including sweeteners in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fats in the form of hydrogenated fats made from soybeans, and feed for cattle and pigs. This flood, in turn, drives down the prices of fattening fare such as prepackaged snacks, ready-to-eat meals, fast food, corn-fed beef and pork, and soft drinks. Worse yet, some scientists say, paltry support for foods other than these staples increases the contrast between prices of fat-laden, oversweetened foods and those of healthier alternatives, offering poor folks little choice but to stock their pantries with less nutritious foods."" \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247588/)\]

So, consider that unhealthy eating is a consequence of economic policies (the root cause).

You're not away from the hormone riddled existence of teen years, this impetus lasts on into mid 20s, indeed there is a great deal more sexual learning and experimenting going on in college than high-school. Its not bad to still be a virgin, but having no sexual experience at all is worth taking note of and working on. That being said, a lot of what you said reveals that you know nothing about it and are making all sorts of assumptions. 'If I found a partner as an adult, why would I want to have sex with her?' Trust me when you're in that scenario you will *not* have to ask that question.

Furthermore, it sounds like you're hinting that you're lacking sexual desire, or feel like you won't be able to perform. Stop watching porn, it totally fucks your sexual programming up and will absolutely drain you of sexual drive, leading one to question why women and sex are even appealing to everyone else, because your brain isn't sending you horny hormones since it thinks you just got laid the previous however-many-nights you've wacked off. Maybe you're not watching any porn but just in case, don't, because it causes the very problem you're afraid of.

You're too far removed from the scenario of sexual interaction to have a clear view on it, and I'm betting your shame/fear about being an adult virgin is getting to your head, both of them. I just got through a very short, very intense interaction with what was a brand new acquaintance. She threw herself at me, no feeling involved, and was probably trying to manipulate me for her own reasons, but I could smell it and guarded against it while trying to enjoy her graciousness. I've had the same thoughts you've put here before, and felt like I might be slipping away from my hormones, from my virility as a man. She proved me wrong given how many boners I got from mere touching and kissing, and the fire it lit in me I had forgotten existed. I didn't even like her and actively knew she was trying to dominate me, which was fun to allow her to think, but that would usually cancel out sexual attraction for me. I don't like evil people, I don't like sex being manipulative. Still, my hormones had me ready to bat. I guarantee if you find someone you actually love and find attractive, you won't have a hard time finding yourself. Stop thinking about it so much and go live life. You're a virgin at 18, you have some catching up to do. Go mess around with some people and try not to hurt anyone and watch your feelings but don't be surprised if they get hurt anyway. Life is messy. But sex is great and don't let yourself forget it."	2.0	0.0	482	False	True	0.0

Lmao, ""As people know"", bro you never heard of adults having all night orgies, swingers parties, one night stands, etc.? I can promise you that 20 and 30 year olds have just as many sexual desires as your inexperienced teenage ass. We just learned to control our boners.

&gt;Adults also aren't innocent or ignorant to sex. Because of this, sex isn't as exciting or seen as something... to be mesmerised by. However teenagers on the other hand have a extremely strong desire to have sex and ""explore"" 

&gt;Because those experiences are new and mysterious they can be more exciting and thrilling especially because its it's something you shouldn't be doing unless you're older. 

So something that's new is interesting? Groundbreaking work there. But what you fail to realize is that teens that have sex all the time also don't find it as mysterious.

&gt;I mean adults need all of these fucking sex enhancing drugs and techniques and information to improve their sex life and ""spice"" shit up. Adults also need to be ""in the mood"" for sex But adolescents don't need any of that bullshit. Most are horny as shit and ready for sex all the time 

Lmao, ""anyone trying new techniques to get better at a thing they like doing doesn't enjoy the vanilla version enough"". I absolutely do not envy whoever you end up plowing missionary for 10 seconds before busting your first time. 

&gt;I've been feeling extremely bitter as i said before and it's made me develop misogynistic views and some incel views as well. I'm not a misogynist or incel but If i continue this path i surely will become both of those things. 

Then don't continue? If you see the views as flawed and problematic, don't hold them?

&gt;I have a lot of goals and desires i plan to purse. One of them being that i wanna become a person i am proud and confident to be. I wanna grow and learn and become successful. 

&gt;Some of my goals require me to social a lot. I plan to build my social skills further and learn to be more charismatic. 

Alright, cool. That's a good start. But if you've not been very social up to this point, maybe recognize that your views are coming mainly from what you perceive, and not from reality. I know many people that lied about their sex lives as teens to be cool.

&gt;I highly doubt i will ever find any sexual relationships with women when I'm older but... if i ever do why should i bother having sex with them? If for one reason or another women find me attractive (money, or my success or some other quality i have) 

&gt;Why the fuck should i bother having sex and losing my virginity if i am a grown ass man? 

You're already shooting yourself in the foot with the whole ""ill never be worthy of anyone"" mentality. And you are altogether WAAAAYYYY too focused on the idea of sex and losing your virginity. It's not some mystical, otherworldly experience. It's an activity that can be amazingly fun for some, but not interesting for others (see 'asexual'). You don't need to do it if you don't want to; it's not something you ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" do.

&gt;Having Sex and relationships isn't exciting as a man compared to doing it as a boy. 

Again, obviously the first time you do something it'll be more fun than the second or third. But how do you, a 17 year old, feel experienced enough to tell all us adults that we're wrong about finding our adult relationships fun and exciting?

&gt;I fucking hate sexually active teenagers, especially teenage boys who have sex with attractive adult women. 

&gt;I hate them. I hate them i hate them i hate them i. Fucking HATE them. 

Holy shit bro. I get that frustration, I really do. I wasn't cool or popular in high school and I was jealous of the athletic people for being fit and popular, but you have to let the hate go. It won't do anything but turn you into a bitter person. 

And I've seen you arguing with other comments, but just so you know, I have a friend who was really mentally messed up by an older woman preying on him when he was a teen. It started out fun for him, but it's been almost a decade and he's still not fully over it.

&gt;Having sex as a grown adult for the first time means that you are late and other people who have had the same experiences at a younger age are superior and better and enjoyable for the reasons i mentioned before. 

You're straight up wrong. Your entire argument boils down to ""adult sex is boring and teen sex is fun because i said so / everyone knows it is"". You're making up these rules and saying everyone has them. I was on a rugby team in college and both the men's and women's teams could not care less who was a virgin or a slut or gay or straight. It really did not matter at all.

And fyi, because you said you didn't wanna become an incel, I'll tell you that this is exactly how it starts. A guy says ""everyone is judging me for being a virgin"", then uses that perceived judgment to justify to himself why he's pulling away from everyone and isolating himself in incel communities. Once he starts to develop the really shitty views like ""I DESERVE sex"", then people really do start judging him and he feels like he was right all along."	15.0	0.0	967	False	False

Yes, there are some women (and men) that don't want to be someone's first, but that often revolves around many people feeling attached to the person who ""took their virginity"". But as I said, the rugby teams at my university had people who'd been with dozens, and people who were still virgins. We really didn't care. Hell, I didn't lose mine until 19, the summer after my first year in college. It's not at all strange to be a virgin for a year or two in college. 

&gt;So whores want a man whos been with dozens of women before them?

Careful. You're sounding very much like an incel with that one. It might shock you, but the number of people someone's been with isn't a huge factor for a lot of people. A lot of the focus and perceived judgment on ""virginity"" is perpetuated by virgins and teenagers who are finding another way to antagonize their peers.


Cards on the table, I thought similarly to you when I was your age. Getting out of my small town and actually talking to other people helped me realize my unhealthy obsession with my idea of sex.

You're somewhat right that many people (men and women) will find a 40+ year old virgin a turnoff, but that doesn't apply to 18, 19, or early 20s virgins.

If you wanna talk about more specifics privately, feel free to message me privately, but I'll turn it around and ask you some questions.

What do you want to get out of sex? What do you think is the difference between having your first time as a 17 year old versus as a 19 year old?

The first problem is that OkCupid's rating is not an objective measure of attractiveness. 

See, if you rate someone highly, the algorithm will suggest you to them. If you rate someone low, the algorithm will ignore them.
Since men message women far, far more often than women message men, women are incentivized to rate men low, else they get spammed with a thousand messages.

On top of that, look what happens if we look at who messages whom.

That appearance is valued over ""personality"" when the only information you have on a person is mostly their appearance according to a picture and their personality is just a short description in text... isn't surprising. 

Survival of the fittest is pretty much an empty tautology.

What survives is presumed to be what was most suited to surviving in its environment ... because it survived. Of course, environments are always changing, and fitness in one context isn't the same in another, so it doesn't do explanatory work it merely describes what mechanically happens. 

At the level of mechanism we can use it in a larger account, but morality doesn't factor in. Survival is a precondition for maintaining some structures of an organism but it doesn't determine how any organism ought to behave while surviving. There are multiple ways to survive, and surviving in an environment necessarily involves changing that environment. If I ask how we ought to change the environment, appealing to survival accomplishes nothing."	3.0	0.0	197	False	True	2.0

Firstly, the ""study"" had users rate an individual's attractiveness and then tracked their message sending. Despite rating men as less attractive than a standard bell curve, women sent an expected number of messages. Assuming that means women think men are unappealing or that women have too high standards is kind of ridiculous. 

A) maybe a dating website *isn't* a normal bell curve of attractiveness. 

B) maybe women are conditioned to be less comfortable opening admitting sexual attraction to strangers, particularly in a potentially sexual situation. 

C) maybe women dont base their level of attraction solely on physical attraction to a photograph so they wouldn't rate people as very attractive without getting to know them. 

D)or maybe the physical things women do find attractive are harder to convey in a photo than the physical things men find attractive. 

E)maybe men on Ok cupid, on average, put less effort into their photos than women did. 

F)maybe a dating website from a time when dting websites were less ubiquitous is just a bad, self selected group of subjects. 

G)maybe there were other factors that affected women's ratings more than men - like maybe they were unconsciously taking things like clothing, props, backgrounds, or even usernames into account in their ratings. 

H) maybe women rate men as below average attraction more often because they view themselves as below their level of attraction also. If my siblings are super smart, I might think of myself as relatively dumb. And if I think (rightfully) you're about as smart as i am, wouldn't I probably rate you as below average intelligence too? The issue there isn't your intelligence or even my perception of it, its that my whole baseline is shifted - my idea of intelligence isn't a standard bell curve.  

But most importantly, the ""research"" found that men disproportionately messaged the women they rated as most attractive while the women messaged a much broader range of people. 2/3 of men only messaged the top 1/3 of women, but women's messages almost exactly mirrored their attractiveness rating - ie, *they may have rated men as being less physically attractive but were* **far** *more likely to give them a chance and try to get to know them.*

For example:

&gt; Liquidity has no significant inherent value to the stock market in terms of it's value to the economy as a whole. 

This is flatly incorrect. Liquidity is of massive value to financial markets, as recent crisis events have shown (global financial crisis, covid crisis, silver sunday, to name just a few). When liquidity dries up asset prices begin to collapse, which is why the government has to step in and start buying up assets, as the Fed did in the corporate bond market last year for example.

Another example:

&gt; Prohibiting the use of all speculative instruments/derivatives and imposing small per-trade tax would not negatively impact the stock market in it's value to most people it would reduce the volatility of the market and the likelihood of national or global market events, and if anything it would increase the returns of low risk index funds and value investments. 

Derivatives are used primarily to hedge exposure, not to speculate. The exposure could be commodity prices, interest rates, or security specific exposure, but irrespective of what the underlying exposure is a hedge is a hedge. If producers of goods like gas or pork or financial institutions like banks can no longer hedge, you would actually see volatility levels rise, not fall, because institutions have lost their ability to reduce or eliminate price risk. If banks can't use swaps to hedge interest rate exposure, daily fluctuations in bond markets are going to have material impacts on mortgage rates for example. Same thing with oil producers not being able to use futures markets to hedge their crude price exposure.

I understand that when there is an expectation of liquidity then the risk of a reduction in liquidity can cause a run. No one wants to own something if they're not sure they will be able to sell it right away if the norm is that they are always able to sell it immediately. If the status-quo shifted such that there were an expectation of lower liquidity then the steady-state investment would surely remain roughly equivalent - lower liquidity wouldn't reduce peoples desire to earn capital gains. Is there another factor to this I'm not understanding?

Surely this risk mitigation could be achieved through more traditional insurance models without being significantly disruptive. The effect should be the same but would limited to hedging the risk for the people who produce the commodities. Letting others who have no stake in the market hedge against it is like letting random people take out an insurance policy against me crashing my car.

So you are acknowledging that there would be a shift from one status quo to another and that expectation of liquidity is currently of value. Do you not then see that shifting from scenario A where you have liquidity which you find valuable, to scenario B where you have less of said liquidity, would lead prices to move lower?

It's interesting that you bring up insurance, because insurance companies also use derivatives extensively to hedge. You should look into reinsurance companies and how they hedge the exposure they take on from retail insurers. It can get pretty esoteric, hedging disaster insurance like floods or fires with things like weather derivatives (which yes actually exist). These types of derivatives are also used in agriculture to hedge for things like crop yield fluctuations as well. Letting people who have no stake in the market take on risks associated with said market is a fundamental element of insurance.

&gt; I'll need to think more on this.

Snow White takes a poisoned apple from a stranger and wakes up believing she is able to speak to animals. This shows impulsivity and a lack of understanding of consequences and speaking to animals is a delusion perhaps explained by schizophrenia.

Cinderella is similar. She believes her clothes were sewn by rats and she has a coach made of a pumpkin. This could perhaps be a delusion caused by schizophrenia but in context seems likely to simply be a false reality she made up because she couldn't cope with her existence and the abuse from her stepsisters.

Aurora has narcolepsy. 

Pocahontas was a real person so I'm reluctant to count her here, but I guess she also counts so I must. The Disney character of Pocahontas (rather than the real person) is impulsive and reckless and shows a disregard for social norms and her own safety. This could be explained by ASPD or hypomania. Also taking into account what actually happened to the real Pocahontas, the Disney story of Pocahontas could be seen as a metaphor for PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome.

Mulan could be seen as a metaphor for gender dysphoria. She presents herself as a man far more often and for far longer than was actually necessary in the situations she was in. Her obsessions with bringing honour to her family show that she is insecure and perhaps obsessed with success which could be a sign of something like covert NPD. Also Mushu could be a hallucination.

Tiana works way too hard; harder than is healthy or productive. She's a ""workoholic"" which is often a sign of anxiety, OCD, or NPD. Also there's the whole turning into a frog thing which might be seems as low self-esteem and negative self-talk.

They may, they may not. But if we know anything about testosterone and male puberty, it has a long lasting effect on the body. Even former Trans men who take testosterone end up with permanent side effects after they stop taking it. The muscle mass and density is usually advantageous.

&gt; Plus I assume segregating the trans vs cis women would not go over well. 

First of all, only 0.6% of the population identifies as transgender. There actually might be more of an issue of not having enough of them to play period. And they were literately born with the capacity of competing in the men's league, now they changed to the female gender. Definitely not anything like a black guy on the basketball team, he does not have the ability to change his racial complexion.

Especially for kids who transition before they go through puberty (and with acceptance and awareness of trans people increasing, this will becone the case for the vast majority of trans people), physical differences between trans and cis women aren't actually that big compared to the variability between individual women. Especially in team sports, where a lot of success is dependent on things that aren't related to strength, like teamwork, reflexes and situational awareness, it probably won't make that much of a difference if you're a cis woman or a trans woman who transitioned before puberty. 

Also, one of the main reasons why women's sports isn't more popular is that sports organisations have deliberately tried to stop women's sports from being publicly viewed at all, and still continue to choose not to promote it more. Women's soccer used to be more popular in the UK than men's soccer, until the FA banned women from playing on official pitches. The women's soccer world cup final in 2019 was scheduled on the same day as the final games for men's soccer tournaments, but still managed to attract more viewers than both of the combined in the US, as well as the previous years men's soccer world cup.

If you're part of the 'out group', I think a fascist society would be as bad if not worse (scratch that, definately worse) than a communist society. 
Also, the metric of 'worse' is incredibly subjective. I recently had a long discussion with someone who grew up in East Germany, and they said that although there were some things they found 'bizarre' and wrong (the Stasi, state surveillance, etc), they considered their childhood a happy one. On a much more extreme note, I think people living under Nazism would report similar experiences - afterall, if your society tells you something is right and moral, I guess you start to believe it. In fact, I have a book somewhere which has the first hand accounts and experiences of children living in WW2 (the interviews were conducted in the early 2000s), and I remember reading it being surprised to find how many children living in Nazi Germany, blissfully unaware of the genocide and extreme anti-Semitic violence happening under their noses, reported enjoying their childhoods (although they of course now know that that enjoyment was shrouded in darkness and war crimes). I'll try and find the book and put some of the testimonies in it in the comments.

However where i would disagree with you is on two points: a) whether or not the kind of regime they would choose would really be definitively a ""fascist"" one, and b) whether or not fascism or communism presents more danger to a society  


For my first point, i would argue that in all intents and purposes, ""fascism"" as a political ideology is all but dead.  the people who genuinely agitate for it are hyper-marginal, and more often its used as a political epithet against people deemed to be authoritarian than an actual descriptive tool with any connection with the fascism of interwar europe.  for example, politicians like Marine le Pen, Donald Trump and Matteo Salvini, three people often called ""fascists"" today, I'd say have both different ideologies, and are nevertheless much more in the middle than genuine fascists were.  All three I'd argue are better called ""national conservatives"", who are basically pro-capitalism and pro-status quo, but want less immigrants, more sovereignty over their affairs, and are less committed to traditional allies (but still generally committed).  Le Pen is more anti-laissez faire than the other two are, and someone like Jair Bolsonaro, another person I'd include in this category, is more socially conservative.  But I'd still say they're not fascists; they're basically a kind of conservative.   


Now, if those with power were to be seriously threatened again, there could be a resurgence of fascism, or something similar.  My guess would be it would be the kinds of societies they would create would be the same, but the actual ideology itself would be  a lot different, just because of how much fascism is despised today.  But who knows.  


  


For my second point, I'd say that genuine fascism, real fascism, is far more dangerous than Communism.  By ""Communism"", i'm assuming you are and I will be referring to Marxist Leninist states that followed the Soviet model.  Those states, while repressive and tolerant of mass starvation for economic goals, did not advocate for the enslavement or extermination of huge swathes of Earth's population through conquest.  The Soviets did not embark on the most cataclysmic war the world has ever seen in order to slaughter ""subhumans"".  Communist aggression was typically defensive in nature; Stalinist ideology spoke of the need to build ""socialism in one country"" while the world proletariat inevitably rose up against capitalism elsewhere, which would be aided by the Soviets.  Therefore, what aggression they and the Chinese undertook was generally taking territory in their immediate vicinity to PREVENT a greater war, not cause one.  The Soviets and Chinese invaded Finland, Vietnam, the Baltic states, etc. when they were all but positive that a greater war would not break out, and that they would not have to conquer huge amounts of land, and when they felt threatened by another power.  Fascism by its very nature encourages conquest, especially Nazism.  With conquest comes an enormous new population to exploit, and the fascists were eager to do so.  The Nazis went even further, and outright wanted to kill most of the population in its occupied territories to pave the way for German settlement in those areas.  That's what the Generalplan Ost planned for.    


Fascism sought to re-establish earlier forms of European imperialism onto other countries in Europe for nationalistic purposes; European imperialism in Africa, the British settler colonies, all of those would be reborn by fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and took to new levels and heights with as much of the surrounding peoples they could conquer.    


Lastly, I'd say that Communism's fall was so devastating to some countries just because of the way the transition was handled.  Compare the transition to capitalism in Russia to the transition in China; Russia's was called ""shock therapy"", and was coordinated by western free-marketeer economists who wanted to test their theories further like they did in Chile in the previous decades.  It was a disaster; Russia saw a catastrophic decrease in economic output and quality of life that it has taken decades to recover from.  China, on the other hand, took a very gradualist approach and introduced reforms slowly, to the point where now China is in competition with the US to be the world's biggest economy.  Reforming society post-Communism isn't always a disaster like it was in many of the post-Communist states."	6.0	0.0	768	False	True	0.0

Before the USSR, the Russian Empire was technically a constitutional monarchy but the czar had absolute power. Of course the transition to capitalist democracy following the fall of the USSR would be challenging in comparison to the transition from Nazi germany to post-war democracy. Germany was fascist for  less than a decade, so most Germans had lived in a democracy already. Compare that to the USSR, where no one in all of Russian history had lived in a democracy before. 

To really compare how fascist and communist countries return to a democracy, you’d need to look at 2 countries which had similar government systems beforehand and were communist/fascist for about the same amount of time. I don’t know of any two countries like that off the top of my head, which makes sense since communism and fascism arise from different types of societal issues. I think it’s really difficult to make any accurate comparison between the two."	1.0	0.0	191	False	True	0.0

**It is possible to objectify  people in ways other than sexual.**

(before getting into this I just want to clarify the topic of objectivation is a lot more complicated than most people make it out to be, people freak out about the idea which means that the word comes with a lot of negative connotations, the reason I mention this is because I am not using this word as an attack against you but rather because the use of the term is needed to deconstruct your feelings about women so you can understand them better.) anyway back to the main point

**It is possible to objectify people in ways other than sexual.**

you are using women as a metric to evaluate your sense of self-worth.  This doesn't feel like objectivation to you because it isn't sexual as illustrated by your statement here.

&gt;while I actually really want to have a loving and caring relationship with a girl. I value cuddling more than sex, to put it plainly. In fact, I don’t really care about sex that much

Regardless it is still objectivation , instead of being on object of sex you are thinking about women in terms of them being a tool to measure your value.  We can see this in a number of ways. One, the very fact that you identify as an incel, the fact that you are particular focused on virginity, the use of words that are intrinsically about ranking people according to sexual status.

&gt;they don’t want to talk to me, because women see anyone who isn’t chad or a clown as subhuman  
&gt;  
&gt;Yay, so I can get women when they are old, ugly, and used up? That makes me soooo happy :/  
&gt;  
&gt;I want my first time to also be her first time, and for us both to be teenagers

all of these things are about framing relationships as a metric by which to rank yourself not about the relationship itself.

So why is this a problem? well like I said it's still a from of objectivation which means that instead focusing on actual specific people and actual relationships you are focused on an imaginary relationship with a people you don't know but have projected a personality onto.

By your own admission you haven't talked to these women, and your reasoning for wanting to be with them isn't based on anything personal about them or even based on what the actual real world relationship would be, you just like the idea of them validating you as a partner in some way.  Ask yourself this if you asked one of these women out and they said yes what would happen next? do you actually have something specific you want to do with them?  My guess is not really, and the reason for that is because your desire to be with them isn't personal.  Your not looking at your options and evaluating which women would best connect with you personally your imposing onto women ideas about which one would best validate you if they choose to date you.  Things like are they hot? are they socially valued by my peers?  In this way you treat them as objects, imagined versions of themselves.(notice how none of these things are actually descriptions of their personalities.)  In short you have convinced yourself that your attraction to them is personal and then vilify them as being shallow, in reality your approach is just as shallow.

To clarify being attracted to people in this way doesn't make you bad, everyone does it.  The problem you are having is that you pretend that you don't do it, which makes you resentful towards others and will prevent you from interacting and getting to know women personally because the personality you project onto them stops you from realizing who little you know about them in reality.

&amp;#x200B;

a quick fix for this is to stop thinking about interacting with people as a way to win them over but rather as a way to see if the 2 of you are compatible, this works with romantic and plutonic relationships.  Doing this will make you interaction revolve around what you actually have in common and how compatible you are instead a vaguely defined game of social interaction that can be won and lost, which is both un productive andtypically very awkward."	15.0	0.0	759	False	True	0.0

How do you know this type of girl has a ton of guys going for them? How do you they would probably hate you? Assuming you're referring to your own attitude toward women, the solution is simple: become the type of person whose mindset would not make them hate you.

As many people have said in this thread, the best way for you to change your view is to first work on yourself. Through therapy, through building on your confidence and not hating yourself, and eventually through making friends of both genders. You need to stop assuming you know things. I don't know how many times you've been rejected but it's clear that those instances had a large negative effect on your confidence and defined your worldview, even if it was just a few times. The way to combat that is to work on yourself and become the type of person to keep persisting and being less afraid of rejection. But unless you're willing to not let those rejections define your view of women as a whole, your view isn't really going to be changed."	5.0	0.0	242	False	True	6.0

Would you say you are *afraid* to bring it up to your family? You mention that it would be annoying (point 3) but I'm curious if you think they would be mad. You note that you don't feel oppressed, but what would your family do if they found out you had sex with men?

&gt;I don't consider this a core part of my identity and so don't feel any desire to do so.

Honestly, that's all the more reason to do it. That is to say, if you are surrounded by people who mention their sexuality casually instead of dramatically, it seems reasonable to assume that you'd take sexuality less seriously or see it as less unusual. It's the same reason why cisgender allies list their pronouns: because if everyone lists their preferred pronouns, it's less cumbersome for trans people to do it. If you see your sexuality as a casual part of your identity, then saying so might help people see sexuality as a casual thing. It shows you don't need to be hyper-intense about your sexuality in order to be ""not straight"".

&gt;If I did come out, it would require explanation of all of the above.

Why, exactly? Couldn't you just say ""I'm bisexual""? Your argument is that people don't need to know things, but you seem adamant that if you told your family about being bisexual you would *have* to add the fact that you only like having sex with men and don't like kissing them or falling in love with them or anything like that.

To understand the reasoning in Roe, you have to understand the Griswald reasoning and the idea of due process.

The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment says, among other things, that no state shall deprive any person of liberty without due process of law. What happened in the early 20th century is the court began to, and still does, give this idea of liberty quite a bit of weight. Liberty has been read to guarantee fundamental rights implicit to ordered liberty. There are a lot of legal theories as to where these fundamental rights come from and one of them is they are the express AND implied rights in the Bill of Rights. Most things decided using this liberty idea (substantive due process) are very personal things like reproduction, use of contraceptives, marriage, sexuality, etc. 

Now onto Griswold, what Douglas is saying is Griswold is if you read several provisions of the bill of rights together (I think it was the first, third, fourth and fifth) you find the idea there are zones where the government simply isn’t allowed to intrude. (They are called zones fo privacy in the opinion, but that is confusing I think). The reasoning didn’t turn so much of searching bedrooms or homes, it was that married couples have the right to privately decide if they want to use contraceptives and the state cannot intrude on that decision. 

Now, Roe is a very poorly written opinion. But, it takes this Griswold idea and in a very matter of fact way says it’s expansive enough to cover abortion and then sets out the trimester system. Thankfully, the reasoning in Roe has been overruled and placed in a much stronger place in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. However, the current Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women’s Health case is irreconcilable with either Casey or Roe. So, we will see what happens."	5.0	0.0	319	False	False

You seem to be defining ""very religious"" from your own perspective versus that of an atheist, which is going to be difficult. Why? Because each individual will have their own definition of ""very religious"" and they'll define it according to their own personal scale. For example, as an agonistic atheist myself, if you had to ask me to define some sort of ""how religious are you"" scale, I'd do so in the following way:

* **Not Religious**: a person who does not believe in any religion.
* **Kind of Religious**: A person who unconvincingly follows a religion because it might be all they've really known and are part of the community, and may or may not really believe in what the religion says.
* **Religious**: Believes in a religion and willingly participates in religious activities.
* **Very Religious**: Believes in a religion and willingly participates in public religious activities as well as private practicing (strict about praying; abides by dietary restrictions; does not waiver in faith; etc.).
* **Extremist Religious**: Believes so much in a religion that it completely consumes them and leads to irrational tendencies.

This isn't going to be perfect because it's off the top of my head, but you get the point. To me, you would probably be classified as ""Very Religious"" because it's something that you consider in every aspect of your life: you chant, you dress the part, you give offerings, you think about it when you make decisions... The diet thing isn't really a disqualifier for me in this scenario because you check off so many boxes and every religion is open to interpretation by the individual to the point at which they'll disagree on some major and minor points. Even if that may not be the case, it's almost always the case that individuals will pick and choose the aspects of the religion they follow, often out of personal convenience or due to some other reason.

Now, take your perspective as a religious individual as part of a community of other religious individuals. You're going to have your own scale because you're exposed to, and can recognize, other individuals who may be obviously more devout than yourself. Your atheist friend might not be capable of recognizing the nuances within that group. This is a common pattern when you don't understand, or haven't been exposed to, something. For example, if I were to watch a chess match, I might not be able to tell who's better between two players because I'm unfamiliar with high level chess, whereas someone experienced would be able to follow and criticize. To me, both players may be really good chess players, but that might not be true to the experienced chess player because the scales are different."	1.0	0.0	471	False	True	0.0

Each of these things on its own would be something that would qualify you as very religious to me.  The fact that you do all of them puts you very firmly into the ""very religious"" camp.

However, this just gets into the vagueness of the term ""very religious"".  It's a spectrum of varying degrees of religiousness.  Where we draw the line between ""somewhat religious"" and ""very religious"" is arbitrary.  To someone who isn't religious at all, anything more than a token participation in religion might feel ""very religious"".  However, someone who is following every tenet of their religion might view that same level of just more than token involvement to be not religious at all.

For perspective, I was raised Reform Jewish and I left the religion.  I consider the Modern Orthodox sect of Judaism to be extremely religious to the point that calling them ""very religious"" is an understatement.  However, I'm also active on /r/ex-jew and have had a lot of conversations with people with other backgrounds on that sub.  For some of the people there, switching to Modern Orthodox represents a drop in how religious they are.  As a result, there are groups that I consider ""very religious"" that they consider ""not religious"".  It's a matter of perspective.

Thinking about it that way, I'm sure there are people who wouldn't call you religious at all.  But it would also be fair for someone who is less religious than you to call you very religious."	2.0	0.0	325	False	True	0.0

I don't see sufficient evidence to believe an analyst can accurately predict the future price. If he/she has such a predictive power, he/she should've quitted the job and made money by his/herself.

There is a few issues there.

* Just because they don't *know* the future price doesn't mean they can't be slightly better than the market at predicting it.  Even slightly better than market can make it worth listening to.
* Making a slightly better than market return doesn't necessarily mean you'll make more money doing that as your main job.  For example, Jim Cramer makes $5 million/year salary.  Even if his full estimated $100 million net worth was invested into stocks, he would have to beat the market by a full 5% in order to top what he gets paid as an analyst.  Even then it is still riskier and may just not be as enjoyable for him.
* Sell-side equity research influences the market, so even if it really was no better than throwing darts, its a factor that could influence the price so belongs in your research just like anything else that can influence company price.

&gt; Some people may argue that we can accumulate knowledge reading sell-side equity research. However, could you generate superior return above index by knowing more? I don't think so because what you learned is already known by other rich investors who would have more significant influence on market prices.

Just because rich investors know what, say, Beta is doesn't mean it isn't worth learning and sell-side equity research is a place where you can learn about a lot of things like that."	2.0	0.0	279	False	True	0.0

Thank you for your comment. Your logic was very clear and easy to follow. I like some points that you have made. Especially, it's worth listening to them even if they are not perfect predictors.

I would like to discuss more about two points.  
1. Analyst predictions  
Your point is based on the assumption that analysts have slightly better ability at predicting future prices. When we discuss prices, we need to incorporate their ability to predict appropriate P/E. To simplify the discussion, let's talk about their ability to predict EPS and revenue.

One interesting finding is this.

* EPS Surprise: In the fourth quarter of 2020, 81% of companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 reported a positive EPS surprise, meaning that these companies beat analyst expectations. That’s a huge miss on a key valuation metric used by most investors.
* Revenue: In the fourth quarter of 2020, 79% of companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 beat analyst expectations in terms of revenue.

[https://www.moneycrashers.com/stock-market-analyst-rating-accuracy/](https://www.moneycrashers.com/stock-market-analyst-rating-accuracy/)

Would you say analysts are slightly better than average investors?

2. Known facts/observations  
I agree with your idea that we can learn about a lot of things. Personally, I learned a lot to be a less worth investor. However, it is kind of indirect causal argument. Would you say reading the report could be direct cause of performance above the market?"	1.0	0.0	225	False	False

&gt; that these companies beat analyst expectations

Analysts missing on mass like that isn't really a criticism unless they missed by more than the rest of the market did.  They could miss by a lot and still potentially beat the market.  Not sure if that is true here or not, don't know enough about that EPS surprise.

&gt; Would you say analysts are slightly better than average investors?

The significant majority of analysts, personal investors, mutual fund managers, etc that beat the market are only beating the market due to luck and not the quality of their strategy.  But that shouldn't be confused with none of them actually have strategies that are better than the market, though identifying which analysts should be listened to in general is likely as hard an activity as just beating the market (since successfully listening to the right analysts would also lead to beating the market).

But ultimately, I do think that ""Jim Cramer said this is a buy"" is useless.  Their final recommendation aren't what I would suggest you listen to.  It's the reasoning and how you incorporate their reasoning into your analysis that matters."	2.0	0.0	195	False	True	2.0

That *might* is extremely important.  That is an example of something that is negligent, but its level of negligence depends on the details of the situation.

From your link:

&gt; culpable negligence is “more than a failure to use ordinary care for others” and is instead “a course of conduct showing reckless disregard for human life” which can include “a conscious indifference to consequences”

That is absolutely NOT met by an ""honest mistake"".  When you are showing a ""reckless disregard for human life"" that goes way beyond an honest mistake.  Note that this link is quoting Florida (not Minnesota) Jury instructions, so lets take a look at the Jury [instructions in this case](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/judge-decides-on-jury-instructions-in-kim-potter-case-shaping-strategies-ahead-of-opening-statements/89-5d081964-b797-4490-9aa6-dd5331033489) and see if it is any different:

&gt; Judge Regina Chu decided she will instruct the jury that recklessness in first-degree manslaughter requires ""proof of a conscious or intentional act... that creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the actor is aware of and disregards.""

Again, same as Florida, an honest mistake just doesn't meet the threshold.

The conscious act that Potter took was reaching for and discharging a taser.  This is what her intention was.  Unless merely discharging a taser in the same situation would've been a reckless behavior (for example if the taser was completely uncalled for, which the prosecution is trying to show), then there is no intentional act that was reckless and especially doesn't arise to the level of ""the actor is aware of and disregards""."	7.0	0.0	287	False	False

Right, but I'm not sure how more clearly they can say it than ""An accident isn't a crime unless..."". It has to be more than an mere accident.

That is true, but that would only apply if firing the taser wasn't the right call to be made at that moment. None of your original post said anything remotely like, ""She shouldn't have even fired her taser in that situation"".  This is an argument the prosecution is trying to make, so there is an argument to be made there, but it certainly isn't a clear cut one.  If you want to have that discussion on whether or not she was right to draw a taser in that situation, then we can have that, but that is a much harder target than you seem to be aiming for.  Your original post seems to try to paint her honest mistake as still meeting the bar.  Without her intentional act (the one she intended on doing, drawing the taser) being a reckless one, she just isn't guilty of anything.

The charm of hockey is that it is a super fast game dialed up to 11 the whole time, while soccer is a more patient and energy efficient game (hockey is a sprinter, soccer is a marathoner).

What I am trying to say is that the endurance elements of soccer, where you only have a handful of subs, is part of what makes soccer soccer. That is why extra time soccer is so interesting. You can see that the players are absolutely gassed, and yet they keep on pushing. Yes, you could have unlimited subs, but then soccer would simply turn into hockey on grass. Yes, the offense could be more explosive and then there would be a lot more goals, but then it would become basketball played with your feet.

So yes, substitution would improve certain components of soccer, but perhaps that would change soccer to a point where it becomes something else. To me, this sound like making the hurdles shorter to allow sprinters to run faster. If the shot put were lighter, you could throw it further. If long jumpers could jump off a springboard, they could jump further. If target shooters could use a computer programed rig, they would shoot more accurately. All these things would make their respective sports ""better,"" but they would change it to the point where the spirit of the sport is no longer the same.

Limited substitutions means the effects of injuries, fatigue, players being cautious on a yellow card, or just failed choices that aren't changeable are further reduced, and that benefits the team that has more resources.

Having unlimited substitutions would make squad depth that much more important, and that only benefits those who can afford the costs.

It would vastly reduce the efficacy of cards. Often players take yellows to prevent a promising attack, or they use ""rotational fouling"" where no one player fouls an opponent enough to get a yellow/red for persistent foul play. Unlimited subs would mean you could bring players on for the sole purpose of committing fouls, disrupting the game, and killing attacks.

My other concern is that substitutions take time and are already used to disrupt the flow of a game. Having unlimited subs would slow the game right down. You could always go for roll on/roll off subs but that would involve an overhaul to the way subs are made and require extra refereeing (could make things difficult at lower levels). It would certainly add delays though, as if a coach wants to put out five defensive players for a set piece or corner, that's five on that need to take up positions. Same for attacking plays from corners or long throws. The one thing football doesn't need is people wasting more time.

I also think there's something to be said in favour of limitations. It means that the way the game is initially approached matters much more. How a team sets up for a game isn't a trivial decision. Formations are more rigid as wholesale changes can't be made, and we get to see strategies and tactics play out over 90 minutes rather than be in a state of flux in which the system constantly changes. I also think the level of organisation required in football systems wouldn't lend itself to chopping and changing so much anyway (I suppose that might be a plus to your side as teams wouldn't actually utilise their subs too often). Personally, I don't want to see a constantly shifting game, I want to see whether a team's tactics work over 90 minutes."	3.0	0.0	384	False	True	2.0

Innocent people are wrongfully murdered by the state too. By adding rape as a punishment this might save some of those death row inmates, giving us at least a chance to correct such a mistake.

The person who raped them is not guilty.

We'd pay for the therapy similarly to how we pay for wrongful incarceration/execution.

But, the problem is Twitter, like other social media sites, is already a dangerous echo chamber where bigotry festers unchecked. The core issue is not ownership at all.

Rather, the business model social media platform uses. Under this business model, we are not the actual customers. Advertisers are. So without getting into all the nitty gritty details, keeping customers engaged through morally dubious means and using underhanded ways to ~~use~~ abuse private user information to attain engagement in order to maximize ad revenue is the source of the issue.

For a better treatment of this thesis, check out *Ten Arguments for Deleting Social Media Accounts Right Now* by Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist who is close to the tech scene at Silicon Valley.

Therefore, while I fear Musk's ownership, it is not the main problem at all.

Also, your statement implies social media platform favors progressive voice when that is far from the truth. The belief that social media platform actually represents the left to me is more of right wing statement, designed to fabricate baseless outrage.

According to Robin DiAngelo - white fragility covers a wide range of defensive behaviors in response to conversations or statements about race.  This can include (AFAICT) any non-affirming response to a racial statement (such as the one you describe).  

From a NYT article:  

“She taught, throughout the afternoon, that the impulse to individualize is in itself a white trait, a way to play down the societal racism all white people have thoroughly absorbed.” - https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/magazine/white-fragility-robin-diangelo.amp.html

“And so a white person is supposed to learn that there are all sorts of things that they can't say. You can't say, ""I marched in the civil rights movement,"" because that would make you too comfortable. You can't say, ""I don't see race,"" because you almost certainly do. You can't say, ""it's about class,"" because it's about race.

And she's got about 25 proscriptions that make it so that any good white person is essentially muzzled. You just have to be quiet.” - https://www.npr.org/2020/07/20/892943728/professor-criticizes-book-white-fragility-as-dehumanizing-to-black-people"	2.0	1.0	174	False	False

&gt;News flash asshole, they should feel guilty for what happened in the past week. 

I totally agree with this, and I take it you don't, so let me talk about why and how what you said was racist even if you meant no ill will.

Hate crimes happen. You and I have no real control over what individuals decide to do because of racist beliefs they hold. That much is true. But when people make statements like the one above, they're not talking about individual hate crimes - they're talking about patterns.

We have seen patterns of acts of domestic terrorism, committed by white people, against minorities, treated much different in the eyes of the law than if other ethnic groups committed them. Go back just one century, it was the KKK - an organized group of murderers and racists - not even being labeled as a terrorist organization by the US government. One of the most notoriously racist terrorist organizations in American history. And yet, the Black Panthers were swiftly dealt with by that same government. That's the problem we're addressing. One klansman lynching one black teenager is not something you should feel guilty about. A pattern of klansmen getting away with lynch mobs for decades because of an American culture that gives them a pass? Yeah you should feel guilty about that, because that's *your* people, and not only do y'all collectively enable it, a lot of you refuse to acknowledge there's even a problem.

So fast forward to today. It's not klansmen out and about, public and proud like in the era of the civil rights movement. But it is still domestic terrorists, with racist intentions, routinely getting off easier and treated gentler by American culture. A Muslim kills innocents, America blames Islam/the Middle East. But let a white man do the same thing, he's just a ""lone wolf"" with mental health issues. That double standard is the problem.

And so it *is* racist for you to make yourself the victim of the situation. Because terrorism is treated different in the eyes of the law and the media depending on the race of the terrorist. As white Americans, that's your responsibility to fix, because it's a problem you created. If you don't want to fix it, or even acknowledge it, that's also fine. Shit, I should probably be volunteering at a homeless shelter right now instead of arguing on Reddit. But you don't get to absolve yourself of guilt.

Instead, I'd like to try and take a shot at this belief:

&gt;I don't think white fragility is racism

First lets get the definition of white fragility clear because a lot of things have been proposed in these comments. In a nutshell, white fragility typically refers to the **discomfort that many white people feel when discussing racial issues, possibly accompanied by defensiveness.** It's not just ""saying anything non-affirming about race"" or ""disagreeing with a person of color,"" as I read in a few comments here. Let's look at a few examples:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Person A: ""Hey your remarks earlier were racially insensitive to our coworker.""  
Person B: ""Oh no it's ok I'm not racist. I went to a march last year.""

Person B is exhibiting fragility because they are attempting to absolve themself of wrongdoing, while ignoring the real harm they may have caused. They are taking a defensive stance rather than listening to feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Person A: ""Black lives matter""  
Person B: ""No, all lives matter""

The ""all lives matter"" retort to the BLM movement is indeed an example of white fragility. Person B is misinterpreting the BLM slogan as an attack against themself, ignoring that the slogan is a rather a statement about the widespread disregard for the well being of people of color.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Person A: ""Something needs to be done about police brutality against minorities.""  
Person B: ""Not all people are racist, it's just a few bad apples.""

Person B is exhibiting fragility by excusing individual actions, thereby distancing themself from the harm being caused even though that wasn't what was being discussed. They are therefore ignoring the systematic racism that perpetuated those individual actions.

&amp;#x200B;

White fragility tends to deflect the conversation away from the problem of *institutional* racism and focuses on denying *individual* racism, which is problematic because in order to combat institutional racism, we must be aware of its existence and our inevitable part in it.

In summary, white fragility doesn't mean you specifically hold racist beliefs. White fragility is considered racist because it perpetuates systematic racism."	29.0	0.0	376	False	True	0.0

I think you're responsible for the Buffalo shooters actions, yeah, just in an indirect way. White American culture is very tolerant towards acts of racism if it's committed by a white person. And I don't just mean in the court of law, I mean in the court of public opinion. Y'all, collectively, have set the groundwork for political extremism. The specific ways you have set that groundwork is a question a sociologist is better equipped to answer than I am, I can't be an expert on everything - but in short, white American culture resists progress because it makes them feel like the bad guy.

They'd much prefer to turn discussions towards progress into debates about why minority's problems are their own fault. News outlets and political parties have fed this idea that discussions on race relations are basically a game, a source of entertainment where you pick a side and defend it ardently. Should we address police brutality against black people? What if, instead, we countered it with talking about ""black on black crime""? That shifts the blame back on them, and if they argue against it, we can broadcast the discussion and profit off of the brewing resentment between the two races.

Everywhere ethnic minorities turn to air their grievances, it turns into an us-vs-them debate, where instead of white people understanding they're in a place of privilege and working on a solution to use that privilege to help, they find a counterargument that absolves them of responsibility. This strategy isn't always intentional, but it is always the more comfortable thing to believe, and it happens almost all the time. And it is absolutely your fault, as individuals and as a culture, for refusing to engage with ethnic minorities in an honest way and take accountability for the problems you have created. Because now, in addition to all of that, you've empowered extremists to think of ethnic minorities as enemies who only exist to pester them for handouts. You've fed the (probably already existing) idea that white people are the ""real"" victims.

For some, the idea is sort of just uninspiring. It's like, instead of exploring space to make discoveries or help humanity, it's just another way for corporations to make money. 

For others, the idea is foolish. This is along the lines of those, like Musk, who view space colonization as a way to escape a dying Earth. The obvious question is ""if we can create a civilization on a barren moon, then why wouldn't we just do that but on the barren Earth."" A variation of this is also just the criticism that we are spending resources on moving off of Earth instead of fixing it. Or the fear that this is just a way for rich people to escape the problems they've helped create. 

Finally, the reason to care about the environment in space is actually really about conserving it for future generations. If we can't survive in space sustainably, then all we are doing is making it that much harder for people in the future. If we are relying on mining or using up natural resources then eventually those will dry up and future generations will be forced to travel even further or work harder or solve these problems.

Or throw it into the sun if we're worried it'll hit a space marmot in 90,000 years.

That's...not how orbits work.

If you just throw something in a random direction, it will be in approximately the orbit you were, and it will pass through (roughly) the same place relative to the body it's orbiting repeatedly. The more we do that, the more we increase the probability of colliding with something near the bodies we visit frequently.

If you actually want to make it not a problem, you need to throw it out of the solar system, which takes a *lot* of energy. It's easier the further out you are, but even if you're near Jupiter's orbit, you still need to throw things at about 5 km/s to get them to leave the solar system.

Throwing it into the sun is actually even *harder*. To throw things out of the solar system you need to increase their velocity by about 40% of your current velocity around the sun....to throw them *into* the sun you need to decrease their velocity by more than half of its current velocity around the sun. And increasing and decreasing velocities are equally difficult in space.

In short ""throw it into the sun"" and ""chuck it into space so that we'll never need to worry about it"" are both *much* more expensive than more traditional waste management."	415.0	0.0	259	False	True	2.0

For instance, the client might not have fully informed the contractor. For instance, if the government contracts a railroad company to build rails, and the contract stipulates that the government must acquire the land to build it on. However, legal challenges/changes in the law make the government unable to get the land by the time the contract says. Getting rid of the contract now would be inefficient, far more inefficient than waiting for the legal issues to be resolved. Additionally, events outside of the control of both parties could slow things down or spike the cost without it being an inefficient action. Natural disasters, international conflicts, or supply chain disruption could all be problems without any inefficiencies.

That’s not to say inefficiency doesn’t exist. Humans aren’t perfect, and every project will have some limit to how efficient it can be. There are also real examples of incompetence or corruption slowing construction. Whether these are the root cause of the widespread slowdown you are concerned about, however, isn’t clear.

Finally, it is also possible that this apparent inefficiency is simply a function of our current world. It is possible that all major projects that you are concerned with are operating at their peak efficiency, and any efforts to clamp down on the hypothetical corruption or incompetence would lead to even more cost overruns.

The good news? Your question is still easy to answer:

&gt;  If western nations constantly face cost blowouts and delays with infrastructure projects, how can we possibly have hope that we can enjoy fast internet in the future? Or clear up transport problems? Or build the infrastructure needed for sustainable development?

As it stands, the United States does not have a problem with getting *necessary* infrastructure.

* [94% of Americans have access to *both* high speed land broadband and 4G mobile broadband] (https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/fourteenth-broadband-deployment-report).
* We spend well over $300 billion annually across federal, state, and local infrastructure appropriations in the United States, and the focus on infrastructure has resulted in [a drop in ""poor"" ratings for bridges] (https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-highway-bridges) and [improved road conditions] (https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-roadways-functional-system).

The one thing that isn't addressed in these is so-called ""sustainable development,"" which is not understood as infrastructure in normal conversation.  Even still, the number of social programs specifically targeting poverty and disadvantaged populations is rising overall.

Poor estimation methods can factor into it, but that's not really the heart of the problem.  I'll try to explain because I do this for a living.

When you're quoting a large multi-year project that's going to cost millions or billions of dollars you get some requirements that you use to generate the quote.  Those requirements vary in level of detail.  Where there isn't enough detail you make assumptions and estimate.

One of the ways that you get into cost overruns is that your assumptions were wrong.  It happens, and it can often mean the project costs a lot more than was planned.

But there's another place that you get into even bigger cost overruns most of the time.  See when you estimate the cost/effort needed to do something you can do that estimate in lots of different ways.  You can assume everything goes right the first time around and make your estimate based on that.  Or you can assume lots of things will go wrong and make your estimate based on that.  Now obviously the estimate assuming that everything goes right will be much cheaper than the estimate where everything goes wrong, so when you have multiple companies competing to win a project like this, it's common for companies who quote more aggressively to win the bid.  But in reality, things *always* go wrong.  The companies who quote aggressively know that.  And they also know that when those things go wrong, they'll pass the cost on to the customer.  And that's the biggest reason you get these cost overruns, because the original planned cost was never realistic in the first place."	2.0	0.0	299	False	True	4.0

I think you are underestimating the difficulty of properly estimate such complex and long term ventures with so many moving parts.  Most people cannot even predict the amount of time it would take to fully clean their house and garage and expect experts to be able to accurately predict the time and expense of years long projects including hundreds or thousands of people and often needing to navigate different locale communities and special interest groups and etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the natural answer people come up with is ""they are trained to do that"".  Ok, what training teaches you to do that?  How does that training perform IRL?  Do you know the first bit about that training?  And if you're not well informed on what would allegedly allow them to accurately plan all of this then what makes you so sure it's inefficient?   

Not to mention that even if they had the best of training with an impossible 100% success rate with correct information...who says they're being correct information or indeed even have all the information.  Every project has a significant amount of missing information that impacts completion dates and costs that is not known before the project starts.  Like any project started before COVID lol would be one of the easiest to understand examples right now.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Planning long range is already incredibly difficult even with simple things.  I think you're simply underestimating the difficulty.  Though if you wanted to lower the difficulty and costs of such planning then lowering the rights of your people and their wages achieves that pretty well.  Less rights = less variables from worker availability to special interest groups to local groups to etc.  And ofc less wages not only = less money overall but less variability in the overall cost outcome."	2.0	0.0	347	False	True	4.0

In the case of China, the cracks have begun to show:

* China’s second-largest builders, Evergrande Group, has $300 billion in bad loans — that is about 2% of the total tax-revenues of China; nothing about the loans are particular to Evergrande
* Housing prices have dropped 30% this year, which may cause the GDP to drop by 10%.  This is worse than any drop in US GDP during the Great Depression.
* Homeowners have called mortgage strikes in at least 300 cities.  This has forced regional banks into insolvency.  
* After flatly refusing to pay off on deposit insurance, the Chinese government has claimed it will pay off some depositors of insolvent banks.  It is not clear this is enough to prevent collapse of the banking system.
* The government has promised war with Taiwan over the Pelosi visit: either it will deliver, resulting in the utter destruction of the PRC, or it will back off, causing the government to look weak.

Will the PRC survive to see the Year of the Water Rabbit, six months from now?  _Maybe_.

But everything is very, very bad and there is no appetite for reform anywhere in the CCP.  Xi seems to be doubling down on bad policy in every sector. 

The 20th National Congress is coming up later this year.  Xi will probably try to get himself elected “Chairman” or even “Leader”, titles that have not been used since Mao.  If he succeeds, it will likely mean stasis until a *Downfall*-style final collapse of the PRC government; if he fails and is purged, the government may be able to survive, following a period of chaotic reform."	2.0	0.0	402	False	True	2.0

Let's scale this down to answer.

Why do you invest time into having to get an education as a youth?

Many children rather than school and examinations would rather hedonistically just play around rather than have to provide for family like is the case in many 3rd world countries. We do so anyways because we recognize that schooling is necessary in order to both improve the child's quality of life in the future as well as for the child's own ability to survive in their future. Even if they are unhappy for a brief period, it is worth it for the next 30-60 years.

You can't just play around and be illiterate all your childhood and then decide when you're 30 years old that you want to be able to be able to support yourself since you lack the cultivation of prerequisite skills from education. Your 'extremely happy for a short period of time' decision has now affected your ability to be 'moderately happy' for the remainder of your life.

Now with respect to sustainability, if we consider our society to be an adolescent, why would we not invest in not just the next generation - but the current generation.  Concepts such as sustainability are not just an investment into hundreds and thousands of years into the future... they're concepts that affect us decades from now which is not far off.

For example we've only been able to not starve to death as a species at the current population levels [thanks to technological developments 100 years ago into ammonia production](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1918/summary/)

The truth is that part of what makes a human brain act so human is the constraints and affordances of the materials that it is made of. And the process by which a brain is made does not make the same kinds of stark divisions between code and hardware (which are, after all, an abstraction mainly for us, as humans, to think about complex machines). That lack of clear division makes the idea of hardware/software difficult in humans, and--as a practical matter--in (other) machines.

2. Is this just the Turing test?

That is to say, does simulation to a high degree of precision result in no practical differences regardless of the system simulating it? If so, it seems to me to be a question of a different sort, though it continues to be a discussion. (See, for example, Searle's Chinese Room.)

3. A difference that makes a difference?

Two humans can think and behave in quite different ways. Presumably you are not asking for the intelligence to behave or act identically to a single given human.

So that leaves the question not of difference, but how much, and whether it is a difference that makes a difference... to something. What is the meaningful outcome of this lack of difference? Is this a question because we would want it reflected in the language we use? In the rights granted to the entity? In the restrictions and responsibilities put on it?

In other words: there is bound to be a difference between a given artificial human mind and a human mind. Even with the assumption that we could make an instantaneous physical copy of an individual human's mind, there is every reason to believe that the two minds would diverge rapidly. So the question is how much difference is enough to matter, and that means specifying an outcome that such difference might affect."	2.0	0.0	321	False	True	0.0

Your op wants indistinguishable  ai.  So the actions are by definition the same. How we take in data, that is another difference, if that counts for you because computers will be taking in different data and with much different sensors than humans.  How we process data is definitely different if we are dealing with different input data.  How we think and how we experience should be different than computers given our significant differences.  For example, we experience senses like sight and hearing in two different ways.  Why would a computer experience them like us? Perhaps they see in the way we would call hearing.  Perhaps they experience all senses with sight.  Perhaps they sense in some totally different way we have no intuition for.  Maybe the programmer can control how the ai experiences different things.	1.0	0.0	147	False	True	4.0

You make an interesting point. That, for example, a digital consciousness couldn’t react to being cold, or dizzy, or hungry. So in order for an AI’s behavior to be indistinguishable from a human’s, it would have to lie. I suppose that leads me to wonder, what if it’s programmed and built to have awareness of the physical components that sustain its life (temperatures, power consumption, etc)?

Issue is that in theory you can replicate everything, but in reality you would need to know:

\- how exactly it reacts to any stimuli  
\- how emotions are generated and how do they work  
\- how memory works

If user says ""Good day"" respond with ""Nice weather""

and you could make those conditional statements longer to remember what the user had said previous.  billions and billions and trillions and trillions of condition statements.  

with enough conditionals I would eventually replicate human behavior sufficiently well.  But probably this thing would not be conscious and certainly it would be different then a human.

But we don't actually know what causes humans to be conscious.  We know our decision making is powered not by a bunch of conditional statements but rather by a neural network.  But we don't know why an neural network would give rise to the type of consciousness experienced by humans.  we don't even know if a neural network gives rise to consciousness.

like our basic AI with countless pre-programmed conditions, a neural network based IA might also lack consciousness.  Since we don't know what causes consciousness we cannot say with confidence.

We already have neural networks, they are just simple.  It looks like the most powerful computer in the world simulates about 80k neurons and an ant brain has 250k.  So the words biggest computer is about 1/3rd as smart and an ant.  I think at that scope we would say with confidence that while an ant might have consciousness our super computer certainly does not.  But again its not clear if non-humans are conscious or if our primitive neural networks are, because we don't really understand what consciousness is.

besides the complex problem of conscious there is a much simpler difference between artificial and natural intelligence.  All natural life wants to continue to be alive.  All life strives to survive.  but we would have no reason to give our AI this desire.  There is no reason why we'd want our AI to be concerned with its survival in the world.  of course we see this in current AI.  An AI that plays chess or generates artistic pictures does not care if you delete it.   Our AI is unlikely to have any survival instinct.  Rather it will just get trained to perform whatever task we are concerned with.  Tesla's want to avoid car crashes, but they don't try to avoid being deleted.

If I’m a pro athlete, or a someone with success, status, and good looks being promiscuous is easy. Women will throw themselves at you.

And it is at that point ( if you ever get there) that being monogamous is much harder.

There are like two mass shootings a day in the US. That's an insane number, and despite FOX's desperation to push the narrative that they're mostly gang related, that's not true.

They are often domestic/familial, which doesn't mean people won't be harmed -- especially in states with lax gun laws (the more strict the gun laws, the less gun violence, and the less strict, the more gun violence).

This is a very bold claim.

&gt;They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

This is not mutually exclusive with your initial, bold claim. 

My primary argument is against your initial, bold claim. It is bold because it is implicitly an accusation of bad faith. I was raised in an evangelical fundamentalist household. Until I was ~14 (honestly I can't pinpoint when I started questioning but by the time I was a young adult I was not religious) I fully believed Hell was real, God smote the evil, and the righteous will prosper.

*Let me just call out that there is simply no reason for a person to do some of the things believers do unless they are true believers.* In evangelicalism this is well above 50% of people (we're pushing 80% at least). One thing you don't state but what I strongly believe (and you may very well agree with) is that people project their beliefs onto god as a way of insulating their beliefs from self-reflection and finding similarly-minded people. It's this insulation that prevents them from realizing they are projecting in the first place. It also allows them to avoid cognitive dissonance while maintaining genuine, contradictory beliefs in some cases. 

As a ancillary argument I want to state that there is a high probability that someone inherits the beliefs of their parents. It's not 100% though! It's not even close.

https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/11/17/are-religious-convictions-heritable/#:~:text=Religiosity%20is%20moderately%20heritable%E2%80%9425,Lewis%20and%20Bates%2C%202013).

I've seen studies where the heritability is as high as 65%. The source above states 25-45% which is much weaker.

So the answer to your question of whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents followed a different religion is at best *probably* but also very likely not.

My first argument should dispel this idea that religious people generally do not believe what they say they believe."	10.0	0.0	341	False	True	0.0

Roads do, however, move people around. Consider adding a third lane to a two lane highway. In a few years congestion will return to the roughly the level it was prior to the road expansion, however that road will now be carrying approximately 50% more people. Those will be people going to work, to see friends, to recreation, etc. Increased traffic represents an increase in the number of people getting from where they are to where they want to be.

In essentially all US cities (with the exception of maybe NYC) the road network is the most important means of civilian transportation. Land use patterns have developed which reflect the capacity of the built road network (this is what creates the induced demand), so severely restricting the capacity of that network without providing an alternative would be a disaster for mobility in urban areas.

A policy of this sort would have worked had it been in place from the beginning, with city development occurring in response to a more limited road network. American cities would have undoubtably had better public transit and walkability. However, this is an instance where you can't unbreak the egg: American cities have developed with their road networks, and those road networks now represent an essential component of how those cities function. I support road diet programs, but the process has to be gradual to allow public transportation and development patterns to evolve to reflect the changing transportation paradigm. An immediate change as you are proposing wouldn't just be a rough transition, it would render cities completely inoperable."	11.0	0.0	279	False	True	0.0

1. This would be really hard to figure out in many cases. Let me give a few examples:   
If a team of 10 people now works twice as fast with the help of AI, and the company just pays them a bit more instead of hiring a new team, jobs are being replaced by AI but no one is fired, that would be really hard to figure out  
If I hire someone with a different skillset or for a different purpose than I would have without AI tools, it may not show in a headcount report as someone being replaced by AI  
Basically, there's a long gap between ""person does a job without AI"" and ""AI does job without person"", and your solution ignores the middle area of AI as tools, AI as assistant, AI as speedup, etc. 
2. What is substantively different about doing this compared to taxing companies that replaced workers with computers? Or factory line workers with robots? Or do you believe those companies should have been treated the same way as you now propose for AI?
3. What about algorithms like recommendation algorithms, that never had a human analog? Should Facebook be taxed because it doesn't use human raters to in-real-time curate your feed?

That is not the case. You need to actually read the study before talking about what it does and does not say. Here's what the study says about recruitment: 

>Female and male youths, ages 14 to 21 years, were recruited from three gay-focused community-based organizations (85%) and two college student organizations (15%) in New York City. Meetings were held with the study investigators to introduce the study and invite the adolescents to participate in a study of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. In addition, youths were approached individually and invited to participate. These recruitment efforts were conducted by a gender and ethnically diverse study staff who were college educated and trained to follow a common recruitment procedure. Attempts were made to recruit every youth attending the recruitment site. We have estimated that approximately 80% of youths who were invited or attended a meeting participated in the study.

In short, the only criteria was age, meeting in LGBT groups, and willingness to participate, **not** substance use level. 

In fact if you actually look at the data tables, they are not a very substance abuse heavy population.

> Items use a 5-point response scale from “not at all” (1) to “very often” (5). The mean of the items was computed as an index of substance abuse (α = .78 - .92 across all 3 assessment times for the female youths).

1. GPS isn't available everywhere cars are allowed to drive. In lots of places, it's unstable. If my GPS says I'm going, say, 85 when I'm really going 50, and it suddenly halves my speed on the highway, that is unsafe.

2. For the sake of argument, let's call cars with the throttling hardware ""modified"", and the cars without ""organic"". There will be no way to tell, on the highway, which cars are organic and which aren't. Sure, you *say* there will be a hefty punishment for removing the safety feature, but tell me even one traffic law that gets punished every time someone breaks it. I see expired plates all over the highway, and those are incredibly easy to spot. The only way we'd spot organic cars is by the same methods we already use to catch speeding vehicles.

3. There are tons of situations (road work, school zones, etc) where the speed limit is conditional and very hard to detect with a program. Google Maps still gets it wrong very often, and look at the resources they have at their disposal. You trust the government to maintain all of that consistently? They can't even fix potholes.

4. A speeding ticket is not considered a serious crime. In several states (if not all of them, I obviously haven't lived everywhere) you can take a defensive driving class to get out of them as long as you're not doing it excessively. It's rare to be caught speeding at all. This is a massive commitment which will cost millions of dollars, and it's to fix a problem we don't consider to be a huge deal as-is.

An echo chamber is **not** simply a community. It is not merely a community that censors intolerant views, or moderates conversations to keep things on-topic. 

Echo chambers have at least two distinct, key features. 

One of those is a pattern of manipulating members into increasing closeness by methodically discrediting all outside sources. This sort of ""You can't trust anyone but us, because everyone else is lying"" approach looks and feels very cultish. This 'us versus the world' framing is key feature of an echo chamber. This is above-and-beyond the typical sense of a community. 

The other key feature of an echo chamber is the sequencing of having ideas, gathering evidence, and discussion. A typical approach towards new ideas is for an individual to be exposed to and/or gather information, form an opinion or explanation, and then seek to have that opinion challenged by others through logical analysis and/or additional information. In an echo chamber, the opinion comes *first*, and then others provide information that supports the opinion and excludes and discredits anything that challenges it. 

To illustrate these features, imagine the following claim being made in a given community:

""I see a lot of crime and homelessness in my city. I think it's because people are lazy bums, and a lot of them are minorities.""

How would our imaginary community act? 

Would this community *agree* with this assertion, and follow that agreement with pre-emptive criticism of conflicting evidence? ""Oh yeah, and the city government just loves to waste taxpayer money on stupid projects like giving junkies free needles and making the cops be more sensitive instead of kicking those freeloaders off the sidewalk!""

Or does this imaginary community challenge some aspect of the view? ""Well, the police blotter and crime statistics actually show we're at a 5 year low on a lot of those things. Maybe you're just noticing it more, or maybe it's because people have been pushed out of where they used to camp and you're seeing them in your neighborhood for the first time...""

>Forming one's perspective on how to view the world and how the world should work is a process that requires exposure to various ideas and constant willingness to hear out other perspectives.

The problem I have with this claim is that there's no exception for ideas that are factually incorrect and/or objectively false. There's no distinction made between other perspectives that are grounded in reality and distorted perspectives formed by rhetoric over reason. 

You see this a lot with folks who like to talk about ""the marketplace of ideas"", too. Yes, there's a marketplace for ideas, but the market has repeatedly, definitively rejected some ideas, and pretending like we should keep allowing those ideas to re-circulate with the same standing and legitimacy as new ideas is absurd."	5.0	0.0	495	False	True	0.0

That's why I specified *overtly* and mentioned personal attacks.

I think your definition of echo chamber is simply far too broad. Most communities, even ones which have limited censorship rules in place, have a diverse community of individuals with varying world views. For example the exclusion of racist people doesn't mean all non-racist people remaining will agree on everything, especially if the community in question is based around something very different like economics, video games, or whatever else.

The only time banning racists would create an echo chamber is in the context of a community who's primary engagement is the discussion of racism. In this context all members would constantly be exposed to anti-racist views which reinforce their beliefs. 

However, in the context of a community based around discussing economics, banning racist people has very little effect on the dialogue. It isn't necessary to have racist opinions expressed in that context in order to avoid constant exposure to one set of ideas/ideals. The remaining members who aren't racist will never (or rarely) share those views and will still disagree about many other things related to economics."	3.0	0.0	191	False	True	4.0

Furthermore, even though there is a clear distinction between communities that foster respect and those that promote harmful beliefs, it might not be accurate or fair to classify one as inherently ""harmless.""  
  
Firstly, the term ""echo chamber"" often carries negative connotations, suggesting that members of such a community are uncritically repeating the same views without considering alternative perspectives. However, communities that support marginalized groups often do not blindly echo the same ideas. Instead, they aim to provide safe spaces for people who may face discrimination, harassment, or misunderstanding in other areas of their lives. Such communities often actively encourage open dialogue and understanding, rather than merely echoing the same points.  
  
Secondly, even communities that create a civil environment can have unintended consequences. For instance, they might inadvertently exclude individuals who hold different views but are willing to engage in respectful conversation and learn. This can lead to a lack of diversity in thought and even isolate the community from broader societal discourse, which is not entirely harmless.  
  
Thirdly, while it's important to create communities that prioritize the mental health of their members, these communities should also strive to educate and enlighten others about the issues they focus on. If they turn into echo chambers that do not engage with outside perspectives, they may lose opportunities to raise awareness and foster understanding among a broader audience.  
  
Lastly, the dichotomy between 'harmless' and 'harmful' echo chambers can be misleading. Any community that discourages critical thinking, open dialogue, and exposure to diverse perspectives can potentially lead to an insular mindset, even if its intentions are noble."	3.0	0.0	297	False	True	0.0

There have been times where things were worse than they are now and it didn't escalate to a civil war. If you think back to during the civil rights movement when things were really tense with mass civil unrest across the country how things are today doesn't look so bad. 

I think with the advent of social media we can quickly fall into the trap of listening to the loud minority. The 24 hour news cycle has adapted to thrive off of adversity so social issues are pushed to the forefront but reality is quite different. If you look for different types of a news you will find it. I've spent a lot of time curating the type of news I consume to make sure that at least half is non-political. The less doomsday media you consume the less of it you'll see.

It's easy to forget that near 40% of the country doesn't even vote. Out of the 60% that do vote I am willing to bet that at least half are moderate one way or another which only leaves 30% or less have strong enough views that they're actually willing to physically fight over them. 

I also don't want to downplay the very real threat of radicals. I know they exist and unfortunately some of them are armed and ready to militarize but that would be less of a civil war and more of the government stepping in to stop what basically amounts to terrorist. I don't think there's nothing to worry about but overly worrying about it by thinking were on the brink of war is counterproductive.

While civil war is often cloaked in ideology, it actually occurs for economic reasons. In the American Civil War, the country was split very clearly along geographical lines. When the addition of new free states outnumbered the addition of slave states, the southern slave states feared the free states would outlaw slavery, which would radically transform the entire economy of the south, and heavily shift the balance of economic and political power in the country. As a result, the southern slave states revolted.

There is nothing really akin to this in the modern U.S. The geographical divide is far less clear-cut, and more along rural/urban geographical lines.

Wokeness and identity politics are just flavor-of-the-day squabbles that everyone forgets about immediately. Everyone will forget about Jason Aldean and Bud Light by next Monday.

It could just be my location, but I am relatively consistantly inundated in real life with people parading around Trump bumper stickers, making crude comments about Democrats or wokeness,  and generally public demonstrations of political affiliation. I just have the general vibe in my area that people are politically aware, and thus might be inclined to stick to their positions. I also meant to address the Jason Aldean's small town song, and general public perception, which in my area, again, generally supported. That song is unquestionably about political vigilante-ism.

I don't think voting metrics on their own serve as a concrete example of political leanings, as I am well aware of the tendancy to refuse to vote because of a lack of faith in the candidates most in line with ideology. Leftists are particularly bad in this area, refusing to vote for centrist liberals because they aren't going to do Universal Healthcare or something else. I don't know if it judt an issue for leftists, but I imagine the right might also suffer slightly from it too.


The part I am most interested in further discussing is about the government dealing with radical's militarization. Would Jan 6th not be evidence enough of the potential problem with relying on the government to step in? I meant to speak more on Jan 6th as well, but we see state legislators and governors either tacitly endorse or downplay the issues with Jan 6th, as Republican officials seem to be more permissive of right wing radical action. There seems to be a running theme of right wing radicals being stochastically encouraged by Republicans. What we would likely see, in my estimation, is red states backing their radicals, which could further devolve into blue states backing the federal government and fighting the red states. Florida is rescinding their full faith and credit from blue states, which would indicate a potential for interstate conflict.

I live in a state where urban changes to corn fields in less than mile. And while I hate to stereotype and say that it turns into ""Trump Country"" it would mean ignoring all of the flags and billboards announcing it as such. I can't help but to think of it as a bandwagon thing. Lots of people show public support and repeat the things they hear to simply not be ostracized by their community. Im not naive enough to think that none of them believe it but hear enough of it at the local bar and people start saying the same things to not stick out. It gets hard to gauge how many people actually believe it but not everyone who says those things would actually fight for it.

>I don't think voting metrics on their own serve as a concrete example of political leanings, as I am well aware of the tendancy to refuse to vote because of a lack of faith in the candidates most in line with ideology.

There will always be a certain amount of people that don't vote because of lack of faith but those same people also wouldn't fight hard for their opinions either. The point I was trying to make is that they don't view people with opposing views as harshly as someone who voted specifically so the ""other side"" doesn't win. That type of mindset is necessary to actually start a civil war.

>The part I am most interested in further discussing is about the government dealing with radical's militarization. Would Jan 6th not be evidence enough of the potential problem with relying on the government to step in?

I actually don't think that Jan 6th was a big deal all things considered. Was it bad? Yes but aside from the loss of life it was relatively harmless and that harmlessness it what allows the GOP to be neutral enough to look like they condone it. The problem that the GOP is facing is that Trump has essentially created a large rift in the party. They can not secure elections without at least some of the Trump vote and that's what's keeping the GOP from speaking out against it. Most of the people who did speak out against it didn't win their elections. However, none of them have intervened against the FBI investigating or sentencing the participants. The GOP's silent condoning of it only goes far enough to maintain their voting base. 

The real concern is paramilitary groups that have been silently growing. They're actively seek disenfranchised young white men and radicalizing them and providing them with military training. Some of these groups are already on FBI watch lists which is both reassuring and scary because that means the government is taking them seriously. I think if any of them acted in a meaningful way the GOP would be forced to make a choice, either they continue to stay silent and risk losing their more moderate base or speak out against it and lose the support of the radicals that they don't actually want to admit they need.

>I acknowledge that racial tensions have always been a problem, and my perception is a real factor in my position. It just seems to be exacerbated by white supremacists being far more comfortable with being open about theirs.

I still think it's a matter of perception. Once you know the signs it's just way easier to pick out. Maybe some of the subtly is gone but the amount of racists haven't grown."	1.0	0.0	625	False	True	2.0

Innovation is not inherently bad, but psychology as a field of study can continue to evolve its understanding without crossing moral or ethical lines.

This topic came up in Congress with gasoline and ability to advertise 'taxes included'. 

There was a very significant portion of the electorate who was completely against the idea. They wanted citizens to *know* what was added to the price of the product by government in taxation. 

Kroger is charging you 99 cents for that lettuce. They have zero say in any taxes collected on it. They don't keep anything from those taxes. If it it a 1.08 total, it tells the customer that they have to pay 10% tax rate to the government for buying that lettuce. 

I personally think this is very important. It makes people cognizant of the costs of taxation.

There is absolutely nothing *dishonest* about this pricing. Claiming this does not make it true.

The prices are all advertised as XXX plus taxes. There is not one thing dishonest about that statement. 

>It's not bad because it's uniquely American, its uniquely American because every other country rightly decided that it was bad. 

That is not an argument. It's an opinion.

I have repeatably told you *why* it is done this way. When you have literally thousands of different taxing districts in a country, it is impossible to clearly, properly, and accurately advertise the 'price' paid when you have chain stores located in *different* taxing districts.

Yes - fees for the facility that are not 'optional' should be disclosed up front and clearly. That in my mind is a deceptive business practice.

They typically get away with it by stating only *some* clients have to pay these. If you are a 'member' of some club, those are not required. Places that rent timeshares don't charge the resort fees to owners for instance. 

The other way they get around it is stating there is a resort fee plus a per-night charge. You only pay the resort fee once and not 'per night'. This also complicates the pricing immensely. In total cost calculations, the 'per night' rate depends on how many nights you stay. 

Right now on VRBO, there are some obnoxious and deceptive fees added on to prices. These are typically called 'cleaning fees'."	1.0	0.0	162	False	False

Let's focus on this:

> Let's say that a person starts out in a Party A echo chamber. They agree with 9 out of 10 of the main Party A viewpoints. But because they disagree with Party A one one single viewpoint, they are pushed out of the echo chamber by people who demand ideological purity. Now let's imagine that Party B says, ""It is enough for us that you agree with us about this one viewpoint. We accept you."" The person now joins a Party B echo chamber.

What does accept mean in this context? Does it mean simply welcoming and accepting support? No one has a problem with that. Or does it mean changing the position to align and engage this person? That's the rub.

Cause let's imagine the current US landscape.

If there's a Republican who agrees with Republicans on guns, taxes, climate change, trans people, ""wokeness"", etc... but completely opposes the Republican anti-abortion positions and that person therefore registered, donates, and votes Democratic, then great! Democrats will do nothing but pump their first.

But that's not actually how it plays out. How it plays out is the person leaves Team R because of abortion and suddenly there are people, on the periphery of Team D, that say ""Hey! We can get them on our team, we just need to slow down on all the policies about climate change, guns, and trans people and focus on abortion!"" 

And that is where people on Team D resist. 

No one on team D will say we don't want your vote for our agenda. What they do say is we don't want your vote *over* our agenda. Or, at least, they say so so long as they believe (right or wrong) that they don't need that vote to win. 

It sounds like you're arguing for people to be more welcoming, but you're actually arguing for people to be more conservative. Don't rock the boat and get more votes. And that is where you lose people.

It's absolutely true that there has to be some calibration. The center of a party should never embrace policies that the country as a whole mostly rejects. That is a road to electoral ruin. But you can't take that lesson to heart to the point that you just sell-out your principles and do whatever it takes to align with the center of the country, cause that's also a road to ruin - maybe not electorally, but in every single other way.

Your problem is your conflating demands on the party members with demands on the party itself. Democrats would be stupid to demand that every single Dem voter care about addressing climate change. But Democrats would also be stupid to do anything less than demand that every single Dem leader and elected official care about addressing climate change.

And, therefore, you have to balance. You can't have so many voters that don't such that the party doesn't. And it's not just like you know when that threshold has been crossed. And it's certainly not easy to undo once it has. So a degree of vigilance in protecting your notion of justice is necessary."	1.0	0.0	543	False	False

I'd suggest that there are two things you need to achieve to win an election. The first is to persuade as much of the electorate as possible that they should vote for you over the other guy. This is the more obvious problem, and you've correctly identified it. If a party narrows its support too much, it simply can't build a coalition with the numbers needed to win. If we assume a bell curve, or even an even distribution of public political opinion, there are theoretically almost always more potential votes in a moderate position.

However, there is a second aspect of electoral strategy that's easier to overlook. A party also needs to persuade voters that they should vote for it, rather than not bothering. In liberal democracies without compulsory voting, a substantial portion of the electorate don't vote. Some are just ignorant and apathetic about politics. But many will vote sometimes, but not always. And they matter. 

The reality is that most Democrats and Republics couldn't realistically seize more than a modest share of Republican and Democrat voters without alienating their usual supporters. Most of those won't switch parties, but they might stay home on election day. What this means is that the available electorate to any particular party is smaller than it appears.

Bonus points if you can back this up with some kind of statistical data, but a purely logical argument could also be convincing.

Let's look at the real world, then. In the USA, the democrats had basically unbroken control of the house of representatives (and almost as much control of the senate) for like 70 years. Didn't matter who the president was, what party was in power. It was just a truism that the democrats controlled the house and senate. During that time, they were the labour party, and that helped them keep that solid control, because they had the unions

In the 80s, the democrats got stomped by Reagan. As a response, the new leadership in the 90s sprinted to the right, because they believed that's what they had to do. Reagan had been crushing unions, and instead of reinforcing that position that had kept them in power for most of the century, the democrats abandoned all positions of workers rights and became ""Reagan democrats."" Reagan won, so that was the smart move. Staying with the unions and workers, which the older Dems wanted to do, was just being too ideologically pure. It was virtue signalling


Ever since that flip, the democrats have been out of control of the house and senate both for the majority of terms, to the point where someone like Trump could even make a very easy and obvious political play by saying he gives any sort of fuck about workers. The unions are all gone. The democrats can never get that back. They 100% fucked themselves over to do the ""smart"" move of tacking to the right, permanently, because anything less would have been purity testing. And they have been losing ever since (See also: the labour party)"	1.0	0.0	320	False	True	0.0

&#x200B;

In short its not just R vs D but also R vs R and D vs D and ideological purity can help a politician primary their opponent.

&#x200B;

For the biggest election, the presidential election, you have to keep in mind that winning is not the only goal, you also have issue candidates who use the platform of presidential debates and election hype to sway the public's opinion. For examples look at Bernie and Yang, Bernie had Medicare for all and Yang had UBI.

&#x200B;

They both succeeded in their elections because they increased the popularity of their issue. This doesn't push people out of the party either because, in a presidential election, after the primary the people who lost endorse the winner anyway. Even back in 2016 with Hillary Clinton who was hated by the left only about 10% of the people who voted for the ""ideologically pure"" candidate Bernie Sanders switched to voting for Trump in the general.

The statement ""It is illogical to not believe in Free Will"" implies that there is a logical inconsistency or some logical leap that must be made in order to come to the conclusion that Free Will does not exist.

The argument stated, however, establishes a tertiary value judgement of ""being right"", delineates a specific definition for it, and states that ""being right' is a desirable quality only within this definition.

By your stated argument ""being right"" does not mean that a belief accurately describes the state of the universe at large.

Instead, the stated argument begs the question and presupposes that in order for a person to be right, ""free will"" must first exist.

According to your argumnent, without the existence of free will, even if a person's description of the universe is free of logical contradiction or fully accurate in describing the universe, because they did not ""freely"" make the choice to believe it, it is not valuable.

This is an argument, but not one for the stated subject line.  In other words, it does not argue that Hard Determinism or Compatibilism is illogical.  Instead it argues the following:

- ""Making a choice"" requires free will.
- ""Making the right choice"" therefore requires free will.
- ""Making the right choice"" within this narrow definition that requires free will, is an inherently valuable thing.
- A description with no logical contradictions, that accurately describes the universe, if made without free will is not a choice and therefore is not valuable.
- Thus, within the parameters defined in this premise, ""making the choice to believe in free will"" is the only opinion that has value (value as defined within the premise itself).

Again, there's an argument to be had there, but it isn't whether or not ""There is no free will"" is a logical statement, for which you provide no arguments against.

Instead, the stated subject line should be something along the lines of ""Whether or not free will exists, it is more personally beneficial to live with the belief that it does because if you are right, then that's good, and if not, who cares because nothing matters.""

In order to argue that Hard Determinism or Compatibilisim is *illogical*, you must provide a logical contradiction/argument against it."	1.0	0.0	401	False	True	0.0

A lot of your examples seem to be about confronting social anxiety with AI assistance. Do you maybe think that there is a possibility that you are actually not confronting anything by using AI assistance? But instead have found a way to put off having to deal with it?


Again, do not want to attack. This is coming from a genuine place that I think sort of illuminates what I see as a counter-point. Do we actually improve when we have something that takes out the difficult parts? Is removing the difficulty enriching?

Roughly 50% of the party is pro Trump and the other 50% is some mix of antipathy or resentment to Trump.

The base of the party (neocon GOP and old social security + social conservatism people) historically are dying off to age or are very suspicious of Trump or are moderate dems these days. 

They are still there - they are just being pulled along much like Bernie has pulled along some democrats (not to the same extent). If you look at the polls Trump has like 50% locked up and the other 50% is split amongst 7 people. The real issue is nobody in the GOP agrees on next steps.

Some want to moderate and become ""more appealing"" which usually means sacrificing values 
Some feel that the GOP has done nothing but ""moderate"" since Reagan and it has resulted in 2 Mediocre presidents and a long march to economic and social leftist
Some want to rejuvenate historical America (at least the ideal of the 50s or 80s) and think somebody like Trump can do it
Some simply want no change to anything in society and basically believe America is working just fine
Some really want the government to be radically reduced and turn more into a pre 1930s government.

He grew up in a different era, and his views on family may not be the same as those of younger conservatives. Additionally, it is important to note that Trump is a successful businessman who has created many jobs. This suggests that he is a strong leader who is capable of making tough decisions.  


Religion: While Trump may not be a religious scholar, he has spoken about the importance of faith in his life. He has also appointed conservative judges to the Supreme Court, which is a key issue for many religious conservatives.  


Managerial competence: Trump's business success is evidence of his managerial competence. He has also been able to achieve a number of policy goals since taking office, such as tax cuts and deregulation.  
   

Honest dealing: It is true that Trump has filed for bankruptcy several times. However, this is not necessarily a sign of dishonesty. In many cases, bankruptcy is a legitimate business strategy that can be used to save a company. Additionally, Trump has released more financial information than any other presidential candidate in history.  


Promises kept: Trump has kept many of his campaign promises, such as appointing conservative judges to the Supreme Court and withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal. However, he has not been able to keep all of his promises, such as building a wall on the border with Mexico.  


Decorum: Trump's demeanor is certainly different from that of previous presidents. However, his supporters see this as a sign of authenticity and strength. They believe that he is not afraid to speak his mind, even if it means ruffling feathers.

They do believe in things, and rather strongly, but those beliefs are not the kinds of things they want to advertise openly. Primarily; people, regardless of their color, who support Trump are racist. You mentioned family, personal religion, and a number of other categories, but the biggest lie even he has conjured up is “I am the least racist person ever”. When Trump makes attacks on minorities and says “make america great again” he really means “make white people unilaterally powerful with no accountability like it used to be where the lower races know their place and don’t talk back”. 

He evokes the fundamental idea of what conservatism is and means; to “go back” to the traditions and systems of the nation before modernity and to reject progressive ideals for a more conventional or conservative society. In America that is, definitionally, defined by white supremacy and racism. To “go back”, to “make America great AGAIN” would require us to fully embrace the racism that formed us and even if it didn’t I don’t think Trump voters would actually want that. 

The racism is the point; many Americans will not say it but fundamentally they believe the white race is superior and should have power over the entire world but America most especially. It’s the reason Barack Obama constantly fielded racist attacks: cartoons of him as a monkey telling whites what to do, insults that his wife was a gorilla or a man in a dress because she is a black woman who doesn’t look like Beyoncé, that he was a Kenyan Muslim secret immigrant; it was all to let him and his voters know “we don’t take orders from black people and we don’t elect them to power.”

I grew up with these attacks and seeing the proto trump party, the Tea party, promoting the most racist and openly, hatefully white supremacist ideas and being mostly embraced by the voters on the right even if people like John McCain and Steven Schmidt and other establishment conservatives didn’t like it. I’ve debated a lot with right-wing voters and conservatives and trump voters; consistently the result I find is that whether eloquently or clumsily, they try to hide their racism and become offended when they know you have found them out. Whether consciously or unconsciously, they know they are racist, and they don’t like you or I knowing it. So they will tell you to your face they want state’s rights and family values and whatever else the new line is, while quietly voting for people they know are racist like themselves. I genuinely think that John McCain lost the presidential race when he corrected some racist white lady at his campaign who came to the stage and started calling Obama a secret Muslim, an Arab, a terrorist sympathizer etc, and McCain said “No he is not, he is a good man and we just disagree on policy points”. He made a line in the sand and said “Republicans who want racism, white supremacy, and racist conspiracy theories can go over there, ones who don’t can come with me” and the entire party went over that line and formed the modern GOP we see today, putting Trump on the throne and being willing to destroy democracy to get him there."	1.0	0.0	561	False	False

Trump is human garbage and has no right to be President in 2025.  But I did vote for him in 2016 and didn’t in 2020(Didn’t support Biden either). 

But I feel we need to clamp down on illegal immigration, and Trump supported that while
Clinton and Biden didn’t. We see places like
NYC seeing the results of relaxed immigration policies. 

I also support a more isolationist government on the world stage. Trump was more of an isolationist.  Especially coming after Bush who got us into two wars (one made sense the other not so much) and Obama who pushed for more troops and deaths in Afghanistan and expanded drone strikes. 

Trumps views on abortion are more conservative than mine but closer than Clinton or Biden.  He wanted to end the republican platform of a complete ban. He also didn’t support jail or prison for women who get abortions. And since the overturning of Roe v Wade he doesn’t support a National ban. 

While I don’t agree with his stance on Trans rights.  I do understand why many people feel uncomfortable.  For many being trans seems to be their primary personality trait, rather than just what they are.  And a lot of people don’t like being forced to say their name followed by he/him or whatever.  They may be fine with someone who is trans, but don’t want it to be, in their opinion, forced on them. Also there is a lot of confusion on what gender affirming care is for minors.  And they think it often means permanent things. 

Then a lot of us also support conservative economic policies.  Which leads someone to Trump.

I have talked to people who voted for trump back in 2016 and their answers, some more obvious than others, were clearly race based. Some said their issue was about abortion, but even that is race related as many conservative and right-wing political groups have expressed fears about the “browning of America” as Ann Coulter (right political ideologue and author of popular right-wing books) once put it. The more common name for it is “white genocide” and “white replacement theory” and rightwing news pundits like Tucker Carlson of Fox News talk about it constantly.

When I say their answers were race based, what I mean is that while they USUALLY didn’t (but sometimes did) say outright they don’t want non-white people “taking over” or “browning America “. Instead they will say “illegals are overrunning the country and changing the demographics to suit democrats, someone has to stand up to that”. For me, as a Mexican Indigenous person who is also European in ancestry, this struck me as insane because the “illegals” they were talking about originally come from this country, where the majority of those excluding them are from other countries originally. When I brought this up, their answer UNILATERALLY was “well this is our country now and we aren’t giving it to anyone, and if your people (mexicans) want it back, they can take it!”

It became clear to me both from talking to these people, and from looking at what they were saying online, on tv, and from their hero’s books and popular manifestos, that all the talking points about “family values” and “christian principles” are outright lies. They couldn’t give two shits about those things. The real goal is singular and supersedes all other goals or values: the white race must have dominion over the world and over all lower (non-white) races and anyone who tries to stop that needs to be gotten rid of permanently, non lethally or otherwise. The elite Republicans in congress have ousted Lizz Cheney (whose voting record is more conservative than Trump’s or anyone else’s), Adam Kinzinger, and any other republicans who wont go along with Trump who were already few in number. Why are they doing that? Because low taxes, family values, and conservative principles are not their primary concern, making a white dominant ethno-state where Christianity is the state religion and the law is essentially Evangelical Shariah Law. They openly advocate for Christian Nationalism, no more separation of church and state, and for any book pertaining to racism or slavery or civil rights to be banned in schools and burned at public book burnings. That is why I focused on race; because it alongside Evangelical Christianity is the main motivating animus behind their politics even if they are too cowardly to openly admit their fascist and white supremacist beliefs."	1.0	0.0	472	False	False

Plus, Congress is poised to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement, which would not have been possible without the threat of tariffs.

He worked toward and enforced the FDA to approve more affordable generic drugs than ever before in history. And because of that, many drug companies are freezing or reversing planned price increases.

He reformed the Medicare program to stop hospitals from overcharging low-income seniors on their drugs—saving seniors hundreds of millions of dollars \[in 2020\].  
  
Trump signed a law ending the gag orders on Pharmacists that prevented them from sharing money-saving information.

Trump signed an executive order \[in 2020\] that forces all healthcare providers to disclose the cost of their services so that Americans can comparison shop and know how much less providers charge insurance companies. When signing that bill he said no American should be blindsided by bills for medical services they never agreed to in advance. Hospitals will now be required to post their standard charges for services, which include the discounted price a hospital is willing to accept.

Trump signed 3 bills to benefit Native people. One gives compensation to the Spokane tribe for loss of their lands in the mid-1900's, one funds Native language programs, and the third gives federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Montana.

has it not occurred to you that being numb, crying, being scared and embarrassed, that these are ways of processing what occurred? Not all rape is identical. Honestly I'd say the main reason rape victims have a hard time processing is a lack of sex education from a young age means plenty of children might be raped before they even know what sex is, worsening the inherent trauma of The Talk. And the entire rest of adolescence really, once you know that you've done the thing everyone talks about wanting to do and if you talk about it, you're pitied. Not to mention how people love to fantasize about violently hurting rapists, so if your rapist was a family member or friend, someone you don't necessarily want torn apart, you have every incentive to just never tell anyone and try to diminish what happened even to yourself

We live in a world so utterly dominated by capitalism, it's hard for us to even notice it. A hundred years ago, 'what economic system should we have' was a major political topic. Capitalism, Fascism and Communism were the main ones, but there were also significant anarchist, syndicalist, georgeist parties movements and states. Fast forward a hundred years, and if an anti-capitalist party can get enough votes for a single seat in parliament, that's unusual. Vocally anti-capitalist states have almost entirely capitalist economies. Vocally anti-democratic states scramble to make hold fake elections, because not even Putin, Xi or Kim can of legitimate authority that isn't a democratic mandate. 

Debate on political systems, by the standards of previous eras, is almost dead. We've just gotten so used to it that a student group calling itself socialist and demanding a new welfare program counts as radical anti-capitalism now.

But given the Hegelian roots of Fukuyama's thesis, it's arguably more useful to read it as an aspirational or even teleological ideal (i.e. the world *should* become like this). Democratic backsliding and other undermining of liberal democracy is thus understood as an irrational regression away from what would work best. Of course, Fukuyama was definitely in part making that 'optimistic' prediction of a shift towards democracy post-Cold War (based on the idea that it makes sense to move towards what is better), but that is probably the less important even if more publicised aspect of his views.

It's probably also worth pointing out that Fukuyama himself has also acknowledged the limitations you have looked at here, [partially explaining it by attempting to account for emotional irrationality](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/francis-fukuyama-postpones-the-end-of-history), but generally [still holding to the core criticism of non-democratic states](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/francis-fukuyama-still-end-history/671761/) while [still insisting on the superiority of the ideal of liberal democracy (albeit without really having an answer for how to achieve it fully)](https://theconversation.com/the-end-of-history-francis-fukuyamas-controversial-idea-explained-193225)."	12.0	0.0	182	False	True	0.0

3 companies own 20% of the whole stock market in the US. A lot of the way that companies are making money now is collecting rent. The biggest marketplace doesn't sell anything but collects rent on what you sell, the biggest taxi firm doesn't own taxis it collects rent from people who drive, the biggest hotel doesn't own hotels it collects rent from people who buy up property to rent it out. And we're in multiple cost of living crises that involve largely the fact that renting everything is just robbing people of their efficient capacity. People keep poking Millenials like doing something, ignoring the dual-saddles of debt, and living costs that make it impossible to save for the future, start businesses, have families, move out of mom's basement.

Democracy? I would suggest that a lot of places have major problems with democracy. They don't think that the things they believe in are implemented. The promises we're being given by government are being used only to steal money from us, and the rich aren't paying taxes. And lots of people are leaning towards politicians and media that tells us to stop respecting it. Also, media has become corrupt. People constantly talk about the fact that nobody has a unified voice, and that the only way people understand the news now is through the lens of a political channel. And within political parties, there is control over the things that are allowed to be politics. There are limits in economics to what can be allowed to be economics.

But this story is both inaccurate and simplified to uselessness. 

A country can coerce another into a political dissolution through espionage, sabotage through espionage, economic pressure, military threat. The life of the Soviet Union was influenced by a vast amount of external and internal factors. The external threats, being the US, would strain and influence internal problems, including the illegal dissolution of the USSR with an enthusiastic ally to Yeltzin. 

Now it is true that to get to the point where Yeltzin is able to dissolve the union unilaterally and illegally was caused by stagnation, but the implication of this is always used as a failure communism, as the ""End of history"" suggests, and that is simply not true.

The dissolution was a overwhelming unpopular decision that brought with it demonstrations to reinstate the union, suppressed both by foreign allies and by Yeltzin. The dissatisfaction with leadership and downward turn to stagnation really started with Khrushchev's change from a ideologically communist motivated system built by Stalin to a ""reformed"" command economy devoid of Communist ideology and dialectical materialist understanding of the world. 

Khrushchev wanted to compete head to head with the west, militarily and economically, where such a thing was not viable, combined with changes in how the economy worked lead to a stagnation where the USSR relied more and more on the west. This culminated with reforms by Gorbachev introducing private businesses and the entirety of Perastroika, which did not help the declining quality of life.

 During this time people were very unhappy with the communist party. It had lost its ideology at the core of leadership and was an administrative husk of its former self. In demonstrations, those who had lived under the communist government of Stalin wanted a return to the good times and growth in living conditions brought by him and his ideological leadership, not a turn to capitalism, as Yeltzin had done by taking advantage of the party's weakness, as some wanted to see any change. 

So when Yeltzin took power, he took this as his chance to reintroduce capitalism and illegally dissolve the union. It wasn't a collapse, as more of a murder caused by weakness in ideology of the party, leading to mismanagement and stagnation."	1.0	0.0	395	False	True	2.0

Looking at [Trumps numbers](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/2024/national/) he's dominating, that's in spite of there being more room for challengers.    

These are realities that you can't just ignore. Sure you can advocate for another candidate, but at this point it's almost impossible to build up another candidate in time for the election.

It's very, very rare that if the incumbent president runs in the primary that they lose.  Which means that baring some extreme upset, Biden will be the nominee if he continues to want to run.  Part of this is because no good candidate would want to challenge their parties incumbent.  This is largely because generally whether they win or lose, it damages their party's chance of winning in the general election.

Trump's base is insanely loyal.  It's questionable whether he can win enough independents while not losing non-MAGA to the extreme republican voters to actually beat Biden in the general election but it will be extremely hard for anyone else to win the primary election. 

The DNC or the RNC COULD change the rules to state that either candidate isn't allowed to run.

If the party leaders dictated who could be the nominee or even who can't be the nominee they'd be dealing with a lot of political problems.

I guess ""problematic"" for me comes from when I see people saying they can handle their drink cause their Irish, or they make assumptions about clan culture in Scotland (we've not had clans in hundreds of years) making my country seem primitive.

I think it comes from the imbalance of culture exchange. We know so much about so much different parts of American. Yet yous know so little about my whole continent, never mind my wee country.

I think I would be more patient with it, if I felt there was a genuine appreciation of what our culture actually is. And not just whisky, getting drunk, tartan and willy from the simpsons.

Have you considered all the things you *don't* see? All the Irish-Americans who tell people they're Irish-American when asked about their heritage then quietly go about their lives not blaming their poor behavior on insulting stereotypes?

And that's a really fair point. We don't have loads of Americans walking about in Scotland. Just because in my experience they seemed to have lacked social awareness that their Scottish culture is not my own doesn't mean everyone who identities as such will be just as short sighted. Some generalisations of my own in there.

Don't get me wrong, I really love the way Americans can be fascinated with their history, the way yous can show pride for people long gone is very respectful to your heritage in ways we just don't tend to thing over here. 

I think that my appreciation for that part of your culture has gone, uncommunicated. This genuinely isn't a ""I hate America"" post. More of a ""I'm bothered by the constant misrepresentation of what my culture is"" kind of post.

Obviously don't be ignorant is just plain obvious, but some people in this comment section feel they are entitled to say whatever they like about my culture just because of how the identify witthin the context of American society.

But I also understand ""our"" way of viewing it.

My direct lineage left Ireland around 1730 and I've never stepped foot on the land. If I were raised in Italy, I would probably say I'm Italian and not mention Irish at all. But my family still celebrates our heritage in small ways here and there, especially around St Patricks, and probably in ways that actual Irish people would think is stupid. We make corned beef and colcannon, and someone puts small toys or candies or dollars in canbage leaves and hides them in a tree for kids to climb and find.

Because America is so new, so heavily mixed, and so large...it warps perspectives a bit. Driving an hour from Glasgow gets you half way across Scotland (exaggeration, I know, but you get the point) while driving an hour from the nearest major city to me barely seems to get my out of the neighborhood. Florida isn't even a huge state, but I can drive 9 hours in a straight line at 120kmph and still be in Florida. Similarly the time scale; like you said, there are universities actively running that are older than our whole country. 

Everything here is new, humongous, intermingled, and constantly changing. So we look back to the bits of culture our family kept up with and hold on to that little island of data as part of our identities. And it gets backed up because the immigrants tend to stay within their own cluster when they first come here, so that little island of data becomes an important cornerstone of who you are both to yourself and to your neighborhood

I would never go to Ireland and start faking an accent and talking about how I've always loved floating down the Danube, but I'd probably get offended if someone tried to tell me I'm not Irish...even though I'm really a bastard mix of Irish, Welsh, native American, modern American, German, and more."	1.0	0.0	349	False	True	0.0

Essentially, what I'm seeing is that your issue is with ignorance, and that can appear at any level of ethnic purity. I'm a 4th generation American with 80+% Irish ancestry. I've got a fair few alcoholics in my family, but I'm not spouting off ignorant trash about it being a uniquely irish thing. If my 1st generation Vietnamese friends are spreading trash about Asian and Vietnamese culture mostly inspired by Fox News, I don't think their ethnic purity entitles them to that...

Again, my confusion with your post is why someone's ethnic purity is a factor is whether or not it's wrong to spread ignorance."	2.0	0.0	140	False	True	2.0

> On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing

I respect this view, and I think you may be thinking of open bodybuilding— the mass monsters in thongs. Nowadays there are other divisions that fit certain looks. For example, the Classic Physique division is arguably the most popular division with the current Mr. Olympia in the division, Chris Bumstead, having a larger following than many A-list celebrities. The Classic Physique look is more ""attainable"" and replicates the golden era aesthetic (think Arnold Schwarzenegger) that not only popularized the sport in the 60s but also has much greater mass appeal.

> What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it.

The same reason why people think any sport is worth it: to reach the extremes of what humans are capable of. Elite bodybuilders are just like any other athlete, whether it's a sprinter, swimmer, tennis player, etc. They each have a rigorous and disciplined training, eating, sleeping, and pharmaceutical routine. The only difference is what it is within the human body that they are pushing.

Also, for some, bodybuilding is an art. Don't get me wrong, it oftentimes *is* meatheads vainly posing, but for others there is a creative and artistic aspect. It's like you're treating your own body like a slab of marble and sculpting it to an aesthetically presentable form. Regardless of what you find attractive, it's not a beauty pageant, nor is it a muscle arms race; judges look for a fine balance of proportion, shape, symmetry, and detail. No two physiques look the same even if they do the same workouts, eat the same foods, take the same drugs, and these differences allow bodybuilders to sculpt their physiques in their unique ways.

There's also an extremely creative and skillful aspect of posing. It's much more difficult than just flexing your muscles— many people including myself will say a posing session is more tiring than a workout. There is skill and practice in twisting, contorting, and tensing certain parts of your body in the right positions and angles that simultaneously *highlight* your strengths and *hide* your weaknesses. Individual routines also highlight unique styles; Kai Greene incorporated elements of hip hop and dance in his posing. In the way I described above, sounds a little like gymnastics, figure skating, or diving, huh?

>  I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is.

Bodybuilding appeals to me mainly because, out of any of my life pursuits, it has provided the most profound sense of ""enjoying the process"" rather than ""the destination."" Muscle gain and fat loss are physiological processes that inherently occur over time, no matter how gifted you are. What I do with my training, sleep, or diet in an hour, day, or even a week won't do anything; it's the accrual of these hours, days, and weeks of training, eating, and sleeping over several years that allow for meaningful change. For better or for worse, there is never a single climactic moment in time in the sport, because the destiny of one's competitive pursuits were determined in the preparation behind the scenes."	5.0	0.0	542	False	True	0.0
