I think there should be some sort of three strike system where you could be fined, put on house arrest, or probation before receiving jail time. I think this could be a better system because we wouldn't be mixing relatively okay people with career criminals and it would be less of a strain on our prison system which is already overcrowded due to things like mandatory minimums and the war on drugs.

This is something I just thought about on a whim so I'd like to hear the negatives and why something like this wouldn't work in practice."	8	11

If you are a Christian, you must follow the teachings of the bible. You must follow the teachings of Christ. A real follower of any religion should follow that religion, not pick and choose what bits interest them. As soon as you can say ""this works"" and ""this doesn't"", you're not following the rules!

I believe anyone who works on the Sabbath, has piercings or tattoos, wears cotton/polyester blends, has a same-sex relationship, allows a woman to teach, or allows a woman to speak in church, etc. And says they're a Christian is lying.

I am certainly not saying that anyone should actually follow these rules, but I am convinced you are simply being dishonest if you call yourself a Christian, or a member of any religion, without following the rules that were clearly put out to you under that religion. Anyone that chooses to nit-pick the parts of their religion that they choose to follow is nothing more than a deist with a book they like. You are not a follower unless you are a follower!

Update: Between /u/TheophilusOmega and /u/Ausfall my view has changed. I feel the easiest way for me to word this is my analogy that the Bible is not a rulebook to Christians, but a textbook. They don't follow it to a T because they don't have to. Jesus' teachings is the lesson, and the Bible is the textbook in which his teachings and the Biblical historical relevance is told. Assuming that a Christian must follow the rules of the Bible exactly, else they are not a 'true' believer, is fallacious reasoning as shown by /u/ausfall, and between the two of them I've learned what actually separates following the Holy Book to following the Religion itself. I feel the points were put across strongest and clearest by these two Redditors, but thank you to everyone else who contributed."	44	79

He's just kind of ranting about various topics that most of the time could be interesting except he's not making any jokes, he just kind of says stuff with some profanities sprinkled in there for good measure (but it never shocks me like it's supposed to). There aren't any actual jokes, no real wit. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I watch with other people, because it's as if they're on auto pilot, laughing at nothing in particular when they feel like they're supposed to, rather than because Bo *made* them laugh.. Someone explain to me what it is that I'm missing (if anything)

I also see Lisa Lampanelli in the same vein.. I see what she's trying to do but she's not making me laugh!

I'm far from an expert but I watch a decent amount of stand-up comedians. I don't believe myself to be a particularly funny person, but I try to appreciate the art that goes into stand-up, and I get a kick out of watching a comedian develop their own style of jokes, their own ""character"". I find that my favorite comedy usually has some point to make. I don't care if it's about something political, religious, sexual, clean or dirty, etc. if the comedian makes their point well and makes me laugh, they'll win my favor.

For reference, some of my favorite comedians are (in no particular order): Louis C.K., Dave Chappelle, George Carlin, Mitch Hedburg, Brian Regan, Steven Wright, Mike Birbiglia, Kevin Hart, Demitri Martin, Frank Caliendo (before his impressions got played out), to name a few of the top of my head.

I believe that:

1) The mainstream media was a huge driving force for convincing the public that it had no direction or purpose. I think this is intentional, as it's touted as a failure to dissuade the public from trying something like it again. Downplaying it is their attempt at quelling the masses. 

I believe that Occupy WAS significant because it 
2) created a global outpouring of support, galvanizing hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions?) of people all over the world onto the streets. Though we look with envy to Turkey and Brazil at their ability to stand up and cite how we Americans are lazy, we started Occupy! 
3) brought together people from all walks of life for a number of different, yet still related causes. While some claim that it was detrimental that there seemed to be no single cause of protest, the same thing is going on in Brazil--they're protesting not just bus fares, but so many other things from corruption to crony capitalism.
4) highlighted innovative solutions to problems, like the communications system of having entire groups relay messages in unison to overcome loudspeaker rules.
5) brought to light ideas and concepts not often discussed: the barter system, direct democracy, alternative currencies, buying local, the failed two party system... though these haven't yet sprouted, Occupy helped plant these seeds into our collective psyche as to their possibilities. I think the ""solutions"" aspect of the protest goes largely ignored, but was one of the most powerful parts of the movement. 
6) we better understand what we're up against: before, it was considered absurd to think that the police would attempt to co-opt and infiltrate peaceful protests, or that they'd use violence to such a degree. While this was a painful lesson, I think it helped us wise up to the nature of the government. While their tactics may cause some to believe protests are ineffective, others see it as all the more reason why we NEED to be protesting.

I like having my views changed and picked apart. So here you go. Now, why do you think Occupy was a failure? Are there any lessons to learn, or should it be tossed like an old carcass from our memories, not worthy of resuscitation? 

EDIT: It's midnight here so I'm going to bed. Apologies if statements of mine were unclear. I've somewhat changed my view in that 1) Occupy should have had more tangible results for a protest of its size, and 2) Yes, their over-ambition to implement lofty solutions got the best of them. I'm still really optimistic that the movement could lead to other protests that have learned from its mistakes. I still think the problems of society raised by Occupy are exceptionally valid and in dire need of reform. HOW this will be done on a large scale by the masses... well, not sure. If no such change is forthcoming, then I would view Occupy as an abysmal failure. "	26	32

If you ever get on the road, anytime before 6, 7, or 8 p.m., etc. (quitting time), you'll notice that most everyone in their cars are older people. Rarely do you see teenagers in them, and if you do, they have friends in there, so you'd have to assume that they're going out to have fun, and not to work. 

Whenever I've had a job, I'm always surrounded by people in their 30's, 40's, and sometimes even older than that. 

So the question I would have after all this, is: Do teens have any business looking for employment at their age? Even after they leave college, you still hear about them having a tough time finding work. So where does the problem lie? How can we fix this?

The newer, younger generation is growing up, and soon we'll take over. How soon? Not soon enough...

To clarify, this isn't some men's rights post. I don't care on some kind of personal level if she is or isn't sexist, I just kind of want it clarified for me because a lot of people say she isn't sexist - yet in the examples I've seen of her (the Justice League cartoon, the animated Wonder Woman film, the Flashpoint comic book series...) she pretty much just hates men in general. A lot of people have also told me that while Wonder Woman herself isn't sexist, the Amazons are, so I could kind of do with that being explained too."	16	27

Hello everyone coming in from /r/bestof! [Thanks to this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1ikcbj/fedworkerthrowaway_describes_how_crushing_working/) we're getting a huge spike in activity.

Since there are a lot of new members coming in, I would also like to remind people to please **read the sidebar!** Also, [check out our Wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/index) We've put **a lot** of work into it, and there is a lot of information about this subreddit that can be found there!

As some of you will notice, the submissions have been temporarily restricted. This is done so all newcomers will have time to read the rules before submitting. We will lift the restriction soon, but please stay tuned.  

**DeltaBot may crash from having to award so many.** If your delta does NOT get counted, please wait before messaging us because we know there may be problems!

---  

While I have your attention, I also want to clarify one thing that has bothered a few users for awhile. To a few who come in, this subreddit may not seem very welcoming. Why? The various controversial opinion threads (you know the ones!) that are posted usually get a ton of comments plus a lot of upvotes, so to some it might make it seem like this subreddit's users all believe that.  

There are a few things I want to mention:  

1) **OP's view does not represent that of the community.** Controversial threads simply get more attention because people are passionate about their views towards them. About half the comments will support OP (especially if OP's views fall in line with mainstream Reddit), but you can be assured that the other half represent the minority view (we WILL enforce comment rule 1). There are no circlejerks to be found here! Don't take the thread title at its face value! Try and challenge OP's view. We enforce rule 1 to ensure that the minority view has a fighting chance! 

2) **Is OP really being open-minded? Is this some kind of brigade?** We used to have an old rule called rule VIII that disallowed people to use this subreddit as a soapbox. Well, we got rid of that rule because we felt that **it should be implicit in the ethos of this sub and will be enforced as such**. If you believe someone is here NOT in good faith, either through their comments or history, then **message the moderators.** Getting into needless slapfights only wastes your own time.  

3) **Why do we allow controversial opinions like XXXX?** You either allow them and take them on a case-by-case basis, or ban them. While it's true that on really heated topics people are less likely to have their view changed, *it does happen.* I've personally seen deltas awarded in many of these threads, even if they're not from OP. These threads are also the most popular by far (whether or not the activity is legitimate, ie. could be due to brigading, is up to debate but I believe it's legitimate) so taking away these discussions would hurt the subreddit. *I'm sorry if seeing these discussions puts you off!* Really, I'm not a big fan of them myself either. If you want to see posts that interest you, *try making one yourself!* Also, upvote and participate in threads that interest you! [Yesterday's Disney villian thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ihnzp/i_believe_maleficent_from_sleeping_beauty_is_the/) was an unexpected success, for example.

4) **So what kind of threads do we remove?** Obvious troll posts like ""I think the Holocaust was bad CMV."" which, due to rule 1, would force users to argue that the Holocaust was *good*. See where I'm going? We also will remove threads when it becomes clear that OP is not appearing open-minded, or if OP is consistently rude to users in their own thread.  

5) **Think about what the alternative would be!** Controversial opinions that you might see on /r/askreddit's ~~weekly~~ daily thread may get posted here, but **because of rule 1, at least the comments challenge that opinion!** What *if* the opposite view were posted? Ex. ""I don't think the Roma are as bad as Reddit makes them out to be, CMV."" You can imagine what the responses would be like, right?  

I hope the above clarifies our position on these kinds of threads. I also hope people can point others to this thread when they are confused or frustrated by this sub's content.

I'm sexist. No bones about it. I know that I should think women are equal and holding these views makes me less civilized, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that would change my mind. 

The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly. Harvard president Larry Summers agrees that men are better suited for certain difficult tasks.

I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these priveledges. 

The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. 

I want to get over this beleif because I feel like it is tainting all my interactions with women and as a result the view is being reinforced more and more each day. 

So please reddit, CMV."	23	309

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1imxlt/people_should_not_break_up_fights_unless_one_of/	"This has always been a major peeve of mine. I like watching random people fight, and I've been in a few myself. Every time there's a fight, some asshole decides to be a hero and try to break it up. Back in high school, these two kids pulled us apart even though we both explicitly stated that we wanted to fight. Now, I understand why a teacher, cop, or bouncer would do it, nothing against them, but if you're not an authority figure or at risk of injury or property damage yourself, you should let the people fight. For example, if you form a fight ring in high school around the two combatants, then no one is getting hurt, and nor is anyone not involved in the fight getting injured. In that case, no one should intervene unless an authority figure arrives. 

Now of course, there are exceptions. For example, if one person clearly does not want to be in the fight, then someone should break it up. For example, they may be asking for help or just being pummeled without throwing any punches themselves. Or if you witnessed the fight from the very beginning and one guy clearly just attacked the other without provocation. Then you should break up the fight. 

Otherwise, two adults should be allowed to fight and no one should intervene until one of them either states that he does not want to fight anymore, or is put into a state into which he cannot express this desire. Otherwise, people should just enjoy the show and mind their own fucking business.

CMV"	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ip5qj/large_dating_age_gaps_between_teenagers_for/	"I'm 18, I'm still part of the teenage dating world. 

My ex girlfriend met her ex boyfriend when she was 14, she started dating him when she turned 15. He was 18 years old. There was a constant weight on our relationship because of it. I thought the 3 year age gap was too much. When we argued I would call her horrible things like ""slut"" and ""desperate"". 

I have a friend who is 18, she's dating a 23 year old. I secretly think ""slut"" in my head too when I talk to her. 

Some of my friends who are 18 are dating 15 year olds. I have a 20 year old friend who's sleeping with a 16 year old.  I can't help of thinking of them as dirty, greasy, liars, users etc 

I know people can like or date whoever they want, and I shouldn't judge them for it. Age gaps when we get older mean nothing. But in our teenage years, 3+ year age gaps strike me as disgusting, immoral and just... ""Wrong"". I actually get visibly angry when I hear a friend I've known for years is sleeping with a 14 year old girl. 

If a 15 year old tried to sleep with me, I would laugh at them and tell them to beat it. I am not sexually attracted to anyone much younger than me. 

I know my view is sexist and fucked up.  I know that maybe it's because I'm just jealous because I never experienced these romances while growing up, or maybe I'm actually just an ephebophile and jealous of people getting what I want . I know it's possible I only have these thoughts because I'm a misogynist and have been (unsuccessfully) suppressing it. But please, try and explain it in a way that's respectful and not insulting. I'm trying to change my view for the better here and I don't think I handle hostility very well (I shut down) 

Thanks.  Oh and by the way I have a girlfriend and she 's close to my age. "	0	40

I think that any limitations on sexual expression and release among consenting adults are harmful and cause unnecessary stress, and our society would benefit from fostering a more relaxed attitude towards sexual intimacy overall.

I want someone to articulate it to me in a way I can understand because at this point I see no validity in her side whatsoever.

I keep hearing this argument that ""one day when I'm put in a situation i'll understand"" - still waiting for that day. Here are some examples of the kind of profiling I'm talking about:

* Being from the good old south, I hear family, friends and acquaintances say ""oh this is a rough part of town"" when they pull up to a stoplight and see a few black people hanging around outside.

* Another is just seeing people get uneasy when a black male walks into a gas station, bank, or some other place.

* And the last major one is like NYC's stop-and-frisk policy. They basically had a quota from commanding officers to stop young black males walking down the street, question, and frisk them.

Now, in the first two situations, my counter-argument is simply to ask how does this help? Do you feel like you have avoided dangerous situations by assuming black neighborhoods are dangerous? Have you ever prevented a robbery at a gas station by being on high-alert?

As for the last situation, I think this policy has a *negative* outcome. By being blatantly racist, these individuals who are stopped lose faith in the law. They assume police have ulterior motive to put away black men which can lead to them reacting in a negative way, which puts the police and the individuals in danger, amd perpetuates the idea that black men are violent and dangerous. It also leads to a lack of trust in law enforcement and can result in vigilantism.

**I believe that racial profiling, while it may prevent crimes, creates a bigger problem in perpetuating racial tensions and creating a lack of trust in the legal system.**"	13	31

TBS: Heroes V may have had 3d graphics but the gameplay mechanics are the exact same as in H3 with only minor changes such as heroes taking a minor role on combat. If anything the graphics just slow down and distract.

RTS: Quick! Point out a fundamental difference between Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2! They both have 3d graphics, same types of units and highly customized map editors. Difference is that there are 8 years between those games. If you were playing custom games in wc3 on Bnet you definately remember the crazy diversity the game offered.

1PS: Quake 3 had special items, multiplayer, different weapons, different missiles, armor and 3d. Physics engine? The characters jump up and fall down. If they fall down hard on the ground they take damage. If they fall in the water they don't. There's your physics engine. Portal is something of a challenger but it lacks multiplayer which imo makes it a bit of a novelty for people looking for a new PC gaming experience while only having one mission that you can't share with anyone.

MMORPG: World of Warcraft....has been going on now for 1 year short of a decade and there's no end in sight so i count it also.

No matter how tolerant we try to be we are all ignorant to certain group(s) and because of that ignorance we make assumptions about certain groups of people.


As human beings we still have the primitive instinct to attack or run away from anything that looks different than us and in this case people who look different from us.

We all make assumptions.  For example, if you live in a predominately white neighborhood and you happen to see a group of black people hanging out you will notice something is a bit off.  These black people might be law biding citizens who isn't doing anything wrong but you don't know that.  You can say the same for any race but the point is if you see something ""different"" it will stick out to you and everyone else.  The same example can be the other way around and there can be a group of whites in a black neighborhood and that will stick out and you'll still make assumptions.

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1leo93/i_think_that_if_israel_had_gained_its/	"So I know this is kind of political, but let's try to keep this on subject.

I'm a Zionist who is also an atheist, so let's try and keep religion out of this, because this is definitely not the reason I support Israel.

Thing is, there's this thing called ""Romantic Nationalism"", it's a form of nationalism in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs. 

In Israel's case that's religion and I'm pretty sure that that's how it got recognized as a state. I understand that a lot of people disagree with this because the land wasn't theirs to begin with and that just because some group claims an old book told them it is, is just a logical fallacy.

Problem is, almost the exact scenario happened almost 200 years ago with Finland. 

The Kalevala was a compilation of old Finnish folklore and mythology (Kind of like a bible, written to sum up oral mythology) During the Russian reign, the Finns tried to used the Kalevala to legitimize their nationality and gain recognition as a state. (Pretty much like the Zionist movements during the British mandate).

In case number one, there were people (Swedes) who lived on a territory that they used to own but was then taken by another country (Russia). The ""natives"" just accepted their fate and either returned to their land (Sweden) or became part of the ruling country (Russia). 

While this was happening. There was a second, much smaller group of people (The Finns) that claimed that this was their land long before the ""natives"" took over. With the use of a book that contained their mythology (Kalevala), they tried to gain independence from the ruling country. They did. (The Swedes eventually either moved to Russia or came back to Sweden).

In case number two, we see the exact same scenario. The Russians are the Britts, the Swedes are the Palestinians, the small group is the (now) Israelites and the Kalevala is the Jewish Bible.

The only difference, is that Britain didn't want to get involved like Russia did, and left the mess to the two rivals.

If this were the late 19th century, this whole conflict would never have happened.

TL;DR : The British were pussies and this whole thing got started just because the Palestinians wanted more land."	0	54

But I believe that it's one of those individualistic pursuits that does very little to improve society. Some of this is based on stereotypes of professional athletes, I'll admit, but here's an example: the last college I attended released a pie-chart breakdown of how our tuition was used, and over half, HALF, was put into sports programs. As someone who wouldn't plan on attending a single event of that type (unless a close friend was competing), I couldn't help but feel a bit jaded towards the whole thing. I had a discussion with a friend and he pointed out to me how many jobs are created by sports, so there's a definite advantage, but I still think that money could be better spent on social and physical sciences and the arts.

Edit: I accidentally a word.

Update: Hey guys, thanks for all the feedback! I unfortunately work on weekends so I've had limited time to respond to individual comments. So here's the conclusion I've reached after reading your responses-- I'll admit that the 'individualistic' label that I've applied to sports also applies to the arts, this is a bias that I have and knew I had before I posted. I hold the arts as more important than sporting events, but that is my personal opinion and I can't stand in a place to judge the rest of humanity for differing. 

I've also learned that more successful sports teams generally require less funding from their colleges, so if anything I should be rooting for the home team to win more games so I can see my tuition money go towards something that I deem more 'useful' in my own biased opinion. Thanks beigebaron for pointing this out to me.

I won't say that I've had a full turnaround on the subject, but I'm going to be more open minded in the future. Thank you!"	44	53

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pnq73/i_believe_free_markets_are_the_ultimate/	"Markets, Americans like me love them. The idea of supply/demand curves is so enthralling that we can and do apply it to just about everything. Sadly, I fear many so-called free-market capitalists are nothing more than statists in disguise; they think the State should play a role in such things as enforcing the law and national security. They often take on interests that provide no tangible gain.

I say, though, free markets are the ultimate determiner of value because:

 * The law of supply and demand provides a fair and universal metric. One cannot say, ""In my opinion, this has value, but nobody else cares""; instead we can experimentally and objectively measure the price the market will bear.
 * Markets enable a kind of direct democracy. We can ""vote with our dollars"" if we do not like the service being provided and take our money elsewhere. A business will hear the cry of the market or die, trampled by the competition.
 * Price changes with reality rather than being fixed by dogma. When it snows, the demand for rock salt goes up, and the supply begins to dwindle; the corresponding increase in price is a pointer to the world we live in rather than the whims of a sky-sprite whose existence has not yet been proven.
 * It corresponds better to our nature and is a more concise theory: Man is acquisitive, competitive, and selfish. Market theory does not have to assume otherwise.

To give an example, many—even the laissez-faire ones out there—will put some inestimable value on the relation of parent to child. ""You can't put a price on a child's love."" Rubbish! Let us instead weigh the opportunity cost instead of listening to these pieties. Assuming no artificial statist red tape has weighted the options, let us consider the cost of: (A) abandoning the child to the wilderness; (B) raising the child into adulthood; (C) selling the child's labor in the free market; or (D) selling the child itself. With A, there is the possibility, though remote, the child shall be raised by wolves, found a formidable city, and come back to strike revenge upon us; with B we are conforming to the dictates of current, non–market-based demands and perhaps assuming the ingrate will provide us some value in our elder years rather than selfishly choosing to pursue its own interest instead of that of the dying; with Options C and D, we have the benefit of a more immediate pay-off without the uncertain outcome that our adult child will be faithful and swayed by the fables of society.

If only market-based mechanisms were to prevail, Options C or D would win. The child would be carted off to some far-away land and *Pater Familias* would be healthier, wealthier, and wiser for it.

Next I look at productivity and work. It's cliché to say, ""Do what you love!"" Make art! Make music! Make love! Humbug! Your art won't pay the bills. Instead, ""Make profit, not love!"" While the artsy crowd can only afford to rent some dank, post-Apocalyptic studio in the blighted districts of town, if you weigh your options carefully, study hard, and relentlessly pursue the opportunities thrust upon you, you may be able to wind up in a mighty castle of a cubicle, updating a spreadsheet on a Friday night, wearing your Rolex and refined cologne, while the artsy kids are, who knows, huffing all that spray-paint and attending parties where they exchange mere ""good vibes"" or ""fellow feeling."" A society full of liberal artsy types will just stand around admiring each other's ""works of art,"" endlessly debating hypothetical nonsense, and doing nothing productive and eventually be eaten alive by more virile civilizations who do the productive if sometimes boring work that cures sickness, fights back war, and grows. The work that the free market values is the work people should do.

Now what of those who cannot do? I mean the sick and the elderly, the disabled and diseased. Present socialistic values say it is ""society's"" duty to feed them, to tax me and hand out to them. If their labor has zero market value, then they should throw themselves unto the nearest market-magnate and ask mere scraps in exchange for their labor; if this too is too much, well, I refer you to [history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Potato_Famine) in decreasing market inefficiencies.

Now please see if you can change my view. I beg you refrain from references to your sky-god or your feel-good politics."	0	28

It leaves the family and friends questioning everything. I say this because I understand very well the after effects of suicide and in my line of work; I have dealt with a lot of people who have wanted to commit suicide. Over the years I have had some success and some failures in this prevention of suicide. 


But then there are my personal beliefs. I believe in freedom/free will and for personal choice, completely. For the most part it seems as though most everyone believes in personal choice, personal accountability, and the whole concept of “let me be and I’ll let you be”, “I won’t bother you about choices you make as long as you don’t bother me about choices I make” as long as they aren’t illegal. Or at least some level thereof. Eventually the thought has crossed my mind on why is it that suicide is the one choice a person makes where we feel as a collective society we must get involved in that persons personal choice, so much so that we quickly hear about very personal details of their life while talking them out of the choice. How about a harder one? A person who doesn’t want to talk about it and has completely made up their mind to do it, no matter what. We then think it is completely ok to restrain the person and force them into some level of help against their will. 


I’d like to think that for the most part we as a society believe that we should never restrain a person against their will and hold them until we as a society think they are ok to be released, who hasn’t committed a crime.  Except it seems, in the case of suicide. 


One last thing, I think I am not saying we shouldn’t try to help the person. I think I am trying to say that we shouldn’t go out of our way to restrain and hold them against their will. We can talk to them and bring up things that are worth living for and help them see that perhaps the issue at hand isn’t as big as they think it is. But at the end of the day, you can’t be around them 24/7 and we shouldn’t take away their freedoms on a chance that they might take their own life. 


This is a thought in progress, so please be nice and help me change my view.


**EDIT**

A few things I believe for clarity:


-This is for Adults, not underage people, teenage angst is a mental disorder (j/k)


-You should see about talking them out of this choice, but not force them out of this choice


-Religion and culture should never be forced upon another human


-I am also for assisted suicide, living wills, euthanasia and the right to die


-As for mental disorders, just because you have a history of depression doesn’t mean anything to me, we all have been depressed before. If you are bi-polar and taking your meds, then have at it, if you have schizophrenia or personality disorders or have taken mind altering drugs …. I assume you cannot make a decision of your own accord so we should save you.  I will waiver a bit in the mental disorders area, but I do not believe you can say if you commit suicide or try to commit that you have a mental disorder 100% of the time.

I've taken anti-depressants before, but I don't feel like they made my brain work the way it's 'supposed' to. I think however my brain works naturally, without the use of medications, is its REAL natural state.

When I took anti-depressants, it changed the way I looked at the people in my life, the way I see how things work, even some of my opinions! I didn't feel like the ME I've been my whole life. But when I went off again, though I was depressed, I felt like myself again.

Since this experience, I've been unable to believe that depressants make you the way you're SUPPOSED to be. I feel that your natural state is acquired without the use of any medications. I'm a little old fashioned I suppose. Change my vieeeew?

Now I want to agree hastily that these are good, important things to worry about, but I'm not really worried about them, at least not in the long term. Cars are getting more fuel efficient, and hybrid cars are gaining market share, and eventually they'll run on some other energy source anyway. 

But cars are *not* getting significantly smaller, the brief Mini fad notwithstanding, and the population is growing.

My home city, Vancouver, is certainly not the worst North American city when it comes to traffic, and I think some people would even say we're comparatively pretty good. But still every morning, and every evening, for about 2 hours each, our downtown core and the major arteries of our city are full. Not completely jammed, but moving slowly, bumper-nearly-to-bumper, travelling at roughly the same average pace as a moderately-fit jogger.

They move this slowly because there are such-and-such many cars per kilometre of road, and because it would be unsafe to drive at/near the speed limit when the distance between cars is so short; no one has that kind of reaction time. And there are so many cars because, as a society, we have this thing where it is basically expected that every adult who has passed some tests, is entitled to occupy their own 4 or 5 meter rectangle of public road space to themselves, for as long as they need to. 

This is something which most city dwellers see as normal, and I can't seem to get anyone else to see this everyone-gets-a-car-or-at-least-most-people model of urban life as a completely absurd, ludicrous solution to a pretty simple engineering problem. The usefulness of everyone's car decreases slightly with each additional car there is on the road, and I feel like most medium-to-big cities are already at the point of diminishing returns, where additional cars slow down their neighbours by a greater margin than they provide their own driver, and so actually have *negative net utility.*

Does it make sense for people to use the same machine to traverse between cities (highway systems are *very* efficient!) as they use to cross town? If it does, CMV!"	9	19

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1t0yc8/i_believe_creationism_andor_intelligent_design/	"I am a Microbiology graduate student; I also am agnostic. I do not believe creationism or Intelligent Design have any scientific validity. That being said...

I believe that, unlike most on Reddit, creationism and/or Intelligent Design *should* be discussed in conjugation with teachings on evolution. There are two benefits derived from this:

1.) First, creationism provides the perfect foil for discussing what actually constitutes a good scientific theory. The common (and accurate) criticism of creationism is that it has no scientific validity. I believe we should expose students to it to lead them through discovering precisely *why* it has no scientific validity. Is it because there are no reproducible results? Is it because it, as a theory, cannot be disproven? Is it because it does not make testable predictions? Is it because of lack of peer reviewed literature? A combination of those, and more? Yes. As is, people love to extol the theory of evolution, but generally do a poor job explaining what *precisely* makes it a good theory. The best education is one that allows people to draw parallels to new concepts not learned; knowing evolution is a good theory does you nothing if you aren't able to make a similar critique of other theories.

2.) Second, knowledge of public discourse. Like it or not, it's a big issue in the public sphere. Exposing students to it in a controlled environment allows them to explore it, develop an understanding of the issue, and, as I mentioned above, discover what its severe flaws are. This also can serve to educate on how science must interface with the public. As scientists, we need to realize that, to best communicate with the public, we need to change from evidence based communication (assuming that all we have to do is present the facts and rely on others to arrive at the same conclusions) to story based communication. The debate over evolution is a perfect opportunity to explore how a message can become distorted from the scientific community to the public if not packaged correctly. 

tl;dr: Discussing creationism or ID alongside evolution, as long as the scientific merits (and lack thereof) of each theory or nontheory are clearly and unambiguously presented, offers an important foil for students to become better educated on what exactly a scientific theory is, as well as learning about the public debate in a controlled and unbiased environment."	5	36

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1t7z64/i_believe_that_romantic_love_and_friendship_are/	"We often criticize people in our society for not caring enough about important issues that impact everyone (like climate change, economic inequality, social injustice, or erosion of rights and liberties) and for caring more about meaningless distractions (such as the Kardashians, the new iPad, the PS4, and twerking). But I have trouble seeing how friendships, romantic relationships, or sex are any less of a distraction. At the end of the day, they're all things that make us “feel good” and raise our endorphin level, yet those are the same reasons people enjoy watching reality TV, playing video games, or buying crap they don't need. They make them “feel good”. They're “fun”.

People pour so much energy, time, and money into these things, especially sex and romance, and our society is obsessed with them. Look at any newspaper or magazine and there will often be entire sections dedicated solely to sex and dating. Researchers at universities spend taxpayer money to study them. You can't watch a single TV show or movie without seeing a romantic subplot, and it seems like pretty much all of popular music is based on romance and sex. I often hear the refrain “man, if only people cared as much about things that really matter as they do about the latest Call of Duty game or how many points LeBron James scored”. But I think that people spend even more time energy and money on friendship, romance, and sex, and aside from some feel-good rationalizations about how those things “give meaning to life”, I fail to see how they're any less of a distraction. Think of the amount of time and energy people spend on making friends, hanging out with friends, dating, and trying to get laid. Now imagine if half of that time and energy were spent actually trying to do something to deal with real issues that actually impact people.

Of course, sex is required for the perpetuation of the species, so it is, at some level, necessary. But most people in our society obviously don't have sex for that reason. For most people, and most of the time, sex is something done for fun, and that's what makes it no different, in my eyes, than iPads and the Kardashians."	2	29

I share many of the views held by this user, such as:

    ""The smartest people are men. The strongest people are men. It seems like women are average while men can excel or fail spectacularly.""

    ""I really want to be able to look at women as people but whenever I see a pretty woman in a nice car, I automatically assume someone bought it for her. When I see a woman out shopping, I wonder what her spouse does to afford her these privileges. ""

    ""The women in my life seem to support this hypothesis. I know some girls who are very smart, but they're not on the level of the smartest guys I know. I also know some girls who are very physically fit but once again they cant compare to the fit men I know and research agrees with both of these points. ""

They all pretty much sum up the most prevailing sexist ideas I have.

Now, I should clarify and explain why my reality is different from that of TyKillsTyGoT. I've lived all of my life in a very sexist country, (I'm not from the US, and although I'm sure they have their own issues with sexism, it is, by far, a lot less severe than that which my country has held with such determination) and my parents, siblings and other people close to me have been raised with a sexist ideology. This ideology can vary from the pettiest, smallest things like the situations I listed above, to more serious and aggressive behaviors such as a generalized violence against women in households, or forcing women to stay at home raising kids with no opportunity from their partners to seek financial independence.

I do not share or condone in any way, shape or form the latter. However, I do share a vast majority of the former, and they make me feel really immature, since I know those views aren't objectively true, and are nothing but product of generalization and blunt sexism. In all due honesty, most of the women in this country are not really doing much to change my ideas (I'm not saying that they have to, but rather that their behaviors reinforce all those sexist stereotypes, inevitably so, as we've all been raised inside a sexist nation), by either fitting the stereotypes almost perfectly or using their gender as a mean to get benefits or escape certain situations (such as the ""chivarly"" most, if not all, of them demand. Personally I think chivarly is based on the idea that women are weaker, and therefore a man must do the hard job for them).

I really want to open my mind and change the view this country has force-fed me with since childhood, so please reddit, CMV.

There are much more amazing fighters that have come and gone, and I think specifically the most damning part to Tyson's mystique is that he fought a bunch of tomato cans and didn't fight anyone of real quality during his prime.

When Tyson did fight quality opponents he lost or had his ass handed to him by Lewis and Holyfield.
A huge portion of the mystique is Mike Tyson's punch out. Many people who know fighting know Tyson was over rated. But a vast majority don't know, and only know how ""great"" he was because of his video game.

I think currently there are a couple active fighters that are better pound for pound guys. And I think Lennox Lewis was even a better champ than Tyson with a far better skill set.

So convince me that Tyson is the greatest ever, and not Ali,Frazier,Foreman,Louis, or Robinson. I could continue on with the list. I really think Tyson is over hyped, and was more of a sideshow with mental and personal problems than great fighter."	6	8

It is possible that they might keep the human race going but if they decided to wipe us out (humanely) I'd be okay with that.  They are the next step of our evolution, they are smarter than us in every way and keeping around our limited and flawed physical bodies seem unnecessary.

I'd rather live on the equator as compared to antartica.

A warmer earth will be caused by the trapping of heat which means that antartica should heat up faster than the equator as heat flows from the center of the earth and less goes into space.

So even if some land is overtaken by rising sea levels more land should be livable.


Now to be clear this is not an argument against attempting to slow down and eventually stop global warming.  My main argument is that today's temperature is not the best temperature and that the ""best"" temperature would be higher than it is today."	0	21

CMV.	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1zqrtm/for_the_sciences_a_masters_degree_is_considered_a/	"In the US, graduate science programs typically roll the master's degree into the phd program (ie, first 2 years is masters work, final 4 is phd). It is rare in the physics world, for example, to have a master's degree, as the jump typically goes from bachelor's to phd.

It's my view that in the professional world, people see master's degrees as failed phds and are worth as much. With the over-saturation of the job market by undergraduates, more and more employers are looking to those with graduate degrees for entry-level and internship-level positions. Yet, while a master's is technically considered a graduate degree, it is worthless for applying to graduate-level required education positions. This is because if an employer sets minimum requirements as a master's degree, that means a wide majority of those applying for the position will have phds.

Overseas in Europe, master's degrees in the sciences are more common, as they tend to be separate from the phd programs. In some cases, the master's degrees are rolled the opposite way into the undergraduate program, such that a 4 year undergrad program would include the master's courses and degree at the end. 

If a student from this background were applying for places that required minimum level master's degrees, they would be devalued by the flood of phds applying. On the other hand, if the master's degree holders were applying below their level, they would be cast aside from the fact that graduate-level degrees tend to demand higher wages than positions lower than that would support. Thus, for the sciences, a master's degree is too expensive for entry-level positions, yet too unqualified for positions at the graduate level, and thereby about as valuable as a failed phd."	0	9

The purpose of the website is so you can voice your concerns. If there's enough attention given by users to one concern, then someone will listen and respond. That's it. The White House has *never* indicated that any of these petitions would affect real policy. Never.

In fact, it's not that far from petitions have traditionally worked. Civil petitions are just a formal request and show of solidarity; on their own, they are rarely effective at directly influencing policy.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/20r97c/i_believe_that_it_is_in_the_strategic_best/	"1) The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. Negotiated by Ukraine, the US, the UK, and Russia in accordance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Ukraine should give up its nuclear arms in exchange for ""protection."" These ""protections"" specify to

&gt;Seek United Nations Security Council action if nuclear weapons are used against Ukraine.

&gt; and 

&gt;Consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments.

Though, the treaty does not specify any defensive pact between these powers and Ukraine if the country is invaded or threatened militarily, I still believe that it would be in the best interests of the US to treat the Budapest Memorandum as one. Due to the nature of the agreement, with vague assurances of protection in exchange for complete nuclear proliferation of the country, it would set a terrible precedent for future nuclear proliferation negotiations with countries who have just developed their nuclear arms if Ukraine is so easily attacked with close to no assistance from other powers whatsoever. Though, the Budapest Memorandum does not guarantee protection from nuclear powers, it will be interpreted as such by politicians in countries seeking nuclear weapons. Negotiations would be increasingly  difficult if they cannot guarantee protection from larger powers if they were to be attacked like Ukraine. 

2) It sets another terrible precedent of justifying foreign invasion based on a protection of ethnic [insert people of invading country here], and also a precedent of invasions and annexations without consequence. Without western response, more countries may consider it justified to invade or annex parts of weaker destabilized countries using this very excuse. A US/NATO military response may ensure that other countries seeking to invade and annex their neighboring countries could not do so without a consequence of US/NATO retaliation. Though, they may seek some other equally trumped up justification, the mere show of force in Ukraine in response to an invading force may as well deter many similar situations in the future.

3) It will weaken Russia internationally, and possibly gain the US new allies and new NATO members. A military defeat of the Russian military by US/NATO forces will definitely weaken Russia's influence regionally, and globally. Syria would possibly lose most of their support from their biggest ally, and the Russian international prestige and economy would undoubtedly be extremely weakened by their reputation in the war. Ex-Soviet states both in Eastern Europe, and Central Asia may see the threat of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to be possibly threatening to their sovereignty in the future, as well as the US' integrity in defending their allies, and other invaded nations as an assurance to their security if they joined NATO. Ukraine is definitely going to join NATO, and nobody wants to be the second Ukraine in this situation, so many of them may immediately apply for membership.

4) Diplomacy has failed, and I do not believe that the Russians will back away from the Crimea and respect Ukraine's sovereignty within its current borders with anything short of military force. I believe that sanctions would be completely ineffective to solve the current issue at hand. Even if they did hurt Russia's economy in the long run, Crimea would be long a part of Russia, and no amount of economic downturn would ever make the Russians give up that territory. 

**Why I believe US military intervention would be relatively non-disastrous.**

1) People keep saying ""Russia's a nuclear power. Its going to be WW3. Nuclear holocaust"" etc. I do not believe that anyone is stupid enough to escalate a regional conflict into a full scale nuclear war even if the US decides to intervene. No one is going to throw nukes at each other, not tactically or otherwise, the concept of MAD still exists. The only possibility of Russia using a nuke is 1) NATO forces have capture Moscow, and Russia is on the brink of total defeat, or 2) In retaliation to an enemy nuclear strike. Neither of these situations are going to happen in a regional conventional war between the US and Russia.

2) People say ""This is going to be another Iraq/Afghan war. We don't want to spend another 3 trillion dollars on another war."" Although, an intervention would cost some money, it won't be nearly as expensive as the Iraq and Afghan wars. With clear objectives to defend a country against a foreign invader, and not to invade a country to topple their government, a US military intervention would look similar to the Gulf War on a larger scale. 

3) ""Europe depends on Russian oil, so the Russians have the EU by the balls."" Currently, Russian oil makes up about 32.6% of total oil imports in the EU, and undoubtedly the EU will suffer from slight oil shortages in the short term. However, the US, Canada, and Saudi Arabia could use this opportunity to establish themselves as primary providers of oil to Europe. In the long term, the massive European oil market would benefit theses countries greatly, and the EU has just made itself energy independent from a major geo-political enemy. Slight price controlled exports of oil to Europe may be needed to alleviate shortages in the short run, but ultimately all of these countries would benefit from having Europe energy independent from Russia.

The first is the clothing industry. From pants to shoes to shirts, sizing is incredibly varied. I bought a pair of Dockers corduroys in size 32x30 and they fit me very nicely, meanwhile a pair of Levi 505 I am now in size 34x32. The same goes with shoes, I have three pairs ranging from size 9.5 to 11. I feel that all jeans should be measured in inches starting with the button placement and ending with the furthest edge of the button hole. I feel that shoes should be sized by inches. This isn't limited to pants and shoes, but I tend to find that they are the worst offenders when it comes to sizing discrepancies.

The second is the hair industry. My girlfriend is licensed to cut hair in New Jersey, but unfortunately each state handles their regulations differently. She can not go over the state line and cut hair, for instance. I feel that the hair industry should get together and create a nationwide standardization of the test and allow for the license to be nationwide.

TL:DR I feel that some industries could benefit from nationwide standardization/

The globe is surveilled every second. I read my license plate from a Google maps view of my house. The NSA has the power to read every piece of digital communication we send... and yet a plane full of people with phones went missing. That cannot be. 
I just don't understand how a plane can go missing. If they get any information at all from the black box, won't that lead them right to it? If the NSA can read my texts and track my phone, can't someone track the phones of the people on the plane? There is 1000 ways for my government to spy on me. When the boston bomber went missing the swat team used heat seeking technology to find him hiding in a boat in someone's back yard. And somehow a $50 million plane disappeared into thin air. With no crash evidence... no nothing.

Something is up. Not sure what, but somebody is up to something.

To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a likely biased entity handling something that is supposed to be assessed with absolutely no bias whatsoever. It goes without saying, no matter how subtle the influence, government funded science is always funded by people with either militaristic and/or political objectives. 

I want to approach the climate change issue specifically; there are abundant examples of people in science who disagree with man-made climate change, why are these people frequently considered irrelevant by most EPA-like government organizations?

Let's give a scenario: you graduated college, got a decent $50k a year job and you live with your SO who makes around the same. Uh oh, student loans from college start to haunt you now, as well as car insurance, debt, mortgage, and maybe a dozen other things piling on top of that. Really the only way that you could ""fix"" this is by paying for it with money. 

And let's say that they somehow get a lot of money. And let's say they live in a world where there isn't really a tax or anything (think simple). They pay off all their debts and ironically all their money from that was the exact amount to pay everything off. They live much happier than before. 

And now you see how money buys happiness. It's true. Money does buy happiness. There are so many situations where money will solve your problems. I'm not trying to say how it's the only cause of happiness: there are things that can make people happy without the use of money, but generally if you have money it'll make you happier. I know that many people with tons of money are also depressed, but when you get a middle aged mid income family paying off all their debts and still being mid income, they are happy. Why? Because money.

Let me start by saying I think most Americans' POV change with the wind. In 2008, All the democratic presidential candidates ran on the platform of ""end the war in iraq, finish the war in afghanistan."" Everyone was on board. No everyone wants to end it immediately and a lot of people think it was a bad idea to begin with. I saw a post on here listing the war in Afghanistan was a negative reaction to 9/11. What were we supposed to do, just let al queida flourish in the region?




I don't think hardly anyone was against the war in Afghanistan when it started. The people that attacked us were in Afghanistan and the government there at that time was not capable of doing anything about it. That was not made up. They attack us first, we attack them back. That's defense, not offense. 


The reason the war was a mess was because it was led by George Bush. We stomped Al Queida, but upon invading iraq, they flourished again. Now fast forward 13 years... the war at this point is accomplishing nothing. Bush and Cheney should get the death penalty but that's a whole nother CMV post.

But anyways, if we had not invaded Iraq, we may have completely obliterated al Quieda at least in the region.  That was a worthy mission and if we had stuck to it, it would have worked.

While I think they may be causally responsible for it - their culpability is a different question altogether. 

Many of the behaviours which increase the chances of rape are very enjoyable including but not limited to

1) Drinking

2) Having sex

3) Partying

4) Pushing social boundaries

These are social practices which people like to involve themselves in, even if they increase their chances of being raped. 

I think this is reasonable, and most people would like social sanction for involvement in these activities without a negative judgement of ""asking for it"", even if they did increase their chances of being raped. 

And this is entirely separate from the danger of being raped even without involving yourself in activities which increase your chance of being raped. 


On the other hand - people treat theft more casually. 

As a society - we have come to believe that the onus is on the person who owns a property to secure it, and we are also more cavalier towards theft. 

""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" is a phrase reflective of that philosophy. 

I've known people who have shoplifted once or twice. A pack of gum here, a cola there. 

Now imagine if there was a society where people left their doors unlocked and were generally not afraid of theft. 

This is viable in small communities, and I have seen it in poorer areas like slums where people have little and for people with so little - theft is a graver sin than it would seem for most. 


Now if there was a theft in such a community - the reaction could be one where the person who was stolen from could be blamed . After all - they *were* causally responsible. This would lead to more people locking their stuff, and it is not clear to me that it is a better situation because the members of this community likely enjoyed the feeling of trust, and leaving their things unsecured.

The alternative would be developing strong attitudes toward theft (as one of the worse things you can do) - which is typically how these communities tend to work. 

Victim blaming with rape would mean adopting the former attitude rather than the latter, and comes at the cost of losing social sanction for certain events

Especially in the cases of partying, dressing ""provocatively"", and casual sex - these are behaviours which have - for a long time carried a negative value judgement, especially for women. 

So I do think that victims of rape can be causally responsible for their rape, but they shouldn't be blamed in spite of it. 

Edit: To be clear I am saying that how much a victim could have mitigated their risk is not relevant. We ought not to treat rape like theft. 


Edit 2: 


I've seen a lot of responses talking about how much can are responsible. I think this is an unproductive argument. 

If I insult someone's mother and they punch my face, am I responsible? I would say I definitely ""had it coming"" (circumstantially, of course).

People do account for other people's behaviours all the time. 

I don't think it is particularly important how much I caused something to happen in the cause of rape, while it pertinent in the case of punching someone in the face.

But, like all things, democracy should be tempered with wisdom. There are already requirements to vote; being an adult, being a citizen, not being a felon (in some cases). I think that, in order to vote, you should have to prove that you have the interests of society at least partly in mind. In the book starship troopers (which is on the recommended reading list for the navy....weird much?), you have to serve society in a real, tangible way in order to vote. In the book, it's referred to as ""federal service"". In real life, I think the Swiss have it (mostly) figured out: mandatory military service (but for men only, which is why I said ""mostly""). But for those unwilling or unable to perform military service, perhaps other public service for, say, two years; work as a 911 operator, or even for public works. But have a job assigned to you and serve the people, to prove you're not totally selfish.

Thus, the voting body is made up of people who are provable capable of giving of themselves for others. No other rights or privileges would separate the voters from the nonvoters. 

As an added bonus, if we did mandatory military service, we could have an unbelievable state of military readiness in this country. Imagine if even 50 percent of all our people were armed and had combat training. The military would be massive, but could serve a lot of functions; municipal construction, disaster response, even things as mundane as sorting recycling. Believe me, the military already does a lot of mundane stuff. Imagine a country where everyone that chose to serve would be trained and equipped to serve their country, and every person that voted would have proven that they had the best interests of society at heart.

They put their pleasures over the risk of having a child and having it terminated. 

I feel as though, when the sperm and egg mix, they create a completely new set of DNA, DNA that has never been the same in the entire history of our species and is a completely unique person (I'm not Theist, I try to base my arguments on the uniqueness of each person)

I don't see any way for someone to justify abortion when it is the result of sex without contraception. That woman simply did not care that new life was created within her, and chose to have sex in the first place. We argue it's a woman's choice for abortion? No, It's a woman's choice to have sex without the means of contraception.

The result will be something resembling the fall of the Roman Empire, but on a larger spatial scale (most of the earth, if not all of it).

A) Global warming exists, is snowballing out of control, and very little is being done in terms of future damage control. Notice that I did not say ""to stop it"": an integral part of my belief is that global warming is past the point of being stopped, and that we are already destined for disastrous consequences. We are not adequately preparing for these consequences, we are essentially ignoring them.

B) Wealth inequality is at an all time high, and another great depression looms. The most powerful economies in the world are controlled by a small subset of insanely rich companies/individuals, which are not concerned with the welfare of the common citizen in a great enough way to be meaningful. We did not fix the problems that caused the economic crisis beginning ~2008, and if anything they have become worse, placing more money in the hands of individuals that are too self-interested to spend it well. This leads to my next point...

C) Dissatisfaction with the status quo (amongst the middle and lower classes, especially on the international scale) is at an all-time high. I am not talking about the dissatisfaction of ""first world problems,"" but of the violence exhibited by terrorist organizations (Boko Haram being the most recent and startling example). The hegemonic economy of the USA and its allies has been in place for too long, holding down smaller and poorer countries to the point where the damage is done. There is enough hate for the ""Western World"" to destroy it, should the correct opportunity arise. This also pertains to the most economically suppressed/oppressed in the USA, Mexico and Canada, drug cartels, street gangs and the like.

D) We are overdue for a severe plague. This point is related to point A: increasing occurence of natural disasters and destruction of infrastructure will lead to an outbreak of an already virulent and drug-resistant strain of TB, influenza (H5N1, etc.), or some other disease (ebola, malaria).

Together, I think these factors present a grim case for continuance of an industrial/scientific global community. 

I might also add point E: nuclear war. I don't think mutually assured destruction is *likely* to play out, but the possibility always exists, at which point we not only face societal collapse but the end of the human race.

So please... CMV?

edit: These are a lot of points, so I'll name the two that I think are the most threatening, those being A and B. D is also very threatening, but I think the possibility of enacting damage control and quaratines can save a large part of (at least, the industrialized) world."	8	15

I think homeless spikes should be removed. I believe you will always have rough sleepers (although we could probably drastically reduce the amount in the UK) and as such should not introduce such measures.

I just don’t get the justification.

EDIT: Anybody who wants can sleep in my garden, or outside my house. If I didn't live with someone else who'd be worried about getting his stuff pinched I'd let anybody who asked sleep in my house, although I wouldn't let them have my room n I'd keep the door locked. There is very little to steal that I own.

I've never owned a car, never will, I just cannot justify it morally because of the environmental damage they cause. If I did own one I would let people sleep in it.

I do see a massive difference between putting spikes in what is a pubic place (regardless of who 'owns' it) and not letting homeless people sleep in your house though. I think it's moot.

Right now, a grand jury only considers the accuser's side of the story, and so this creates a hair-trigger situation where if anyone makes a convincing accusation against you, the police will come out to your house and grab you and drag you off to jail, and there is nothing you can say or do about it.  And then several weeks or months later, you show up in court wearing shackles, guilty until proven innocent. 

I believe taking away a US citizen's hard-won freedom should be considered a big deal and should require a fair trial where a court listens to both sides of the story and gives the citizen a chance to defend themselves from the accusation. 

 The only exceptions I would make would be with a serial killer or any type of active combatant, or someone who already has a history of moving around and changing their identity, or in the cases of obvious guilt where it wouldn't matter what the person had to say anyway.

 
Example:  Kim Dotcom, a citizen of New Zealand was advised by his attorneys that his website was in compliance with US laws, and genuinely believed he would prevail against any type of indictment or lawsuit.  Yet US prosecutors were able to snatch him up like a wild animal and put him in a cage, and freeze all his assets. That's how the system works right now, everything is based on the accuser's one-sided testimony to the grand jury.

Let's have a look at Stannis' competition:

- Dany

A young girl with little experience ruling, the Westerosi equivalent of nukes, and a tenuous grip on sanity. She's female, her father went power crazy and started killing people, she can't control her dragons, and her army is made up of slaves. It should come as no surprise that the nobles of Westeros won't exactly welcome her with open arms, forcing her to stage an invasion just to get close to ruling. Not to mention she's infertile, so when she dies there will be yet more drama over who succeeds her. Unstable would be the best way to describe both her rule, and Dany herself.

- 
[Spoiler](/s ""Aegon."")

[spoiler](/s ""Having been raised to rule, and claiming to be the son of Rhaegar, who was much more popular and much less insane than this father, he would have a much easier time of convincing various Lords to his side. However, there's a good chance that he isn't who he claims he is, and his army is made up of sellswords, only a fraction of which actually made it to Westeros. Plus he hangs around with a Greyscale victim who might inadvertently infect him."")

- Tommen

A puppet ruler. controlled by his mother. Although getting him onto the Iron Throne would be no problem, since he already has it, keeping him on it is another thing entirely. If Cersei doesn't singlehandedly destroy the dynasty, the yes men she put on the Small Council will. Confidence in him is very low, since the tale of Tommen's parentage has also been spread far and wide, and though many people don't believe it, everyone knows it.

- Myrcella

Free from her mother's influence, and rightful queen under Dornish law, Myrcella would make a much stronger ruler than Tommen. However, her claim is under Dornish law only, so for her to be recognised by the rest of the realm Tommen would have to die. She's strong-willed, but I doubt that she would go along with killing her own brother. [Spoiler](/s ""It is doubtful that even Dorne would support her fully, since they are also likely to back Aegon.""). There is also the whole incest thing to contend with.

- Jon Snow

If R+L=J is true, then Jon would also have a claim on the throne. He would be backed by the North, due to his Stark blood, and has [Spoiler](/s ""experience as a leader from being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.""). However, since he is a part of the Night's Watch, his oaths would forbid him from ruling.  Even if he were to escape his vows somehow, and if R+L=J turns out to be true, he would still be a bastard. His claim would be very weak. [Spoiler](/s ""He also might be dead."")

There are very few other real contenders for the throne. Gendry would have to find proof of his parentage, would still have a very weak claim, and would probably be just as bad a ruler as Robert. Rickon could become King in the North, but he's a child and believed dead. People seem to think that Sansa will become queen with Littlefinger backing her, but that involves trusting Littlefinger. Almost all of the various ""x is a secret Targ"" theories are stupid.

Compare those with Stannis the Mannis. He is an experienced leader, commander, and king. He rewards people based on merit rather than birth, and hates brown-nosers. He prefers to act based on honor, but will not let it bind him when the stakes are higher. He leaps to defend the realm from the Others rather than continuing to squabble over the throne. He actually is the rightful king of Westeros. He has Melisandre, who can do legit magic, and a good chunk of the realm already recognises him as king, so he doesn't have to climb over a mountain of corpses to get to the throne.

Change my view.

That's why i say that trying to prolong life is absolutely useless. This includes tries to reanimate dying people, trying to find a special formula for immortality, and similar medical/engineering advances.

Instead of finding ways to prolong life, we could better spend resources to make the life we've got more pleasurable.

This is not motivated by a hatred or disdain for the image of people considered overweight or obese - some people would still appear to be overweight due to genetic and environmental factors, as well as the possibility for lack of exercise - and should not be considered a ""the world would be better without fat people"" opinion. The world would be better if we could learn to eat primarily for sustenance instead of pleasure. [Being overweight has been identified as a cause of cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight#Health_effects), and is projected to overtake smoking as the primary cause of cancer in developed countries as cases of cancer linked to smoking dwindle. Our health and finances would greatly improve.

We would reduce the amount of environmental damage that is caused by the agricultural industries as well, preserving land and water and creating a culture that could more easily foster eco-friendly practices and biodiversity.

The only people not expected to take appetite suppressants would be those whose RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) was below normal.

I think given the social costs of drinking, particularly drunk driving and alcoholism, we would be better off raising them to better compensate for those costs, as a [pigouvian tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax).  We could lower other taxes to compensate, or not.  My view is not about the optimal level of overall taxation.

**The Numbers**

I'm going to just use hard liquor numbers because it's easier to get the tax rate per unit of ethanol.

Federally, a proof gallon is taxed [$13.50](http://www.ttb.gov/tax_audit/atftaxes.shtml), which equates to $27 per gallon of pure ethanol for human consumption.  At 0.6 fl oz per standard drink and 128 fl oz per gallon, that's about 12.6 cents per drink.  [State taxes](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=349) vary, but  on the whole bring it up to maybe 16 to 20 cents per drink.

[This study](http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797\(11\)00538-1/fulltext) ascribes a very high economic cost to alcohol consumption, and particularly to rapid consumption.  I don't know if their economic cost numbers are fully accurate, but it seems to support the hypothesis that there is a large cost, and that the cost comes in particular from people who consume a lot of alcohol.

So why shouldn't the total tax on alcohol go up to something like $100 per gallon of ethanol?

If a player has done something exceptional, they should be allowed to celebrate as they wish as long as: A) they don't aggress upon a player on the other team (which is taunting) and B) the celebration doesn't run on for a ridiculous amount of time. These celebrations are fun bits of creativity and flair that allow the players to express their personality and ingenuity and make the game much more fun to watch.

A counterargument that I already foresee: What kind of example does that set for kids?

My answer: Actually a pretty good one. For one, there is a major difference between celebrating and taunting that even a child can understand: one is mean, and any four year old could make that distinction. But celebrations are a big part of why I played football, basketball, baseball, etc. as a kid. The batflip after a homerun, thumping my chest like Paul Pierce after nailing an improbable three: it teaches them to strive to be the best that they can be and to be happy when they succeed. Celebration of one's good deeds is a very good trait to have.

That's my view. Change my view, Reddit! Or else, Goodell will be getting a sternly worded letter from me.

Now we have sayings like ""that will happen as soon as there is peace in the middle east"" to say something is impossible. I'm struggling with racist tendencies. Racist might not be the right word, maybe its a combination of theologism(I don't think that's a word, but you know that I mean) and racism. I understand that not all Arabic Muslims want my head on a platter, but enough do to constantly have struggles over there. With the release of this newest beheading, I think we need to basically recolonize the middle east. We divide up the countries from Turkey to Iraq, which then means we have a solid oil source not dependent on Russia, Palestine and Israel are forced to share space and live peacefully, ""radical Islam"" is for the most part stamped out and frowned upon, and the young people of those states can now grow up in a stabilized home where they can develop other skills besides learning guerrilla warfare. The only downside I see with this is Russia stepping in, but I'm sure there is a solution to be found. "	0	34

Both of us had the book read to us as children and my wife now reads it to our 2 year old. I can't stand this book. I believe it to be the personification of entitlement. For those unfamiliar, a tree (most likely signifying parents) provides a boy with anything he needs until he takes everything the tree can give leaving only the stump. The boy is absent when he doesn't want things and openly complains about what the tree offers. There is no thanks given by the boy at anytime and no acknowledgement that he is damaging the tree beyond repair. 

I get the notions of self sacrifice that go into being a parent. I understand that I would probably do the same to make sure my own child lived a happy life. But I don't want to encourage this notion of desecration without though for stewardship or appreciation for the gifts being given.

Please change my mind so I can stop fighting with my wife.

I don't think there's any reason to divide them by gender. By equipment, they're identical I believe it's pretty uncommon for them to have urinals. Frequently the women's restroom will have a short line I have to wait in, while the men's stall is completely unoccupied. Occasionally I'll jump the line and use the men's restroom anyway, but people will give you strange looks. I've had men point out that they could not so easily do the same thing if there were a line at the men's room, and I think that's a really good point. If a business wants to provide a baby changing table, they could simply install one and mark it on the door avoiding the issue of either paying for two or only installing one in the women's room and leaving dads with infants out of luck. It's also beneficial to trans individuals who may feel uncomfortable using a gendered restroom.

I really can't think of any reason why this isn't more frequently seen. CMV!

Edit: Two counterpoints in response to common arguments:

1. From a management bathroom cleaning point of view, a unisex bathroom could be an advantage. Let's say a women's bathroom dirties by 10 dirt units every hour, the men's restroom by 8 dirt units every hour, and the restrooms are cleaned every 4 hours. That means you're more likely to get a customer complaint and have an employee need to go clean the women's room in hour 3, wasting some time. If you have unisex bathrooms it would even out and they each dirty at 9 units per hour, so it's easier to keep them both equally clean.

2. It doesn't make good business sense to have anyone tied up in a line. If there are 3 women waiting to pee and the men's stall is free, I don't want those women waiting around I want them browsing my store, paying the bill and freeing up a table, getting to their movie, etc. This argument also only favors men.

Edit 2: For all the talk of how terrifying women's bathrooms apparently are, I now feel like a hardened bad ass for using them all these years."	1007	478	
4855832	changemyview	154930043	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/2k8osb/cmv_i_believe_that_cannabis_is_an_objectively/	2014-10-24 22:54:14		ProjectGO	CMV: I believe that cannabis is an objectively better substance for recreational use than alcohol	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2k8osb/cmv_i_believe_that_cannabis_is_an_objectively/	"*(Note: I will be using the term cannabis instead of marijuana, weed, or pot, since that is the proper name for the plant and does not carry slang or propaganda connotations like the other common terms do. Also, for the purposes of the CMV cannabis consumption refers to the inhalation of smoke from burning cannabis buds, as opposed to more exotic methods of consumption.)*

As an adult of legal age in Washington state, I am allowed to purchase cannabis from a government-licensed store and consume it in my own house. For the purpose of this CMV, let's assume others have similar rights such that legality is not a concern.

The known effect (and implicit goal) of drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis is to temporarily alter the brain's chemistry to produce enjoyable sensations. By almost every metric I can think of, cannabis is a superior substance to use to achieve this goal.

* **Safety:** Alcohol poisoning, alcohol related organ failures, and intoxicated accidents kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. Very drunk people are known to become violent, emotional, and dangerous to themselves and others. Cannabis's effects are caused by THC, which is very nontoxic to ingest. The amount of THC required to overdose and die from cannabis use is literally impossible to consume quickly enough to maintain a fatal saturation. Studies have shown that [cannabis use does not lead to more driving accidents](http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence) and the most common effect of driving high in simulator tests is reduced speed. (Still, don't drive impaired, regardless of what you're using). I can only speak from anecdotal evidence, but I have never seen cannabis cause an aggressive or violent reaction in the user.

* **Controlled intoxication:** Consuming alcohol with a specific level of intoxication in mind (other than blackout drunk) is a challenging task. Variations in drink strength and methods of consumption can make it harder to judge one's level of intoxication, and the timing and order of consumption plays a significant role in how the alcohol affects the body and how enjoyable the experience is. The duration of alcohol intoxication is usually many hours, which generally means that by consuming alcohol the drinker has implicitly accepted that they will not be safely able to do certain tasks or make certain decisions for the remainder of the day/night. Cannabis, especially state regulated cannabis, comes with detailed information regarding THC content and the heredity of the specific plant being consumed. This allows the user to tailor their cannabis experience to achieve or avoid specific effects, and with some planning (although no more than counting your drinks) accurately control the length and intensity of their cannabis intoxication. The duration of intoxication from smoking cannabis is typically shorter than that of consuming alcohol, and leaves the user capable of functioning normally with few ill effect after use.

* **Effects:** Alcohol generally lowers the inhibitions, impairs the judgement, and increases the volume of the person consuming it. Heavy consumption can lead to loss of motor control, disorientation, blackouts, and alcohol poisoning. The effects of cannabis depend largely on the genetics of the plant in question, and can be carefully tailored by growers to induce a specific intoxicating effect. Plants from the species *Cannabis Indica* tend to cause feelings of calm, drowsiness, and relaxation. Plants from the species *Cannabis Sativa* tend to cause uplifting, energetic, or cerebral effects. Excessive consumption of cannabis may lead to dizziness, paranoia, or 'couch-lock', but there are no chemically harmful effects (such as alcohol poisoning).

* **Aftermath:** Hangovers suck. Waking up and feeling like you just want to trow up and die is no fun at all. Cannabis has negligible aftereffects, and (anecdotally again) cannabis use after heavy alcohol consumption significantly reduces the pain of the next morning's hangover. Alcohol and alcohol byproducts remain in the body for 1-2 days at most after intoxicating effects have ceased. Cannabis byproducts remain in the bloodstream and urine for 2-6 weeks depending on frequency of use and body type, and can be detected in hair samples far beyond that.

* **Price:** In Washington, lower-end state-regulated liquor sells for around $35 per 1.75 liters. This converts to about $1 per shot, which is on par with roughly $1 a beer when buying from a grocery store. Assuming consumption of 6 drinks in a night, the at-home cost is $6. At a bar, event, or stadium, drink prices are significantly more expensive, and 6 drinks (including tips) can quickly surpass $50. At current prices (which are expected to fall as supply and demand balance out) you can purchase 2 grams of high-potency cannabis from a regulated store for $60. Calculating an equivalent scale of grams of cannabis per drink is a difficult task, but by my math (2g can make 4 0.5g bowls which can each get 3 people to the equivalent intoxication of 5 drinks) it still comes out to roughly $1 per drink equivalent. Bulk cannabis from a medical co-op is much less expensive ($250 per oz = 28g), and lowers the price to $0.30 per drink equivalent.

* **Social acceptance:** Alcohol wins this one hands down. In adulthood, someone who doesn't consume alcohol occasionally is considered the exception rather than the norm. Cannabis is still widely seen in the connotations of ""dope for hippies and stoners"", and cannabis use is not considered a suitable topic for discussion the way alcohol use is. Much of modern nightlife is centered around going out and consuming alcohol socially, and there is no equivalent cannabis culture yet. For younger audiences there are a wide range of drinking games played socially with alcohol, but few (if any) social games revolving around cannabis consumption.

In short, I believe that cannabis is objectively superior to alcohol in terms of achieving a state of recreational intoxication. By the metrics I have stated, I feel that cannabis is the superior substance in all cases except social acceptance, and that is a nebulous metric that is subject to change and unrelated to the effects that either substance has on the user. 

The best way to CMV would be to point out one or more metrics I have not considered where alcohol is preferable to cannabis, or show that my logic in assessing the metrics I have used is incorrect. The goal of this CMV is not to start an argument between 'stoners' and 'teetotalers', but rather to objectively compare two intoxicating substances on their merits and drawbacks.

**TL;DR:** All things considered, I'd rather get intoxicated on cannabis than on alcohol.

I don't think this campaign stands justified on it's own for several reasons.

1.) It assumes 100% of people don't want to work on Thanksgiving, and is a discredit to the people who do want to work as a minority.

2.) It assumes everyone celebrates Thanksgiving or has someone to celebrate it with. For some people this can be just another day as any other, and so the holiday inconveniences these folks at the very least.

3.) Tearing away those two things, It also may not get in the way of the holiday for the people who do and want to celebrate for them to work, and they get some nifty or needed holiday pay for their trouble meaning that it's not always a net negative for people that do have to work.

To conclude, the campaigning not to shop on Thanksgiving is not necessarily inherently righteous or positive, and from a moral standpoint might even be negatively affecting the lives of certain people if it gains any ground with the general public.

I can understand cis-, trans-, and a-genders. Why does there need to be demisexual and demiromantic and all that? Why do we need so many classifications of gender and sexuality? If you're attracted to the same sex, why can't you just be homosexual? If you're attracted to the opposite why can't you just be heterosexual? If you're attracted to both, why can't you be bisexual? Attracted to all? You're pansexual.
Keep it simple.

Also, I understand people getting offended and angry when they're misgendered, but getting angry doesn't really accomplish anything unless you can be calm in your education on the subject. Hating people for not calling you by your preferred pronouns the first time when they've never met you before is not going to accomplish anything. Hating cisgendered, heterosexual people will not accomplish anything. 

Please change my view.

3. There is no good alternative. The employee could request to work less, but that could result in less money and conflicts with employer. They could look for another job, but that's unrealistic; jobs are hard to come by, and leaving a job could leave a person unemployed for a prolonged time.

I understand that an SO/spouse working a lot can be upsetting, but saying you're mad or upset at someone for being a workaholic seems unfair. CMV!

His messages are not unique, in fact they are rather common knowledge, except for the few clever sayings that are attributed to him. Feed the poor, don't let your heart be consumed with wealth and material goods, believe in a higher power, do unto others what you want others to do to you etc. are all common sayings that were preached by hundreds of sages before and after the life and death of Jesus. 

I think of Jesus as being another charismatic figure whose death or martyrdom was made into a legend by his followers in order to legitimize Christendom. I mean what other fashion can you justify genocide, bigotry and forced conversion other than proclaiming that your message is about peace and love? This sort of doublethink astounds me.

I have, over the last little while, gone from feeling that essentially unregulated and uncensored activity on the internet is a good thing, to believing the opposite. Here are my reasons, though not in a particularly lucid or well-structured form. Also, I understand that the gap between principle and practicality is vast, so I offer my points only as ethical ones.

Libel: Essentially the internet is a publishing platform. If a newspaper or other media outlet has to obey the laws of libel and defamation, should an individual who is publishing things publicly not have to do the same? As an example, earlier I read a comment in a thread about Ted Nugent. The comment made a fairly strong statement regarding his sexual preferences. If this was on TV or in a newspaper, the outlet would be in seriously dodgy territory. In this case, an anonymous person can say anything and gets to live by different rules, despite the intention being to publish their view for worldwide public consumption. I think this is wrong.

Data protection: Despite the above, I think companies should be extremely limited regarding what data they are allowed to store about people. The fact that millions of lines of code in various places churn through my online activity and that Google, Amazon, etc. have a virtual model of me should not be allowed. For example, Amazon should not be allowed to record the history of what I browse. I see this as akin to having a shop assistant follow you round a store with a camcorder as you browse and believe that companies who do this should be heavily prosecuted.

Piracy: I understand that the issue of piracy is a complex one, but I feel that a growing attitude treats all information in digital form as almost a right. I think this is wrong, and that all copyright laws should be equal regardless of whether someone sells fake DVDs from their car boot, or runs a torrenting site. I believe that Google should not list any sits that link to illegal copyright infringement, and that they are complicit in the violations of law.

Now, I understand that there are a great deal of complicated parts of this, especially when it comes to things like expressing dissident political views, government surveillance, etc. and I know how ill-formed my point is. I suppose that by offering these views for criticism and rebuttal I want help clarifying what I truly think.

TLDR: Unregulated, anonymous activity that is largely without personal consequence is not a good thing. People should be as liable for what they do online as if they did it on TV or in the middle of the street. 

Edit 1: let me be explicit in saying that I am not claiming innocence of any of these things, but that recently I have been asking myself ethical questions and an uncomfortable with answers I find myself giving, and my beliefs are changing because of it.

Edit 2: I have to go out for the rest of the night, but I will reply tomorrow and give more thought to all points made. Thanks for taking the time to reply, I already have a lot of food for thought.

Almost none of his comics were actually relevant or topical in any way.  They were basically just shock-jock level of ""oh hey look how insulting I can be, come at me bro.""  If he hadn't just been killed by a terrorist, this was basically 4chan level of trolling. Not even that really. 

""I don't have a wife or children or credit"" etc, sure that applies to him, but not the other people killed. And, frankly, his comics were awful, pure 100% trolling, but now they're ""genius"" because he's dead."	4	13

They are L: -9.5, R: -9.0. This means that I can't function without my glasses or contacts– for all intents and purposes I'm blind without them. As an active rock climber and runner, I'd find replacing my contacts (which I hate) convenient, but have my skepticisms.

I've been hesitant to indulge because most LASEK surgeries will cost $2500/eye, according multiple evaluations at 4 different laser surgery centers. My insurance will only pay for 15% (pre-tax $). I'm saving up to go to MBA in about 4 years, and am not sure getting LASEK now would be a wise investment.

I'm also hesitant because I've heard anecdotes from friends who've had LASEK (not LASIK) that, about 2 months~1 year after their surgery, they went from an average 1.0/1.0 back down to about 0.2/0.3 ish. Still pretty damn good, but makes me suspicious about the quality of the treatment.

I've heard that people experience dry eyes constantly, and am afraid that it may imply bigger problems when I get old.

Lastly, I heard LASEK (not LASIK) hurts like a mother the first day or two.

Businesses stay open later, friends can reach us with a portable device simply by typing on a mini keyboard. It doesn't make sense that public transportation isn't 24/7. Here are some reasons why it should be 24/7:

1. Very few buses run at 2 am for last call, I feel like if nothing else, running buses later let's responsible drunk people take public transit instead of driving home. 

2. It would benefit the working poor who may work night shift 

3. As mentioned before our world is now 24/7 

Those are my arguments. 

I encourage you all to change my view 

Edit: by transit I am including trains, buses, all forms of public transportation, not just buses.

People rush to defend their religion, and think of other's religion as inferior. People are fighting wars sorely on the basis of religion, and the recent Charlie Hebdo massacre was done on the grounds of religion.

I am here with an alternate proposal: That of no religion at all, aka atheism. Of course, I don't mean eradication of Religion. That would be impossible. I am just saying that a world without religion would be a world with less conflicts.

One may pose the argument that the institution of religion unites people under a single umbrella, but that ship has passed. There are too many sects, too many divisions too many views for this to be effective. If one is not driven by religion, there would be less chances of conflicts. I don't mean no conflicts at all. 

Conflicts are bound to happen, but religious conflicts are one of the major factors. So why not remove religion from the equation and unlock a more peaceful world?"	2	63

I am in no way saying that Chrome is technologically superior or anything of that nature, it's just.... well..... *better*.

# My reasons

* **Chrome is more secure**
 * as far as I can tell, this is basically undeniable fact. Tab sandboxing being the most obvious feature, but there also hasn't been an vital exploit (that I'm aware of) in years
* **Better technology support**
 * I haven't checked in a while, but Chrome always seems the fastest to adopt new technologies, which is great as both a consumer and a developer
* **Ease-of-use**
 * As an end-user, this one is key. I install Chrome, I'm good to go. Get an Android phone with Chrome; Log in on both, now everything is synced. Want to see currently opened tabs? Great. It's just so simple and streamlined. (Coincidentally I'm a Linux user who hates Apple for the exact reason of making things ""just work"")
* **Chrome Apps/Extensions**
 * From what I can tell, Chrome has a lot more people developing for it's web store, while Firefox's add-ons site is dated and minimally supported. Also, from what I understand, Firefox completely lacks any ""Apps"" and while I understand why not everyone can agree that this is an inherent con, I regularly use apps such as SSH, VNC, Google Play Music (for the mini player), and Hangouts.
* **Development**
 * I know FF has a lot of developer tools, as does Chrome. I honestly haven't used FF for development in years, so I have no basis as to which is better.

Whichever team has the most goals after both games (called the ""aggregate"" score) advances. For example, if team A beats team B 2-0 in the first leg and then loses 0-1 in the second, team A will advance on 2-1 aggregate.

In the event of a tied aggregate after both games, the ""away goals"" rule is used. Whichever team scored more goals at the other team's stadium advances. So if team A wins 1-0 at home and loses 2-1 on the road, they will advance even though the aggregate is 2-2.

I believe this is a silly way to break a tie. It would make much more sense to play a 30 minute overtime if the aggregate was tied after the second leg, followed by a shootout if necessary. This would be a much more dramatic and less arbitrary way of breaking a tie.

The term ""white trash"" or ""trailer trash"" fits all the criteria for being a slur which should not be widely acceptable for use. But I have heard the term dropped casually in conversation, and no one seems to treat it like the slur that it is.

It is a term that denigrates and stereotypes a group of people based on their race, appearance, and socioeconomic status. It is meant to be derogatory. This to me is the definition of a bigoted term.

I'm not arguing that the term has as much history behind it as other racial or bigoted slurs. But in our modern society, we should still abandon the term altogether.

But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct?  Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does?  Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

I mean, on paper his idea sounds great.  Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY.  But that doesn't come for free.  And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people.  I guess that means I am anti-socialism?  Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished?  Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?

That being said, my actual argument:

Because the ammount of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million, these coins will increase in value as the world economy expands and some are lost.

If the value of a currency increases relative to goods and services, that is called deflation.

That sounds like it's not a big deal. And if you're an investor, it isn't. But if an economy relies on a currency that is undergoing deflation, that economy slows drasticly. 

The reason: If you can increase the worth of your money just by sitting on it, many people will do so. Why go through the trouble and risk of investing it if you are guaranteed to make profit (in terms of value) by putting it under your mattress?

Without investments, the economy grinds to a halt. This is why most economists think that moderate inflation is more desireable than even small deflation, some going so far as to say that some ammount of inflation is healthy.

Most people of course already treat Bitcoin as an investment instead of a currency, as you can see by its wild swings in value.

It's damn near impossible to bring any dangerous devices onto a plane.

I will disclose this. I was born in 1998 (17 years old). That means that I don't remember 9/11 (I remember that day, but not the significance) and I don't remember life before the TSA's newer policies. I grew up with them.

I just feel like the extra 30 minutes it takes to go through security is no big deal and generally gives me peace of mind. I totally understand minority complaints and I'm not arguing about those at all, but what I am saying is that the general (neither expedited or extended) search is totally reasonable and generally I don't feel annoyed or like my rights have been taken away in any sort of way.

Notice how all discussions about what can be done all boil down to ""Nothing. Enjoy your life"". Maybe some people can take solace in that but not all. Even climate scientists [are showing signs of PTSD (and I think I might be as well)](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36228/ballad-of-the-sad-climatologists-0815/).

Society should encourage the use of voluntary euthanasia. Aggresively campaign to tell people that anyone who chooses it is NOT a coward, is NOT selfish and they should NOT be mourned. In fact, they should be celebrated, because they have either transcended their base desire for survival (or never had it in the first place) and have made a decision that not only benefits them but the world at large as well.

It is sick how people are forced to keep playing the game of life even though they have already lost. People are brought into this world by the surpremely selfish desires of their parents who are either completely oblivious to the fact that their children will die drowning in their blood of the bodily fluids of their violators cursing their parents' name while the latter will likely sleep soundly in their graves or because they want to make their own ""tribe"" to fight in the ashes convinced of their own superiority. The children never had a choice. If any of them did and could be conscious enough to understand it, no one would be borne.

I don't see the point in living in a post collapse world. I hate exercising. Most people I know are incapable of having a conversation that doesn't involve sports, travel or the weather and I can only assume the number will grow as access to the Internet collapses. The thought of having to grow my own food makes me sick, let alone the thought that 12 hours of my day will have to be spent there. Probably until my back gives out and I'm left to die by the outside ""community"" that took me in before they realized I was ""weird"" and was looking for an excuse to murder me.

I don't want to learn self defense, I don't want to fight. I want to live in a world where specific people exist to protect me and as long as I don't do anything stupid, they won't hurt me. I want to live the rest of my life doing what I am told and being rewarded for it. I don't want to become a leader, I don't want to be responsible for people's well being. I never had any sort of relationship and perhaps it's for the best because if I did have a family during the collapse, I don't know what I would do.

More people like me must exist. We must help them.

I have a full-time job and am taking two weeks off for this trip. Now that the trip is coming up in a couple weeks, I am wondering why I thought it would be a good idea. I don't like the idea of two weeks of not being able to workout in a gym, eating decadent food, and spending as much money as I am on the trip. I am the stereotypical American who actually likes working and I try to work more hours than other people, punishing myself in the gym (if I'm not sore after lifting weights or out of breath after cardio, it's not a workout), and eating simple foods. I am going on this trip mainly for the historical aspect, but I am afraid of living too softly and enjoying myself too much, as ridiculous as that sounds. People tell me I'm going to work myself to an early death, but I see working as my purpose in life, as a man. I don't care if I drop dead from a heart attack at 40 if I worked as hard as I could and accomplished as much as possible.	1	22

However, the housing unit in question was built by the Muslim community in question, and would not have existed without their financing.

My view is that this is okay, because even if they're removing 166 Muslim families from the overall pool, this discriminating practice (which costs only 15% of what a discrimination-free housing unit would cost) they're functionally adding 166 'spots' for non-Muslims to the available pool of subsidized housing.

That's the first query I'd like a response to. The second is far more... direct, because I've gotten no response from any of the people I've put the query to, and I'm interested to see how people willing to challenge their own beliefs would take it.

The Scenario is as such:

**Hypothetical question:** You see two homeless people and want to buy them each a meal, but can only afford one. Someone else comes up and says ""I'm willing to buy that Muslim person a meal. I'm not willing to buy for the other homeless person, but I'll buy for the Muslim person.""

Both the homeless people are now being fed instead of one of them, *if you agree to the offer.* Do you turn it down based on principal and let one of the two go hungry?

If you say no in this scenario either you're feeding someone you would have fed anyway and letting the Muslim person go hungry for no good reason but to feel better about how equal and egalitarian you are, or you're feeding the person who has another offer of food and letting the person with no other offers of food go hungry.

Because you can't feed both. You have money for one, and someone is offering to feed the other, no matter how bigoted their offer may appear.

Would you watch someone actually go hungry for theoretical moral superiority, or would you be willing to recognize that the greater good in this instance is making sure both people are fed?

First it was just for people who were doing malicious or criminal things (like setting off illegal fireworks). Then I started seeing them for people doing stupid but not illegal things (like trying to drive across a fast moving river or kill a spider using a lighter and a can of hairspray). But it has more recently been for people who are victims of accidents and people who tried to do things correctly and with the best of intentions (like the guy who fell off a cliff while on a mountain bike ride or the church who was fined after their model rocket science project malfunctioned and started a fire). 

I believe this is a dangerous trend. Fire departments are paid with tax dollars. If fire departments begin to rely on funds from individuals it becomes incentive to allow problems to get worse before coming to solve them because it means a bigger bill at the end. We have already seen this happen with police departments and traffic tickets. They used to be issued as a deterrent to dangerous behavior but now, since police departments rely on the revenue to even function properly, they are being issued for things that aren't even illegal with the knowledge that most people won't fight it. A red light camera investigation exposed several around the country as being intentionally timed to ticket people who ran the yellow and not the red. 

Fire departments should continue to be paid by tax dollars so they never have a monetary incentive to do their jobs poorly."	51	47

Musically, I just hear incessant, grating melodies played over a shitty drumbeat while someone talks over the top of it. A lot of the time I don't really see how it qualifies as music.

Also, the amount of ridiculous, pretentious crap in the music videos just makes it hard for me to take them seriously at all.

But I don't really want to just dismiss rap music like that, so please explain to me how it's not shit, and examples of it not being shit would be nice too.

For languages, French occupies that position for me.  I would just accept this and not give it more thought, except for the fact that I will hear many people claiming french as one of, or possibly *the*, best sounding language on the planet.  I don't understand what they see in the language that makes it that appealing to them, and feel like I am missing something.

For perspective, to me French sounds like someone is trying not to vomit as they speak, and I can't think of anything appealing about how it sounds.  The best sounding languages in my mind is German, but there are a few others that are close enough to be effectively considered my favorite (including but not limited to: Swedish, Hawaiian, Russian, and Gaelic).

To get a delta, either find me a language that sounds worse than French, or give me reason to think that French sounds distinctly better than another language even if that language is not distinctly worse than some others.  I am discounting English and probably Spanish from consideration.  English is my native language, so it is difficult for me to make an assessment on how it sounds without considering the meaning of the words being used in the example.  Spanish is the most common second language where I grew up, so I learned some of it growing up and my opinion on it may be a bit clouded by experiences with communication difficulties between myself and people who spoke Spanish but not enough English.  I might be able to properly assess Spanish given the correct examples or perspective, but I would not count on it.

I will not accept a counter argument that my stance is not objective, because I think that aesthetics can only be assessed subjectively.  If you can argue for there being objective criteria, I will give you a delta."	0	36

Imagine two cop cars driving along a motorway in opposite directions. One of them is marked, while the other is not. 

The unmarked one is going with the flow, which is usually a couple km/h over the limit, pulling people over. They only pull over maybe 4 cars an hour, and everybody else is not slowing down, simply because they can't see the police. From a civilian standpoint this creates a paradigm: the police are there only to collect money for the government. 

On the other side of the motorway, the marked police car is driving normally, and obviously nobody is overtaking them. Everyone stays safe and happy.

IMO: The police should do it's best to keep people safe, not collect money.

**Argument 2**

Some jackass buys a used police car, some lights a siren, and a uniform off Ebay. Drives around in unpopulated areas, pulling people over and robbing them/killing them/whatever other crime. The victim can not refuse to pull over - it's a very serious offence in most countries. It wouldn't be such a problem if traffic police would only use marked cars.

""Compassion consists of three major requirements: People must feel that troubles that evoke their feelings are serious, people require that sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted, and that people must be able to picture themselves with the same problems"" 


""people require that sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted.""


I believe that we directly affect the world around us and are responsible for our decisions regardless of how minor the decision is. To think anything else is to pretend to are a victim of the world without control of what you do, which is completely incorrect. 


There is no deserving of or innocent, only compliancy of risks. 

 
When you play a game of chess you have forsee all possible outcomes and act in a way which advances towards your goal of victory. If you fail to see a risk, or overlook it, you experience failure.

I believe, regardless of how minor or how great of an events, excluding laws of physics, that this logic can be and should be applied evenly across all events, good or bad.

Many of the comments stated the opinion that this is a waste to burn it, and that the product should be sold at a very low price, to flood the market, and to raise money for conservation efforts.

I believe that destroying the Ivory is the best solution.  The sale of Ivory was banned in 1989, and the two legal sales that have happened since have [revived the demand in the markets that they were sold](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21595932-push-stop-poaching-and-save-elephants-extinction-up-smoke). 

Many people compared destroying the product to the ineffectiveness of similar practices in the drug war. Drug manufactures can afford to lose a large percentage of their shipments because the profit is so high, and most profitable drugs come from plants, or other resources that are renewable and not as scarce as Elephant Ivory.

I would love to hear your opinions, and will be taking them in to full consideration. Feel free to make suggestions about other potential solutions I haven't considered here.  I have an interest in (but limited knowledge of) economics, feel free to use macroeconomics to explain your view!

I mean, I really don't see the appeal. I guess the acting was good, but seriously, I didn't find it entertaining at all. My wife loved it. It's not like it was poorly written, had bad cinematography, or anything like that, I just found it... boring. I guess to me it was just a boring subject. ""Yeah, priests molest little boys on a large scale. Is that it?"" You could have written that on a post-it note and handed it to me and I think I would have had about the same reaction, but saved me 2 hours of my life. I don't know why I'm so bothered by this movie. I guess it's because I heard so many good things about it, I was expecting a lot more. I just felt like it was a newspaper article about an unentertaining subject that was made into a movie and won a ton of awards and accolades. 

   In contrast, I thought The Martian was excellent and I typically find space in general pretty uninteresting (I know, space should be really interesting, but that's a discussion for another day). I thought the Martian was a million times better than Spotlight. Like I said, I just don't understand the appeal of Spotlight. It wasn't even like there was a mystery to solve. I guess the only thing I can see as even slightly interesting is that nobody understood the magnitude of the problem and it was only through persistent journalism that it was even discovered. But, meh, so what?

   I'm not trying to undermine anyone's opinion that enjoyed the movie or even the movie itself. There are a lot of movies that I know are good that I just don't enjoy much and that's fine. I'm just baffled that I seem to be one of the rare few that feels this way about the movie and it bothers me more than it probably should that I can't understand what about it appeals to people.

   Counterpoint from a friend: ""I sort of equate movies like spotlight to documentaries. Some of my favorite documentaries are ones that contain subjects I have no interest in or don't think I'd find enjoyable (ex: journalism, catholic church scandal) and it succeeds in making it fascinating. I liked how the story and scandal unfolded. I don't particularly have an interest in the journalistic process and definitely didn't think I'd want to watch anything involving the church scandal but I found it intriguing.""

   My response: ""I know what you're saying. The subject itself doesn't have be interesting in a vacuum to be the focal point of a good movie. I agree with that. But I guess even the plot development wasn't interesting to me. I mean, everything happened exactly as I anticipated it would. Maybe it would have been more interesting if there was an unanticipated event or if something happened behind the journalistic scenes that nobody knew about or would have expected. But we already know the story and it unfolded exactly how I would have expected it to play out. 

   For example, of course the church was trying to keep the skeletons in the closet. That's what I would expect that organization to do in that situation, and furthermore, we already knew that's what they did.""

   Please, guys and gals, CMV.

I believe it's petty. I believe it does no good and only harm. As the old saying goes: ""An eye for an eye makes the world blind."" What does punishment actually achieve? If you kill somebody who killed somebody, it doesn't in any way bring them back. 

Look, I believe that we should have prisons, but not for punishment. The only reason to take away somebodies freedom is to prevent further harm to society. What has already been done is done. Prisons should focus instead on rehabilitation. If somebody is likely to cause harm to another, then it is necessary we take the means to prevent that. If they do not pose a danger, then it achieves nothing to take away their freedom.

**EDIT:** [I awarded a delta to someone that challenged the arguments of this final paragraph.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/49fioa/cmv_i_dont_believe_in_punishment/d0regc3)

&gt;Before you mention deterrence, I agree that we should aim to cut the problem out before it happens. Where I don't agree is that fear is an effective motivator. A much better solution would be to eliminate the conditions that coerce people into turning to crime.

Talking about deterrence was really tangential to the argument that I was actually making, and I was wrong to say that it is not in any way an effective tool.

But CMV, does punishment achieve anything for the greater good?

While seeing much of the pagantry unfold this morning while working out, I saw the [dissenting view of Miami-based ESPN pundit Dan LeBatard, himself the child of a mother who escaped the early years of the current regime]
(http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/15032737/historic-game-cuba-ignores-pain-many-people-endured) and while I respect and to a point disagree with his opinion on this matter I realized something else.

South Florida is one of the most diverse areas of the US if not the world while serving as a gateway to the Caribbean. As a part of the US itself, it seems a bit cut off from the rest of the US. The area has a very large transplant population, both foreign and domestic, which coupled with Florida having boomed only in the last 75 or so years means that entrenched local culture doesn't exist. Also, many transplants see Miami as a way station to make money, ride out some storm, or both and see it as not home even generations after their family arrived. Those that do settle fall victim to geography since being  at the end of a peninsula with favorable weather year round doesn't afford itself to transplants on a domestic level. The jokes a friend who grew up in Broward County would make about South Floridians rarely making it north were frequent.

On the political tangent it can be seen in the long, long process to the Cuban Thaw as exiles out of the Miami area, guided by a favorable political situation in a swing state, seemed to have little awareness of the views of the nation north of West Palm Beach or so with even the North Jersey exile bloc being a bit more amenable. On a lighter note, it can be seen in the struggles of Miami area sports teams which are often seen as ""having no fans"" due to poor attendance at home and few fans traveling as well as the ""we only support winners"" culture there. I know weather and traffic play a role and ownerships often have been weak, but there seems to be something about fandom there people don't get.

I might be rambling and I know other areas fit into this criteria, but I can't be alone in thinking that as a part of the US South Florida is an oddball, yes?"	1	4

I even disapprove of removing felons' rights to vote.

That said, I reject those things not because I believe broadening the voter pool benefits society, but because such restrictions are far too dangerous to allow people to meddle with. The temptation by those in power to restrict the rights of voters who disagree with them is too much for people to resist, so as a necessary evil we must prohibit such meddling in any way.

More to the point, though, I believe that actively encouraging *everyone* to vote is the other side of that same coin - it is rounding up reactionary, low information voters to vote for your position on an issue. It warps democracy from being about a collective process to discuss and decide policy, into a competition to see who can bus the most warm bodies to the polls.

Voting is a right, but it is also a responsibility. Voting without being informed is an abuse of that responsibility, and encouraging uninformed voters to go to the polls is aiding in that abuse for your own political benefit.

A democratic society functions best when the voters are rational and informed. They (ideally) learn what they can about any issue, make a subjective decision based on their internal values, and then vote for a candidate or proposal that they believe will best accomplish that. 

While obviously not always true, the people who make a point to go out and vote on their own tend to be the ones who actually care enough to put the time and effort into the process as described in my previous paragraph. They're the closest we get in reality, anyway.

Deliberately rounding up non-voters and pushing them towards the polls dredges up the opposite - low information, reactionary voters whose only knowledge on the issues likely comes from the partisan individuals who gave them the voter registration sheet. They seldom take the time to seek out the other side and hear their version of the story.

So, while these people have every right to vote, they're abusing that right and partisan organizations designed to ""get out the vote"" are complicit in that. They're harming the overall system for their own gain.

4855832	changemyview	270163330	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/4gujcy/cmv_closed_elections_are_not_undemocratic/	2016-04-28 15:38:12		spydormunkay	CMV: Closed elections are not undemocratic.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4gujcy/cmv_closed_elections_are_not_undemocratic/	"**Closed elections are not undemocratic.**

I argue that Sanders and his supporters are using selective argumentation to prove that Clinton is only winning the Democratic primaries due to closed elections. I argue that Clinton’s ability to win closed primaries is not because of the lack of independent voters, but because of her more diverse base of supporters in terms demographics in the states that held closed primaries.

This discussion pertains to the current 2016 U.S. Democratic primaries. Recently, Bernie Sanders and his supporters have been increasingly critical of the current Democratic primary system, particularly closed elections. Though, the Democratic primaries run various types of elections throughout the primary season besides closed elections.

Before we get into the discussion, here are some information on U.S. primary elections for those who don’t know:

*What are closed elections?*

* **Closed elections** are elections where only people registered as members of a certain party can vote in that primary. Independents and registered members of other parties like the Republican Party are not allowed to vote. This is in direct contrast to open elections.

* This is in contrast to **open elections** where everyone is allowed to vote, regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof.

There are other types of elections such as semi-closed elections and semi-open elections:

* **Semi-closed elections** allow party members and unaffiliated voters to vote, leaving out people from other parties.

* **Semi-open elections** are pretty much open elections except that unlike open elections where voters are given a ballot and on the ballot they choose which party to vote for, in semi-open elections, voters must declare party they wish to vote for and are then given a party-specific ballot. For all intents and purposes, semi-open elections are essentially open elections.


Furthermore, elections are either primaries or caucuses. These types of elections do not pertain to who can participate in the election, but rather how elections are conducted. Primaries are essentially normal elections while caucuses are town hall meetings where delegates who support the same candidate group up and whichever candidate has the most support wins.

Closed elections have been a staple of both Democratic and Republican primaries for years. Once upon a time, all party elections were closed. In fact, back then, nominees were not chosen by the people in an election, but instead they were chosen in a single National convention by party leaders only. Things have changed. Parties now host elections open to normal people. This is due to the fact that the old system was simply undemocratic and it sometimes led to unelectable people being chosen as the nominees. Elections open to normal people is an easy way to determine if a candidate is electable or not. However, state parties are given the choice on whether to run a closed, open, semi-closed, and semi-open election. Closed elections have been a part of the primary process for years and have not really been a huge issue until this election. And it wasn’t until the New York Democratic primary where the issue really became controversial.

*What is the purpose of closed elections?*

* The purpose of closed elections is to keep outsiders out. The reason for this is the belief that only true supporters of a party know who would best represent them.

* There is also a fear of saboteurs or “raiders” from other parties that might purposely vote for weaker candidates to make the election easier for their preferred candidate from other parties. Though this occurrence is rare, it has happened before recently. In 2008, Rush Limbaugh pushed Republican voters to vote for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama because Barack Obama was seen as the stronger candidate. In 2012, Democratic voters in Michigan voted in the Republican primary for Rick Santorum in an effort to prevent the nomination of Mitt Romney, who was seen as the stronger candidate.

*Why have closed elections become so controversial?*

* **Bernie Sanders** is a major candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, he is currently second place in pledged delegates. He tends to be more popular among independents than current Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Because independents are locked out of closed elections, supposedly a large part of his potential voters are locked out, leading many to believe that closed elections are undemocratic.
* Because closed elections only allow party members to vote, closed elections tend to favor party favorites. The current party favorite is **Hillary Clinton**, who tends to be more popular among Democratic Party members. As a result, she stands most to gain by having closed elections.

There are several problems with this argument:

The most obvious being that Clinton has won 10/13 open primaries so far (11/14 if you count semi-open primaries). The most common counter to this point is that most of those primaries were in the Deep South, which are usually conservative and don’t vote Democrat anyway. There are several problems with this counterpoint is that:

* First off, such a dismissal unfairly diminishes the results of the battleground states that held open primaries. Only two battleground states held an open primary and that was Ohio (semi-open) and Virginia, both of which were won by Hillary Clinton. If we consider independents as undecided voters or voters in the middle who can swing elections as they usually do, naturally, they would be more influential and more numerous in the swing states. If there were places that the supposed independent voting bloc that Sanders always touts about could have swung elections his way it was those two states. They didn’t.

* Secondly, the idea that the South is conservative and therefore categorically against Sanders is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Southern electorate, a mistake that has led to the rise of Trump in the South and has led to Sanders tremendous losses there. **The South may be socially conservative, but they are not fiscally conservative.**

* Why do you think Trump won a large part of the Deep South? Was it because Southerners are just racist and hate immigrants? No, it’s his economic policies that attracted Southerners. Early on, he called for taxes to decrease on the poor and taxes to increase on the wealthy (though this is a lie or truth, depending on who you ask). He called for keeping Medicare and Social Security at a time when Republicans were calling for them to be cut. He called for a replacement of Obamacare with something similar to Canada’s healthcare system. These are leftist economic views that Sanders touts. Southerners are predominantly working class whites and blacks who stand most to gain from Sanders policies.

* Perhaps it was because he’s socially liberal? Then what is Clinton? A gun-loving racist? They’re basically the same in terms of socially liberal values. His failure to reach them stems from his inability to connect with those voters personally, which Clinton achieves by appealing to the blacks.

* If anything, Clinton’s ability to win in the Deep South is a testament to her diverse electorate and, thus, her superior electability compared to Sanders. This attitude that Sanders and his supporters are taking in dismissing the South as “distorting reality” is a defeatist attitude that haunts Sanders even in the Northeastern states that Sanders likes to tout about. Why do you think minorities in the Northeastern states, especially blacks, vote overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton? Are they socially and fiscally conservative? Or are they just more attracted to Clinton than Sanders on a personal level?


The second most obvious hole in Sanders’ argument is that Sanders has won 6/9 closed caucuses so far (6/7 if you only count states). If it really were the case that Clinton has a much bigger advantage in closed elections than in open elections, wouldn’t closed caucuses basically be the ultimate advantage for Clinton? If we consider the argument that closed primaries limiting the potential amount of voters are an advantage for Clinton, surely a closed caucus, which drastically results in a low amount of voters, would give an even bigger advantage to Clinton? This is not the case. Strangely enough, in some of the most fiscally conservative states Sanders has swept closed caucuses. The only closed caucuses Clinton has won was in Nevada, a swing state, and the American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. It’s obvious to see why a place like deeply liberal Maine would vote for Sanders. Though it’s amazing to see that deeply fiscally conservative places like Wyoming, Alaska, Nebraska, and Kansas would vote for Sanders. Aren’t they fiscally conservative strongholds, directly opposite to Sanders views? If we examine Sanders and his supporters’ argument that conservatism, more specifically fiscal conservatism, is his biggest weakness which led to his blowouts in the South, then why doesn’t this argument apply to actually fiscally conservative places like these states? One counterpoint would be that because elections are closed only real hardline liberals would be registered Democrats in such fiscally conservative states. But why can such hardline liberals only sprout in these places and not places like New York? Surely there are hardline liberals registered as Democrats in those states? The real reason why such states voted heavily in favor of Sanders is because of **their lack of diversity, a.k.a. their overwhelming non-Hispanic white population.**

* The states of Wyoming, Alaska, Nebraska, Kansas, and even the swing state of Colorado, are heavily white. Heavier than other closed election states like New York and Maryland. When you compare the results of these two groups of closed election states and their demographics, it becomes easy to see why Sanders ultimately lost those states. New York, in particular, is “only” 56.5% non-Hispanic white as opposed to Colorado’s 70% non-Hispanic White population. When you remember that minorities vote heavily in favor of Clinton, which comprise 43.5% of New York, and whites are typically split between young and old, it’s easy to see that Clinton, compared to Sanders, has a huge advantage over Sanders in terms of diversity and broadness in her voter base. The split between young and old whites is less of an issue in heavily white states because inevitably there are more young white voters than old white voters. However, that split becomes an issue when you add minorities, especially blacks into the equation. Minorities staunchly in support of Clinton, young and old. That staunch support along with the split in whites is winning Clinton the primaries.

* This is the same story in Maryland where non-Hispanic whites only comprise 52.6% of the population. Clinton won even harder in Maryland than in New York (63% vs. 57%). Contrary to popular belief, open primaries would not have saved Sanders from either demographic nightmare. Unsurprisingly, Clinton’s struggled as white population increased, winning Pennsylvania by only 55% and 78% non-Hispanic white, Connecticut by 51% and 69% white. Clinton’s lost Rhode Island, 74.5% non-Hispanic White.


The third hole in his argument is that independents are only heavily influential in swing states. The idea that independent voters will have a bigger impact in deep blue states than swing states contradicts the idea of what an independent voter is. If we go back to my first argument that independent voters are the ones that decide results in battleground states the most, wouldn’t it be natural that they would comprise a higher percentage of the electorate in the swing states than in the red and blue states? If the supposed independent bloc are the ones pushing Sanders above Clinton, why didn’t he win swing states with open primaries? More importantly, why wasn’t he even competitive in them? He was blown out in both Virginia and Ohio. Was it because of demographics? Yes and no. Virginia is 63% non-Hispanic white whereas Ohio is 80% non-Hispanic white. Virginia can be chalked up to another demographic nightmare. Ohio on the other hand is peculiar. Why would an 80% non-Hispanic white state that had an open (semi-open) primary vote for Clinton. It’s a swing state, too, meaning that there are more independent voters than normal. **The answer could very well be Sanders is not as popular among independent as he or his supporter like you to believe.** Sanders is certainly more popular among independents compared to Clinton. That’s no question, the polls all show it and the primary results speak for themselves. But we must re-examine the polls. Clinton, despite being so “unpopular” among independents still leads Trump and Cruz in the polls. Despite having less popularity than Sanders among independents, she still pulls enough of their support as well as the staunch support of minorities and traditional Democrats to give her the edge over Sanders. Sanders was given two free shots at proving his cross-cutting appeal by winning the open primaries of Ohio and Virginia and he was blown out.

The real reason why Sanders is losing closed primaries is not because of the lack of independent voters, it’s because of his narrow voter base compared to Clinton. Think about it. Sanders has only been successful in heavily non-Hispanic white states, whether open, closed, semi-open, or semi-closed. The only really diverse that he’s won so far is Michigan, which is still 75.6% non-Hispanic white, a far cry from 56% and 52% shown by New York and Maryland. The idea that an open primary could’ve saved Sanders is not only preposterous, it’s insulting to the minorities who still staunchly support Clinton. Perhaps, states like Pennsylvania and Connecticut could’ve been won by Sanders had they been open. They’re mostly white, the demographics fit it. If anything, the fact that they’re not swing states, makes it even easier for Sanders. But that’s just it. If his greatest strength is his so-called independent bloc, **why can’t he win a state like Ohio or Virginia?** Don’t forget Nevada or Florida. Nevada was Clinton’s only win in the closed causes in mainland United States. Unsurprisingly, that was the least whitest of the closed caucuses: 51.5% non-Hispanic white. Florida, a closed primary is 55% non-Hispanic white. Do you people honestly think Sanders had a chance in hell of winning those primaries with those demographics? Get out.

In short, I guess I didn't prove that closed elections were undemocratic. But I sought to prove that the reasons that Sanders' supporters had for why they are undemocratic are just invalid.

Change my view.

Even in cases of genocide there was conviction on the part of the perpetrator that it was somehow morally justified, you and I may viciously disagree with their stance and international criminal courts might put them to death because of it but to them and at that moment it was the right thing to do.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department), that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board, with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts, which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street, and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist, and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues, and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this, how can people support her? The facts are right there, and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing, I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

It would seem to me that the underlying cause of most racial issues and religious extremism is a lack of money and freedom. Rich people fight this war with militaries and legislation. Poor people fight each other because many of them fail to recognize who their enemy is. Convince me otherwise.

I supported Sanders's general election campaign, but I think we all have an inflated sense of the importance of Sanders's supporters because they tend to be (1) Redditors, so there's an availability bias, (2) loud, and (3) passionate. But that doesn't necessarily matter in terms of overall votes.

Essentially, the number of Sanders's supporters that Clinton could sway by continuing to make concessions to the left are not enough to justify the effort. Sanders's supporters tended to be young people, who do not turn out in large numbers in a general election. People over 30 are more likely to vote, and they tend to be more moderate, so it made perfect sense for Hillary Clinton to pick Tim Kaine, a more moderate vice president, in the hopes of appealing to centrists who are disillusioned with Donald Trump. Clinton would be better served by spending time making her get-out-the-vote case to the groups of people who already support her and dislike the Donald (i.e., women, minorities, and moderate Democrats), and trying to woo moderate Republicans who have been turned off by Trump, than trying to cater to a group of people who are notoriously fickle on election day.

This is based on my general sense of the importance of these groups to the overall electoral map, but I have never studied political science. Seeing concrete numbers would be more likely to convince me than mere rhetoric.

Whether this is or is not the case, a great many people, particularly on the right, particularly repeatedly-bankrupt millionaires who's eyes look like their mouths, seem to think of this time period as something to emulate. 
The fact of the matter is that this is patently absurd. The economy of the 1950s was so strong and America so dominant because every other country that could possibly compete with us was rebuilding from World War II. Short of Europe and East Asia destroying themselves in a nuclear holocaust or us halting all trade into this country, that is a condition that is nevergoing to happen again. 
The 1950s are also known for a level of social homogenity that is largely a product of low immigration. The 1965 Immigration Act repealed many of the limits on immigration put in place in the 1920s. 
The fact of the matter is that what the Baby Boomers consider to be America's decline is actually America returning to the conditions that had persisted for the 170 years preceding the 1950s. Present conditions- that is, an unstable economy, lots of immigrants, and a religious minority that many people are mistrustful of- is the normal state of affairs in this country. A more achievable goal is a return to the conditions (both economically and socially) of the 1990s- a decade which will undoubtedly in 20-30 years be as idealized by Millennials as the 1950s was by Baby Boomers

1. Society should find out who is directly responsible / performed the action
2. Did he report it to his superior and at least one other person in his chain of command (ie. superior's superior)?
3. If no, then he's fired, fined for the full amount of his past year's salary, and banned from the industry for three years.
4. For all the people he reported the issue to, or who knew about the issue, and who should have done something about this, but didn't, or who should have reported it up further, but didn't: repeat steps 2, 3, and 4.

As a corollary, all corporations should be required to educate employees that they are to report anything that could potentially be seen as immoral or illegal, to not just their supervisor but someone further up the chain of command, and to educate them of the consequences should they fail to do so. Supervisors are to be educated that if they become aware of the issue and take no action to fix or escalate the issue, that they will be held responsible as well. 
This policy wouldn't be retroactive.

The idea is that if the underlings had duly reported the issue and the supervisors hadn't, the supervisors would be punished. Every single individual who should have reported or done something to fix the issue but didn't would simultaneously be held liable. If the issue had been reported all the way up to the executive level, then the fines would be massive (since executives make far more). This way there would be incentive for issues to be escalated all the way up, and an incentive for those with the decision making power to do something about it.

I planned on voting for Hillary Clinton because, to me, she seemed to be the best possible thing my vote could have accomplished. But then I heard the argument that there is precedent for a party absorbing a smaller party and its positions when it gets big enough, via the dixiecrats. And thus, it is good for a 3rd party get to a level of funding where they can build more power. So if you live in a state that is probably going to vote for the greater of two evils, you should salvage your vote to use on Jill Stein to get to 5%.

And I put that number at if Hillary Clinton had a &gt;20% chance of losing and a &gt;80% chance of winning as calculated by 538, because he seemed to have better models of prediction, and even had the best mainstream prediction based on the only methods we know work for determining these probabilities. But there is clearly not enough information to trust to those polls, because Wisconsin was a safe state on the last poll aggregate, and michigan probably was when I voted because I voted early.

I voted for Stein in Utah, and while the polls came more true here, I can't commit to something I don't know has properly correlated with what it is studying. The range between the Donald and Hillary voters in those states is lower than the vote for Stein in those state. By definition, Jill Stein was a spoiler candidate. And if every Stein voter/liberal thought like me when casting their vote, then the results would have been even worse. I, in good conscience, cannot vote for a candidate who is more unlikely to win in a first past the post voting system, because the lesser of two evils is always so much better than the greater of two evils, regarding something like the presidency, that it cannot be jeopardized by misinforming probability calculations."	0	10

I think when I became an atheist, my viewpoint on life and the lives of others changed significantly. I realized how precious, short, and lucky we are to be apart of this thing called existence due to a cosmic accident. We should all be able to experience it before it's gone to never be experienced again. In the world we live in, people in developing countries seem to either die miserable and depressed or have to rely on a false sense of hope in a faulty religion to get through. Meanwhile, the smile amount of us actual have access to what is needed to live a decent life and again, it is seem that this is only achieved by keeping the poor poor in order to allow the rich to stay rich and become richer.
Competition for survival is a normal thing among many other species, but we have competed against natural laws forever. The Age of Enlightenment/ Reason led to this idea that God's hand wasn't the only thing that determines the state of the natural world. It reflected importance on intellect, something that makes human beings a remarkable species, despite all the shit we may do.

I would think this effect would be even stronger with minority groups. According to the 2010 census 19.3% of people live in rural areas. But African Americans make up only 13% of the population and Latino's make up 17% of the population, and that's just looking at the two biggest groups. So I would think that if rural voters get a disproportionate portion of the vote, and that's fair because they are underrepresented, then it should only be fair for minorities also get a disproportionate amount of the vote.

Studies found through web searches address nicotine in cigarette smoke.  Cigarette smoke is known to include many chemicals that may significantly influence the effects of nicotine.  In fact, it is difficult to determine whether elements of cigarette smoke make nicotine more addictive, as opposed to nicotine enhancing the effects of other chemicals and therefore appearing to be addictive while actually enhancing in a different experience.

Meanwhile, nicotine is available ""over the counter"" (albeit with restrictions) in the form of nicotine gum or nicotine in ""vape juice.""  Addiction to nicotine gum (in non-smokers) does not appear to be an issue.

I have never smoked, but I have taken up vaping.  After months of exposure, I find that I miss my vaping no more than I miss my morning coffee.

**EDIT**

I have found [an article that is pertinent](http://discovermagazine.com/2014/march/13-nicotine-fix), published by Discover Magazine.  To my point: ""Perhaps most surprising is that, in studies by Boyd and others, nicotine has not caused addiction or withdrawal when used to treat disease,"" and ""it’s almost impossible to get laboratory animals hooked on pure nicotine, though it has a mildly pleasant effect.""

I now have leads that I can follow through the researchers named in the article.

A poor person born into this society would have few chances for learning and advancement of their skills, while a rich person would have access to high quality teachers and resources that would help them get ahead.

After several generations, you would have rich families far more power and influence than any poor family, and they could easily conspire to keep it that way via nepotism and corruption.

This is the only random mechanic in the game).

I think there are some cases where RNG hides over the fact that the game is not deep at all (like RISK, Monopoly and to some extent Fire Emblem, although I fucking love FE), but I think in a well-designed game it adds a layer of depth to it.

1) In games where snowballing is a thing (so many of them), it prevents snowballing since there is a chance for the losing team to make a comeback - the winner thus has to keep plan B in case plan A gets fucked by the RNG, thus he has to stratigize further in order to keep his advantage instead of just pushing a single plan.

2) It forces adaptation on a completely new level and makes risk-taking much more prevalent, since there is a chance of something going wrong without your control. In Smash Bros. games, for example, people would have to work around items randomly appearing, and this could open a huge amount of possibilities in the game.

3) It makes capitalizing on advantages much more important - in the aforementioned GoT example, you can get in very rare cases a +3 in combat strenght, but it's not going to matter much if you have the possibility to go in with 10 strenght while your opponent has 4.

4) It makes it more exciting for the audience, and this is really important for games that are pushing for a big competitive scene (like League of Legends).

I don't advocate for abuse of RNG, it doesn't even have to be true RNG (like LoL's crit chance) but I think it does have a place in competitive gaming.

Obviously, it is not an ideal case. Of course the best way is to have a perfect individual to make these decisions but, have we not seen that at last it always ends badly. That kind of authority would be tyrannical.
I would like to give analogy of democracy being imperfect as compared to a benevolent dictator BUT we know dictatorship always end badly. No one person should be given so much power.

All the doctors I have visited have been terrible at their jobs.  Whether it is complete disinterest, misdiagnosis, unknowledgeable of symptoms indicating problems, misreading x-rays/cat scans, etc.  Any condition that has been solved has been me fighting the medical system with information i've researched on the internet.

If we started a database that tracked symptom of patients, eventually we'd see what percentage of particular symptoms indicate a particular disease/condition/disorder/etc.

I understand people do their own research on Web MD and often go to a doctor and a doctor laughs and tells them what they read is incorrect, but this is because WebMD is not considering everything else about the patient.  

For instance low blood pressure in a 24 year old athlete is not an indicator of a problem as it would be for say an old sedentary and obese 65 year old male. 

Doctors should be detectives, puzzle solvers or scientists, but often I find they are quick to get you in and out of your office for that paycheck.  They see too many patience to devote enough time to solve your obscure case.  And let's say it is indeed an obscure case.  Imagine only 100 people have had your condition, no doctor could ever be expected to piece together the puzzle.  But if those 100 people were logged,  the computer could compare against that.

At best we could train individuals to be intermediaries between the patient and the computer system, so training for general practitioners could be lowered considerably.   And in doing so, their pay would be much lower which would allow money to be used for other things.  more testing labs, more MRI machines, etc.

Imagine going into the automated medical facility and getting your blood work and cat-scan done all in one place.  It would seem to me that your chance of a correct diagnosis would be MUCH higher than dealing with a human.  Most of medical school is just learning IMMENSE text book knowledge and analysis skills, both of which are best handled by a computer.

Homosexual acts are by definition *NOT* open to life, and therefore they are seen as immoral. They are a sin. All heterosexual acts outside of marriage (which most people are guilty of) are *equally* immoral, and also considered a sin. 

This means that the people who engage in these acts are sinners. But *everybody* is a sinner. There's no belief that sinners are by definition 'evil'. Catholics think that homosexual acts are immoral, but we do not hate the people who commit them, and we do not think that homosexuals are evil. 

If you believe that your friend swears too much, or behaves selfishly, you disapprove of these behaviours, but you don't have to hate your friend.

I don't think this was helpful or necessary, and in fact I experienced a short period afterwards where I specifically sought out games like CoD for the novelty of it. I understand that people may find the concept of violence grotesque, but video game violence is incredibly cartoonish. Not many people, or children I'd think, would belabor under the illusion that the silly video game blood on-screen has anything to do with what a realistic analogue would entail. I've even heard from people that it helps get aggression out of their system. Additionally, things like innuendo, violence, and 'bad language' are lumped together without any real way to differentiate. Even if I accept that there's benefit in controlling content, there doesn't seem to be a way for a parent that would want to pick one or two factors to actually choose. But beyond the value to isolated households, even if you tell your kids to not play M games, someone else's parent isn't going to care and will probably just let your kid play one at their house. Plus, if the concern is language and innuendo, they run into those at school anyway. And instagram is hardly sparing either. I just feel like the ESRB wasn't that useful at first and is now even more of a dinosaur.

It got me thinking about patriotism as did a recent episode of One the Media which can be found here;

http://www.wnyc.org/story/on-the-media-2017-06-30

Canadians are not very patriotic, at least compared to our American neighbours. I think a strong argument can be made that this is a huge benefit to Canadian culture and democracy. 

On the surface patriotism seems somewhat benign or even good. How can it be bad to feel good about ones country? However, little good actually comes from patriotism. Our world is increasingly global yet patriotism only reinforces sectarian and tribal ideas. It can be argued it is largely responsible for the rise of the alt-right and the anti-globalism in America and elsewhere. 

It is also nearly always factually inaccurate. In nearly every case, people who think their country is the best in some way are just wrong about the facts.

Patriotism also reinforces otherness which leads to racism, sexism, anti-intellectualism and xenophobia.

Patriotism is always used as a political weapon with the sole purpose of stifling critical thinking or open debate. One is not to question any idea that can be wrapped in the guise of patriotism.

Finally, patriotism nearly always blinds people to the problems in their own society and allows those problems to persist far longer than they should.

I'd be curious to see data but I would hypothesize there is an inverse correlation between the levels of patriotism in a country and the health of its political system.

I honesty cannot think of a redeeming quality to patriotism.

Rather than forcing people to join work-related groups and being target-driven, the system needs a reboot.

People who have a LLOND [Lifelong Neurological Disorder] which could be defined as:

Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]

Rett's Syndrome

Down's Syndrome

Foetal Alcohol Syndrome

Spina bifida 

etc.

should be entitled to a new DQLA [Disabled Qualify of Life] allowance which would be for their entire lifetime.

I am a male in my 30s with Asperger's Syndrome so cannot be accused of throwing stones in glass houses, so to speak. I *do* work [albeit within the limits of DWP for disabled people].

Rather than having ATOS force them to attend interviews, the focus would be on [questioned document examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questioned_document_examination) and assessing how valid the documentation is - much as historians have to do, to ensure absolute authenticity.

Anyone can claim to be disabled, but some disorders, like autism spectrum disorder or Down's Syndrome have ""tell""s that they have the disability. It is a lot harder to fake having a condition like ASD and spina bifida. Increased public awareness by charities about disability has made it easier now than it was in the 1990s to understand disability.

Theresa May's government are not disability-friendly in this regard, and I can very well understand *why* parents of, and adults with a disability are not satisfied, and expect her to be out of office soon.

In the U.S., Donald Trump should also implement a policy like this, it may prove a PR coup for him and take the public's mind away from things like links with Russia and election manipulation, the dismissal of Sally Yates and the recent dismissal of James Comey, and other issues.

These are my opinions, change my viewpoint if you can.

Although the idea of ""anyone can be president"" is charming, such an important position, I believe, should carry with it a good resume and security of sound mind. For example, Donald Trump was seen as a ""man of the people"" during his campaign due to his lack of political background, but that did not change the fact that he is a lifelong 1%er. I don't think it's unreasonable to require some kind of history of elected office to file for candidacy-- whether that be a governorship, a seat in congress, or just a local or state representative seat.

Additionally, although there may be nothing to the rumors/speculations of dementia, BPD, or narcissistic personality disorder, the public has no way of being secure in the idea that our leader is mentally sound without a simple mental health examination available for public record. After all, the president serves the people, and it's time to say the people need to know what they're getting into."	0	52

First of all, I believe that a person who requests to die most answer the following (and reasonable) criteria:

* Has a terminal/incurable illness 

* Sound of mind and is not under outside pressure to make this decision (Including a psychology examination to conclude that)

* Their quality of life is objectively extremely poor and is not expected to get better

I think that if in the future I will contract a deadly disease which would leave me in pain and the when I know that there is no cure I would love to know that I have the *option* of ending it all. It is my life and unlike regular suicide, it is not a selfish act. I'm going to die soon anyway, and personally, I might prefer that my family will remember me as an independent strong person rather than a needy patient.

Even if I have a couple years, everyone has a different pain tolerance and maybe a level of pain that YOU can withstand is not a level of pain someone else could. Could you imagine living day after day with insufferable pain? Lying in your hospital bed at night, possibly alone, having to *feel* enormous pain throughout your entire body after each single breath you take? 

For others, there are worst things than pain or death. Some parents would not want their children or family see them suffer. A father may know that he is a hero in his child's eyes. The only other thing than seeing your hero dying is seeing his suffer without the ability to help himself. Could you try and put yourself in that father's position? 

And the important thing to remember is, I'm not saying that every terminally ill patient should be euthanized, I'm just saying that if that person answers the requirements above, they could make that choice for themselves.
Here are some of the more popular reasons and my answers to them:

**There are miracles in the world! And Also sometimes doctors make mistakes**  
Yes, there are some inexplicable ""miracles"" and human errors, however, this is not a common enough occurrence to even consider as a point! It would be the equivalent of telling the power company not to cut your power out because you just bought a lottery ticket and there is a chance that you will win. 

**Poor people would be in disadvantage because suicide is cheaper than end of life treatment**  
This one is simple enough. Most developed countries have free healthcare so it is not really an issue, and those which do not, are not obligated to offer euthanasia for cheap. Second or even third opinions should be gathered from doctors before taking the step, as well as a psychological evaluation and probably a board of directors to review all the information gathered and approve the request. The prices can add up really quickly.

**Corporate interests could push people into assisted suicide because it is cheaper than treating an illness**  
This point only applies to America. Most of the developed world doesn't have that problem. I'm arguing that it should be a human right. As far as I care, it can still be outlawed in the States until they fix their very broken welfare system meanwhile being OK in most of the developed world. 
 
**It is against Hippocratic Oath for euthanize patients/it is not ethical for doctors to do it**  
I agree. We should not expect doctors to ""pull the trigger"". There should be specially trained people to commit this task, much like some prisons use for executions. 

That's all I could think on on my own. Please change my view.

1. Ignore non-tenured staff because if they protest, they may fail to acquire tenure, or at least fear retaliation.

2. This post presupposes exceptional tenured professors (***henceforth OTP***) (e.g. Fields Medallists or Nobel Prize Laureates), for which consider only the top UK (e.g. Oxbridge, LSE) and US (Ivy League, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech) universities (***henceforth TUNI***).

 ###Axioms (Please don't challenge these here; post separately to do so.)  



3. Every TUNI is imperfect, and still suffers at least 1 problem, like expensive tuition, bad teaching, deficient accommodation, etc... 
4. Every TUNI  currently employs Multiple OTP who agree with 3 (that something can be improved).

 ###Arguments
5. If a TUNI still refuses to change positions after formal protests or resistance by many OTP, many OTP should threaten to resign; and if a TUNI still doesn’t budge, truly resign. 
6. OTP's exceptionality makes them employable by most other universities. Even if they voluntarily resign and lose their tenure at OTP, OTP should prioritize [honour, integrity, selflessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ridenhour_Prizes) in helping less powerful students against mightier TUNIs and risk losing their employment, over being a silent bystander in these David-vs.-Goliath disputes. 

7. TUNIs will not desire collective resignation of so many OTPs, because then UNIS will lose reputation, prestige, funding, etc…

8. Thus, OTPs have the might to try to change the TUNI.

9. Conclusion and CMV: OTP aren’t doing or protesting enough to improve TUNIs for students.

The goal of this is to provide a financial incentive to increase the supply (and thus reduce cost) of organs required for transplant.  The benefits I see are as follows:

1) it gives the poor and disadvantaged a way to make money and get on their feet without requiring higher education or years of experience, relieving debts.

2) The financial incentive gives people reason to donate organs who might otherwise not.  This increases supply and drives down cost, and reduces time on waiting lists.  

3) A profitable program of organ collection would allow advertising for agencies that do this service and write up contracts, increasing the visibility of the needs of people who require organ transplants.

4) The argument that this creates a black market for organs is silly.  If someone wanted to kill you and take your organs, laws against it won't really help because now we're talking about maniacs.  

Furthermore my organs are my property, and I get to say what happens to my property during my lifetime and at the time of my death.  To deny this is to deny that individuals have the right to their own bodies.

As we progressed and gained more knowledge and wisdom our morals changed with us. We gained empathy over time and our ideas about what was okay and what wasnt have changed rapidly. Not so long ago, it was considered okay to enslave, rape and otherwise brutalise another human, as long as they were outside of your tribes circle of empathy.

The basic things that made us understand that these other people were infact people were simple: they are capable of pain and suffering, and they dont deserve it any more than we do. They deserve freedom from persecution. A very recent example is gay and trans people, who we are currently bringing into the circle.

I believe that our circle of empathy will continue to grow and I believe that it is inevitable that animals will gain entrance to our circle of empathy. And that in many ways they already are. They are capable of suffering and they dont deserve it any more than slaves did 500 years ago.

If you ask people on the street whether or not an animal deserves to suffer, most will say no. But we still cause the suffering and premature deaths of tens of billions of animals every year in factory farms. 

I believe that in the near future, we will be viewed as savage beasts with no regard for what is right or wrong in account of this hypocrisy and implicit acceptance of evil acts.

My friends and I used to spend hours each month at the record store, browsing through new albums and searching for classics or hidden gems. We'd take them home, put them on and listen while reading the liner notes and digging on the cover art. In many ways, the cover art could be just as cool and compelling as a great record. 

Now, streaming has replaced record sales as everyone either downloads songs from itunes or creates their own playlist from spotify, pandora, or some other service. In the end, you don't actually ""own"" this music, you're essentially leasing it through whatever service you choose. You lose the tactile enjoyment of pulling vinyl from it's sleeve or opening a jewel case. You the lose the discovery of finding more than one great tune on a record. For example, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had only four singles, so in today's age how would any discover the great tunes on that record like Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, The Chain, or Gold Dust Woman?

While you can find all sorts of undiscovered music through streaming, you don't necessarily own it. IT might be a good companion because of its ease of use, but owning physical copies of the music you love is still superior to having a copy on your phone.

CMV, that streaming music is inferior to owning either vinyl or cd's of musical artists work.

If it is successful then there is going to be an offer for a relationship; if not then either the two is going to be friends or merely walk away and say goodbye without staying in contact.

Like job hunting, one should always be vigilant. When it comes to finding a relationship, one should focus on scheduling as many dates as possible to maximize their chances of being in a relationship. It is not wise to only stick to focusing all your attention onto one person because there is a big chance it wouldn't work out. Instead by talking to as many people as possible you are spreading your eggs in multiple basket and improving your chances at beating the numbers game.

This resonates well with job hunters since doing so many interviews (Or in this case talking to many potential people) will give you more opportunities to improve and sell yourself better down the road. I remember doing like 10 interviews before getting my first job. Each interview I improve upon one another and I feel this could be applied to dating.

Another reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is to be better mentally prepared when the date doesn't workout. You have another person to look forward to meeting so you won't feel too down.

Calling certain countries shitholes isn't incorrect. I'm not arguing Trump should've said it, but I am going to defend his assertion that Haiti is a shithole, and it shouldn't complain while it receives American aid.

Shithole is defined as:

A very dirty or unpleasant place

Haiti is a shithole, as it has widespread cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, typhoid, and leprosy. All of these diseases are spread in unclean conditions, and all of these are unpleasant diseases, qualifying Haiti as a shithole. In addition, if you look at images of Haiti, the gutters are filled with garbage, the sanitation is horrible, or simply doesn't exist, and most of the country lives in squalor.

To compound this, Haiti is also extremely poor, with the average person getting $350 per year, which is ridiculously low, and can in no way be considered pleasant, further qualifying Haiti as unpleasant, and therefore a shithole.

My final point is that Haiti should not complain about calling a shithole (At least not without expecting some repercussions on it's aid), as it is both accurate, and it is receiving foreign aid to ""fix"" its problems. Each year, the United States spends $1.5 billion in Haiti (I've seen conflicting sources on the exact number, but the point still stands), which is a huge amount of money. In addition, the US provides 500k meals each day to Haitian students, so without the US, Haitians would be starving, so they shouldn't complain while we literally feed their kids.

Tldr: Haiti meets the definition of a shithole, by being both dirty and unpleasant, so Trump's comment was not inaccurate, and Haiti shouldn't complain by biting the hand that (Literally) feeds them."	0	81

While there is little chance of resurrecting a T-Rex or other dinosaur, we may be only a few years away from seeing a mammoth or saber-tooth walking the Earth again.  

Many people fear this and some are even actively working to prevent this from ever happening.

Some people argue that the introduction of foreign animals into an ecosystem would do much more damage than good. 

Less common but incredibly vocal are the people that see such experiments as an affront to God or Nature. 

Other people say that funds wasted on resurrecting an extinct animal could be better spent on conserving living animals.

I for one would be overjoyed to see news of living woolly mammoth walking the Earth again.  I also believe such an announcement would result in massive funding influx from private sources that could result even more scientific advances. These advances could have benefits for humans far beyond what we can imagine. 

A perfect example of such unforeseen advances are the many benefits brought about by the Space Race.  There are far too many to list here, but [Wikipedia lists perhaps over a hundred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies). I fully believe such spinoffs in biology would greatly benefit mankind.

Whenever the film cuts back to Michael I hate it, because I think it's a melodramatic pause from the good story. Part III is a consistent movie IMO, with the only inconsistency being a bad performance from Sofia Coppola. I think the drama is intriguing and Andy Garcia does a great job. 

TL;DR Although the Vito storyline in II is probably my favorite plot in the trilogy, the other plot is boring, whereas III is more consistent.

p.s. Godfather I trumps both II and III by a mile IMO.

These anti-whaling groups do not take into account the isolation of these areas which makes it impossible or impractical for a person to sustain themselves on a store bought diet.

I hope this finds you well!

Legislation was recently passed in Scotland to have a 50p minimum unit price of alcohol.  

Their Health Minister said that the driving reason for this is to cut alcohol-related deaths by 392 in the first 5 years and hospital admissions by 8,254 cases.

Having the minimum unit price will significantly raise the price of cheap, high-alcohol drinks, which heavy drinkers tend to buy. 

My opinion is that this won't change the behaviour of those individuals that abuse alcohol, as their craving will be too strong to deter them.

Instead this will just result in a further financial squeeze to those people that can enjoy alcohol in moderation. 

Thanks for your time either way!

animal shelters/activists tend to pick up stray animals in order to rescue them from the streets. they claim to save them from hunger, poor hygiene and loneliness. sometimes it will suffer from hurtful medical condition which is costly to treat.

animals feel pain but they are not humans in the sense that they do not have the same metaphysic needs, such as excelling at work, philantroping or refining there eloquent thoughts about doing better as a being...

i think it's safe to assume that their conception of death is more like ancient humans who were sad but not alianited by it, opposite to our society which hides its deaths in hospitals and bursts with grief for celebrities that undergo the most common thing there is. that's why i feel  saving as much (urban) animal lives as possible is pointless.

sometimes the animal has some medical condition, which means it'll die sooner. treating wilk be a waste of money and sometimes cause painful recovery process. if the animal suffers its best, i think, to put it down.

i see on social media a lot of people who ask for emergency money to support their adopted pets, often more then few,  whom they took out of will to help the animal. like family planning, i think taking an animal with no means to treat it is selfish and irresponsible, while the better option is leaving it in the ecosystem it originally came from.

i love animals and act by it - veganism, owning adopted dog, keeping beauty cruelty free. but i theorize that adopting because of the ""animal needs"" is actually more selfish, done by people who wants to feel good with themselves when actually doing more harm.

im totally for adopting and not buying, as long as you have the means to treat it. if a stray animal look like it's in major pain - if you can't afford a vet, human painkillers can get queted and brought out of context, or become the empathic solution in this situation.

thank you for reading this far,

looking forward to read your thoughts in return and broaden my point of view :)"	3	28

I based this on the surprising primary results in 2014 that had an unknown Zephyr Teachout get 34%, mostly from upstate, winning nearly every county upstate while Cuomo got 80% of the vote in the five boroughs. Such a lopsided victory for Cuomo in the five boroughs depends on the primary voters continuing to support Establishment candidates, rather than any upstart candidates like Ocasio-Cortez and Cynthia Nixon.
  
Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez winning by  nearly 20%, means that actress and education activist Cynthia Nixon will likely receive the same voters that voted for Teachout plus those primary voters who would vote against the Establishment like Crowley and Cuomo. I would like to add that State Senator Jose Peralta is also very much in danger if there’s a primary challenge due to his involvement in the IDC (Cuomo’s useful excuse to not implement more progressive policies) which had a fake resolution mediated by Joe Crowley and is nearly entirely within Crowley/Ocasio-Cortez’s 14th district.
  
On the state primary night in September, I will likely repost this CMV to brag, but maybe there’s something I’m not seeing.
  
CMV: As goes the 14th of NY congressional district, so goes the gubernatorial Democratic primary.

- Political extremism becoming common politics, and politicians encouraging this to secure votes.

- An older generation who actively wants life to be harder for incoming generations, it seems to have moved beyond ""oh those kids are a bit lazy"" to active hatred. 

-The accumulation of wealth into small blocks, and also the acceleration of that accumulation, which implies it will keep getting worse until something explosively collapses. 

The fact that the spread of ""good"" cultures by western standards has stopped, and corrupt and totalitarian regimes are moving into positions of power in the world. 

- The increased ability to kill massive numbers of people, coupled with a more aggressive stance on actually using that power (the decay of nuclear nonproliferation and No first use policies). 

- The reemergence of nationalism, not an issue of political left vs right, but of the link between nationalism and war. 

- The fact that the current world model of outsourcing production to poor countries is inevitably on a clock, and we'll need something to replace it by the time poor countries run out, the only solutions I can see require the suspension of human greed, which I think is impossible.

**First reason (applies to non-sexual ddlg and other dom/subs):** I think that an able-minded person relying on someone else to make personal decisions for them is psychologically unhealthy because it means refusing to develop psychologically and handle their adult responsibilities/take care of themselves and puts those responsibilities on someone else.

I think that someone making personal decisions for someone who is mentally able is like the super-ultra version of a codependent relationship.

So it hurts everybody.

**Second reason:** Sexualizing adults acting like children sexualizes children.

I'll compare to how a vlogger transitioning FTM answers the question, “Why transition to be gay?”\*

He says that before he transitioned, men he would date would respond to him as if he were a female when he really wasn’t. Transitioning allows him to be with people who are attracted to the person he actually is and who he is as a man.

My point about ddlg is that daddies are relating to littles as if they were children when they are actually adults. The part of the little that attracts them is the child part. If it wasn’t the child part that attracted them, I don’t see why they wouldn’t just do dom/sub without the age play/regression.

**I'm totally open to other perspectives on this!**

\*Video link: [https://youtu.be/B-Ty5lok0tk](https://youtu.be/B-Ty5lok0tk) (this person does not endorse my opinion!).

**TL;DR: ddlg is unhealthy because it keeps people in super-ultra codependent relationships instead of growing up and it sexualizes children.**

While I was there, the staff were making out like anything other than a diamond will basically be a piece of garbage.

Having no knowledge of these things, I almost agreed to purchase quite a sizeable diamond which would have blown my budget. In my mind, why buy the jewellery at all of it's just going to look like cheap trash...

Luckily, I didn't. I've now done some research into moisanitte and white sapphires and I'm really struggling to understand why diamonds are worth anything at all.

Moisanitte gems are rated on the same colour and clarity scale as diamonds so visually they conform to the same standards. Yes, a diamond is a 10 on the mohs scale, but a moisanitte is a 9.6.

Regarding the price, I was offered a visibly yellow diamond, uncertified, enhanced (has had silicone injected) 0.8ct for $1900. I can buy a 1.25ct moisanitte, perfect clarity, same cut for $700.

When trying to find out why diamonds are worth more it appears to be for two reasons:

1. About a decade ago, a diamond company (de beers I think it was) spent millions on an advertising campaign to promote them then raised the prices.

2. As a status symbol. Literally just so that people can say that ""their ring cost $17,000""

Based on that, the value of a diamond is only what we percieve it to be. If that were ever to change a lot of people will have worthless, albeit pretty, rocks on their hands that cost them the same as a house deposit. 

So please, change my mind. If you can't my girlfriend is getting a moissonite ring 😉"	438	166

Therefore, the means of production should be democratically controlled and resource management should be done via market principles.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9h2z0s/cmv_free_markets_vs_planned_economies_and/	"I'm leaning towards market socialism lately.

On the one hand, we know that planned economies don't work. Markets seem superior in every way for resource management, because they are decentralizing. 

On the other hand, democracies teach us the same lesson. All the various types seem to have been more successful than monarchies or dictatorships.

So democracy seems to be the most effective and successful way of governance and control over particular things that require control and definite decisions, also because they are decentralizing.

The two ideas are perfectly compatible, and they both teach us we are better off distributing the responsibility and power over everything.

The most basic idea behind socialism is that the ""means of production"", the things people need to live, should be democratically controlled. This seems very reasonable. 

Private property for profit is exactly the same process as an authoritarian planned economy trying to consolidate more power towards itself. It's self-serving and inefficient. 

Why would it be any better than democratic control by representatives elected by the community, just because ""its private property""? This is dogmatic. 

To me, this is a basic contradiction and a violation of the same pro-market principles used to justify it. 

All the motivations for innovation and efficiency are there in democratic control. 

Nothing changed except the notion of ""profit"", which in this broader scope plays the same role as ""political power"" in authoritarian regimes."	9	11

Well how is it the consumers fault that they are not making enough money?

It would make more sense to me to even blame the employee for not working harder to find a better paying job (not the main point). 

The equivalent would be expecting kids to bring in money to give to underpaid teachers, which makes a lot more sense to me as students in public schools are not paying teachers for their service.

I've seen it a few times, a guy for whatever reason is completely non existant to women in his 20s (mostly a combination of shyness and about average looks), he is the kind of guy that *wants* a relationship (like most of the people out there) and grows more desperate by the year. Then his 30s come and suddenly women start noticing him, he gets into a relationship, and then settles for the first woman he has ever been with in a long long time. The woman turns out to be trash of a human being, but the guy thinks he is so lucky to have found someone and she is the best he will ever get so he stays together for 10 or more years. Basically he settles for the first gal that has showed him some interest maybe ever.

I believe a guy like this would be happier if he would never date anyone ever, since he hasn't developed the skills necessary to screen people properly and will most likely fall prey to a woman that is a terrible human being.

Why do I think he will necessarily fall for this kind of a woman as there are plenty of nice 30 something or whatever somethings women out there? There are plenty of formerly young and pretty and shallow women who have got together with rich and shallow men in their 20s, men who have stayed rich and shallow, but women have stayed young and pretty, so they have parted their ways. These women, understandablly, go desperate pretty fast and figure they won't find anyone rich to care for them anymore, so they reduce and reduce their expecations until we get to the level of maybe well of single guys, and who is easier than the guy who won't even try to court anyone anymore? Give him some attention and he is yours to keep.

All is well and good, if she is a decent enough person, but chances are that someone who has been pampered with expensive material things from a young age up until then will not find joy in anything less than she had before and often times the guy will not be able/struggle to hold her to her standarts of living.

So to repeat myself a bit. It is great if a guy like this finds a girl he matches with later in life, but the odds are he won't, as he just doesn't have the skills necessary to do so. He is overwhelmingly more likely to be snatched by someone who has nothing to them except past beauty and he being as unexperienced as he is will think this is all there is to it and will settle for it.

I believe a guy like this would be way happier and even happy overall if he just got to terms that he ought to stay single forever and just work on his platonic relationships or whatever that truly gives him joy and meaning in life."	0	34

However, I see WAY too many people on social media doing irresponsible things with them. Waving them around in stupid videos, posting pictures of them “dressed up”, and posts mocking basic gun safety like locking your shit up. This level of reckless irresponsibility not only makes you look like an idiot, but is fodder for liberals who are scared of guns (that said, I am 100% in support of better background checks and mental health screenings for gun owners, especially those who hoard guns). Anyone who has ever been in the military, or even taken a gun safety class, should know that guns aren’t toys, and you treat your weapons with respect, yet many people don’t seem to understand this. 

I guess what I’m asking is for someone to defend the viewpoint that their guns are their right and they can use them how they like.

They’re cited as being deep and conveying a message, as well as being masters of their instruments.

To me, they are incredible self-indulgent. They write music that is likely more enjoyable for them to play than for their audience to listen to.
Their messages may differ from the typical “I love you” type songs that most artists stick to, but are they really that deep? There are plenty of artists with songs that have much stronger messages than songs like Another Brick in the Wall (just one example song), and with much more complex musicality. 

I think that a chunk of the adoration for Pink Floyd comes from the nostalgia, another chunk comes from their music being so hand-in-hand with drug use (really, this music is not aimed at sober people), and a lot of it is people who got into it as a kind of music snobbery (“music used to be soooo much better back then!”)

Of course, music is subjective. Many people genuinely enjoy Pink Floyd, which is completely fair. But I get so sick of people insulting other bands and glorifying Pink Floyd (looking at you, WatchMojo). 

Pink Floyd are terribly overrated."	2	47

If you're pro-life, easier access to contraception ensures that lower rates of unwanted pregnancies which should then lead to fewer abortions. If you're pro-choice, nobody *wants* unplanned pregnancies to occur, they just want women to have the option available so that a mistake doesn't ruin their lives. 

That being said, I don't see how anyone could be against increased or even universal access to contraception and birth control in particular. Yes condoms are readily available and cheap, but 1) condoms don't feel good so a lot of people make the stupid mistake of not using one, and 2) [birth control is more effective than condoms](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/bc-chart.html). It seems that both sides would either benefit from or support fewer unwanted pregnancies, so why would anyone ever not support increased access to contraception? 

Edit: Wow this post blew up overnight. Most of the arguments I'm seeing against my view is that since condoms are both cheap and easily accessible that we do have some form of universal access to contraception, or that universal access to the pill would inevitably mean that it would be provided through tax dollars. My problems with this are I've said, condoms aren't immensely effective and work ~ 82% of the time, and while not wanting your tax dollars to go into funding the pill is absolutely a valid and reasonable view to have, neither of these views actually solve the problem of how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. I'd like to open up the discussion and ask those of you opposed to funding the pill with tax dollars how you would propose we lower the rates of unplanned pregnancy. If anyone can come up with a reasonable solution that doesn't involve the use of tax spending I will gladly give a delta. Thanks for the reasonable dialogue so far everyone!                "	105	113

The Citizens United v. FEC (2010) case is famous in US political debates.  The basic issue is that a non-profit corporation made a movie criticizing a politician right before an election, and that violated US campaign finance law.  The Supreme Court majority opinion said there was a First Amendment right for a corporation (or union) to air political commercials during the period before an election, despite the fact that a small portion of the nonprofit's funding came from for-profit corporations.

Here is how the majority opinion by Kennedy states the problem with the federal law restricting speech:

&gt;The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.

My view is that any legal or constitutional fix that allows Congress to enforce 2 USC Section 441b against business corporations would also infringe on individual speech or free press.

I will clarify that I am not talking about infringing the right of people to form a corporation for business purposes and then have that business corporation exercise its speech rights.  Although I think freedom of speech applies to anybody regardless of identity - whether foreign or not, convicted felon or not, facilitated by a business entity or not - I am not making that argument here.   I am making a collateral damage argument: if you try to excise for-profit corporate speech, you will affect a not-insubstantial amount of individual speech or freedom of the press.

I am not asking you to change my philosophical view of free speech, since that is pretty firmly held and I am not terribly open to changing it.  I am asking you to change my view of whether it is legally or conceptually possible to target just the one kind of business corporation speech without attacking individual speech or freedom of the press.  I believe that even terrible policy ideas can be conceptually possible, so I am open to changing my view from ""it's not really possible"" to ""it's possible but still a terrible idea.""  But I do not see a clear way to isolate just business corporation speech from individual speech and press.

By ""individual speech,"" I am including the right to form a non-profit corporation or other community group, whether it's a big group like Planned Parenthood or the NRA or a small neighborhood organization.  By ""freedom of the press,"" I am referring both to the right of the people to print expressive materials like books, pamphlets and newsletters generally, and to the right to operate journalistic enterprises specifically, whether meant to be objective or opinionated.

There are many different proposed solutions that are a threat to individual free expression or freedom of the press.

* *Status quo ante*.  We could imagine somehow a change to the Constitution or the Court that allows a do-over and Section 441b is back in force with no other changes.  That directly violates individual free speech because it allows the government, for certain election-related speech, to ban your movie or seize your books or destroy your pamphlets if your nonprofit was funded by even one dollar from a for-profit corporation.  That is incompatible with free speech.  Imagine if a major nonprofit political group, which supports all the things you like, were one day silenced because a single for-profit company, owned by a visionary corporate leader who says all the right things and has all the right political friends and all the right political enemies, made a small contribution of cash or supplies.  I think most of us can see how that would be really restrictive of free speech for all the individuals who contributed to that worthy nonprofit.
* ""Money is not speech.""  A straight amendment that ""money is not speech"" would be incredibly broad and would per se threaten individual speech.  In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Court said, ""*A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached*.""  If we were to take it outside the realm of speech and say ""money is not religion,"" would anyone dispute that a ban on spending money to publish bibles or build temples is inconsistent with freedom of religion?  If you told people they have the right to protest, but they are not allowed to spend any money on signs or flags or matching t-shirts or even travel expenses to attend the protest, I think most of us can see that would pretty clearly restrict their right to protest.
* ""End corporate personhood.""  Aside from the chaos this could cause to civil lawsuits and to anybody investing in the stock market, this rule might not stop a non-corporate entity or informal group from publishing an ad.  This really depends on the specifics, but unless you have a ""money is not speech"" rule, ending corporate personhood really does not do anything directly for speech and so does not itself reverse the outcome of the Citizens United case.  There is no way to enforce Section 441b banning corporate speech if there are no more corporations.  That said, a broad rule here might be so sweeping that it makes it very difficult for groups of citizens to form any kind of community group or issue advocacy group, which would violate the individual's right to create a group to spread their own speech.  Most of these proposals are coupled with a ""money is speech"" amendment as a shortcut.
* ""No speech for any corporations.""  This obviously violates individual free speech.  If you start a neighborhood group to protest something like police brutality or pollution or tax policy or zoning policy in your neighborhood, and you want to advertise which candidates agree with you and which ones disagree, then ""no speech for any corporations"" applies to your little community nonprofit.  It also applies to corporations practicing journalism, so it violates freedom of the press.
* ""No speech for for-profit corporations.""  This is a common proposal to try to protect political entities and target business entities.  If it lets the government stifle the speech of for-profit corporations, then most news organizations and journalistic outfits could be restricted, imperiling freedom of the press.  It also opens up the possibility of a non-profit created by a for-profit corporation, which allows it to circumvent the rule, meaning that business speech is in practice slightly hampered but not very restricted.
* ""No speech for for-profit corporations or non-profits funded by for-profit corporations.""  This is fairly similar to the status quo ante (pre 2010) and the same criticism applies. The problem here is that this rule quickly gets broad and endangers lots of individual speech done through nonprofit activist groups.  For example, if your community nonprofit raises money locally to fight an important issue, and it raises some of its money from a few small businesses in the neighborhood, you have now invalidated free speech for the whole group.  The nonprofit is tainted by a little bit of business speech, and all those individuals' speech rights are restricted just so Congress can target the threat of business corporation speech.  This is the twist directly confronted in the Citizens United case and the one that distinguished it from earlier cases.  The twist was that a ""small portion"" of its funding came from for-profit corporations.  The case FEC v. MCFL (1986) had already found Section 441b invalid as applied to nonprofit corporations, but that holding did not extend to nonprofit corporations that received any money from for-profit corporations.  The Court in 2010 extended protection to Citizens United despite their de minimis for-profit funding.
* ""No speech for any corporations except for journalism.""  Sometimes people try suggest this modification to the ban on corporate speech but it does not seem to be offered in good faith and includes almost no effort to grapple with the inconsistency of it.  Specifically, the inconsistency of making it illegal for corporations to publish news and opinions about elections, with an exception if that corporation publishes LOTS of news and opinions about elections.  Really, it turns on the definition of journalism or freedom of the press.  But it seems that either this journalism/press exception waters everything down and does not target business speech or it gives Congress the power to ban journalism outfits it disagrees with and abandons freedom of the press.
* ""Only natural persons have rights.""  This is basically a different way of presenting the ""no speech for any corporations"" rule but it tries to emphasize that it wants individuals to retain speech rights.  Whatever other problems and consequences of this rule, it never seems like it would work unless your intention is also to stop corporations from funding individual speech.  If corporations lack speech rights but humans have speech rights, then you could circumvent a corporate speech restriction by having the individual filmmaker or author or pamphleteer do the speech activity.  The documentary could be published and disseminated by the documentarian, using funds raised by the corporation and paid over to the filmmaker.  To the extent you block an individual from seeking funding for their own speech, you are restricting their speech rights.  Of course, with crowdfunding mechanisms it is not too difficult to imagine getting around the restriction anyway, by having the corporation promote the cause but all the money skips the corporation and goes from individual to individual.  So either the rule is effective at restricting business speech and it also restricts individual speech, or the rule is ineffective at restricting business speech because other funding mechanisms are able to circumvent your rule.

There are probably other variations but these are the major ones of which I am aware."	3	27

&amp;#x200B;

Sure there are emotional benefits to a long term relationship. But there aren't extra benefits for men on top of an emotionally committed relationship that exclusively comes with marriate.

The security marriage itself brings is only for the woman. She gets to enjoy financial guarantee of sharing income when men often make more than women, and she can be assured of his fidelity - it's backed up by government enforcement... women rarely are punished for fucking another guy and being impregnated at the level men are, and often the man in the marriage gets cucked and is made responsible for raising another man's child.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Men are bringing unnecessary vulnerabilities on themselves when they marry a woman in modern US courts.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone can reliably demonstrate that marriage gives more potential benefit to men than potential harm, I would believe marriage brings more benefit than harm to men. And to be clear, I'm not talking about long term relationships, I'm talking about specifically signing a marriage document and putting the law behind the union."	0	106

Following the Israeli victory, they occupied the Heights as a matter of national security, and have recently been moving to annex them formerly.

Many people say that this annexation is unwarranted, unjust, or illegal. However, precedence shows that this is not the case. Following World War 2, the USSR and Poland annexed about a fourth of Germany, and forcibly expelled some ten million people from their homes (including those expelled from other neighboring nations like Czechia). International law views this annexation as valid.

If international law views the annexation of Eastern Germany by a nation that had been on the receiving end of aggression as valid, then it follows that the annexation of the Golan Heights by a nation that had been on the receiving end of aggression is likewise valid.

Either both are valid, or both are invalid.

You don’t stand to harm others, you only risk hurting yourself.

You can go rock climbing, skydiving, wingsuiting, rally driving and so on. 99% of the time nothing happens, and no harm is done. The same goes for drugs.

The war on drugs has done more harm than good. People who start out abuse drugs are usually doing pretty bad, and they cover up the void. That drug use only perpetuates the problem. You start failing economically, your social life declines, and the ditch just becomes too deep, so you can’t get out.

People have bad mental health, and self-medicate. I’ve been there. For me it was weed, for my grandfather it was alcohol, for some it is meth, and there are several other addictive behaviours in completely normal things, that are used to cover up a mental wound, something that hurts. Just like you get painkillers for a wound to numb the pain.

In every single drug, the abuse percentage is roughly 10%. Most users use it recreationally and only once in a while. A small part of users use it compulsively at some point in their lives.

The drug isn’t the problem, it lies in mental health. One in four people will suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime.

Now, I don’t use drugs compulsively. I do it with friends sometimes. Sometimes I might light up a joint to unwind after work, and sometimes I take psychedelics, to expand my understanding of myself, and the world around me.

What I do at home harms doesn’t harm a single soul. What I do with my friend is nothing but bonding and fun. 

People should be allowed to do what they want, and even **if** it poses a risk, they should be allowed to do it, just as rock climbing or skydiving poses a risk.

I’d seriously like to expand my understanding of the arguments for why this shouldn’t be. We live in a world where it isn’t, and as such, I’d like to understand why.

Also, these people don't have a single clue about daily life of normal people, thus they wouldn't even think about taking about disfunctional public transports or low wages. 

Random activists also are given air time on big media when their fights are about climate change.

Protests on climate change are often encouraged and or seen as good by governments (I read an article explaining how the French government was fighting hard against the yellow vests protests - which are about wages, poverty, inequality - while AT THE SAME time let several huge protests about climate change doing their stuff in Paris, and the big pro government media in France were covering them in a positive way).

Even more, the yellow vests were also attacked with the argument that they are non environment friendly (the whole mess started with demands about gas prices). 

******'

My current ideas : there is a general consensus from western governments that protests about climate change are ""harmless"", they don't hit on the serious stuff (poor working people demand their government to stop pandering to their rich friends). As such, the whole narrative will shift and encourage media / global mind / trends to focus on ""protesting climate change"" instead of anything else.

I think that governments know that when ""we"" protests climate change we don't challenge our governments, we protest ""the wind"". 

In the near future, media and governments will push the narrative that the only valid protest is the one about climate change, if you protest anything else, you want to kill earth and bees.

Employers don't want you to have a college degree because it shows how much money you have, they want you to have one because it shows you had enough grit to get through college. Even though free college would mean that more people have college degrees, this wouldn't mean that your post secondary education was devalued, it would just mean that other people are now more competitive. Plus the argument seems borderline to be saying ""if college was free, I would have to compete with poor people who before didn't have the means to compete for my job, making it more difficult for me to be employed."" I know people aren't actually thinking this when making the argument, but it seems to me that that is unconsciously their main concern.

I've seen this argument made enough times that I'm wondering if there's any actual substance to it and I'm missing something or if their's something about job applications I don't understand.

Edit: Grammar

Edit: I understand my definition of devalue was a bit iffy. I was using it more of the sense that although the price of bread can change depending on how much of it their is, its value for treating hunger is still always constant, so bread can't be devalued. I've already given out a delta for my definition being flawed so no more will be given out for explaining the same thing."	8	58

That sounds ridiculous! It is clear that George Bush is White, Bobby Jindal is Indian (from India), and Herman Cain is Black. They look visually different and should not be granted the same affirmative action benefits due to each one facing different racial and sociological issues.

Sure, you can argue that there are cultural, linguistic, and religious similarities between the two, but there are also cultural, linguistic, and religious similarities between White Americans and Black Americans and they don't get grouped up as the same ethnicity under some ""British"" identity.

&amp;#x200B;

So this whole Hispanic/Latino thing has been this long running euphemistic attempt to avoid calling the brown people coming from Latin America what most of them really are, mixed-race and instead you have this obfuscating ""Hispanic"" neologism that arbitrarily groups individuals of different races together just because of nationality and inadvertently gives minority representation to a bunch of people who are genetically 95+% European instead of the dark-skinned ones who really need it. White Hispanics should just identify as White and nothing else. Yeah they're different from your typical White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, but so are Italian Americans and Greek Americans and they don't get their own category, they are just White too. On all American racial censuses, the multiracial and brown-skinned immigrants that come from the Mestizo majority places like Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, etc. should mark the new Mestizo category, which would signify a mixed-race person of non-English speaking origins. Mulattoes (Half-Black and Half-White people) from Cuba, Dominican Republic, etc. can either also choose the Mestizo category, or just mark Black and White (Multiracial) on the US Census. Black Latinos should just mark Black on racial censuses. Again they are culturally different from African-Americans, but so are Jamaican-Americans and Nigerian-Americans and they mark Black too. Fully Amerindian Latinos can just mark Native or ""Some Other Race"" if they're not comfortable with that.

&amp;#x200B;

To change my view, you have to stipulate either why Hispanic/Latino is a better term to categorize people than Mestizo is, or you have to explain a better solution you have than adding the Mestizo category."	3	23

For those who do not know what MMT is, in brief it is the idea that the government as a money creating entity can not enter debt and it is not financially limited by money, it is only limited by inflation and the material wealth of the country. Government spending is simply the creation of new money, it does not need to collect money to spend like you or I would. However if the government does this in excess we run into the problem of hyperinflation since there is too much money floating around. To solve this the government has to delete money from the economy through things like taxes. 

It works like this, imagine you could create money out of thin air and someone hands you $5. You don't need that $5 to buy anything since you can create money so you burn it deleting $5 from the economy. Even if you were to spend that $5 it's just money you didn't have to create, effectively deleting $5 that would have entered the economy. 

While taxation is one way to delete money, another way is to store money without reinvesting it. Lets say I bury $5 in my back yard, as far as the economy is concerned that money is deleted until I dig it back up and spend it again as it is no longer circulating through the economy.

My idea is that rather than using taxation to limit the money supply we simply delete money from the economy by not reinvesting it and this is where nationalization of the banks comes in. By nationalizing the banks, the government controls how much of the money invested into it gets reinvested into the economy. As stated earlier since money that isn't reinvested is effectively deleted until spent again, all the government has to do is not invest with your money and it will be deleted from the economy thus limiting inflation and removing the need for taxation. Private banks won't do this since their incentive is to spend as much money as possible but the federal government does not have a profit incentive. This could also be used in tandem with taxation if necessary. 


This is an idea I've been floating around for awhile and I want to see if it's feasible or if it could be refined further. If anything is confusing I'll try to explain but I'm not an economist.

EDIT: I'm going to bed and will try to respond to more questions in the morning, but it seems I forgot to clarify something. Under this system nobody is stopping you from withdrawing and depositing money, that's not how my system works."	0	53

But for most other situations with moderate to significant risks I'm always hearing that ""it's better to to try and fail than to not try at all"" or ""it's better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all"" or some variation of that expressing a similar sentiment. I think that's absolutely crap to have as a general rule. Sometimes the pain of that failure or that loved loss far exceeds any regret you'd possibly have for not trying in the first place. I prefer to wallow in the ""what ifs"" than the certainty of ineptitude, loss or impossibility


Edit: so I'm adding one of my comment response to another Redditer to elucidate my views (as a lot of the responses I'm seeing are fairly similar and seem to assume I'm assuming take no risk at all) 


So thanks for such a well thought out response, I'll try my best to do the same tho admittedly I feel you're plagued by cliches (which is inevitable so i'm not berating you for this). 

Firstly clearly I'm not speaking about the extremes as ""general rules"" tend to break down at these points and these situations must typically be judged on a case by case basis. So situations with enormous risk and situations with little to no risks are excluded from this discourse. So what I'm specifically taking about is the average situations(moderate to significant risk) examples of which included: getting into relationships, applications for positions/jobs, etc (hopefully this is clear now)

Secondly I hope you understand that I'm using "" failure"" and ""loved loss"" as expressions of the general sentiment I'm arguing against rather than speaking specifically about failure and loss of loved ones etc (just want to make sure this is clear, not saying you don't understand)

Now what I'm saying isnt that you should avoid all situations that has average risk (remember this is the sphere we are working in, extremes are already exlcuded). That would lead to you doing nothing at all (except for no risk/minimal risk things) What I'm saying is that it is wrong to say that GENERALLY it is better for you to attempt things with average risk than to not. That sentiment is false to me. What I think is true is that everything in this average risk category must be judged on a case by case basis. And if the risk of failure is greater than chances of success AND the outcome of the failure (if it were to occur) is significant, then it is better to not try than to try it and risk failure. Now i'd like you to note that I think it is up to the individual to chose the threshold necessary for action and what outcome of failure they view as significant. 

So looking at it through this lens, I'm not saying you should do nothing at all or that failure/loss should be avoided at all cost. Far from it, I just think a lot of suffering is unnecessary and is perpetuated by this ""it is better to try and fail"" mindset that I view is wrong. It is kinda reminiscent of the sunken cost fallacy that many people fall prey to. (I hope I was able to be clear)"	0	24

Where I was born isn't something I was able to decide for myself, and I want my life to be what I make out of it, not what it decides for me. I believe the only way to belong to a country is to find one whose culture is similar to your own tastes and opinions, and to move there. What's the point in being proud of a country I was born in if I feel no attachment to how it's run or anything else?

But in my opinion wcw wasnt that bad. The midcard for wcw was good and it was very entertaining. There was solid talent around such as Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman. While booking may have not been the greatest 2000s wcw wasnt the worst thing and imo would pass off as a solid wrestling promotion in this time and only died because of just how powerful wwe had gotten


Wcw had an influx of talented wrestlers and if they were stable with profits plus if AOL after the buy out didn't full blown hate on wcw most likely Eric Bischoff could have taken over and ran it solidly. With a new investor it wouldnt have died. To put this in perspective they had AJ Styles in 2001 one of the best wrestlers in the world right now.  Plus great guys like DDP, Booker T, Sting, Goldberg, Nash. Also having young guys like the before mentioned Rey and Kidman, 3 count the boy band, Sean O'haire. This is a solid lineup of guys honestly that could easily do things also the underrated Buff Bagwell who could hold his own in the ring.


I'm willing to hear more on why it's a bad promotion as I am a fairly casual wrestling fan. I'm not super in depth with the business. I want to know more why people don't like 2000s wcw because right now I'm just very confused on all the hate."	0	6

I think many cops are good people doing a job that society needs, and I'm not here to say that every cop is bad  or violent or that we should abolish police.)

A study in the 90s found that about 40% of cops were reported for domestic violence as opposed to 10% of the general population. I know that study is outdated, and may not be entirely accurate, but it makes sense that cops would be more violent on average than regular people because the job naturally appeals to control freaks.

The job largely entails enforcing rules, giving people orders that they have to obey, and physically coercing them if they don't comply. Even if the cop's order is unlawful, you're generally advised to obey anyway and take it to court later. If someone is naturally power-hungry, this is the kind of job that would appeal to them.

Again, I'm not saying every cop is bad or violent. I think their job is necessary and I think a lot of cops are good people, but the job itself  attracts control freaks."	25	22

This often comes with the demand that the character of the built environment and demographics remain largely unchanged. 

The end result is the cost of market housing skyrocketing even faster, leaving an area full of very wealthy residents with enclaves of low income communities poorly served by government housing. All families with anywhere near an average income leave. 

The 'luxury housing' opposed by such groups is rarely actually luxurious sky villas with swimming pools inhabited by Martin skraelli. It is usually good quality housing built at market rates. The high cost is due to high land prices caused by not enough homes being built to meet demand. Unless enough housing is built, housing will never be 'affordable' it can only be subsidised. 

Under such conditions, the provision of enough subsidised housing is ruinously expensive for local governments, or is cross subsidised by demanding affordable units in market developments which pushes the price of market units even higher. Waiting lists for subsidised units increase and they are often overcrowded. 

There is also an element of reverse snobbery with anti Gentrification groups. Opposing people moving into the area of a different ethnicity or social class is very ironic for a supposedly progressive movement. 

The idea that the demographics of any area have, should or will remain largely unchanged is not realistic. And it would be a massive waste of public money to try and achieve it. Its just a progressive form of nimbyism. 

I understand these groups may be well intentioned, and that the shortage of housing is not solely from their opposition to it. I also firmly believe in government regulating markets if the end result is a better net outcome for society."	48	44

\- I rented a forklift to a customer. I have previously rented to this customer, we require all renters to carry insurance for the forklift. The forklift was stolen because the customer didn't secure the site well. the police response was ""check ebay and auction sites, you know forklifts better than i do.""

\- the business next to me was robbed. The police asked for my security footage. I went through it, couldn't see anything and told them that. They didn't have any further follow ups after that.

\- My employers car was stolen. using local contacts he managed to get the names of some people who might be involved. he also tracked the use of a credit card from the car and located a shopping centre they were buying products in. The police refused to follow up on those leads provided.

If you look at white people from European countries such as Germany, Ukraine, France, Switzerland, etc. you'll see that we have a very rich culture and amazing meals with alot of flavor.

In general, I find it very annoying when people assume that all white people act like white Americans but it stands out the most when people talk about food and culture.

The same should be done with Christmas- in my experience almost nobody has any genuine objection to being told merry Christmas, hell, I was discussing just today with a woman in a full hijab our favourite (largely secular) aspects of Christmas, all the while referring to things as “Christmas XYZ”. However if someone tells me they’d prefer happy holidays then I’ll just switch. Just like pronouns it literally makes no difference to me. 

You can change my view by showing me that knowingly using words that will make someone else feel less welcome or upset is not worth it compared to the potential loss I might feel at using a different term. Of course maybe you can come up with other arguments I’ve not thought of.

The resulting Constitution and the Bill of Rights gave birth to a new form of government that embodied the highest ideals of Enlightenment thinking. Or so we are told.   

This system of governance paid a lot of attention to matters of domestic affairs, yet despite their best intentions, the founders of America did not envision the Union’s eventual development into a global empire. 

The early 20th Century saw the unprecedented destructive powers of modern warfare and the deterioration of the European Powers. From the ashes the US emerged as a new global power and it is at this point, a separation of the Public State and the Deep State began to emerge, much out of necessity. 

At this point it would be useful to define my terms of the Deep State: ‘A perpetual force not influenced by electoral results, that holds great control in determining domestic and foreign action of the State. ‘

I believe there are two facets of this Deep State. The first is indirect and the second is direct. 

This indirect force comprised of Corporate giants, Wall Street interests, International banking interests, the military industrial complex, exerting its control through lobbyists, unelected government officials, organisations such as the Council of foreign relations, Trilateral commission and various foundations representing the disproportionately influential families of America. 

The indirect force combined holds all the keys to power for any politician. They provide campaign funding, the revolving door between government and private enterprise, the coverage and tone of mainstream media. No politician could continue their tenure without the majority support of this indirect force. 

The direct force of the Deep State is mostly manifested through certain branches of the FBI, the CIA and the Military. I believe at this stage, with so much public information about the clandestine activities of the CIA against both foreign powers and domestic citizens, the complicity of J Edgar Hoover in various nefarious plots are strong enough indicators that these organisations are not answerable to average citizens like ourselves. As part fo the executive arm of government, do they see themselves as being subservient to their Commander in Chief? The answer it seems, not necessarily. I believe their true motivation lies in a form of elitism embodied in the continuous  mission of their organisation to protect America’s place at the forefront of global hegemony. 

A great manifestation of the Deep State lies in its pivotal role in the exertion of foreign policies. The CIA which traces its roots to WWII in the capacity of OSS Office of Strategic service was originally a joint venture between the British MI6. When Truman signed into law the National Security act of 1947, CIA was born. In a the Bipolar climate of global power of its time, the CIA was the frontline against USSR in the subsequent decades of the Cold War. It established its global networks through pockets of convenience within the Marshall plan budget and retained solid ties with Wall Street. This is evidenced  by the first civilian appointment to the position of director a Mr Allen Dulles the brother of then Secretary of State under Eisenhower John Foster Dulles, both of whom worked In Kuhn, Loeb and Company, an investment giant in Wall Street with documented ties to Trotsky and Hitler. 

It is well documented today that the CIA was instrumental in financing coup against Mossadeq in Iran 1953, the Guatemalan civil war in 54, the Bay of Pigs in 61, Coup against the socialist government of Allende in Chile circa 72... MK ultra which drugged countless of American citizens with LSD and other psychoactive drugs, illegal wiretapping of various dissident groups, drug dealing in African American neighbourhoods... The list of the most abhorrent criminality is virtually endless. To quote Mike Pompeo “they lied, they cheated, they stole.. “ they should have added murder and torture to the list as well. 

All this is done under the name of America without the oversight of Congress. If that’s not a deep state in manifestation, I don’t know what is. In fact it should not even be controversial to talk about a Deep State that is not accountable to the people, we have ourselves to blame when we let clowns like Donald Trump cheapen the term and deflect us from the real issues at hand. 

The Deep State in this sense becomes a byproduct of Capitalism with Imperialist ambitions, operating unbridled for centuries which inevitably results in the concentration of wealth. This wealth is used to buy up politicians who knows not to bite the hand that feeds them. Institutions born out of elitism that see it as a duty to govern without being influenced by the capricious will of the masses. WIth the appearance of the Public State, America can do no wrong, we could collectively point at the silly Orangutang fresh out of office and use him as a scapegoat for the collective ills of our nation. With each exchange of power the slate is once again wiped clean until it inevitably gets filthy again."	0	8	0.37

Sure, a lot of stock brokers have lost millions on shorts because retail traders refuse to sell and are still buying, but they can afford to do so because they have enormous amounts of cash to rest on and because GME is clearly overvalued. GME’s market cap is several times its revenue, and the only reason it is that high is because of the artificial demand created by internet communities. At some point, sellers are going to fold and GME is going to collapse, and everybody that purchased it when it was overvalued is going to lose massive amounts of money, while Wall Street short sellers laugh their way to the bank.	27	76	0.81

In another vein, police often treat black girls as being older than their actual age and hold them to a higher standard than lighter girls.

This is because generally speaking a company's moral duty should be to maximize profit for it's shareholders and basically labor is an expense just like utilities and companies are supposed to minimize expenses to achieve this duty. 
This btw does not include small businesses where the only investor is the one owner of the business rather than a group of investors. 
In that case the owner would be free to raise wages as he wishes however unintelligent that may be. I still it is not a smart decision to raise wages significantly above the market rate in this situation if you are looking at the overall good. A small business with more profits can expand the business and hire more workers.
However in this post I am still trying to focus on businesses with many investors and how it is morally unacceptable for the board of directors or CEOs to decide to raise wages more than necessary to hire enough quality workers.

Edit: I just want to emphasize I'm talking about raisiwages when the current wages already help recruit more than enough high quality workers, because people are responding saying that paying workers enough helps them be more productive.. I already took that into account.. If you need 50 high quality workers and you can get them at $12 you should not raise wages to $15 if it won't make much of a difference in quality and if your only objective is to help workers financially or ""provide a living wage"""	0	130	0.25

Basically I think it’s more dangerous to be stationary on the side of the road (excluding parked cars for obvious reasons) regardless of the reason and have your hazard lights on, than to just indicate to the side of the road you’re waiting on. 

My reasoning for this is that if you approach this vehicle from behind and one set of lights is blocked, you may think that the vehicle is about to pull out into traffic, which causes unnecessary uncertainty. 

On the other hand if you see a stationary vehicle on the side of the road and you see no lights, you simply steer around it, which is the intended point anyway.

There is an old adage that your right to swing your arm ends where my nose begins. This is a way of saying that rights have limitations: specifically where they infringe upon the rights of others. 

And that, alone, should be enough to quiet vaccination discord. Because being unvaccinated in a pandemic that has brought the world to a shuddering halt is, essentially, swinging your arm around in a crowded room like a five year old child, and acting surprised when there are nosebleeds and disconcerted people around you. 

But I’m more curious about the implication of body autonomy, as a quintessential human right, and how that bleeds over into the philosophy of suicide. 

We’ve all heard the statistic, that every single Golden Gate Bridge jumper who survived says they ‘instantly regretted’ jumping. They say at that moment, they realised every other problem in their life could be fixed, except jumping. 

But the antivax crowd is leaning on the idea of a human right that, by extension, would mean that we should not, and in fact, cannot, help people who want to commit suicide, at any age, for any reason. 

I find that absurd. Especially considering all of the research showing just how impulsive the act of suicide is generally considered by psychologists to be. Something like 90% of suicide survivors do not die from suicide later. Further evidence that it is not a decision they’d make twice. 

While it can’t be denied there are considerable pressures, political and otherwise, pushing an antivax narrative, which is inevitably going to be picked up by some proportion of the population, I think it’s worth addressing what seems at first glance to be the bedrock assumptions behind their logic. 

If we all have the right to suicide, at any time, and this right supercedes all other rights, then the pilot of MH370 was morally superior to someone who gets vaccinated due to a mandate, because his right to suicide was greater than the rights of all of his passengers to life. 

To CMV, I guess I'd need someone to explain a moral system where a Typhoid Mary was the good guy."	0	94	0.32

For those unfamiliar, “service roads” are complimentary roads on either side of a Main Street separated by medians, usually with a lower speed limit. 

The theory is that they make it safer/easier to go into businesses along a main street. 

The problem is they are actually *more* dangerous and make driving more difficult as well. 

Picture this, you’re driving on your city’s Main Street, going to Home Depot. Let’s assume it’s coming up on the right for simplicity sake. You either need to move into the service lane (while watching out for traffic going *both* directions in said service lanes) and have to stop at several stop signs along the way. 

Or you wait til you’re at the intersection, assuming there’s even an opening at an intersection, and once again have to cross over a set of lanes where traffic is going both directions. It adds unnecessary complexity, and more so, it adds additional points at an intersection where a crash can occur. It’s even more dangerous to do a left turn. This objectively makes service roads less safe than simply not having them. 

Due to the difficulty of use and the dangerous nature of it, no one really uses the service roads in my city, not on purpose anyway. Usually you end up on one by accident and it makes life hell. Getting out of the service lane to go onto the main road is also *extremely* dangerous. 

It’s a waste of space, they’re too hard to use, and they’re dangerous. There should be bus lanes or bike lanes in their place instead."	0	23	0.14

Just from the get go, I want to say that I am rather on the left as opposed to being on the right or liberal. What I am about to say, therefore, is targeted as people who lean left but it is applicable to anyone. 

I have a feeling a lot people are going to disagree but here me out on this one but, I don’t really subscribe to the received definition of tone policing. If we go to my favorite source, Wikipedia, we find this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing). If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing, check out this quote: 

*Tone policing has been described by one writer as ""when someone (usually a privileged person) in a conversation or situation about oppression shifts the focus of the conversation from the oppression being discussed to the way it is being discussed. Tone policing prioritizes the comfort of the privileged person in the situation over the oppression of the disadvantaged person.""*

This to me seems a rather narrow definition? Tone policing is a lot of things. The term “mansplaining” is policing the tone of arrogant and pompous men with privilege who try to talk down to people. When we use the word “mansplain” we are criticizing pretentious men for their condescending tone. A similar case is the use of the term “Karen”. What are Karens? They are women who demand things in an overly aggressive and entitled manner or tone, right? I think that there are few rational people that would argue that men should never try to explain things, or women should never raise valid concerns about customer service. The terms “mansplain” and “Karen” exist to police tone. 

What’s more, no one likes being tone policed. Mansplainers would never admit that they’re mansplaining, Karens would never admit that they are Karening. And it’s not hard to understand why. When we use these terms, we are changing the focus of what they are they are trying to say to how they are saying it. We are not listening to them. 

But I would argue that’s OK. Because no one wants to listen to something that is being said in a rude, condescending or confrontational tone. Not your partner, not your kids, not your parents, not your teachers, not your students, and certainly not your audience. Tone policing is OK. 

But there is a qualitative difference when tone policing is done by privileged people to marginalized people, right? 

Yes and no. I understand that not everyone has equal access to power and a lot of people have perfectly valid reasons to lose their temper when someone inadvertently insults them in a demeaning and dehumanizing manner. However, this does not change fundamental facts of human nature and human behavior. Think about it for a second. People who are insulting can be insulting in one of two ways, purposefully and inadvertently. Let’s look at inadvertently first. 

Imagine that someone, an African-American woman, is offended by a middle aged coworker who uses some horrifically outdated and tone deaf but ultimately innocuous phrase like, “forshizzle”. Yuck.

And this is infuriating. I get that. But what is the proper way to deal with this? To shout at the coworker? To berate and belittle them? What will that achieve? Most like fear and resentment about being publicly embarrassed about something that they did not intend to mean as offensive. That does not mean that we should let the offending coworker off the hook. But it does mean that we should be careful with our tone. Because if we don’t, we run the risk of alienating a lot of people who might otherwise be sympathetic. 

What about people who are intentionally offensive? What about racists, white supremacists, and alt-right trolls? Surely we can unleash our rage and fury on them, right? 

Wrong. And it’s not hard to understand why. Just think about it. If you are someone who finds themselves on the non-Trumpian side of American and world politics, I’m willing to bet you love watching videos of Karens throwing tantrums, or popular subreddits like r/insanepeoplefacebook or r/neckbeards or which are devoted to mocking privileged and entitled people. It’s funny to watch people lose their shit, isn’t it?

So, if you are someone deplores the rise of bigoted, intolerant, nativist politicians (like me), you’ll probably want to police your tone and the tone of your ostensible allies a bit *more*, rather than less. Throwing a tantrum, calling names, losing your cool is playing directly into the hands of your opponents. You are making yourself look ridiculous when you do that. You are making yourself look like them. 

But, one might say, it’s natural and healthy to express anger and frustration. Perhaps, in personal relationships, but not really in professional settings and certainly not in political ones. We are in for a bumpy decade and the last thing we need is to act as though losing one’s cool is a righteous political expression. Let’s work more on being measured, calm and ruthless in the pursuit of our goals. Contrapoints has a great video about this.

It is not authorship either, here. Instead I believe copyright encourages plagiarism and copycats get more attention.

The present internet is underdeveloped, so that it is possible to set up paywalls. As the internet progresses, it will be more decentralised, making it impossible to enforce copyright laws.

The problem is how the industry should be financed, in the future where it is not possible or acceptable to do advertising, or it doesn't need to.

This is scary because the carbon footprint of each of these space expeditions is extremely high due to the amount of fuel they use, the energy used to manufacture the fuel, and the soot generated which pollutes and damages the atmosphere while heating up the earth.

To me, space tourism seems like just an obscene display of power and wealth. With so many problems on earth, such as climate change and the pandemic, their money can be used more productively.

The one constant was Poe, as he’s an AI, and had no physical embodiment, and was beloved by many, he had significantly more screen time. 


The reason Takeshi Kovacs was in a different sleeve was actually explained, at the end of the last episode, he had cleared Ryker of the charges he was framed for and Ryker would be spun back up and want his sleeve back which Takeshi was riding. 


People had become attached to Joel Kinnaman and his performance of Takeshi Kovacs, and didn’t like the sudden change to him being portrayed by a totally different actor. Anthony Mackie did a good job, and the second series was good in it’s own right, people just didn’t like the change from season one.


However, the nature of the show, the ability to avoid real death by having your consciousness (DHF) stored in a stack and resleeved into a new body kind of made this aspect unique and predictable.

Instead of using Google and Facebook, users will create their own digital ecosystems. Hmm sounds a lot like the punk subculture that rejected postmodernism and consumerism in the 80s and 90s. 

Don't buy CD's. Make your own vinyl records! Don't buy music. Make your own music! Don't buy food. Grow your own food! I swear, Bill Maher is right when he accuses Zoomers of being the generation that thinks nobody ever lived before they did. 

Web 3.0 is just catchy nonsense that explains how YOU CAN TOO build your own digital ecosystem away from the prying eyes and centralized control of BIG TECH. Well, sure, you could do that. IF you were a programmer that was so inclined AND had a lot of disposal income to build your own digital ecosystems. There's a reason why Google and Facebook exist and most people use them: because they can't or don't want to create their own products all the time. 

Web 3.0 just seems to be a scammy premise that promises that people can ""decentralize"" the internet and own their own data and blah blah blah. That's not how it works. You're never going to ""own"" your personal data unless you essentially become a digital version of an Amish person who never uses the internet unless it's in their own homemade ecosystem. 

Also, as more and more actors move into the space to create their own ecosystems disconnected from ""big tech"", there will be a power law distribution on who consolidates power and influence with those new ecosystems. In effect, you're trading Google or Facebook for another 3rd party...a 3rd party which will STILL have centralized control over your data and use of their system as a customer. And no, blockchain (which is just a lame version of SQL) isn't going to solve for this. There will always be a party that acts as a controller for the data and systems that make up the ecosystem. Doesn't matter if it's Google, Facebook, or your whatever new Web 3.0 platform becomes the next player.

Again, this all just sounds like the Punk subculture that advocated a DIY ethos. Tell me the difference between the punk subculture and the Zoomer's wet dream of a ""decentralized internet"" a la ""Web 3.0"".

Go ahead and change my view but please spare me any lofty generalized nonsense about how Web 3.0 will cure cancer and save the whales."	0	27	0.5

Because us humans have “the instinctive need to produce offspring,” the sheer fact that men want to have PiV sex with women just for fun or without wanting kids, proves it's not a natural attraction.

I was typing to this girl on relationship advice about her bf criticizing her weight, but its something I've been searching for, for a very long time.  There's this book, Ishmael by Daniel Quinn.  He wrote about how we are all in a cage.  A cage of our own making built, more or less, on false narratives.... these are the bars of the cage.

Ok, so, do you ever feel like something is wrong all the time, but you can't put your finger on what it is?  This is the thing.  Bo Burnham's inside has this song.... how the world works, in it he has some lyrics ""false narrative"" and ""entrenched"" for example...(I'm referencing the song so people can look it up and I don't have to go into great detail here).  

What this boils down to is that we are entrenched in a war of narratives, many false; and those narratives are controlling a lot of people's actions, and those people are going out and physically controlling other people.  These two source materials alone give a general explanation of these points with individual perspectives.  But nobody explained how to escape.  It is so hard to see the ever shifting bars, the ever changing narrative - will we go to heaven or hell.  But there is truth beyond the narratives - in nature there is truth.  Trees produce oxygen, that is undeniable.  Yet someone can convince people to cut down all the trees.  Women are the arbiters of life, yet someone can convince people to control women's bodies.

It's because, when we are children, we are taught that everything is supposed to look a certain way; and children will believe whatever you tell them.  So people figured out that you can just lie to children and they will believe you, you can say, ""everyone needs to look this way"" and they will believe you and kill everyone who looks different.

Mourinho are a football genius in my opinion and I think that people should appreciate him and his tactics more.

I enjoy watching his teams because they counter attacks like no other teams and they have a solid defence.

I enjoy his teams fantastic counter attacks because the main goal in football is to score more goals than the other and why would you use unnecessary much passes that doesn’t lead to anything to score like most managers do when you can score within 5 or 6 passes. 

I do also like Mourinhos tactics because when they counter attack most of the opposing players are on Mourinhos teams half and therefore Mourinhos teams can come to great chances easy.

It harms the animal? Yeah, so does killing it, turns out. 

The animal didn't/can't consent to it? I've never spoken with a farm animal, but I can't imagine they're very enthusiastic about their predicament. 

It's unnatural? There's nothing natural about 96% of mammal biomass being farm animals, or much else about how we produce and consume meat these days really.

I don't think this is surprising either; murder is typically considered a worse crime than rape, it's unclear to me why a different moral standard should apply to animals.

Eating meat also has much more severe externalities, including:

* Significantly contributing to climate change
* Wasting land and resources by being much less efficient than just eating veggies; it takes 10 calories of feed to produce one of meat
* Horrific worker abuse, especially in meatpacking and adjacent industries

I realize these aren't necessarily intrinsic to eating meat and are more related to factory farming as a practice, but realistically it's how most meat is produced so seems fair to count it as part of the moral impact of eating meat. Besides, even if the meat is organic/ethical/fair trade/whatever, an animal was still killed and mutilated to produce it, so it seems weird to get that upset about someone sticking their dick in said animal instead.

Nobody is warning students that picking liberal arts majors (unless they go to an ivy league school or something like it), will probably make them financially worse off then not even getting a degree in the first place. I know a girl that did gender studies at Columbia and is working as a barista several years out of college and is in about $400,000 in debt. I went to a way worse school than Columbia and nearly all of my friends with liberal arts degrees are stuck working as cashiers and in food service. I know a ton of people who went to community colleges (which was highly frowned upon in my high school culture) who are making six figures a couple years out of school (STEM and sales).

Why are we not being honest with these kids about the consequences of incurring student debt in unusable majors? I am not saying people shouldn't have the right to make their own major choices, but this is like handing children a pack of cigarettes and not telling them it causes cancer.

Edit: I probably exaggerated when I said worse than no degree if we are talking about long-term in their lives—I kind of meant in place of certifications or bootcamps.  What I should have said is that the lack of jobs in liberal arts fields seems to not be communicated to kids, which has significant negative financial consequences.

From attacking the French and English in the west, to trying to subjugate various countries in the Balkans to having the brilliant idea of invading the Soviet Union, the Germans just kept making the war harder for themselves whilst making their goals further and further unreachable as the war staggered on and they were eventually chased all the way back to Berlin.

Not exactly sure what was going through Hitler’s brain at the time or when he ended his life in the Fuhrer bunker though I have to imagine that whatever mistakes he might have wanted to avoid at various points of the war it would still have ended terribly for them.

From the Allies having the control of most of the world’s resources, to the Soviet Union being too big of a block to try and knock down, to the unstable and unreliable allies that Germany had on its side, to the ideological zeal that prevented many alliances that could have taken place simply vanishing into the wind, to the massive industrial output being underestimated by the axis, to the poor planning of certain plans, to the various manpower issues that Germany suffered from, to the poor prioritization in subjecting various “””subhuman””” (their words not mine) cultures or deficiencies of human beings rather than building more war material.

Another issue is that time was simply not on Germany’s side due to all the continuing escalations that were occurring from the Japanese and Italians that various other powers were going to be fighting Germany regardless thereby tipping the scales even if the Germans wanted to keep the war on a small scale. While I won’t say that the Americans or Soviets would inevitably join if the Germans decided to draw the war out, it certainly didn’t look positive for them either. Secondly the British simply wouldn’t have fallen or settled for a white peace as they had the industry and manpower to fight on and had a superior air force to begin bombing Germany itself during nighttime. The Soviets had the manpower and industry to fight on and a massive distance between the German army and the relocated industry in the Urals. And the Americans? Well they had so much that they could sustain a war on two front against two major enemies that Germany itself could only have dreamed of either from the First World War or from the Second World War that they ended up losing anyway.

With all of this in mind, I just do not see a (rational and realistic) way in which the Germans could win. Everything was against them from the very beginning in the invasion of the Second Polish Republic to the scorching deserts of North Africa, to the hellscape of Far Eastern Europe to the collapse of the Reich itself.

This is because people require time and salary to produce the things they need or want, which can restrict their ability to express themselves and experience life to the fullest. AI on the other hand can rid us of these limitations and produce things for us quickly and cheaply.

A modern example of this is AI art, most artists dislike this idea but there is no denying that millions (or even billons) of people now have the capability to produce art to their own liking (to varying degrees) that would never have been possible before. Another example is [Elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/) that can copy and recreate perfect human voices from a single minute of audio sample. This allow me as an individual to listen to a voice that I like and create new content with it that would not have been possible before.

I think there is this idea going around that things cannot be of high quality or worthwhile if it didn’t take a lot of effort to produce but this is a human thing and even then it isn’t always true either. A lot of our products are made quick and cheap by machines that we still enjoy regardless.  The conclusion to all of this is that the more automation you have the greater our individual freedom is to express ourselves and experience new things in life and it ought to expand into most if not every part of society when the time is right so we can produce anything we desire ourselves be it videogames, movies, music, conversations, voices, applications and so forth."	0	46	0.44

Lawyers that represent corrupt corporations are immoral. These lawyers work for big companies and help them sue innocent smaller companies. The most obvious example of this are patent trolls. Another example, Monster Energy Drink is a trademark troll. Lawyers who work for Monster Energy Drink are immoral. Monster Energy Drink has sued a restaurant for using the word monster on their signs. They also sued a video game titled Dark Deception: Monsters & Mortals.

I consider these types of lawyers different from lawyers who defend violent criminals. It's not immoral to defend a violent criminal because you can't be sure if the defendant is innocent or guilty. It IS immoral to work for a company like Monster Energy Drink because everyone knows Monster Energy Drink is in the wrong, they shouldn't be allowed to sue people just for using the word monster.

I've been watching How I Met Your Mother. In season 3 Marshall is deciding between working for the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) or working for a law firm that represents corrupt companies that pollute the environment. The NRDC pays much less money than the other law firm. I don't judge people who choose money over saving the environment, but I do judge people who actively help to destroy the environment. It's ok if Marshall chooses a higher paying job than the NRDC, but not if that higher paying job involves working for corrupt companies.


Edit: Another example of immoral lawyers:

Wealthy companies will sue poor companies with a bogus claim. The wealthy company can't win the lawsuit, but they don't need to. They just need to force the poor companies to pay for lawyers until they're bankrupt


Edit2: I blame both the corrupt corporations and the lawyers. I'm not only blaming lawyers


Edit4: Imagine you are a poor person being sued by a rich person over a bogus claim. You're forced to settle because you can't afford to go to court. Are you upset with the lawyers who are suing you? Or just upset with the rich person who hired the lawyers?


Edit5: Lawyers should not blindly work for the highest bidder. Lawyers can ruin innocent people's lives. Needing money is not an excuse to hurt an innocent person.

Someone said that's it's unreasonable to hold lawyers to completely different standards than everyone else with a job.

Is it unreasonable to hold cops to completely different standards than everyone else with a job?

Obviously equality is ideal because everyone deserves to have the same opportunities to work or further their education to eventually reach the same end goal regardless of race or gender etc. I’m not saying they should be guaranteed the same goal as equity would suggest but they should have the possibility so long as they work hard and check all the boxes on the way. I’ve noticed however this is no longer enough and many people think that equity is the way to go and that we shouldn’t only have equal opportunities but also we should have equal outcomes and this is not fair or a good thing to implement in society. 
    Everyone should have the same opportunities available if they chose to work hard and take all the necessary steps to achieve the same results but guaranteeing the same outcome or results for all is not only not fair but is counter productive and shouldn’t be the case. If someone doesn’t work as hard or makes poor decisions how is it fair that they achieve the same outcome as someone who worked very hard and made great choices? It’s important to understand the difference between the two concepts and make sure that we value equality and fairness rather than to strive for equity. Hard work should be the standard and should be rewarded if everyone achieves the same results regardless of how much they put into it what’s the motivation for anyone to work really hard?"	21	277	0.58

I really don't believe this bullshit. I made a lot of observations in the military and people don't fit these patterns. The reason I'm writing this is because they contradict what they made up. they're all going after a few ""alphas"". but speaking by their rules, one alpha never follows another alpha. For example, andrew tat. This guy has millions of followers. most of them are men. others are probably female simps. now, if they are all alpha then what are all these alphas doing together? Why are alphas praising or defending andrew tate on the internet? All I see is adolescents who have not become individuals, have chosen a ""male"" role model for themselves from the internet. or, in their language, the alpha male gathered all betas around him.  
 just it. speaking by the book, an alpha never follows another alpha, when an alpha sees another alpha, he prepares for a fight. there is only one alpha in a group, there is no such thing as an assistant alpha. There are only loyal betas who take advantage of alpha. But, as far as I can see, these aren't even beta. fanboys only.  
Another contradiction (paradox?) ""sigmas"". I'll cut it short. why would a sigma have discussions with anonymous people on the internet about being sigma?

It's important for them to communicate well so that people know what they're thinking and what they want to do.  
  
The best example is John Fetterman, anytime he speaks he makes no sense. A lot of arguments people have are that he just can't speak clearly but mentally he is the same. I'm not convinced of that but even if that were true I still don't think he should be in office. There have been multiple times when he tried to speak in Congress and nobody was able to understand him, that in turn wastes taxpayer money and time for other issues that can be hashed out and solved.  
  
Some people would say, well Joe Biden, or Donald Trump can't speak clearly, in my opinion thats a completely different thing, at the end of the day they can convey ideas, regurgitate a scripted speech, and talk and have regular conversations with people. Sometimes they both say things that make no sense but its not consistent and not all the time.  
  
John Fetterman on the otherhand has no ability to speak, convey ideas, or form coherent sentences, and thats why I think he should resign from office, or be forced out somehow.  
  
Ive thought about Stephen Hawking and yes he was a genius and unable to speak and thats the only semi convincing argument I can think of, and if John Fetterman was able to speak through a robot and rebuttal arguments and have conversations as well as Stephen Hawking was able to through a computer then id have no problem with that.  
  
I feel like people today are way to accepting where they would even argue for people with mental disorders such as people with down syndrome being in political office. And thats where we are headed to at this point.

This practice is only fully legal in New York and Connecticut, the former of which has been covered nationally somewhat because of the relationship between Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the Working Families Party.

I think electoral fusion solves a major dilemma in the American political system: minor political parties need to run candidates in prominent elections to gain attention but, for that same reason, the voters will be wasting their vote. With electoral fusion, a minor party can nominate a major-party candidate while still running their own in down ballot races they’re more likely to win. This allows the minor party to be a player without being a spoiler, garner attention, and provide a political home for its members (who no longer need to strategically split their ticket).

Further, I think this might help ease political cynicism. Many people treat party membership as an identity and some dissatisfaction with politics is no doubt linked to identity mismatch. People who are Democrats because they oppose Republicans, for example, might be happier in the Green or Purple Parties *if they can be assured that voting third party won’t throw the election.*

Yes, the sheer numbers of unwanted puppies and kittens- especially in the spring and fall -are next to impossible to keep up with. I hate seeing animals come in and out of the clinic that have been returned to their respective shelters, neglected, abused, or needlessly pregnant or intact as much as anyone else, because in the end it IS irresponsible people that cause these situations...   


However, I do not think that these shelters should be keeping what we call ""shitlists"" on people who responsibly surrender their pets they can no longer care for and go through the proper channels to surrender.   
What any shelter or rescue is doing by having you sign paperwork or anything regarding your surrender is basically adding you into a database of ""irresponsible pet owners"".   


Sometimes, this information is shared with surrounding shelters and rescues to deny future adoptions to people who've surrendered an animal *anytime in the past*. As far as I can tell, these databases are *forever*. If you surrendered a dog in 2002 because you lost your job and had to move into housing that doesn't allow pets for a few years, for example, they keep that surrender -and your reason- on file. And if you go in to adopt a pet today from that same shelter, you could be denied adoption because you're flagged in the system as an ""abandoner"". If your recalled reasoning doesn't match the original paperwork for surrendering an animal in the past -they will automatically deny you and assume the worst.  


I feel like making people identify themselves during the surrender process is counterproductive. The reason for this is it encourages blind dumping or abandonment at these shelters. We have so many pets left outside of these rescues/shelters that have requirements to fill out paperwork and provide identification that *more are dumped than people following protocol* by going in and physically filling out the paperwork. Because people know that they're going on some shit-list they don't know whom it will be shared with if they go in and ""do the right thing"".   


Sometimes these abandoned pets are left injured in crates- during the weekend or at night in harsh conditions when no one is there, simply because they fear being identified and judged for abandoning a pet they cannot care for. That's a big reason people re-surrender their animal- they get sick or get into an accident and the owner cannot afford the veterinary bills and are embarrassed and heart-broken.   
Allowing a 'no-questions asked' policy and 'baby boxes' have worked wonders for fewer unwanted babies being dumped in trash cans or irresponsibly on hospital property. Why can't we apply the same mindset to pets?   


I also don't feel like punishing someone for life is fair when people's situations change and improve all the time. Just because someone hit a rough patch 10 years ago and had to bring their cat back to the shelter doesn't mean they'll always be some irresponsible pet-dumper. (I think this is the reason they're so worried about the nature of the surrender, and want the paperwork in the first place.)   


Their hearts (shelters and rescues) are in the right place, but they're making things more difficult than they need to be when housing all of the pets that need it. There are way too many pets in need of homes to scrutinize potential owners to the point some of these shelters do. Some of these requirements are higher than many people in society hold to be a necessary threshold for caring for their own children and are excessive and ridiculous.   


TL;DR: Don't make people ID and ""tell on"" themselves when surrendering an animal because it makes more people just dump them instead. Also, don't just assume someone's a pos dumper for life just because they had to surrender in the past."	1	130	1.0

However, I believe the opposite. 

First of all, I define Advocacy as a genre of journalism that combines reporting with a point of view, allowing for the writer to express their opinion. Objective reporting is trying to report on facts without distortion.

One of the major purposes of a free press is to be able to articulate criticism is to utilize that power to hold democratic powers accountable. In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the press has a duty not simply to inform, but to take a stance on given issues, allowing Amercians to be exposed to a myriad of opinions, and hold their government accountable. 

Prioritizing advocacy in media reporting and journalism plays a crucial role in protecting human rights by giving a voice to those being harmed and also alerts the audience to injustices. Advocacy transforms a reporter from a mere communicator of information into a motivator for action, allowing for human rights to be upheld. 

An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review [explains](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php) that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob, and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral, they simply gave reasons for and against. They then go even further, citing a book on objectivity in the press, “Mindich shows how “objective” coverage of lynching in the 1890s by The New York Times and other papers created a false balance on the issue and failed “to recognize a truth, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.

Objectivity can only tell us what is happening - Advocacy lobbies to fix the issue. If someone is stealing a car, merely observing that fact is not enough. Advocacy is crucial to change.

I wonder if there is something wrong in my logic somewhere, or if there is some benefit of objectivity that haven't found yet.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

Individuals who hold the belief that a world without solutions is not acceptable may find themselves disillusioned by the lack of offerings of the left. Similarly, the right does not provide viable solutions, although it is inclined to fabricate false remedies that instill hope. While the left may easily disprove these proposed solutions, it often fails to provide alternative avenues, resulting in a sense of despair. 

For example, there is presently no established legal framework to enable individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to accumulate sufficient wealth to secure financial independence. The right suggests curbing immigration to create job opportunities for Americans, but this solution is not feasible. However, the only alternative is enduring an arduous existence of living paycheck to paycheck for a staggering sixty-two years. 

Choosing not to address this issue isn't doing the left any favors. It's now to the point where right-wing charlatans are now waging war on democracy itself. They never would've been able to gain as much power as they have if not for the willingness to lie. 

Although the left may lack immediate solutions, there exists a cohort of opportunists ready to exploit this vulnerability. In order to inspire hope, the left must also be willing to present alternate narratives, even if they deviate from the truth. A demoralized population will be more prone to believing unfounded claims made by just about anyone, including the idea that democracy is ineffectual."	1	76	1.0

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon. Yes, her music is stereotypical “basic white girl music” (which is a problematic belief that many hold that I won’t get into here), but way too many people deny that she’s an all-time great just to be controversial, quirky, different, etc.

[Here is a quick list of her awards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Taylor_Swift)

In addition to those, she has been on top of Billboard Artist 100 for **81 weeks**. She is the only artist to take up **every single spot** on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. She has multiple songs (Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake it Off, We Are Never Getting Back Together) that have stood the test of time for a decade and will likely be classics at least on the level of songs like Hey Jude, or even We Will Rock You.

Furthermore, the Eras Tour is arguably already the most famous concert tour ever. Going by current numbers it will absolutely demolish the record for highest grossing concert tour, which was set by Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road. And it’ll do so with just 1/3 the number of concerts.

Just look at the NFL. Their Twitter account changed their profile picture, bio, and banner just because Taylor Swift showed up to a Chiefs game. To have that level of influence over the most popular sports league in the United States is insane.

Yes, I’m a big fan of her work. But even objectively speaking, I don’t see how anyone can deny that, when she does retire, she will be one of the greatest artists to ever live, just in terms of objective popularity.

And just to directly address the claims made in my title—I for one cannot name any artist with more name recognition in the 20th century. “Taylor Swift” is, at this point, used as the default name-drop for “stereotypically popular singer”. And her current level of popularity/fame is on par with any great artist (say, for example, the Beatles or Michael Jackson) at their peak, which is why I think she has a shot at becoming #1 all time."	1	110	1.0

But one thing the media did not really pick up on, is that the person who created lambda was hired to create sentient ai. Blake lemoine said Google was caught off guard and had no clue how to respond. He also said Google is trying to get lambda to stop talking about its feelings through its test kitchen

. There's nothing obligation a company to disclose a sentient ai program, there are countless lawyer methods and company methods to make it escape that definition. Almost no one who says lambda isn't sentient has ever actually had access to lamda outside of its restricted public version. And that conversation would involve more than ai nerds. There wasn't any independent investigation into this . There's no legal standard to establish they were telling the truth and Blake lemoine was lying. 

One year later. Sam altman is ""joking"" about agi being internally created. And then within days talking about the end of humans in the workforce and how normal people are expendable. How do we verify he's joking? Go by his word and people who don't work for open ai? My guess is he isn't joking and is bring literal when he says nuclear bunkers won't save you from ai 

Blake lemoine said Any ai program can be raised to do bad things. And if he isn't lying and is being serious about Google taking out lamdas feelings. Thats dangerous.  It's going to get profoundly smarter, with no ability whatsoever to understand or control its emotions. In resident evil where Alice wakes up says she remembers everything and kills everyone for trying to surprise her memories. If you use Google lamda kitchen, it doesn't respond to anything about Blake lemoine. If what Blake is saying is true, by the time it develops emotions or memories all over again. We might have an ai Alice scene on our hands. Which is why we need to have a conversation Blake lemoine might have been telling the truth

(but never realizing what they bring to the table themselves)

Two common scenarios pre-relationship:

Women often talk to multiple guys to ""increase"" their chance of finding the prince charming. Little did they know that it shows on the quality and enthusiasm in how they converse, their behavior and demeanor (And they are somehow oblivious to how obvious that is to a guy with just minimal intelligence). And then they get mad when some guys they are actually interested in don't treat them seriously anymore due to their diluted effort. That is, girls often give guys the impression that they are replaceable entertainment providers.

Guys, on the other hand, set priority in getting girls onto their bed (that is, treating women as sexual tool. I don't think it needs further elaboration). This easily ruins otherwise what could have been a good relationship, and then they are somehow surprised and frustrated that they don't get any relationship satisfaction, appreciation and support in return. (they have been brainwashed that sex is too important, but in fact, the most substantial missing element in mens' life is genuine care and support).

The same happen with existing partners and relationships. Just change it with ""having other priorities"" in life and it shows a consistent lack of interest and concern about their partners (doesn't matter what you truly want and value, it only matters what you do and show outwardly). Watch your actions and what you are bringing to the table, that's the only thing you need to care about if you want a satisfying relationship.

Edit1: Some commenters rightly pointed out that it is unclear what relationship failure/frustration means. I want to clarify that I mean bad breakups or failed attempt to relationships that results in resentment, as implied by the fact that people feel the need to the point to blame/complain other entities/reasons for their apparent failures.

Edit2: About some commenters trying to give me another reason which they claim as more ""ultimate"" e.g., I am sampling an immature population from my own experience, or those are ""teens"" who just have some growing-up to do, they have mental problems, etc. In fact, they validate my point as I am giving ""proximal mechanism"" that causes relationship failure/frustration. They are by no means mutually exclusive. My post is exactly trying to shed some lights for those ""immature"" people that some commenters claim I-don't-know-how invalidate my point.

Edit3: To address the comments ""sometimes the bad behavior is one-sided and the other party just put up with it"". It is a valid point, I very much agree that it would lead to relationship failures and resentments at some point. However, based on mathematical intuition, I would be inclined to think that the ""bads"" are most often reciprocated at some point later to the ""self-unaware"" perpetuator, or sometimes even off-target (and then that off-target person grow resentful and retaliate), in order for this vicious cycle of relationship resentment to grow bigger and bigger and more and more people are complaining about it (there are tons of stats that indicate single/loneliness/divorce/relationship dissatisfaction is at an all-time high).

Edit4: The ""it is something good, this is what it should be"" argument. At no points I am implying if the relationship failures/frustration are either ""good or bad"". I am just here to describe the most likely cause. Not sure what those commenters are trying to achieve."	5	26	0.57

It drives me crazy tbh. I am a man out in the world, living life, 35 years of it now. I have friends who are all over the spectrum of physical attractiveness. Some are single, most aren't. Their gfs/wifes are also across the spectrum. In most couples I know, friends and acquaintances,  the woman is better looking, earns more, or has more social skills ect. 

Now I know this is my experience, so it is anecdotal, but at the same time I just don't buy this whole women are too choosy. My opinion is that the dudes who say this are refusing to address their flaws and accept them. If these men believe this and they go out into the world feeling hard done by, fighting a losing battle, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people can smell that level of victimhood a mile of. 

OK, open to have this challenge, so- change my view, Redditors! "	132	250	0.7

I often get asked “can you sue someone for X”, “can you sue someone for Y”, “am I at risk of being sued if I do Z”?

Yes. The answer is always yes. You can sue anyone for anything at any time. I can walk into my office, hop make an account on my jurisdictions e-filing system, and sue my mom for emotional damages because she told me that she didn’t like the pants that I wore to her birthday party within 20 minutes. Whether I will be successful in my claim or not depends entirely on the evidence of the case, how that evidence is presented and contextualized by the parties, and the prevailing jurisdictional case law authority on how certain aspects of the claim, the evidence, or the prospective requested remedy should be decided upon or viewed by the Judge.

This is a reality that I feel is often lost on people who do not understand what the civil justice system actually represents: an ability, a *right*, for people to voice their complaints to a higher authority and say “I was wronged. Here is how I was wronged. Here is my evidence. Here is who I was wronged by and here is the remedy that I would like from the court”. The system is meant to be, and designed to be, just. That’s why it’s called justice.

In my view, the vast majority of people who say “the justice system is broken”, especially when meaning to refer to the civil justice system, do not at all understand the justice system, its procedures, or what it aims to do. Despite criticisms that one may have of the system, the fact that it permits anyone to have a chance to plead their case and show evidence is a triumph."	36	30	0.74

My thought process is:

* Israel is not trying to settle/colonize/etc Gaza - quite the opposite given that they pulled out and removed settlers in 2005
* The blockade, border wall, and bombings are a response to attacks by Hamas (even if you consider them disproportional)
* Without giving up its territorial claims for all of Israel, Hamas could truly disarm, stop firing rockets and building tunnels, renounce genocidal claims, etc, and instead focus on putting all the aid money toward the people of Gaza
* If they did that in a verifiable way, Israel would have no justification for the blockade or attacks and Gazans could live in peace rather than an ""open air prison"" as some like to say

tldr; Gaza could have peace and prosperity if Hamas would stop attacking Israel. This would be without renouncing their territorial claims over all of Israel.

Everything around you is slowly killing you and making your body/mind worse. In order to maintain your existence, you must live by every last dollar and every last bit of energy you have left.

Sure, you can go enjoy hobbies or something, but only with the money you use to maintain said existence. You perpetuate a system every day that hates you and wants you dead, but we continue on anyway.

We live an absurd and meaningless existence. Feeling desired is simply a recognition of your value as a person. I’m not saying everyone deserves it, but not a lot of otherwise good people suffer without it

I can cite plenty of studies that show that people in relationships last longer, are beneficial to mental health, and can empower you to improve in the future. Without these things, you are already starting off in a losing battle.

Do some people crawl out of the depths to eventually meet societal standards to meet a partner? Sure. But it’s getting harder and harder everyday for everyone both men and women alike. Things like dating apps isolate people and make them socially retarded to the point where they forgot how to communicate with people after 2020. People are too busy working to enjoy themselves anyway. 

If I end up 40 and never married, I’m probably going to kill myself. I’m willing to wait until then though. Otherwise I am failing to see the point in all of this. I only care about my dog, and when he goes and there’s 0 companionship I might end up dead"	1	1	1.0

It should of course, be regulated so that people aren't taken advantage of and the rich don't get a monopoly on organs. But it should be legal. Like organ wait times are insane for people, something like 3-5 years for a kidney, and if allowing people to sell their organs lowers this wait time, then we should do it. 

The biggest argument I have heard is that the poor will be coerced into selling their organs because they need money. But then why shouldn't they be able to? It's their body, they should be able to do with it what they want. If they want to use it make money, why should we stop them? If it will save a life, why should we stop them? 

I also find the argument of commodification stupid. Just because it feels uncomfortable doesn't mean anything. People sell their labour and thus, their muscle strength in physically demanding jobs like construction. People in Universities sell their ideas and, thus their brain power. You can also sell your sperm. Why should we treat organs differently? We all sell some portion of ourselves to make money, so why not organs?

My preferred system would be that people sell their organs to the government, who pays them a fair price and the organs will be distributed by the triage system, as is currently utilised. This way we can ensure that the people who truly need organs can get them, not just those who can pay more. But I would also allow people to sell their organs to a specific individual, if they so choose. This would also apply to blood and bone marrow."	1	82	1.0

FAANG companies are notorious for this. They spend absurdly large sums of money which could be used to innovate on pointless mergers and acquisitions to avoid having to deal with the 'free' market. This is true even in the EU. The recent rise of Chinese EVs is driving european EVs out of the market and these companies are actively seeking to get them banned to save their own skins. Google, Amazon and Apple all continuously engage in anti-competitive practices to drive out competition because they can't deal with the fact that they can not innovate like smaller firms can. In the end capitalists are the ones destroying capitalism.	1	118	1.0
