As most companies go you can't do everything alone. I've been burned so many times that I'm now in a complete daze and don't know what to do. I no longer believe there are good, honest people out there. People only lie, cheat, steal, and use you for their own advantage. The worst part about this is everything seems completely out of my control. I know people with depression are often told to change themselves, but it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.

People regularly steal from me, ignore me, and lie to me. It's turned me very cynical and I've stopped reaching out to people because I know I'll just get burned. I feel like I can't get anything done anymore because the nature of others will prevent it.

Does anyone have advice?"	4	28

I was really shocked at the move where you, at about 30 yards before a red light, cut into the right lane, then back left to get in front of the car you were behind just so you could be in the front of pack. All this in about 1 second.

The funny part about it all, is that we hit the same lights for about 3 miles until you turned right. So all that reckless driving and those near accidents didn't even get you anywhere faster.

How are they a feminist, or pro-woman item what so ever?	http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hlj67/im_a_guy_and_very_confused_about_burqas_how_are/	"I saw the thread yesterday with the comic about how the woman with standard western dress and the woman in the burqa looked at eachother and felt bad that the other lived in ""a male dominated society"".

From my liberal male perspective, the burqa represses women by hiding them away, thus puts them in a different class from men. It turns their skin into a sexual object for men, whether you admit it or not. 

The following completely silly example sums up my philosophy:
If guys got to see boobs all the time, but shoulders were taboo, if a girl walked down the street in a tube top she would be the subject to so many sets of eyes staring at her.

No matter how you spin it, whether it's a choice or required by law, covering a woman except for her eyes (or more ""liberally"" her face) just seems like you are making the entire woman taboo, sexualized, etc...

I've heard the arguments that it allows the women to feel comfortable while walking down the street. I've also heard the flip-side of the argument that it creates a powerful feeling for the woman when she wears in when not required to.  I just feel like it's a false feeling of power. It's making women feel powerful for hiding their faces from the world, for not feeling the wind on their faces, for not really being a participant in the outside world.

If I sound confused, I am. I disagree with burqa's and even hearing the rational arguments for them I always leave thinking that I was just presented with ass-backwards logic used to describe a tool of repression.

So 2X. Please straighten me out, am I off the mark in thinking burqas shouldn't necessarily be made illegal, but thinking that there should be attempts to phase them out wherever they are, instead of keeping them the status quo. Before you answer, keep in mind what society in Iran pre-revolution was like.

tl;dr: So, I'm against burqa's, I think they are anti-woman, why am I wrong exactly?"	5	77

I want to travel NOW.  What should I do?	http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/m7yga/i_inherited_over_100k_recently_ive_also_never/	"I lost my dad in an accident and ended up inheriting $125,000.  I also have the luxury of having a job that means I'm freelance and my lease just expired at the beginning of this month.  Basically I'm saying, I have no attachments currently and am free as a bird.  

From all the research I've done about what I should do with my money, 9/10 things say you need to do something for yourself.  That something for myself I decided is traveling.  I think my dad would approve and even be all for it at that.. so I can do it feeling really good about myself.

Looking at the guide on the right.. I'd like to leave maybe in January or February.  I'll spend the holidays at home with my family and preparing for this epic journey.  I'm DEFINITELY more into scenery than art.  I don't say culture because learning about a culture in the Amazon rainforest would be awesome whereas I honestly don't care that much about the culture in a French town.  I'm definitely looking for the exotic side of things.  

I have a high tolerance for both heat and cold but I'd like to go somewhere warm as I feel like if I'm on vacation, I might as well avoid the cold if I can.  I'm not really comfortable being a fish out of water but can handle it when is necessary.  I've lived a comfortable live and even though I'm smart enough and capable enough to handle distressing situations, I don't see the need to encounter them.  I definitely love the countryside more as I said, nature is #1 priority on this trip.  And I'm not really an adventurous eater.

In a nutshell my plan is to go somewhere where I can get to Europe in the spring.  I'd like to experience Italy, France, Spain, Germany, etc. when it's nice or at least not cold.  So I've been trying to figure out a way to go somewhere where I can stay in the warm and make my way to Europe once it gets nicer.  This is not a requirement mind you if something jumps out at me.

My dream vacation is either the Maldives or a beautiful valley in Spring in Germany or something.  Seeing as I could go somewhere tropical during the winter, I'm considering that as well.

Thanks.. I'll be monitoring this very closely so if you have any questions, please ask and I'll respond promptly.  Also, any guides/resources you can point me to would be much appreciated!

Thanks again!

Edit: After doing a lot of reading in this thread and elsewhere, it would seem like the most sense to go to Australia or Southeast Asia.  Yes/no?  Looking into it now.

Double Edit: I don't plan on spending a lot.. enough to do it sort of comfortably but not so much that I'm not getting that backpacker feeling."	94	152

I religiously played diablo2 for 6 years straight, and casually for the last 2 (i have participated in every ladder since i was 12, and am now 20).  I've gone back and beaten diablo1 as well once I had gotten older, and fell deeply in love with the franchise.  I then had only to look forward to the possibility of a 3rd.  I had been anxiously awaiting for a Diablo3 release or even just a hint that it may even considered as a possibility in the future... just some sign of hope.  I even remember just day dreaming about awesome it would be if they ever made a diablo3.  Needlessly to say, I had given up hope on that ever happening like I assume everyone else did. But then... it finally happened. Diablo3 was REAL.  I still almost don't believe it... it's just too good to be true.  

So, anyway... the point of this was..

Please, just stop being so ignorant to the creators of diablo.  I as a long term diablo fan respect and agree with at least 99% of the decisions made by Jay Wilson and the rest of the crew.  He himself is one of the biggest true diablo fans, and i couldn't of asked for anyone better to make the next step in this franchise.  People (for the most part) seem to be forgetting that Diablo's main purpose was for players who just want to endlessly slaughter the demons of hell, and i plan on doing just that.


edit: I'm not saying they can't have opinions because me having played the game makes me better than them, but when someone moronically proposes something that takes away a core feature from Diablo while criticizing the design team for doing so at the same time... no.

edit: People are even more ignorant than i had previously thought."	0	23

I just did a ranked on which the communication inside the team was terrible.
- Mordekaiser, Noc and Kassadin kept flaming each other
- My blitz didn't say anything
- The opposing Ahri kept talking and talking to us with, Morde, Kass and Kassa answering her

While I tried a lot to tell them to stop flaming/answering the Ahri and concentrate on the game, they just ignored me and kept talking on the chat whuile making bad plays.

I tried to stop trying to argue and rely on the pings (motsly the retreat ping) but once again no reaction we got aced and lost this game while we could have won easy with a little bit of concentration.

I'm not saying I was the only one doing good (In fact I did okay but not good) but I just wanted my team to at least listen to me (we got nash but we didn't push for example...).

Do you have any tips to make your team listen to you/to stop chatting with the other team/to stop flaming each other ?"	2	4

I tell her this and she says okay so she goes to sleep. This morning I wake up and she is telling me that she is unsure if she can ever understand and accept that i game.

Some advice from people who were in a relationship like this or are currently in one will be much appreciated.

It has worked well to reduce the number of spam / automated bots through many many websites. It is a very simple concept yet very powerful and effective. It would seem really simple for Blizzard to add a captcha like system to their game to reduce bots and automated accounts while being only a minor hindrance. 

Some might argue that the hindrance would be more than minor but I think most players would rather have a fair economy rather than inflation due to illegal bots. Also for people who listen in on popular chat channels it would cut down on the million of 30 line posts for 3rd party gold sites.

What problems am I not seeing with a captcha like system in game and / or what is your take on in game captcha to deter automation?"	0	43

We'll all make cool buildings, and spend time coming up with scenarios too. But in the end, what's the point? 

What if there was something that called everyone to action, to build on one big server, or join together and fight the evils of the night? Something like that. As it is, it's just an endless creation game, like a chalkboard for you to create stuff on, which isn't all that special.

I met her when she had been with her boyfriend of 4 years, and he happened to be a friend of mine (I had just never met her). Within 6 weeks of meeting her, she had broken up with him and was dating me. That caused a lot of stress, and we both lost numerous friends because of this decision.

We moved in together a couple of months later out of convenience as her house mate was moving out, and my landlord was selling up.

Fast forward 6 months, and we were having some communication issues that caused us to break up a couple of times in the space of a month, and me to move out. We resolved the issues within a few weeks, and got back together, and I moved back in with her.

That was all about 5 months ago now. She is obviously still insecure about it all, and now any time we have a disagreement she brings up the fact that I left before, so what is to stop me leaving again? She just does not trust me to stay. I love her deeply, and she loves me, and coming home to her makes me really happy. However, she tells me that she needs me to commit to her, and the only way that she feels I can do that is to buy her a ""commitment ring"".

The issue is, we argue a lot. However most of that is her insecurities about us, and from some of the things I said when we broke up. This is why she wants or needs a ring. I am happy to be committed to her, but if I am going to spend money on a ring, I want it to be an engagement ring, and to be when I feel good and ready about it.

I don’t like that I have to give her a ring to feel good about us. To my mind she should be happy with who we are, not because she has a ring on her finger. She also has plenty of diamond rings (including an engagement ring) from her previous partner.

Yesterday I spent $1000 (3 weeks’ salary) on a ring for her. I love her, but want to give her to ring when I feel the time is right, not because she needs one to feel safe. I don't really know what I am meant to do about it. She is my first long term relationship (I have only had 3 gf's in the past, none longer than 4 months).

**tldr; gf wants a commitment ring to feel safe about us, but I want to give it when I feel the time is right, not just because she wants one. What am I meant to do/feel about it?**

Now anyone that actually reads up on economics and that understands trickle down economics to any degree would know today it doesn't work and only works really in an economy where money can freely flow.  Seeing this ain't exactly going on with the current trickle down equality, why not reverse it?

I am bring up on reversing it more in that with some of the issues women face that things may improve in by addressing issues men face and/or dealt with. Take rape for example, I think a lot of feminists would say it still happens a lot.  But instead of telling men not to rape (which I don't think really works), why not go after where it spawns from?  Meaning going after single mothers.  No this isn't about attacking them, but more fix the environments where boys are being raised that can possibly shape them into rapists.

This [paper](http://www.nownys.org/docs/fatherlessness%20article.pdf) cites old data from the 90's (yet to see a newer data on fatherless families).  But look at some of the stats in it:

* Kids are 20 times more likely to have behavior problems
* Kids are 20 times more likely to become rapists
* 85% of all children that exhibit behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes.
* 80% of rapists motivated with displaced anger come from fatherless homes.

Now if you throw in that the biggest abusers of kids are mothers (they make up [37%](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/cm11.pdf) of all child abuse on acting alone).  I don't think one needs a paper to see that having fatherless homes and mothers abusing kids is going to do any in lowering the number of rapes. 

 I will point out and something I found interesting from the child maltreatment study is that boys and girls are equally abused.  I will also say I am quite aware there are LOADS of factors here and that its far from a simple fix.  My point or that argument is that instead of telling men not to rape, maybe feminists should take more action in ""attack"" what seems to be the grounds or that the causes that cause men to be rapist in the first place.  

I know some feminists will balk at this reverse gender equality as it doesn't make the focus and that the attention women only.  But more post this as food for though really.  As to me it seems some of the issues women have may be fix or that reduce in that addressing some of men's issues (which feminists seem to address very little of as far as even talking about it).  I am aware this isn't a simple issue by any means and that a very complex one and some of it is being address by feminists (tho arguably very one sidely).  But never less just something to think about."	1	77

Honestly I've fucking had it with people that are unintelligent and immature that think being racist by calling other racists is in any way beneficial to anyone anywhere.

It's the fucking 21st century. Race shouldn't matter. Fucking NAACP scholarships should be up for anyone. Ethnic groups should all be terminated for THAT SPECIFIC GROUP and be expected to give everyone the same treatment. I've seen shit on the news about black families beating up their daughters boyfriend because he was WHITE. Are you serious?! If that shit happened inversely with a white family beating a black boyfriend it would not fly at all. Al Sharpton would be all over that shit.

I am sick and fucking tired of all the bullshit that comes with a race.
We're fucking humans. Identifying with where you came from is great but you are just a person. 

So fuck you to every single racist counterracist group out there that only promotes to keep racism alive by making sure everyone knows what it is and why they aren't allowed to do certain shit or say certain things.

And fuck you guy for pulling a racecard where it didn't need to be. "	360	450

You are not sure how you got here; all you have are some hazy memories of seeing a new button labeled ""Ranked Solo/Duo"" after selecting your map. You try it out thinking it is a new game mode, and have stuck to it ever since.

You don't really think about what is happening, and it doesn't really bother you. You pick Ashe for the one hundredth time, pick any lane to go, and auto attack anything you can until the match is over. You may not know how the skills work entirely, why some items are reccomended to you and not to others, or even that you can use QWER for faster casting. And the beauty of it is that it *doesn't matter*. You are having fun, in your own way, and so are the others. Nobody really talks except for the odd ""GLHF"" and ""GG"", but you win and lose sometimes, and you get to play your champions, and nobody will ever give you shit about it.

Until one of **them** show up.

**They** are your messengers. **They** are the ones who ruin your fun. **They** are the ones who show up in the pre-game chat saying things like ""meta"", ""jungle"", ""support"" and ""Bronze hell"" and trying to coordinate your team. **They** are the ones who complain when you die, make a mistake or, heaven forbid, *steal their kill*. However, as much as you may hate it, **they** teach you how to take objectives, group up, and stop trying to kill Tryn when he enters his Unstoppable Rage.

Something stirs inside of you. You want to learn more about the *metagame*. You want to understand what you need to do to win more than you lose. You open your browser and type ""League of Legends Guide"". 

You become one of **them**, and that is when your damnation truly begins.

-------------------------

&gt;**Silver Tier**

You have read, you have learned, and you have won. At a great cost, you stepped on the heads of your fellow bretheren in the Bronze Tier and made it to Silver. You feel truly powerful for the first time; you have accomplished something, you have gained a grand new Tier, and with that a new thirst for victory. You set your sights on Gold and think you can make it there as well. Unfortunately, nothing is as simple.

You enter the pre-game chat and are surprised when everyone starts picking a ""role""; some champs are more fit for some ""roles"" than ""others"". You are completely unsure how to react, and ask them ""where can I go as Poppy?"" and your first taste of the *rage* hits you like a wall of bricks. They rage just like **them** of the old Bronze division, and that catches you off guard. This isn't what you expected. You thought Silver was different, that people would play to get better, and not to rage more at each other.

So you read up more guides, learn more things about the game, and try to get better, but no matter what you do, people still rage. Support lux? Rage. Top Lissandra? More rage. You don't know how to react, so you rage back. Tell them to let you do what you want 'cause ""this is the top rated guide in Mobafire"", even though you haven't even checked the time stamp to find out you can't stack Hextech Gunblades on Mordekaiser anymore. When you win, you feel emboldened and decide you are in fact destined for Gold, and when you lose it was clearly never your fault; just your stupid teammates who fed, did ridiculous things and got caught by the jungler because ""Nidalee traps are wards"". You fight, you learn, and you get to your promotion series on Silver I. Your goal is in sight.

---------------------------------------

&gt;**Gold Tier**

You're here. Finally. Gold. *Gold*. This is where you were supposed to be, this is where you **wanted** to get to since **they** showed up in your face back in the Bronze division. You feel emboldened by your achievement, and happily enter the ranked que one more time to see the ""Ranked Heaven"" with your own eyes. You kindly ask for top lane Wukong as fourth pick.

The rage hits you once again, but despite your surprise, it barely phases you. You have been burned by the flames for too long now for them to make a difference. Everyone says to pick the ""OP"" champions instead. Why? Wukong carried you out of Silver, after all. No, but he is no good here. You need to get Riven, Renekton and Jayce now, or you are going to get crushed.

Your favorite picks in Silver are no longer ""viable"" here. It is now all about abusing who is the new ""OP"" of the week and punishing your opponents for picking ""unviable"" champs. One day it is Vlad, the other day Nunu top, and the other is is Fiora mid. Dying stops being the norm, and now becomes the exception. Giving up First Blood before the five minute mark without a jungle gank means you are now going to be reported by your entire team for intentional feeding. You can no longer depend on kill gold for your builds, now you have to learn the arcane knowledge of *last-hitting*, *zoning* and *lane freezing* if you hope to remain in the game. Falling behind immediately spells doom for you, and you are going to get verbally assaulted by all players over and over again until you either disconnect or get a Pentakill.

Yet, through sheer stubbornness, you persist. You play again and again, day after day, watching the numbers slowly inch their way up, and finally get you to your Gold I promotion series. You are yelling at your team the instant the pre-match lobby loads, telling them to get in line, and anyone who **dares** ruin your series is going to have his mother violated by you repeatedly until the day of their deaths. By sheer hatred and persistence, you get to Platinum once and for all.

---------------------------------------

&gt;**Platinum Tier**

The Rage hits you just as the pre-game lobby loads, but you are now neither affected nor surprised by it. You are ready. You have done everything in Gold to prepare you for this. You can do anything from Skarner mid to Support Pantheon. There can't possibly be anything more that you need to learn.

You were wrong.

The ""team composition"" is the new norm. Why in the world are you picking jungle Diana? We need Trundle to complete our poke comp. You don't have Trundle? You have forty seconds to purchase RP and get him before your pick is done. Never played him? Who cares, just load up LoLPro and pick the first guide that shows up. It says you need to rush Blade of the Ruined King? Then why are you asking us, rush BotRK and go for it.

Picking your best champs or the old OP ones are no longer going to cut it. You have to pay attention to the enemy bans and form an entire team on the go. The instant they ban out Janna you just **know** they are headed for a hard engage. That means your team needs AOE - drop that Elise, we need you to play Orianna. You have to know how to play at least twenty champions in every single role if you hope to be able to win here, and even then the tiniest mistake will cost your entire team the game, once again.

You grit your teeth and keep going. You are almost there. Diamond is just up ahead. Soon enough you are out of Ranked Hell. You can do it, you tell yourself, *you can do it*.

---------------------------------------

&gt;**Diamond Tier**

Nobody seems to type anything in the pre-game lobby at all. That is your first greatest surprise. You actually stop and take note of the names of players in your team. Some of them give you a strange case of déja-vu, until you realize you've seen them before. The players who put some of the more unique guides out there. You actually reached them at last.

This is it. You can feel it.

""Hey, scrub"", one of them types in chat.

You are startled, but nobody answers.

""Yeah, you. New guy. You are going jungle.""

But you are fifth pick, you are going to compl-

""Everyone has their roles already. I am going mid to fill in, and you are going jungle because we are missing out. Don't you dare fuck up.""

Everyone knows everyone in here. All of them stream, have youtube accounts, or have theorycraft blogs, and they all know each other. Except for you. You are the anomaly. You are the one who is going to bring the entire team to the ground.

Players queue dodge the instant they spot the enemy pick Poppy, because they *know* that only **that** guy plays Poppy, and that is an instant GG. The moment a new lobby starts the very first ban on your team is Poppy. The same thing happens nine times over until everyone knows who is who on the other team, at which point one group decides they have already lost and just dick around and troll until the 20 minute surrender.

Somehow, you win. You play games and get better. You reach the top. The final promotion series is there. This is it.

---------------------------------------

&gt;**Challenger**

It takes you more than five hours to start a game. Playing requires you to stay up all night in the hopes of a match, but it doesn't affect you any more, seeing as you have already foregone normal sleep hours since Gold V. Instead, you spend all the time doing LoLKing searches on your potential allies and enemies as well as famous plays so you know what to do at all times.

Noone ever dies before the 20 minute mark anymore. Wards are placed around 80% of the map, and the remaining 20% are constantly patrolled by players of both teams. The games are so close that something as minute as dominating the central brush in the bottom half of the river is enough to snowball a victory out of control. Every single champion ult is timed, every single summoner, every single item use. An ADC that misses five CS in the entire laning phase causes his entire team to mass-ragequit at once. A Jungler who does not gank and force the enemy team to flash might as well be considered a roaming ward. A Top Lane who lets his tower die before the laning phase will have his game recorded and put up on LoLReplay so everyone in the Tier will see, laugh, and await his inevitable demise when he falls back to Diamond.

Sometimes, someone decides to troll the game. At this point, everyone decides on the same thing at once, and all subtlety is thrown off the window. Players will go 5-mid to see if it is viable, proceed to let their supports farm and the ADC to babysit them, and attempt to 2-man baron at the fifteen minute mark with Teemo and Urgot. These are the games that are broadcast and placed on Youtube to trick people in believing that ""high-rank players are having fun"". The greatest, most beautiful lie ever told.

Yet you are here, and you keep playing. This can't be it, you tell yourself. This can't be how it ends. This isn't League of Legends' Ranked Heaven. You are still in Ranked Hell. You are going to keep getting your LP. You are going to reach the fabled 100 thousand LP requirement to reach Ranked Heaven. You must. You have to. Just one more game... Just... one... more... game...

---------------------------------
---------------------------------
---------------------------------
Edit: Yes I realize I got the number of tiers wrong. Brainfart. Just pretend you read ""six tiers of ranked hell"" before entering.

Edit2: Artistic Liberty. I am not literally saying ""that is how Tier X works guys.""

**Final Honest to Goodness Edit**: The verdict is out, people! Here are the results:

&gt; No matter how much you say it, people are still not going to be aware of what is a parody and what is meant to represent real life x.x **I do not think bronze and silver really work that way kthxbye**

&gt; I will admit that the first three Tiers were the best, and my writing slowly lost it after the fourth. I guess I was running out of funny stuff to point out in LoL and just wanted to finish the job already. My bad fellas =[

&gt; You mention Dan Brown on Reddit and everyone loses their minds.jpg

&gt; Zekent, you are awesome, buddy.

&gt; **The entire point was the further you go, the deeper you actually are in Elo Hell**. Not strictly true, but just remember that there are trolls, quitters, AFKers and in general assholes no matter what Tier you are. **And if you somehow never meet these please let me know so I can join your MMR danke**

&gt; Finally, with 20 hours of this being placed on the Front Page, just wanted to thank the fans, the critics, the people who don't understand the concept of Parody, the people who just raged that ""THAT IS NOT HOW X TIER WORKS"", the people who said ""hey, its good, but it could be better"", and everyone who kept voting. You are ALL awesome in your own (and sometimes fairly shitty) way. See you again soon^TM !"	1360	502	
4756456	dayz	87690315	https://www.reddit.com//r/dayz/comments/1g7ia3/some_constructive_criticism_on_the_e3_footage_and/	2013-06-12 17:36:31		NeoDestiny	Some constructive(!!) criticism on the E3 footage, and why some (a lot?) of people are a bit let down by what they saw	http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1g7ia3/some_constructive_criticism_on_the_e3_footage_and/	"**EDIT: Rocket [commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1g7ia3/some_constructive_criticism_on_the_e3_footage_and/cahx3iz?context=3) below**

Hello! I am a relatively well known streamer in the Starcraft and League of Legends community and I absolutely fell in love with DayZ a year or so ago when I first discovered it and started playing. Like a lot of you, I fell out of interest with it due to the hacking, primarily, and also a bit because of all of the random bugs. Nothing was more frustrating than running 15 minutes to the NW airfield only to be thunderdomed by a hacker or (arguably worse) killed by a door in one of the barracks, heh.

Like a lot of people in the subreddit, I quit playing DayZ (for the most part) and began to anxiously await the release of the stand-alone. It's been quite a long wait, but we were all (for the most part) happy to wait because of two things:

- We knew that the team that was working on the game was relatively small, compared to most larger game studios.

- We knew that the end product would be something worth waiting for.

Today, I want to talk a little bit about number 2, and why the E3 footage that was leaked worried me a little bit.

There's no easy way to say this without coming off like a bit of a dick, so I'll just get this part out of the way. The E3 footage looked like a reskin of the Arma 2 DayZ. The movement appeared more or less just as sluggish (the door moving the character model, the general handling/response of the character) and, more noticeably, the zombies appeared just as glitchy as ever (running through walls, hitting the character, running behind the player due to pathing to attack, doing damage way before they've even gotten to the character, etc..).

These things are very worrisome because these are the ""hard"" parts about DayZ stand-alone, and from what it looks like in the E3 preview, absolutely no (apparent) progress was made towards solving these problems.

I think I speak for all of us when I say this: **It would have been far more exciting to see a shitty collection of boxes (that represented houses) and stick figures (representing the player and zombies) moving around the screen and interacting with each other in an incredibly smooth way than it was to see a reskinned DayZ with all of the same bugs as before.** If everything looked like absolute shit, but the engine (the thing we're all the most excited about!) looked to function well, damn that would be exciting. Because at that point, all we'd be thinking is ""Jesus, everything is so smooth. It looks like shit because of the placeholder graphics, but all they have to do now is work on the animations and graphics and everything will be perfect!""

Instead, we saw a nicer looking, reskinned DayZ that honestly wouldn't surprise me if it were just released as a DayZ patch tomorrow. ""Graphics updates, guys! And way more buildings you can go into! Plus a crafting and map system!"" That's pretty neat, but those aren't the things we were really excited for.

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people who like the new graphics and the map and crafting stuff, I think they're fine ideas. People are mad and upset, though, **because they assumed that those new systems were going to be built on a heavily improved stand-alone engine that was free from the terrible buggy glitchiness that existed in DayZ.**

**Some common responses I've seen so far:**

- ""DUDE STFU IT'S PRE-ALPHA IDIOT""

Yeah, it is pre-alpha...but why did so much work go into new buildings, nice graphics, inventory management and a new crafting system before work went into the actual engine itself? In my earlier example, I think we all would have been far more excited to see shitty programmer placeholder graphics in a well functioning, smoothed out engine instead of seeing what, essentially, looked like a reskin of our current DayZ game.

- ""THERE ARE A TON OF CHANGES U JUST CAN'T SEE THEM YET LIKE THE SERVER-CLIENT ARKITECSHUR!11Q""

If the game is already that laggy in **single-player mode**, there's no way any server-client architecture is going to help. I'm sure they've made some changes on the backend, but none of those changes matter if the end product to us, the player, still contains horribly glitchy zombies and sluggish/Arma II movement.

--------------------

I'm not saying ""OH GOD SA SUX"" or ""FUCK DAYZ I HATE THIS SUBREDDIT"" or trying to shit on Dean or fearmonger or anything...I'm just expressing why I believe so many people are disappointed in the SA video from E3. I was incredibly excited to see some shitty-looking, but very smooth-running DayZ, but so far everything I've seen looks possible to do in the current Arma II engine and all of the same bugs still seem to exist. I hope I'm wrong on all of this and I hope SA launches relatively bug-free."	112	532

1. Atheism: The way science goes about disproving something is by finding evidence to the contrary. Many religions can be put down through evidence pointing otherwise but some cannot as of yet. Since all religious claims cannot be refuted it's respectful to the scientific method to not completely denounce religions plausibility.

2.Religion: There is no definitive proof of a God or supernatural force acting on the universe anywhere (no, m-theory doesn't count). That being said, faith is what allows people to hold religious beliefs. I think these people aren't being responsible to themselves because faith simply is a delusion.

Those points being stated I think holding a position of admitted ignorance is both respectful to the possibility that faith is necessary in life and the notion that delusions are not a great thing to incorporate all over your life. CMV."	73	258

It was proposed that in addition to boycotting the future konami events that we also contact them through email and phone support to voice our concerns and announce that we are boycotting.


• Konami Phone Number - 310-220-8100
• Konami Yugioh Support Email - us-cardsupport@konami.com
• Konami Twitter Page - https://twitter.com/KonamiSupport

In the email, or phone call please be respectful and act like an adult or we will not be taken seriously and we will just look like 20 year old man-children. Voice your concerns and know what you are upset about.

Pick something like lack of advance notice for events, the coverage of major events being inadequate, How the OCG product support is better, cheaper to play in the OCG, or that they have better quality cards compared to what we get. 

Just vocalise something you care about as a player. Clearly state that until that issue or issues are fixed you will not longer be supporting them by attending any major events including any regional or YCS's

Also, Do not bitch about dragons or prophecy, or anything ban-list related. Thats is just silly.



Summary of the reasons we are boycotting Konami events.


* Konami has strict regulations regarding how, what, when, where, and which 3rd parties can organize major events. While understandable some of the rules are just silly, and we would like some of them changed

* Regarding YCS Toronto, the announced it about a month or so ago. This gives very little time for players to organize travel plans. As well plane tickets and hotel reservations are extremely expensive the closer you are to the date of reservation.( Hopefully this makes sense ) More so, if someone does not have a passport, good luck getting in a month with out paying out the ass. It makes it practically impossible for non-canadians to compete with out having to jump through hoops.

 The event has been on the convention site that is holding it's event page for months. But most players would be unaware as Konami did not announce it until just recently. More so the 2nd day of the event falls on 9/1 the first day of the next format. As of yet, they have not said what day 2 will consist of giving players little time to prepare.  We are essentially left in the dark until the last minute and most competitive players are annoyed by this.

* Event coverage is horrible compared to other TCGs. The coverage Konami gives us if god awful, hardly even life. We are not allowed to record in any of the venues that events take place in. There is no streaming for Top Cut, or Feature Matches which is as well silly. Even if it was just recording post later I could give with this. It does not need to be live. 

There are a few other concerns such as shitty prize support and other things which can be found here. http://josephgiorlando.wix.com/occupyygo

This is the second announcement of three, and you can find the official page here:

- [Steam Machines Announcement](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamMachines/)

If you missed a previous announcement you can find them here:

- [Announcement Page](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/)

- [SteamOS Announcement Page](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/) and [Discussion Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1mywoh/steamos_announced_day_1_of_3_official_discussion/)

Valve is planning on doing 3 announcements total, and we will be making official threads for each of the announcements. The next announcement is scheduled for September 27th at 10 am PDT (48 hours after this announcement went live).

___

(As with yesterday any speculation that I make that isn't explicitly stated in the announcement will be *marked with italics*)

Steam Machines (previously referred to as Steam Box - and used interchangeably in the announcement) have been announced, but are still in the prototype phase. Valve is working with multiple hardware partners to put out Steam Machines that will come in a variety of options, all of which will be running SteamOS.

Valve is also running a contest where they will ship out 300 high-performance Steam Boxes to users who have completed a few steps on Steam for free. You have until October 25th to finish the steps and be eligible for a chance at a prototype Steam Box.

**FAQs listed on the page**
(Questions and answers have been shortened here, if you want the full text visit the announcement page)

- When Can I buy one?!

Beginning in 2014 there will be multiple options to choose from.

- Do I have to buy the new hardware?

No, normal Steam will continue forward as usual.

- Why is Valve also putting out their own box?

*It's for the prototype and intended for users who want the most control over their hardware.* Other options will optimize for other factors.

- How will you choose the 300 beta participants?

30 will be chosen based on past community contributions/beta participation, the rest will be random.

- Should I create lots of Steam accounts to get better chances?

No, that won't work.

- What are the specs of the prototype? / Is there a picture of it?

We'll tell you more about it soon.

- When will prototypes ship?

This year.

- Will beta testers be free to share info? / Will I be able to build my own box to run SteamOS? / Can I hack the box, run another OS, turn it into a robot, etc.?

Yes.

- Can I download the OS to try it out?

Yes (including source code) but not yet.

- If I'm not in the beta can I still give feedback?

Yes, in the [Steam Universe Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse)

- What games will be available during the beta?

Nearly 3,000. Hundreds run natively, the rest via streaming.

- Mouse and Keyboard in the living room?

If you want, but you can also use a controller. **""Stay tuned, though - we have some more to say very soon on the topic of input.""**"	2581	2904

What are your thoughts on it?	http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1parfn/why_is_blackface_considered_to_be_so_offensive/	"For starters, I completely understand that this question might be incredibly offensive to some people.  Please know that this is absolutely not my intention, I just want to understand the perspectives behind it a little more.

So this question is in response to the drama surrounding Julianne Hough's [halloween costume](http://www.eonline.com/news/474574/julianne-hough-goes-blackface-as-orange-is-the-new-black-character-for-halloween-costume).  I know a little about the history of blackface and how it was used to mock African American's in the past, but the incredible outrage that less ill-willed blackface causes more recently is a little confusing to me.

To play a bit of devil's advocate, why is the use of blackface in a halloween costume worse than other ways people use makeup to manipulate their appearance? [ Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/search?q=halloween&amp;restrict_sr=on#page=1) are some examples of what I mean.  And no, I'm not saying that I think it's acceptable to dress up as a certain race for Halloween.  In the case of Julianne Hough, she was dressing up as a particular person with dark skin, so she used makeup to make her skin look dark.  She wasn't trying to mock the character she was imitating at all, just trying to make a realistic costume.

I really don't know where I stand on the political correctness of blackface.  I'm curious to know how the rest of you feel about it."	141	219

He's mainly an inside dog because I don't want his barking to annoy my neighbors. 

Anyway I was sitting outside with him and it was kinda dark in the backyard. He was finished doing his business and I called him to come inside. He ran to the door , but stopped and turned around, the I started hearing a squeak. I thought he had grabbed a squeak toy, but realized it was something alive that he was chomping down on. 

I tried to catch him to prevent him from eating it, but this results in him trying to wolf it  down as he stays two steps ahead of me chasing him. In fact he swallows it a couple of times but coughs it up and finally I can pick him up and put him inside while I get rid of the carcass. All I could make out was the front and rear feet with a bunch of guts in between and kinda funny that an eyeball was just hanging looking straight up at me. Lol. 

My JRT has previously eaten other small dead animals he finds on walks or in the yard. He is also obsessed with eating bugs he kills to include flies, wasps, and even a stink bug that kept spraying at him. He's also killed rabbits and a coral snake, but I got to them before he could eat them. 

I know he has extremely strong hunting skills and that's expected, but I wonder if it's the breed that makes him want to eat his kill. I hear stories of cats or dogs that might kill a mouse or bird and bring it to their owners to try to please the owner. Not sure which I prefer, but was curious what other JRT owners have experienced. "	3	4

Like many who took part in this [https://foursquare.com/crownecomngment](https://foursquare.com/crownecomngment)year's UN climate talks, I leave Warsaw tired. Not as tired as those that spent two weeks talking, drafting, wrangling, redrafting and horse-trading, followed by an almost [40-hour marathon final session](https://plus.google.com/113890670352423121938/posts). But I do feel tired. I'm tired by the fact that all of that effort, energy and, in the main, goodwill has again resulted in so little progress. 

Where does it go wrong? Nobody can now dispute that climate change is a threat to human society, to the planet as a whole. Nobody can genuinely be confused about what we need to do to reduce this threat. But still inaction seems to be an option, for some the preferred option.

Should we blame those tired negotiators and their governments? Did they draw too many red lines? Did they turn the negotiations into hopeless rhetorical tangles? Can we blame them for putting the interests of their citizens ahead of citizens from other countries or continents? Can we blame them for looking towards re-election? For remembering who put them in office? For reflecting on who donated the most to their campaign coffers?

Or should we blame the UN process? Are there too many voices at the table? Too much semantic hair-splitting, procedural squabbling and high-level posturing? Too much politics? Too many egos? Too much pride?

Not sure where I stand on it, and I always thought I was pretty progressive...then I became a mother a year ago. I'm open to any logical points!

Edit: Thanks so much for the feedback! It's a looong way a from happening, but I lost sleep over it last night. The debate was sparked by a friend from Sweden attempting to figure out the disparity between it being ""ok"" for his nephew to have sex in his sisters home here in the US (sis and nephew are Swedish), but ""not ok"" with the parents of the girlfriend (Americans). So that really made me reflect on the mixed messages I received as a teen (mom put me on birth control at 14, but I was not allowed to have a boy in my room with the door closed even at 18...wtf mom?!). So I guess that adds to the debate, what if you're not ok as a parent with sex under your roof, but you have the sneaking suspicion your child's BF/GF parents are? How the heck do you even address that?

Edit/update: The basic overarching theme I've deduced from this is that both teens and parents alike, are not overly comfortable, but it's the nature of the beast when said teen becomes sexually active. Even with parents that seem to try and be open in discussing sex with their kids and setting healthy standards of responsible sexual behavior. Yes, I know that teenagers will always be having sex sooner than their mother or father would prefer them to, for a plethora of reasons, but the ""ick factor"" seems to go both ways. My hope is that I will raise a responsible son that respects women and sees sex as a fun and healthy way to bond with their partner, but that they are being very cautious and careful with those decisions. I also think it would be helpful to establish a relationship with the parents of my sons partner to see what their take is on it and present a unified front. Thank you again reddit, I'm looking forward to some good sleep tonight! :)

PS LOL, I'd be remiss in sharing that a random woman professing to be a psychic claimed (unsolicited on my part) that I would be a grandmother before I turned 50."	85	228

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Two months after Mormon Kate Kelly led hundreds in a demonstration to shed light on gender inequality in the religion — defying church orders to stay off Temple Square — the founder of a prominent Mormon women's group is facing excommunication.

But here is the best part, coming from the church itself:

""The LDS Church is not a democratic institution, and has never claimed to be,"" Mauss said in an email, ""So such actions are interpreted by church leaders as attempts to displace or undermine their legitimate authority over church policies and teachings.""

The feminist movement in the LDS will not be tolerated. 

""Some members in effect choose to take themselves out of the church by actively teaching and publicly attempting to change doctrine to comply with their personal beliefs,"" the statement reads. ""This saddens leaders and fellow members.""

Finally, a place where they won't give in to PC garbage. SMall battle won! Good for them for remaining steadfast!

A common argument that I've seen to this in threads is ""well if somebody is wrong, I'm just going to downvote them. They don't need any rational."" But here's the thing: it isn't up to you to determine what is wrong unless you have a reason. 

If it's something objective, ie ""In what year did X sail the Y?"", then you can correct it easily. If it's ""This should/n't be."" then there is no objective right or wrong; only your opinion. If you can't back that up, don't have one.

Not the ""Patriarchy""."	http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2ixqlv/women_are_at_fault_for_the_socalled_burden_to_be/	"Brief story that inspired this post: Some girl I met at a party contacted me out of the blue on facebook. She wanted to ""introduce her friend"" to me. I'm always open for more plates, but I asked her if this is one of those times when she introduces a fat/ugly friend to me. 

Yep. I won't post the photo here but suffice it to say, I wouldn't even touch this chick if I was high + drunk. And I've even hid behind the ""a hole is a hole"" justification before in my pre-redpill days (to my everlasting shame). But this was too low.

Anyway, I immediately told her she was high on crack and that her friend was not attractive at all. She of course called me ""mean"" and ""super asshole"" that I wouldn't extend the label of ""beautiful"" to her friend. She said that ""she has a great personality though"". As if that matters. I told her I have standards and no thanks.

---

**Analysis:**

Women think they deserve to be called ""beautiful"". When they aren't called beautiful by men, they blame those men for being mean. Why? Because they FEEL they are good people and it hurts them. Because being called beautiful makes them feel good. **Because they equate beauty with being a good person.**

The last part is really key. In my mind, when I called her friend unattractive, I wasn't insulting her at all. There's no connection with beauty and morality/ethics in my mind. As someone who's used my dick to plow through the fertile female fields of Korea, I know that some super hot girls are righteous bitches. Her butt ugly friend could be a moral saint and great person, probably even better than me (who cares?). Hell, she probably works in a soup kitchen for the homeless.

So why the resistance on her part? It's because women think ""beauty"" makes them into a good person. Beauty compensates for hard work/fair play/equal responsibility. **So when you deny them ""beauty"", you are essentially denying them access to all of these exclusive benefits women can potentially receive (material goods; high moral character)**.

On the other hand, for redpill guys, beauty is a thing unto itself. If you're unattractive, you simply cannot attract people. Doesn't mean you can't do your job or raise kids or be a good friend. It just means less people will want to stick their penises inside your body if you're female or want to allow your penis if you're male. Simple. 

The next time a woman says: 

- **""Beauty isn't everything"", she's hamstering.** Because otherwise she wouldn't get upset when a man simply doesn't want to call her pretty. In her mind, **the man is essentially denying his future resources to her, because they know high SMV men only give resources to beautiful women**. That offends (and saddens) her. So it's easier to believe that beauty isn't that important for attractiveness (even though it is for all of us), because that would mean their low beauty wouldn't detract from them anymore.

- **""You're mean! My friend isn't ugly!"", she is upset because she thinks you are calling her friend a bad person.** She is upset because her friend *deserves* access to alpha resources. By extension, **if her (uglier) friend deserves them, then she definitely deserves an alpha** (Basically, it's the thing where a moderate girl hangs out with 2 ugly ones to make herself look better).

- **""It's the patriarchy's fault for perpetuating unfair beauty standards""**, what she is really saying is ""It's men's fault for perpetuating unfair SMV access standards"". Again Beauty = access to security, value, money, ease of responsibility, etc. The majority of women implicitly recognize this, as they plaster various chemicals on their faces daily to look better.

 So when a subpar woman doesn't measure up to a high SMV community's standards, she will call those standards unfair/excluding/sexist/patriarchal/mean/antiquated instead of improving herself to MEET those standards (exception: Korean girls get surgery in droves to meet those standards). 

 Simplest example of this phenomenon: Exclusive clubs deny fat/ugly/underdressed women (and men) while also providing better treatment for richer men and hotter women. The club = high SMV community. Women who can't get in blame it on the ""standards"", not themselves, because inside the club is a treasure trove of validation/alpha men/benefits. If it was a construction site (no high value), no woman would care. 

 Another example: Augusta National golf club (No regular woman actually wants to golf there, they just want to know they can since golf is probably the ""richest"" sport in the world. So they sued the place. On the other hand, no woman is clamoring to play in men's only Ethiopian barefoot soccer leagues. ""Eww u guyz!"").

Around, a year ago, if not more I made a couple Facebook profiles for the sole purpose of looking into how Syrians behave and what regions typically have more rebel supporters {Usually it's Daraa, Idlib, and Homs} and which ones have more SAA supporters or fighters {Usually it's Latakia, Aleppo, and Damascus} but something has caught my eye in the last couple months. 

The complete admiration of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, and the really abundant Shia symbolism and rhetoric. At first, I didn't really pay attention to it, but the volume has increased exponentially and now numerous profiles are continuously posting Hezbollah flags and banners of Ali. First, I was thinking it was just isolated to small alawi sects, but it's becoming increasingly more prevalent, even among Christian and Sunni circles. Heck, in some cases, I've seen more love for Nasrallah than Assad. 

I've wanted to investigate into this further, along with the demographics of Syrians on social media. The usage of religion and politics {most describe themselves as Muslim or secular, instead of Alawi or Sunni, only the Christians make a disquisition} the morale, and how prevalent the Hezbollah-Syria project is and Shiaification of Syria. I have probably 5,000 Facebook pages to look into, if I only want to scratch the surface, way more if I actually look into it. 

Oh, side note: Talked to an army major in Homs about a week ago, expecting some interesting developments in North Homs in the upcoming months. "	32	94

&amp;nbsp;

Recently i tried to give up something which i considered to be becoming a problem; staring at women, real women, while walking around, going to office, etc. For most people this may be part of recovery, but to me it seemed that i was either desperately trying to gain their attention (mainly just eye contact, not to actually talk to them) or check out their bodies. Both of which seemed to be becoming counter productive, as i wasnt interested in the women as people

&amp;nbsp;

Giving this up, the staring at women was the hardest habit to kick, which i still havent managed. I keep arguing with myself that it is perfectly natural to stare, im taking it too far, etc. Today, i made eye contact with a couple of women who seemed to be staring at me, but because of my paranoia i didnt know how to react, or i looked away immediately. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is making me feel completely like shit. I'm 22 and havent had a conversation with a woman lasting more than 15 min, and that too just small talk, never a deep conversation, or a real heart to heart. As i see my friends around me all getting girlfriends, it makes me depressed for the future"	58	60

This kept on for years and eventually got worse. As more information was coming out and GordyB of The Big 3 was denying eternal progression and saying Polygamy is not Doctrinal - I was made a High Priest so I would be out of Elders Quorum and not disrupt them with asking questions they couldn't answer.

Why, when someone asks a legitimate question do so many start baring a testimony rather than trying to find the answer? 

I remember one lesson on Joe and the Carthage jail where all but one other in the Quorum got pissed and called us both liars for saying Joe had drunk wine as well as shot back at the attackers. ""All a Lie"" and immediately testimonies of Joe as a prophet started being recited - like that changes reality.

""The other night, I was riding my bicycle to Taco Bell. Unfortunately due to inconsistent hours, I was not aware the dining room closed at midnight. So being an experienced road cyclist, and riding a full night compliant bicycle equipped with headlight and taillight, I decided to go through the drive thru. 

However I was rudely denied service. The reason was that I was not in a motor vehicle. I explained my legs are my motors and that I was fully legally able to be on the road. The only explanation was that it was due to safety. The drive thru people then rudely refused to respond. 

Safety? SAFETY?!?

Let me tell you about safety.
What is so safe about having a restaurant with a built in window that supplies food to persons operating a motor vehicle? Eating tacos, burritos, and quesadillas severely impairs ones ability to devote full attention to operating their high velocity multi-ton vehicle. One little lapse of attention can easily lead to the injury of the driver. Or even worse, injury or death to innocent pedestrians, cyclists, or other innocent bystanders. 

So therefore the reasoning of 'safety' should not be a reason someone on a bicycle cannot order from a window that actively distributes distractions to motorists. 

I will return to Taco Bell. I will be on my bicycle. I expect to be served with your luscious cheapo glorious Americanized Mexican food.

As many of you are aware, there has been quite a few disputes lately about the purpose of our community. Some people have asked for clarification about whether or not this is a strictly Ovo-Lacto Vegetarian community, or if it is more of a general community to discuss all things related to vegetarianism, including veganism and other types of vegetarian diets. 

Please take a moment to answer this survey and voice your opinion. The results of the survey will mainly be used as a guideline to determine what the overall mood of the community is. 

Regardless of the results of the survey, I would like to remind everyone that we’re all here because of a shared interest in vegetarianism. Under no circumstances is it appropriate to use profanity and berate other members of the community because you disagree with them. I’ve seen countless examples of people calling each other names and swearing at each other and a lot of people leaving the community because of this. I don’t really like to remove comments because I think everyone is entitled to their opinion, however, I don’t think this sort of behavior should be tolerated. It’s like the old adage, “If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” 

Thank you for taking the survey. I’m extremely busy at work and will be spotty online today, but I’ll try to check back as often as I can.

However, I was still in a great mood so I gave out the most encouragement I have ever done, and we ended up winning the game

I complimented and encouraged the team every ~2 minutes, maybe more frequently. Not just ""gj"", I mean ""that was a great idea (insert name), it was just unfortunate it didn't quite work out"". I went full on therapist, and it worked wonders. I mediated disagreements, empathized with the people doing poorly, and took blame for situations that were maybe 20% my fault.

We came back from a 6k gold deficit at 18 and 2 players got off tilt.

If flaming makes you loose 15% of games (or whatever rito says I can't recall), being just the nicest person your team has interacted with that day is going to help you win at least 15%.

It's a comedy with heavy dramatic and action elements.

Nowhere is this reflected better in recent story arcs than with the reveal of Edward Weeble.

There has been a solid few years of buildup to this reveal of this final warlord.

We get a goofy looking, bumbling manchild who takes orders from his mama. But this idiot is actually annihilating some of the strongest pirates in the world, by himself.

Brilliant. Weeble is my favorite new character from the past few arcs. He's so great. I can't wait to see what direction this character goes in."	73	95

I keep seeing tons of complaints that it's only marginally different. I expected that because it's been said repeatedly that it was designed in Hard mode and dialed back for normal.

He has dozens of posts about how beautiful and in love with his ex he is on his facebook wall from their relationship of 3 years that ended two years ago. I've asked him to delete them repeatedly after telling him they are hurtful to me to see. They are publicly visible sometimes and at least visible to friends of friends (all my friends).

He says I'm dredging up the past and should not snoop. However, a month after we started dating he asked me to delete all pictures of my ex on Facebook so his friends didn't see them. Despite having strict privacy settings and knowing this wasn't possible, I deleted everything including posts about being in love because I wanted to show him I valued his feelings. I didn't realize he had numerous posts about his ex until months later. 

We just got engaged and posted it on Facebook. I know a few of my out of state friends went to his profile to learn more about him after the post. I don't know if they saw the old posts. (He doesn't post that frequently, so it wouldn't take that much scrolling to get to them.)

He acts like I'm being jealous and suspicious. I am a little jealous because there's a long public record of his love for her. He's never written anything like that about me. (They were engaged also.) But I feel like I'm just asking for reciprocity. 

He recently said if I keep bringing it up, he will unfriend me on Facebook. It feels like he's giving me an ultimatum. He never listens to my concerns about this. It feels very unfair because I did what he asked, but he will not do the same. 

I would love to hear feedback /r/Relationships on if you think I'm just being jealous or if he's being obstinate and how we can reach a compromise that we accept. He won't even engage about it.

**tl;dr** My now fiancé (38/m) won't delete old love posts about ex despite asking me (35/f) to delete all my ex's pictures, which I did early in our relationship. I would love to hear feedback on if you think I'm just being jealous or if he's being obstinate and how we can reach a compromise that we accept."	315	136

I'm [21M] not, but she doesn't believe or trust me, how can I fix this?	https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4b9c5b/my_girlfriends_20f_friends_have_convinced_her/	"Yeah so this has been going on for close to a week now. Last week my girlfriend sat me down, and asked me if I was cheating on her. I told her the I most certainly was not, and asked why she thought I was cheating in the first place. She told me how her friends told her that they always saw me flirting and talking up other girls at parties and other social events, as well as taking random girls home after parties. They also mentioned I'm probably sleeping with my marketing project partner, because we were in the same room together working on our project, and clearly a male and female can't be alone in the same room without something happening.

These accusations really pissed me off, but she was crying and getting really emotional so I tried to convince her that I hadn't done any of these things and I was committed to her. I also asked her to stop listening to her so called friends, because they were extremely toxic. They've always been very jealous and petty of her, treat her like shit, and have tried to come between us multiple times. 

Since that time however, our relationship just hasn't been the same. It seems like she doesn't believe or trust me at all, and I don't know what I can do to regain her trust in our relationship. She keeps saying how she's scared I'm going to break up with her for another girl, and I don't know how to fix this. What can I do? 

tl;dr: Gf's friends have poisoned her into believing I'm cheating, how can I rebuild our trust? "	2	24

When I first came out (8 years ago?) I said I was bisexual, which I think was true at the time. However, over time I have moved more and more towards having a vast preference for women. Around two years ago I preferred to identify as queer, and now I am starting to think that I may just be a lesbian.

However, since I have no experience with guys (have I even kissed a guy? I don't remember, but I don't think so!) I'm not sure how much I don't like them. Like I don't feel repulsed by guys, I could fantasise about a fictional guy in my head, but I find I have no desire to chase one irl. I think maybe I'm put off more by the general 'maleness' more so than the physical bits and pieces, but maybe I just have a bad view of men that I meet in real life. There's a lot of bastards out there.

But as an example, a few weeks ago I made friends with a guy who was actually incredibly nice and quite pretty, but I just had no desire to try and pursue him at all. While on tinder/okcupid I have my preference set to women only, I can definitely see myself settling down with a nice lady and I feel vaguely annoyed whenever a man or hetero couple come up on my feed.

Is this what it is like to be a lesbian, or should I be more squicked out at the mere thought of being with a guy? Is just not wanting to/choosing not to enough? People talk about it not being a choice a lot. I feel bad appropriating a label that isn't mine, or look silly if I 'change my mind' in the future, but I'm not sure that queer or bisexual really fit me any more. I met a queer girl the other day who asked me if I was gay when I mentioned going to a Queer Film Festival and I found myself trying to explain/qualify my gayness and it just felt really embarrassing tbh rather than feeling able to just say ""Yes"". I'm aware that it might just be some stupid leftover homophobic part of my mind that is trying to hold me back to just committing to who I am, like 'Oh, but wait, maybe you do still like guys!'

Yeah, sorry for rambling, but thanks if you have advice :)"	16	73

He has worked there for 4 years, in the deli. cast of characters- Owner, Manager, hubs. 

We are moving next month, about 4 hours north for a fresh start. We are staying with friends of his for a few months to save money to pay down debt/save for a place of our own. He is going to be working for his friend's brother, and its a good job. He told a buddy of his that we are moving (I haven't told anyone yet, as I don't want it getting back to my BFF or my parents and then listen to 2 months of ""you're making a mistake"".) The kids know, and I've made it clear they are not to say anything about it to anyone. I expected that one of them would slip. Nope.... hubs did. Or rather, his friend did. His friend was talking to one of the cashiers at hubs' work, and the cashier said something to hubs about it when manager dude was walking past..... about a month and a half before we had planned to tell anyone. So now, word is out.

Owner is surprisingly ok with it- hubs has been the strongest and most reliable deli worker over the last few years, and its kind of been a revolving door with other employees. But, Owner is a cool guy, and says that he's happy for us for making a move to make things better. Manager guy though? Manager guy has been the complete opposite.

MG has sent nasty ""You didn't do this, this or this, you did this this and that wrong"" going-off text messages to my husband, telling him that he's slacking and causing drama (he's not.... he's actually working harder now that they know we are leaving so they have time to adequately train his replacement). The text messages he sent my husband last week infuriated me. As a manager, if I had EVER spoken to someone like that, my boss would have suspended me at the very least. Anyway, it goes back and forth for awhile, and then hubs goes to work. Manager's last text was ""If you don't like the way I talk to you, there's the door"". So, a couple days later, hubs talks to owner, who's response is ""Oh, that's just manager guy. Don't take it personally"".

This ENTIRE week, manager guy and husband have completely avoided talking to each other. Not a healthy environment, but at least they aren't picking at each other. Or rather, manager guy isn't picking at husband, who can only take so much before he snaps back. (And.... hubs *can* get spiteful when he snaps, so he really tries not to). Things have been tense, but he's been able to deal.

Yesterday, he had the day off to spend the day with his mom. Today, he got to work, and apparently manager guy went off on him in front of customers (Owner guy's BIGGEST thing is polite, friendly, customer service. He isn't gonna like this, AT ALL) and other employees. Husband hasn't said what it was about, but he did say that manager guy said again ""If you don't like it there's the door"". Now.... we are moving, it is irresponsible to quit his job early when we have no savings and still have 2 months of bills to pay here... but this is the 3rd or 4th blowout like this in the last couple months, and that now makes 2 in about 2 weeks. Manager guy left for awhile, and texted husband some half assed apology thing, and is supposed to be back in an hour and a half to help close or something. 

When manager asshole gets back, I want husband to tell him that he can consider this his 2-weeks notice and call his bluff, and that if, after he gives his official notice, manager asshole goes off again, to just be done. But.... is this irresponsible? We kinda need his paychecks. He is taking summer classes for the financial aid refund and we are planning to use that to a. fix my car, b. buy him a truck, and c. save the rest for moving, but that money won't come until June 1st. Do we just bite the bullet and struggle like hell till then? Do I tell him its ok to quit now, because this is not a healthy environment for him. 

It has been fucking with him, he's been in a funk for awhile, and when these blowups happen, he gets more distant. Its not fair for him to be targeted like this, and accused of not caring, when it is very obvious that he cares just as much, if not more than manager guy. If he didn't, he would leave them fucked over with no qualms. But husband is a good guy, and this is tearing him apart. He is not the friendly, happy, nice guy that is usually behind the counter. What do I do? 

When I was having suicidal thoughts at my fast food job, he totally supported me in quitting, and we struggled for 2 months til i found another job, and he didn't say a thing about it. I want to do that for him, and he keeps telling me its irresponsible, and he can deal with it. But I don't think its fair to make him keep dealing with it, when its just getting worse. What do I do?"	7	11

To defend the police, some people have been saying that police would not risk their reputation and finance to frame SA.
The reality is that in America, just like some rogue nations in the world, the rich and the powerful enjoy one despicable and disgusting privilege: IMPUNITY.
According to the police in Manitowoc, they could even get away with murdering SA himself. It is not difficult to assume that they were not at all afraid of planting evidence and framing SA. It was just a little more difficult to frame him than killing him. 
After SA's exoneration in 2003, the state of Wisconsin found nothing wrong with those who put SA in jail for almost two decades.
It is not hard to speculate that if LE didn't pull the trigger to kill TH they must have participated in evidence planting and falsely prosecuting. They had the motive and they thought that they had the impunity.
It is high time to change. In the land of laws, nobody should be above the law. This time around, hopefully, some wrong doers should be put into prison for a LONG time if not for good."	31	42

I chimed in to back up my associate, and reiterate that we'd give him a call if we finished it that night.

I specifically work as a guard at federal buildings in the bay area and commute from Sacramento, CA. Yesterday i had to work at the federal building at 1301 clay st in Oakland. There is a ""lead"" guard there who essentially is the supervisor. When guards arrive they must wait outside a locked door for another guard inside to buzz open the door for them. Then they must walk through a room and to their assigned post where they ""clock"" in by signing a federal 139 form. You are considered late if you are not at your assigned post on time. I was scheduled to work at 0600am yesterday and hit major traffic on I80 due to an accident. I called another supervisor (the ""lieutentant"") letting him know i may be 30-40 mins late. I actually got to work right at 6:00am and signed in at that time. However, the lead at the site later approached me, spoke with me and accused me of lying because he didn't see me on site at 6:00am, then had me re-sign in at 6:01am saying according to him i was late. I did so, making a notation that he told me to do so. Later i went and asked him to check the camera footage which shows my post and the time accordingly. The camera only covers part of my post area but it showed me getting there at exactly 6:00am and between 20-45 seconds before 6:01am. He then told me i was 45 seconds late. I dont understand why i was late, as on the federal form we only sign in as HH:MM and do not write the seconds. Do i have a case here or am i wrong? It may not seem like a big deal but because i am currently completing a DHS investigation right now any employment issues are a very big deal to me. To update this, when i left at the end of the shift i didn't sign out because i wanted the 139 fixed back to 6:00am. The next day i received a call from a lieutenant saying if i didnt sign out i would receive a federal write-up and cost the company $5000."	6	6

**Updates**:

16' Schweinsteiger comes on for Khedira who is injured. 

27' Schweinsteiger has put the ball in the back of the Italian net but a freekick was awarded for his push.

45' **Half Time** I'll try and update as much as possible and make up for the shit sho of the previous half. 

Halftime' BBC viewers having a treat not being subjected to the adverts of the evil ITV.  Gianluca Vialli is one well dressed man. Henry step up your game

45' **Kick off** no subs to mention. Italy start well closing down quickly but give away a free kick. 

47' Italy starting well and attack on the left getting the ball into the box but Germany close down well. 

49' Germany close down well in Italy's half but lose the ball. Pelle runs down the left line but is fouled. Free kick to Italy just in Germany's half. 

51' Both teams defending very deep when they don't have the ball. Germany pass it around nicely. Work it to the right to Hector who crosses it but Italy clear easily. They come back, on the left this time and the ball is crossed in but Barzagli heads it for a corner. It comes to nothing. 

53' **CHANCE** What a ~~black~~ block by Italy. Muller gets in the box and shots and its deflected off the line superbly for a corner. What great defending. Corner comes to nothing. 

55' **Yellow Card** Sturaro get's carded for dissent. Better half this. 

56' **Yellow Card** Two for the price of one. De Sciglio out of the next game if Italy go through. Goes through the back of the Germany player and a free kick on the right hand side. 

58' **Yellow Card** The ref gets his hat trick of cards. Another Yellow to Italy's Parolo. 

60' Half an hour left. Who can win this one? Giaccherini attacks down the left gets a ball in but is headed away easily. 

62' Have to say Lowe needs to change up his jumper game. He must be embarrassed compared to Conte who looks sublime. 

64' [**GOOOOOOALLLLLLLLL** OZIL SCORES.](https://streamable.com/e4ag) The ball breaks down the left hand side. A long kick by Neuer and Gomez gives a great pass to Hector in the box by the byeline and he passes it across for Ozil to strike in from 6 yards past Buffon. Credit to u/Omar_Til_Death

65' Germany doing their own version of Don't Take Me Home ^^^maybe

67' Germany really playing well now. Patient build up and keeping the ball. Working it to around. Ozil Brilliantly flicks it over the Italian defence to Gomez and he must.... NO! Buffon flicks it over. Brilliant attack and goalkeeping.

68' Italy can't get out of their half. Germany looking for the killer goal. One more and I can't see Italy getting back into this. 

71' **SUB** Mario Gomez is injured and has to come off. The fans sing his name. Draxler comes on in his place. 

73' **Half Chance** Italy finally get some sustained possession in the German half. There's no movement up front though. Or is there? Di Sciglio crosses low on the left and Pelle is there but his shot is the wrong side of the post. Half chance there. 

75' 15 minutes left for Germany to beat this tournament hoodoo against the Italians. Barzagli floats a ball over the top to Pelle to run on to but Boateng runs it out for a corner. Corner dealt easily enough but it comes back to Florenzi who crosses it in, the Ialians call for hand ball. [**Penalty!!!!**](https://streamable.com/pl81) ~~**Yellow card** to Boateng~~ (Thanks u/Schnabeltierchen). what was he doing?! He was pretending to play volley ball. Credit to u/IdeaTardia

77' [**GOOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL**](https://streamable.com/6gbc) Bonucci tucks the penalty away in the bottom right corner. What the hell do I know. The Italians are back in this game. Credit to u/IdeaTardia

80' Germany now seeing plenty of the ball. Hector slips though! Italy move the ball quickly and it comes to Pelle who hits it but its blocked out for a corner. Cleared easily.

83' This game is anyone's to win now. Tired legs out there as we approach the last five minutes. 

85' **SUB** Florenzi who has put in a shift tonight (11km) comes off for Darmian. 

87' Buffon holding on to the ball. Looks like he wants extra time. Italy keeping their cool and passing it around well. They work it to the right to Di Sciglio who cuts inside and hits it low...side netting. 

89' **Yellow Card** Hummels hacks down Eder on the half way line and misses the next game if Germany go through. 

90' **3 minutes added time**

91' Germany knocking on the door. A few crosses in but nothing come to them. 

93' **FULLTIME** We go for another half hour (cue about ten posts after the game from fans complaining about how golden goal should be used again)

Go for a quick piss, a cuppa or whatever you guys are having, we'll be back in a minute. 

**Extra Time**

0' **Yellow Card** Pelle is in the book for going in late on Boateng and he misses the next game as well. Looked like a sore one. 

4' Italy passing it well and work it to the right hand side but Germany defend in numbers and break the play down.  Schweiny commits a foul just inside the German half.  

6' Getting scrappy out there. To quote the previous match thread 'you can feel the tension in the grass'. Parolo fouls and Germany have a free kick on the right hand side. Ball floated in and Bonucci is pushed. Freekick to Italy. 

9' Not much happening. Both teams finding it difficult to carve out chances. It does fall nicely to Muller who strikes it but its blocked wide for a corner. Its played short, ball floated in and Parolo heads out for another corner. He couldve left it.

11' Short again. Germany play it around. Boateng goes for the long shot and its wide. Poor shot. 

12' **Yellow Card** Giaccherini is taken down, holds onto the ball to get his freekick but refs gives for a hand ball and yellow card to him. 

15' **Extra Time Half Time** 

16' A German ball in and Italians don't deal with it well. Ozil overhead kicks it over the bar. 

17' **Sub** Eder comes off for Insigne.

18' German counter attack well but Draxler's final ball is poor and is over hit. Should've done better. 

21' Germany with more of the ball but Italy defending very deep and containing them.

22' *Yellow Card** Schweinsteiger is the next player to go into the book. 

22' Italy get the ball to Insigne who does his best Kanu-Robson impression and fires it hard into Neuers gloves. Good chance. 

24' Chiellini trips Muller on the right hand side.  A good position to get the ball in. 

25' Ref wants a retake for something inside the box. Parolo clears it. 

27' The German fans appeal for penalty as they get into the box but the Ref doesn't react. Nah way, was his head.

28' Ozil shoots from outside the box but Buffon is there to catch it easily. Buffon holding onto it for penalties. it seems. 

29' Insigne tries to run through the German defence but is crowd out. 

30' **SUB** Chiellini off for Zaza

**FULL TIME PENALTIES** All square and it goes to penalties. Gonna be a close one. 

**Insigne steps up first and places it to the right 1-0**

**Kroos next, to the left and scores 1-1**

**Zaza skies it. He exaggerates his run up and messes up 1-1**

**Muller places it to the right and Buffon saves it. Soft one. 1-1**

**Barzagli puts it straight down the middle 2-1**

**Ozil hits the post. Italy are winning 2-1**

To avoid some common misconceptions, by right-anarchist I mean that I think shaming is useful to discourage behaviors I associate with negative social outcomes, but would never use force or advocate the use of force to discourage them. 

I strive to follow reason and evidence to truth, and while I am fairly certain that my conclusions match reality, I am always open to counter information. 

Edit: Mobile autocorrect 

Edit2: Read the rules, this doesn't seem to be in violation, yet there is a down vote. That is in bad faith, and is frustrating. I guess we will all go on in ideological bubbles. "	0	34

Is he being delusional or am I being selfish?	https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4s90et/my_21_f_boyfriend_22_m_of_7_years_wants_us_to/	"Backstory: My boyfriend (electrical engineer, works in city) and I (dental student) have known each other since we were 12 years old. We still live in our hometown (population 25,000) which is a nice suburb and is about 20 minutes away from a fairly small city (less than 500,000 people). I know that he has never lived out in the country or in the middle of nowhere anytime in his life. He and I are used to driving less than 10 mins for necessities. He has not been talking about this until the last 2 years, but as time passes the distance he wants to live away from civilization lengthens. 

One of his main goals in life is to own thousands of acres of wooded land (in the Pacific NW) for him to be able to camp and hunt on with a nice house in the center of it (where he cannot see any neighbors). I support this dream of his and I would not mind it if it was not for the distance that he wants. He wants to live a MINIMUM of 40 minutes away (I managed to convince him 40 mins instead of an hour) from the nearest town with his ideal population of less than 3,000 and live a minimum of a couple hours from a city! I cannot stress how much I hate that idea! 


My main concern is being able to keep a private practice open (if I do not join another) with little population meaning that I (and him too) would probably have to drive nearly 2 hours just to be around a city and work. I am not willing to be so far and have to waste so much of my time in a car each day. 
Another big concern is that he is also really into woodworking so he does use a lot of dangerous machines. He and I are both waiting until he accidentally cuts himself lethally with a chainsaw and having to wait an HOUR (hopefully) for an ambulance to take him to a county hospital. 


I think that he and I need to gather experience from people who have actually lived so far away from a town. 

Compromising now has just turned into us listing out our wants more than our needs. It has become very difficult to even talk about our living future without feeling like we are holding one back from our plans. 

At this point I cannot tell if he is being delusional or if I am being selfish. 


TLDR: My boyfriend (electrical engineer) wants to become independent and live extremely far away from civilization as soon as I graduate dental school. I will need a dense enough population to fuel my business and we have been arguing about where to live.

First i would like to say that the app was developed for legit (testing and development) purposes and not to cheat on other apps/games. 

It is quite easy in Android to check if the location you received is from a Mock Provider or not (only requires 1 line of code). And Pokemon Go already seems to detect ""Allow Mock Locations"" is ""ON"" thats why it says most of the time ""Can't get your location"". Now i am getting swarmed by users complaining the app doesn't work for Pokemon Go and frankly i don't care! Move your butts and play fair.

What worries me is the problem of people not being able to get a real location in Pokemon Go after trying to use my app. So please provide some info of how you fixed it. This are the steps that seems to fix the problem:

- Go to System Settings-&gt;Developer Options and disable ""Allow Mock Locations"" (On Android 6 just select ""None"")
- Disable location services
- Reboot
- Enable location services
- Disable and Enable Wifi Connection
- Disable and Enable Mobile Data (If Enabled)
- Open Google Maps to catch a real gps position

If the above doesn't work try this: 

- Use [Gps Reset](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discipleskies.gpsreset) to reset
A-GPS data (Used to fix no location found in Device Only Mode) (Thanks to /u/lonefeather)
- Clear the cache partition in recovery mode

If you don't see developer options on your settings go to Settings-&gt;About-&gt;Hit 7 times the build number to make Developer Options accessible.

Please let me know if this doesn't work for somebody or how you fixed it! Thanks guys!

P.S: And please stop killing my app rating just because you want to cheat! The app works as supposed just test any GPS Location App! Its just that Pokemon Go detects the location is being spoofed and thank god it does!

P.S 2: For those who don't believe this post is from a real concerning developer here is the link to my app:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.newapphorizons.fakegps&amp;hl=en

If you still don't believe you also can check my reddit history that i am the creator of ADV Screen Recorder since i advertised it here almost a year ago both apps are on the same account."	3465	531

Yes, even worse than that.	https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4vknmj/fucking_linda_is_even_worse_than_i_thought_yes/	"You guys. Y'all. GUYS.

I have to get my Uncle something amazing. He gave me the most incredible gift today but it cost him deeply, because he hates Fucking Linda and hates talking about her.

When I was born, in all seriousness, she said to him she was glad I was a girl because now it was her turn to fuck me up the way her mom fucked her up.

It wasn't a joke.

I'm not crazy. She DID treat me and my brother dramatically differently. 

She knew what she was doing. The bitch fucking knew she was abusing me (covered in what she said at Dad's funeral) and SHE WAS GUNNING FOR ME MY WHOLE LIFE.

It was deliberate. I wasn't too sensitive, imagining it, or over reacting. 

She knew. She wasn't a broken waif hurting me on accident because she was flailing around in her own pain, like a dog that bites a vet. All the abuse. Was her way of getting revenge on her mother.

I am not crazy. She really WAS trying to fuck my life up. She was deliberately, not accidentally, sabotaging my career, my relationships, my education. She was TRYING to destroy any happiness in my life- it wasn't a bizarre accident, or her trying her hardest to do her best and failing because she was super fucked up.

She really did never love me. My mother begged my Dad to have a baby for 5 years. I was carefully planned and brought into this world to be her toxic dumping ground for venom. Born and raised to be her punching bag. Deliberately isolated from an amazing, loving extended family. I went to 11 elementary schools in 4 states- it wasn't bad luck, Fucking Linda was deliberately isolating me, Brother, and Dad.

It was all on purpose.

IT WAS ALL ON PURPOSE.

I cried, but honestly... While I have a lot to work through, I feel a lightness in my heart I have never experienced. All the guilt, the second guessing, wishing I could give her another chances D wishing I had a mother that loved me....

She never did. There was nothing I could have done to be good enough to fix this, it was her plan from **before I was conceived** that I would be her victim. 

I'm going to cry more, no doubt, and there's some useless but I have to go trough it ""what did I do to deserve this?"" And other bullshit to get through....

But it was real. I was not being Ungenerous or cruel. She tried to cripple me and then shit on me for being a failure because she's an emotional sadist. 

I feel like my uncle, at great cost to himself, has given me the last key I needed to be free from the bitch.

Bitch is too nice of a word for her.

But... I had to post and let y'all know as soon as I stopped crying. "	858	123

The boyfriend has since been almost glued to this sub trying to figure out how to deal with her, and asking me questions and wanting more advice on how to approach her outbreaks in the future. 

Since I'm still sort of new to knowing what this is, I'm still also figuring out how to deal with her.

My doctor nonetheless stated that while he believes I have narcolepsy, he was required to write idiopathic  hypersomnia as my official diagnosis, due to the REM issue.  He explained that due to the fact I take an anti-depressant  (Zoloft), my REM was suppressed.  Consequently, my insurance, Independence Blue Cross/Blue Shield, was unwilling to cover the modifinal that my doctor prescribed stating that its use for idiopathic hypersomnia is ""experimental.""  My sleep specialist went through two rounds of peer-to-peer reviews and my modifinal was STILL denied.   Afterward, I filed an appeal and the denial of coverage was upheld.  I am at a loss for what to do.  I contacted Teva but they don't offer financial assistance for modifinal.  Does anyone have recommendations for how to proceed?

Originally, I entered the gaming industry as a technical support representative (email and forums) to get my foot in the door and then from there I became a software engineer in the Battle.net department. Primarily, I worked on the installers/launchers and build systems for the games. I was mostly involved in the Battle.net Desktop App towards the end of my tenure at the company.

I cannot discuss anything that blatantly violates the NDA (i.e. unannounced games, speculation, etc.) as I prefer company lawyers not to be knocking at my door. Also,  I cannot discuss my current studio in any capacity as I like to keeping my job.

Tis bat and I decided to make like some rp stuff for rules n shits. 


**BASICS**

Each faction and things have their own advantages in combat, these advantages can be taught by someone in the other faction(EX: Barons have diplomacy, Skinjas do not - Jam attempts to teach me I get a good roll and I learn how to diplomacy.) Every one has basic things during combat such as

*Sword swings* Usually 8-20 hits. If the user is on the floor it becomes 4-20.

*Bow Shots* Usually 9-20 will hit. If the user is stunned/on the floor/point blank it will become 6-20.

*Punches* This is a shovel hit and rolls will have to be 3-20.

*Kicks* This is an axe hit, the roll will be 6-20.

*Disarms* These are roll offs, if the disarmer rolls 1-4 it does not happen(Unless the target rolls a 1)

*Smoke bombs* Usually roll offs but are cancelled if user rolls a 1-9 on the throw.

*Drinking potions* can only be cancelled if the user rolls a 1-3

*Spells* used by non wizards are 18-20 rolls to be successful

**EQUIPMENT**

Max equipment is 3 smoke bombs, 1 heal potion, a quiver of 15 arrows(just count if you have infinity). Once spells come out, ewch user can use 1 spell without being tought how to be a magician.(These are per combat things), Sword, Bow, Armor, bring an iron shovel and a diamond axe with you in combat.

**FACTION PERKS**

These can be changed if the leaders wish to change them. They can only be changed once.

*Barons* will possible be able to do diplomacy in combat, 15-20 is a success. Non barons cannot try this.

*Skinjas* will be able to carry 5 smoke bombs that can't be avoided unless skinja rolled a 1.

*Wizards* can cast basic spells such as half heart fire balls as much as they wish, but are difficult to shoot(15-20). They have a max of 3 serious spells such as fire missle, levitate(this moves people not causes damage), etc

*Ludds* always start combat with 2 other guards. (No one but ludds can bring guards into 1v1 duels)

*Greywaters* are better with bow and arrow accuracy. 1-3 on a bow shot will be their fail rolls.

*CINs* can flee from battle but this lowers there kingdoms reputation and after 10 flees, their kingdom falls ( Me and cali discussed this and thought it was the most fun and interesting, could be changed) EX: King fitz or whatever flees a battle, his people believe he is a coward and some people in Fitz kingdom leave. It does not mean if fitz flees, people in King Luxs kingdom leave, just fitzs

EDIT: Smoke bombs are stuns.

So my boyfriend is an alcoholic. I've posted about this a few times before on here so if you're interested you can look in my history. It's not really important though. Just the same old story. Been together almost 3 years, love of my life, beyond perfect when things are good. But when things are bad....

About 6 weeks ago we had (yet another) huge blowout and I said that was it, I'm moving out, I can't live this way any longer. Posted on here for some reassurance because I knew I wasn't strong enough to leave. But I got damn close, and even though I'm disappointed in myself, I'm proud of myself for how far I got anyway. I looked at about 5 different apartments, applied to one, got accepted, and even wrote out and signed a check for the deposit before he sweet talked me out of it and I gave him one more chance. Just one more. Yeah, right.

6 weeks later, he's had a few (okay, many) slip ups and still hasn't gone to any AA meetings. Bought one book on sobriety and seemed enthusiastic for about 3 days. Had a pretty bad relapse over the weekend and has been incredibly drunk for going on 72 hours straight now I'd say, complete with missing work and passing out and nonsense babbling when I try to talk to him, I mean full on bender mode.

I'm too young for this. I'm so tired. I just don't want to do it anymore. My dads just like him and I hate it so much. I don't want to recreate my parents awful marriage and be stuck in this nightmare until I die. I don't have want to have kids with this man and keep the horrible cycle of addiction and codependency going for the next generation too.

It's so hard because I have these moments of resolve and then we have good days and I love him so much and I back down. I just have to do it, I know I have to. I just have to close my eyes and jump I guess. Tomorrow I'm going to call around and see if I can find a decent apartment I can afford that I can sign a lease on. Like immediately. I just need to commit before I chicken out again. God help me.

Thanks for listening to my crazy ramblings. I am so thankful for this community. I'm pretty much just a lurker here, still really new to the program, and I've only been to 3 al anon meetings in real life so far but everyone is so kind and supportive. It's so amazingly reassuring to know there are people out there who have been through the same crazy shit and somehow care about me and my problems even though you don't even know me. So much love here, it's incredible.

Anyway, I posted this to get reassurance that I need to leave but in writing this I kind of reassured myself. I'm so early in my al anon recovery but I feel like I'm already learning so much about trusting myself, believing in myself, looking after myself, it's crazy. Thank you all so much.

Oh yeah, and this weekend at a flea market I found a pendant with the serenity prayer on it! I'm not terribly religious myself but it felt like I was supposed to have it. Now I just need to find a chain to put it on and I can wear it to get me through the next few crappy weeks.

Much love to you all. &lt;3"	11	13

4935377	ModernMagic	327977936	https://www.reddit.com//r/ModernMagic/comments/5f9pe8/the_modern_banlist_a_safehaven_for_discussion_of/	2016-11-28 04:25:37		Douges	[The Modern Banlist] - A safehaven for discussion of all things banlist related	https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/5f9pe8/the_modern_banlist_a_safehaven_for_discussion_of/	"[The Modern Banlist](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern) has been a talking point for all players since the birth of the format. Everyone has an opinion, no matter the style of players they are. 

The /r/ModernMagic subreddit has also been the outlet for many players, raising their thoughts and frustractions with changes, or there lack of over recent years. This thread is a place for all discussion related to the banlist, what should be added or taken off, or any opions on reprints for the Modern format, heavy weights such as Baleful Strix, Cabal Therapy or Counterspell. 

*****
**The current banlist is as follows (along with a short description why from /u/Cody_X);**

**Ancient Den and Artifact lands:** Affinity was incredibly dominant in its day. If you're casting spells that have affinity for artifacts, these lands are essentially ancient tombs without the lifeloss. Its been fairly proven that affinity doesn't need them to be a top tier deck.

**Birthing Pod:** a more recent ban, wizards cited it imposing limits on the creatures they could print with it being legal. One of the more controversial bans, but undeniably powerful.

**Blazing Shoal:** in the first modern tournament(s?) infect featuring blazing shoal and progenitus (or gargadon) allowed incredibly fast kills without requiring much mana, allowing the infect player to leave up spell pierce/dispels. Like the artifact lands, infect has proven to be a fine deck without this.

**Bloodbraid Elf:** Was banned at the same time as deathrite shaman due to an overbearing amount of midrange (specifically jund/4 color). Another controversial ban, ""died for DRS's sins"".

**Chrome Mox:** Either started on the banned list, or was banned in the first wave, wizards tried/tries to ban a lot of the fast mana in an effort to stop the format from breaking turn 4.

**Cloudpost:** Basically tron lands on steroids. Was one of the major players in the first modern tournaments, most of which wizards has banned.

**Dark Depths:** Started on the banned list. Depths + urborg + hexmage is a potential turn two 20/20. Coupled with thespians stage, you have a fairly fast combo thats very difficult to interact with in modern (all of the pieces are lands, and the creature is indesctructible, dodging thoughtseize and terminate.)

**Deathrite Shaman:** Banned due to oppressive midrange strategies. A 1 mana 1/2 that gains life, is a wincon, produces mana, and is gravehate in green OR black is simply too powerful.

**Dig Through Time/Treasure Cruise:** banned at the same time, u/r delver was the primary deck using these cards, but jeskai ascendancy was popular too, and even burn splashed for cruise, and most blue counterspell decks played dig, namely scapeshift, jeskai, and ad nauseum. Being able to turn a underused resource (graveyard) into massive card advantage is strong, and playing a deck that doesn't play either of these means starting with a big disadvantage.

**Dread Return:** always banned in modern. If you think dredge is bad now, it could only be better. Being able to reanimate an elesh norn, iona, or flamekin zealot for no mana, and recoup the sacrificed creatures with bridge from below is part of what makes legacy and vintage dredge so powerful.

**Eye of Ugin:** banned following eldrazi winter. The colorless eldrazi decks could often kill in the first couple of turns, after dumping out a pile of eldrazi mimics for free, and simply playing fairly strong creatures for much less than their intended mana costs. Eldrazi was, and still is, the only deck that plays sol lands in modern, barring the possible exception of darksteel citadel. (Though thoughtcast is the only played card that takes advantage of this).

**Glimpse of Nature:** has always been banned in modern. Legacy elves is capable of consistently killing on turn 3, with a rare turn 2 kill, primarily because of the insane card advantage glimpse can provide. Without cradle, such fast kills are unlikely, but being able to commit half your deck to the battlefield while holding the other half in your hand for 1 mana is pretty good.

**Green Sun's Zenith:** banned for diversity reasons. Being able to turn 1 tutor a dryad arbor for ramp, and later being able to tutor a knight of the reliquary, or even a primeval titan means that gsz is both incredibly strong early and late, and has no real downside to including it. Nearly every green deck would include it.

**Hypergenesis:** similar to living end, cascading into hypergenesis is a potentially fast combo, even without much fast mana. Living end however requires you to play lots of subpar cyclers to make the combo work, where as hypergenesis just lets you play emrakul.

**Jace / Stoneforge Mystic:** banned due to standard dominance, theres no real argument that a huge number of white decks would play stoneforge, and a huge number of control decks would play jace. Somewhat controversial as well, due to them never having seen the light of day in modern.

**Mental Misstep:** banned due to diversity. Mentap misstep has targets against nearly every deck, but the real issue is that the best way to beat a misstep is your own misstep. While people saw street wraith and probe and claimed that every deck would 56 cards + probe, with mental misstep this more or less actually happened.

**Ponder / Preordain / Rite of Flame / Seething Song:** Banned due to storm. While originally storm was a genuinely strong deck, seething song seems to have been banned more due to wizards' fear, or simple dislike of solely spell-based combo in modern. Ponder and preordain are fairly controversial bans individually.

**Punishing Fire:** combos with grove the burnwillows to allow one to machine gun down all small creatures. Small aggro strategies (infect, bushwhacker zoo, elves, etc) would have a pretty tough time dealing with this.
Second sunrise: The original modern eggs deck was fairly powerful, but nearly always took forever to safely win, resulting in potentially half-hour turns. While this isn't the most fun for an opponent to sit through, this played havoc with tournament schedules. When tournament matches go to time, the game gets 5 more turns before it ends. However, if one of these turns is a half hour long, you only need one eggs player per round to add hours upon hours of delay over a whole tournament.

**Sensei's Divining Top:** While it would enable the legacy counter-top deck to exist in some regard, wizards has cited time as the primary reason top isn't legal, similar to second sunrise.

**Skullclamp:** an infamously powerful card, being able to turn tokens, mana dorks, or other small bodies into cards for a small amount of mana gets powerful pretty fast.

**Splinter Twin:** while the deck was powerful, and wizards cited power/diversity reasons as the main concerns, shaking up the modern pro tours is often mentioned. Easily the most controversial ban.

**Summer Bloom:** amulet bloom was able to fairly consistently break the turn 4 rule, and was difficult to interact with, especially with the spell based hivemind combo, and the land based engine.

**Umezawa's Jitte:** banned due to standard dominance. It would likely become an auto include in some number for any aggressive deck. Being able to kill creatures, gain life, or deal more damage is fairly powerful, but jitte does them all in nearly the best ways possible.

Over the past year, the main points that are brought up from a Reddit point of view regarding the list, is that Stoneforge Mystic, Bloodbraid Elf, Jace, the Mindsculptor and even Splinter Twin being allowed back into Modern would not have dire consqeuences for the format. 
*****
*An insight into what should / could be banned / unbanned thanks to /u/Ershy10**

**Infect:**

**Become Immense** - Gives a lot of power to the deck, and it's printing lines up well with when Infect came to power. Its banning would reduce the power level of the deck, but most likely not by a significant margin. A ban here also hurts Suicide Zoo.

**Mutagenic Growth** - This is one of the cards that allows Infect to kill early and surprise kill when tapped out. It also acts as a free way to occasionally save creatures. Its banning would significantly reduce the power level of the deck. A ban here also hurts Suicide Zoo, Suicide Bloo, and some Delver decks.

**All Infect Creatures** - Most likely not going to happen; however, some people have called for it. This would obviously completely destroy the deck.

**Dredge:**

**Golgari Grave-Troll** - Enables the deck. Dredge is powerful, and this creature dredges the most. It was also on the ban list for a long time. The banning of GGT is very controversial. Some people think it would destroy the deck too much while others think it's not enough.

**Stinkweed Imp** - See reasonings on Golgari Grave-Troll. Banning both of these is the option that effectively kills 

**Prized Amalgam** - Realistically the best recurring creature in Dredge. Banning would significantly hurt the deck. It also hits decks not looking to abuse this recursion.

**Cathartic Reunion** - The newest and strongest looting effect. This is what realistically pushed Dredge into arguably the best deck in the format. A ban here would definitely tone down the power level of the deck; however, this also limits future design space. It's likelier that someone else will be banned (if anything will be).

**Conflagrate** - This is a finisher for Dredge. It allows Dredge to potentially do a lot of damage to either the opponent or their blockers. A ban here would reduce the power level of the deck. Many people think that this would not do enough to stop the deck.

**Tron:**

**Urza's Tower** - Tron is one of the more powerful decks that doesn't care about interaction. Tron is normally held back pretty easily by combo. Due to the current lack of relevant combo in the format, Tron would be a very powerful deck if Infect and Dredge were banned out of the format. Furthermore, Tron is currently capable of keeping grindy midrange decks out of the format. This ban would completely destroy the deck.

**Ancient Stirrings** - This is Tron's primary ""cantrip"". This card has a power level similar (if not technically higher) than Ponder and Preordain when built around. Ancient Stirrings is relevant at every stage of the game, and it lets Tron either assemble the required lands or find a way to finish the game. A ban here would hurt Tron, but the deck would most likely still be playable. A ban here also hurts Lantern Control.

**Other relevant bans:**

**Eldrazi Temple** (Bant Eldrazi) - Infect and Dredge are both capable of punishing this deck. Without them in the format, Eldrazi could reign supreme again. It would be preemptive, but many people agree that it would be necessary given a ban on Infect or Dredge.

**Simian Spirit Guide** (Multiple Decks) - This card is played exclusively in ""broken"" decks. It allows these decks to go off significantly faster than without it. Banning it out would hurt Dredge, some Through the Breach decks, and would kill the Ad Nauseam deck.

**Gitaxian Probe** (Multiple Decks) - This gives information and a cantrip effect at the cost of 2 life. The decks that are playing Gitaxian Probe generally don't care about the loss in life. It also allows decks to effectively play 56 cards. Another thing of note is that it is also a Sorcery. This lets it trigger Delver of Secrets, Thing in the Ice, Kiln Fiend/Prowess, and other effects. A ban here has a lot of effects on many different decks.

**Splinter Twin** - Wizards banned for variety in the format, and we developed what many people refer to as fake diversity. We now have many decks designed around not interacting with your opponent. Unbanning Twin would obviously create a huge shift in the Meta.

**Eye of Ugin** - Many people believe this should be unbanned and Eldrazi Temple should be banned instead. Functionally, this gives much more power to decks like Tron, and it would at least cripple most Eldrazi lists.

**Jace, the Mind Sculptor** - The strongest planeswalker ever printed. Control is overall very weak in the format right now. Having JtMS would give control decks something to do. This would also turn control mirrors into JtMS competitions. The overall argument for unbanning is that he does not do enough immediately to stop the big aggro decks of the format. Also, tapping out on 4 is often a death sentence against many of the popular decks.

**Stoneforge Mystic** - The strongest white creature ever printed. The argument for unbanning is that Batterskull would not be relevant right now (and the other equipment would be even less relevant). The argument for leaving her banned is also about diversity. She would fit into almost every deck running white as easily as Path to Exile does.

**Birthing Pod** - An amazing tool. This singular card allows a player to easily find a creature combo or creature based silver bullet card. These decks would look very similar to the current Abzan Company decks or Kiki Chord as they were created after the original banning of Pod. The argument for leaving Pod banned is that it is essentially a reusable tutor effect that very easily assembles multiple infinite combos. The argument for unbanning is that Pod was never really oppressive, the combo is pretty easily hated on/disrupted, and that the Company/Chord lists are not doing well right now. This initial ban was also pretty controversial.

**Glimpse of Nature** - There's no doubting this card is powerful; however, it has never been tested in the format. With Modern lacking Green Sun Zenith, it is hard to effectively set up the board to abuse it like Legacy lists do. It would also allow Modern Elves to gain some power and put it in a higher tier. It could also create a similar deck to Legacy's Cheri0s which may or may not be competitive. The argument for keeping it banned is fear of its power level. Some people are also concerned about its strength in decks like Affinity, although this is not many people.

**Mox Opal** (Affinity, Lantern) has been brought up in some of the same conversations as Spirit Guide. It's one of the few fast mana options remaining in the format and is the primary culprit for Affinity and Lantern being able to dump their hands on turn 1. A ban here would be highly controversial, as Affinity is one of the lone holdouts from the early days of the format and has not been dominant as of late.

**Blood Moon** (Multiple decks)- 8th Edition gets derided for introducing some very frustrating cards into the format, and this is the prime suspect. It heavily punishes multicolor decks and decks that rely on their lands; some decks cannot win after this resolves. Banning this would change a great deal about how Modern players construct their manabases.

**Ensnaring Bridge** (Lantern)- Another problem card from 8th edition. This card is singlehandedly responsible for the existence of Lantern Control, and has the Blood Moon problem of games ending on the spot when it comes down. A ban here would not seriously affect the meta apart from killing one deck that has not been considered a major problem, so it would get some flak.

**Primeval Titan** (Breach Titan, Scapeshift)- This card is a bit of a repeat offender, as it was considered for banning at the height of Amulet Bloom. Getting this into play generally signals the end of the game through Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle in a way that is both a serious clock and difficult for fair decks to interact with.

**Articles**

Pro players have also had a say over the years, some of the more notible being [Craig Wescoe's](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13001&amp;writer=Craig+Wescoe), [Brian DeMars's](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/5-changes-id-make-to-the-modern-ban-list/) and more recently, [Jeff Hoogland's](http://articles.mtgcardmarket.com/my-modern/) 

Honestly, the banlist discussions usually end up in a massive circle, so having a central source for people to discuss and rant is going to be the best approach for the future of this subreddit.

I've been a steady raider since early MoP. Although not hardcore, our guild generally is in the top 5 on alli on our server. Casual hardcore I guess, as we're all very serious about our play, but not gonna penalize people if they can't show. In a way, it's been harder as our group tends to rotate. Typically have worked through around mid-Mythic before the long wait sets in between xpacs.

So of course we log and watch DPS closely, tho we aren't going to kick folks for it unless it really messes up our timing on a strat or something. And our showing is pretty good for a ""casual"" team, with folks regularly being in the 70-95 percentile. Not bad for a group where folks may miss out for a while and end up gearing behind other folks.

But the things is that it felt like people actually could catch up if they missed out a few weeks of drops. Gear would drop that folks already had, and they'd get it all and be pretty much caught up. But it feels like things have changed with the artifact...

So I know the logs right now are screwy because of ""the legendary variables"". You can be super lucky and get a huge boost of DPS just through the right legendary or two. I've still only gotten one, and it's not *that* great. So yeah, I get that the logs right now may be dominated by those lucky few with the right gearing.

But also, something I realized is that if you take a break from leveling your artifact, it REALLY punishes your DPS in a way that I don't think I've experienced before. In my guild, some folks are already on their second or third bonus trait because they've worked their ass off on that treadmill. So yeah, I get that they may deserve that. But the thing is, if you're behind, there is no way you can actually catch up until they hit the end of the treadmill, at point 54 which may be 2-3 months from now. If you're not diligent with farming, it may actually be 4 months or longer to finally catch up. THAT IS A FRAKKING LONG TREADMILL.

I know the end-all of this game isn't  always DPS, and tho many of us may say ""just play what you want and enjoy the game"", deep down inside we still like having our nice high numbers. And it sucks to think that in order to get your highest numbers, you have to stay diligently on that treadmill no matter what. It's not enough to work hard and beat that mythic week in and out, and finally get your drop after losing all your loot rolls for weeks on end. You might be undergeared for a bit, and lag in DPS for a while, but it never felt like it was for long. But now I know that if I miss out a week, my dang artifact is going to lag behind everyone else by a week, and short of getting some amazeballs legendary, THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO, NOR GET, THAT WILL EQUALIZE THAT.

This has super bummed me out. Because of rl, I cannot grind away at farming AP so I'm behind. Whereas I was usually in the top dps of our group consistently for many raid tiers, now I'm constantly in the trailing end. I feel Hunters have gotten stupid easy to play in Legion, yet I'm LAGGING BEHIND. What the hell....

I think it's great that they broadened ways to get high end gear without having to just raid. And that you don't have to bank on getting some random weapon drop also to hit your potential. In a way, it makes a lot more accessible to more casual players (mostly meaning folks who can't consistently raid). But ironically , it feels like it's hurt the ""casual raiders"" who can't log in every night. Disappointed...

So, as the title says, ARK PvP will die, if Studio Wildcard doesn't fix those C4 Pteranodons.

First of all, what are C4 Pteranodons?
C4 Pteranodons are nothing else than suicide flyers. You put a bunch of C4 on the rider and barrel roll inside an enemy base. Favoured targets are behemoth gates, generators and turret towers. After reaching the target, the rider dismounts the Pteranodon and punches, which will cause the C4 to explode.

Why are they so OP?
You can't do anything against them. They are coming out of nowhere, if they are in sight it's already too late. They are barrel rolling - during that they have insane speed, turrets aren't even shooting at it during that.
If a whole tribe attacks hours and hours with those C4 Pteras, 2 C4 Pteras each 5 minutes, you don't have any chance to defend. They are blowing up turret towers left and right, breaking inside your base and ripping off your war quetzals. There's no way to defend against them.

What should Studio Wildcard do against that?
They already mentioned that OP strategy, they also tryed to fix it once (""v252.9: * Attached C4 is now always targeted by Turrets where possible"" and ""v252.83: * Made all Flyers except for Quetz and Wyvern become 'grounded' if you put a C4 on them. ""). In theory those Pteras are fixed with that update, but in practise not. If there's a war between two tribes, the player count on the server will be higher than normal which causes high ping. If the ping is high, turrets shoot slower. Added to that, the Ptera is too fast in a barrel roll for turrets to shoot it.
Because of that, I would suggest wildcard to make it impossible for players who have C4 attatched to them to mount any dino. That's an easy solution which should be easy and fast to implement to the game.

Thank you for reading

People seem to think if you use a few script lines from another mod, that you are some kind of thief. Or if you name spells or perks similarly to someone else's that you are in some kind of violation. Uh, no. (I know many would disagree sadly)

What's worse is this weird mentality I've observed lately, simply can't be good for the modding community. Many would be modders are likely deciding not to bother out of misplaced notions that they aren't allowed to unless they reinvent wheels from scratch and such

Some of the best mods and mod ideas are inspired or copycatted from other mods. GENERALLY, no permission is needed unless you plan to actually use their audio/visual assets (whether that even has merit is debatable but I find it reasonable and polite to follow this)

Not to say there aren't lots of things you SHOULD do out of decency (because there are) it isn't a copyright violation if you decide not to. Like I would take steps to make it not transparently obvious that I used someone else's mod or scripts as a baseline. I personally would only use a smaller scale mod as a baseline, not some huge overhaul. Id also credit the author of said mod for inspiring my mod idea. But that's all just my opinion.

Conservstives used to support debt for infrastructure and that's it but lately the narrative has been to oppose debt completely especially from the libertarian side of the conservative spectrum.

I finally see the end-game and it's not pretty.

Private Infrastructure.

Instead of the government borrowing $1b at 2.9% interest for 30 years. Private Enterprise funds the $1b infrastructure often using bank debt ranging from 50%-85% of the funds coming from debt. The government signs a contract with private enterprise so that the end-user cost of using the infrastructure goes toward the private enterprise resulting in anywhere from a 5%-20% return on investment (given the leverage assumption).

There is virtually no benefit for a government to do this except if the politics are deadlocked surrounding debt so that raising debt to fund needed infrastructure projects would be political suicide. This is why libertarians especially have been against debt.

Who benefits:

- Investors benefit. They get a natural monopoly that provides on average 5-20% return on their investment.

- Rich people benefit from lower taxes. In a society with progressive income taxes, the way to pay for the infrastructure and debt payments is through higher taxes which hit the rich people hardest. For infrastructure, a rich person might drive on the toll road, or use about the same heat in a day as everyone else so he's not paying anything more. The less progressive taxes are needed to fund projects the richer rich people become.

- Banks. Banks are still lending money to private enterprises for the infrastructure projects and at higher interest rates than what they'd lend to governments. Furthermore, banks now have more wealth to manage through their wealth management firms which raises them more revenue. Blackrock for example is looking into Public Infrastructure ETFs.

Who Loses:

- Non-wealthy citizens that utilize infrastructure. The cost of the infrastructure is now higher because investors must earn a return on it and the funding of the projects isn't done by a wealth redistribution as through taxes thus this in effect is a regressive tax on end-users to pay for the investor's return.

- Anyone looking to make social changes such as environmental pushes. A lot of infrastructure contracts the governments sign, they cannot back out of so if you signed a 20 year coal production contract, the government has to pay that entire contract out if they want to stop using coal to power things. Since the government's run with low taxes and debt isn't an option they likely cannot afford to do this and are stuck in the contract. If it were a public infrastructure project the government can walk-away becsuse it's already a sunk cost. 

There is nothing capitalistic about private enterprise funding public goods that are natural monopolies and getting paid a return on it at the expense of society. Capitalism thrives on competition not on trolling bridges amounting to high-way robbery from the middle-class and poor."	0	11	
4614436	Steam	389333302	https://www.reddit.com//r/Steam/comments/6fsrhy/clearing_the_air_around_borderless_gaming/	2017-06-07 11:17:00		codeusasoft	Clearing the Air Around Borderless Gaming	https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/6fsrhy/clearing_the_air_around_borderless_gaming/	"By now some of you may have seen a post on the pcgaming subreddit claiming that I filed false DMCA's and illegally re-licensed my own software. I want to take the time this morning to try and clear up some misconceptions and put things into context.

A few days ago I decided after 5 years that I'd stop providing free binary releases of Borderless Gaming, all future releases will be through Steam and the source code will remain open to anyone. For the majority of people this was fine, however a few people who seem to have been waiting years for this and finally had a ""gotcha"" moment. 

One of these users forked Borderless Gaming (which I encourage you all do) and then proceeded to retroactively remove links and references to myself and the original repository from the documentation -- while also releasing builds. Now I want to make something very clear, I am completely fine with 3rd parties compiling Borderless Gaming and hosting builds for the public, what is not okay is obfuscating the source. I filed a DMCA to take down that single repository and I hope I never have to do it again. 

**Now here is where I messed up**

I had a knee-jerk reaction at the time and having hindsight it was completely stupid. I added a vague sub-license to the repository that stressed mirrors needed express permission to re-host binaries. This isn't something I plan to enforce or implement at a later date. In fact you can find Borderless Gaming mirrors on a number of sites like Sourceforge. 

I additionally tried to re-license Borderless Gaming from GPLv2 to MPLv2. Unfortunately I had some pretty big misconceptions about how that process worked and when it was brought my attention, I reverted back. 

So here is where things stand:

* I've asked all Borderless Gaming contributors for their permission to convert the repository to MPLv2
* Borderless Gaming is still and will continue to be open source and free for anyone to compile
* The Steam version is DRM free and can be copied to portable devices or ran without Steam entirely.

Admittedly things were not handled as gracefully as they could have been, often on the internet people butt heads (or egos rather, mine included.) and reasonable discussion can dissolve quickly. So I apologize for my behavior and I ensure you all moving forward I'll be more transparent in major changes related to any and all of my projects.

As always, I appreciate your support of my work. 

EDIT:

As yet another update, I've decided to adjust how releases will work. Rather than providing no compiled releases at all, I will do trailing releases were new major updates are pushed to Steam first and later at a fixed duration Github.

the 9.3 installers are up  https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/latest

EDIT 2:

After talking with /u/SubstituteCS and working out our differences, I've removed the DMCA and agreed to let his fork operate in its current state. I apologize for the way this was handled and sincerely hope it can be forgiven.

Besides that, we all know most of us just used it to confirm kills.  That lucky bastard who gets away at 2% health, you know the guy, he pops up way too often and deserves to die for his terrible misplay.  He really does, and Hi Rez took that away from us.

Sunder was the counter to Aegis, misplays and luck.  While the initial nerf to Sunder balanced the relic, the second nerf to Sunder limited it's counter potential.  On the new tier 1 Sunder, the initial damage is ""current health"" which means ""completely useless"".  All anyone needs is 1 health potion to counter your 160 sec. cool-down relic at any point in the game. Every time I buy Sunder I feel like I've just thrown one of my relic slots in the trash, because compared to Bellona who bought med at least her relic was initially useful.

  The 20% dmg. increase on upgraded Sunder is good.  If the free Sunder wasn't completely useless that 20% would easily be worth 500 gold.  Knowing that I had to spend 500 gold for a useful relic while my opponent can potentially buy a full item sooner than I can with no reasonable context other than, ""They're smarter because they chose to play safe and 'bought' tier 1 shell,"" hurts me inside.  As of the Shell patch, there is really no reason to waste 500 gold on Sunder when you could just get Aegis or anything else, really.  There aren't enough counters to Aegis or Shell besides having a better team or everyone buying more Aegis and Shell than the other team.  This is the only logical counter play, because thorns is too selfish to be as good as Shell in team-fights and med is useless halfway into the game.  It's better to buy med than Sunder because at least I don't have to waste gold for an effect with use at some point in the game.  I used to think med was the worst relic in the game but it's spot has been sorrowfully taken over. "	26	59

Given that God created the universe, it must follow that he created time and thusly preceded it.

Given that God is omniscient, he sees all time: past, present, and future all at once.

Given that he sees all time at once, there is no reason that creating a universe that would foster life through evolution is not the same as creating all that ever would be in an instant.

If God speaks of events chronologically it is to help us understand.

Genesis can be literally true without disagreeing with the scientific interpretation of the universe when you read it from God's perspective.

It can be understood as God's design for the world before he set it in motion.

God's chronology need not match ours; he acts in all time at once.

With this understanding, we can say Evolution does not defy God's intelligent design and Creation, rather it is his method of Creation."	4	36

Seems that it's hard for some to accept that others simply prefer the old WoW, and when you look at the number of players on private servers I don't think that people are seeing Vanilla with rose-tinted glasses."	0	9

I just really badly want to cuddle and hug with someone. It's getting to the point where if I see someone attractive that's around my age I find it hard to think clearly. 


I know the most logical thing to do is to look for a boyfriend, but I find it really hard to even begin to put myself out there (hopefully I'll have enough motivation to do that soon, though).

He might not be paying all his overdue child support but he is trying to be there and get some kinda money. I believe he deserves a shot especially seeing how much of an a****** Luis is. 

He puts up with 3 women nagging at him every time he sees his daughter, he has to sit in a living room for hours, and he’s not to take his daughter anywhere. I’m not saying he flipped the switch and is Dad of the year but if you see effort at the very least start giving him benefit of the doubt and start the process of letting him be a Dad. 

Every kid deserves a shot of having a dad, and the child will make a choice of what they think of them I think. "	105	79

Just ask them:

""Are you convinced Jehovah exists?"".

If they are answer anything along the lines of :-

""Yes""

""Sure""

""Of course""

""Absolutely""

""Without a doubt""

....then it's merely a faith / belief they have that Jehovah exists. They are admitting openly that they don't know for sure (as a fact).

Why?

If I asked you ""are you convinced that I - the person standing in front of you now, and speaking to you now - exist?""

....they would normally question the ""convinced"" word and say (along the lines of) ""I KNOW you exist, I don't need to be convinced of that fact"".  

The trick is in the word ""convinced"".  It's a word based on belief, not actual fact.  Not ""The Truth"".

What have I done to deserve this kind of son?"". 

You guys... they spoke the last weekend (see previous post), although the call back then was not initiated because SO wanted to talk to them, but because he wanted to hear news about a family wedding they had attended. So they spoke. They had a argument. And NOW MY MIL CALLS and BERATES SO for not greeting her since the beginning of the month (MIL has the habit of sending SO a message every once in a while (sometimes several times a week, other times just once or twice a month) asking ""how are you?""). Then followed by another message saying ""you'd probably be happy if we just didn't exist"". 

Guys - even when SO lived in his HOME COUNTRY years ago, they didn't really talk that much, certainly not every day and not every week. What is there to even say? We work, we eat, we sleep. We don't have pets or kids to share pictures or stories every day or even every week. 

SO looked just so... crushed. Not in a ""I'm so sad now"" way, but rather ""they stress me out so much when they do that"". He just said that he does not know what to do. He loves them, they love him, they kiss and make up faster than I can keep track most of the times, but it's so unfair, painful and disturbing to see how their interactions affect him when it gets bad. 

I told him that he is his own person, not a subject of his mother's will and demands and that if he wants to, he CAN actually go VLC or VVLC or even NC. It's just... I don't think he'll ever will. He'll get mad, SO MAD, at them, but things will be forgotten again and glossed over because that's what they do in their culture. It's just me who remembers all the incidents and ""cannot let go"".  I resent my MIL so much sometimes. "	154	18

(OMG) Why I bought at the beginning, and continued to accumulate to this day.	https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7kv56b/confidence_in_omisego_omg_why_i_bought_at_the/	" So,  to start off, I bought my first OMG shortly after ICO. What immediately struck me was their allay established parent company Omise. Their mission was to provide banking services to areas of the world where banks were few and far between.  It goes much deeper than that,  but that is research for you to do. 

I watched as the price stayed fairly consistent in the 9 to 12 USD range for the longest time.  I watched through the btc skyrocket,  the ltc and the XRP. those were all great projects,  and I'm glad they got the recognition they deserve,  but in my eyes OMG had such a deeper and more useful (read profitable) use case.  So the first thing I was attracted to is their use case.  The second was the fact that OMG and is products are free to those who use them.  What that means is that neither OMG nor Omise will be charging anyone for the use of their wallet sdk, or any other product of theirs.  You might be wondering why that's a good thing.  How can they pay their staff? Well,  great question,  with an even better answer. Of the approx 100m OMG In  existence, Omise will stake 30% for themselves.  The ONLY source of funding they will get from this project is the same way myself or other investors will generate profit.  If that doesn't scream confidence,  I don't know what does.  As it sits at this moment,  OMG doesn't have a production ready product.  They have a demo wallet sdk, and some really good plans.  There is new info hitting us before year end,  and the release of the full wallet sdk, and staking behind in the first half of 18. At 20usd, this token is extremely undervalued.  As I believe people are beginning to realize.  The price has had a slow but VERY steady gain,  which i believe will continue through product release.  This project has no conceivable upper limit in price in my eyes.  Even after the conservative income per staked coin is exceeded,  the price will continue to rise,  and people will transition to it being not only a source of new income,  but a place to store wealth,  like btc. It will eventually be btc that generates a profit.  All this is why even though i bought most of my stack in the 6 dollar range,  I purchased again today at 20usd. 20usd is nothing compared to where this will be a year from now. 

This project has inconceivable value,  those who are recognizing it are buying now,  ill be buying forever.  Until the day I cash out that is.  If this project generates any interest for you,  I urge you to begin this journey with us now.

I would like to ask you 3 questions for all the guru and overlord reader and lover. I have been arguing with a guy on reddit and I would like your opinion and fact. Question 1: Is the Overlord a story of ""MC struck in MMO"" or a story about ""MMO turn into a fantasy world"". 
Question 2: ""Lord Ainz claiming land/city in order to protect his headquarter"" or ""He did it to promote his name to become a legend and world domination"".
Question 3: Does the NPC have any memories of the time when they were in Yggdrasill and if they do, were they self-aware?
Please provide evidence and source when answering questions so we are clear. I thank everyone in advance for your assistance.

We can now have up to 1,500 Pokémon stored in our banks. Combo that with the up coming community events that have double XP opportunities, but only last for a severely limited time. The first one is scheduled to be three hours.  

My suggestion is this- make the evolution animations an option that players can opt into. Many players, like myself, use mass evolutions during double XP events (and a lucky egg) to maximize points. Unfortunately, selecting each individual Pokémon and sitting through the animation can be a time suck, especially during a limited time event and on a lucky egg timer. Also, puts players in a position where they may need to choose between catching the limited time event Pokémon or gaining XP. 

And like I said above, we’re sorting through and evolving more Pokémon at the same time than ever before. It would be nice if the game was optimized for players but still allows players to enjoy the evolution animations if they choose to. "	2	31

She had been sniping at me all day about little stupid shit and when we were in the car, I told her to stop telling me what to do and be quiet. I was annoyed at her and that was probably my  mistake. I could have answered her differently. She proceeded to tell me how to talk to her and that wasn't how to do it. I told her I'll talk how I want and she can talk how she wants. 

Then she said: ""You are walking on dangerous ground""
Me: ""What? I'm going to hurt myself? What do you mean?""
Her: ""I could call the police for abuse...you know they will believe a woman.""

I told her that if she ever falsely accuses me of that, and I spend my 72 hours behind bars, our marriage is over. I will not be held hostage to anyone with that kind of threat. Don't ever threaten me with that bull shit again. I took it further and said that such a malicious threat was worth taking to the elders of our church and asking them to get involved if she doesn't change her tune. 

She then backpeddled on to tell me that I misunderstood. She wasn't threatening, but telling me that by my talking disrespectful to her, the next step for me, would be to hit her and then she would have to call the cops. Ooooh, so right when I tell her that I'm willing to expose your bullshit and make her look like a bitch, all of a sudden, it went from a threat to a misunderstanding. I just failed to read her mind and make such a logical quantum leap from ""Be quiet"" to ""I'll call the cops"". 

She offered a half hearted apology for not being clear about what she meant. Fine. I told her never to say something like that again and I went to bed. 

Now, how would you guys have handled that? How could I have handled it better? And how should I proceed from now on? 

______________________

Edit: 1/27/2018 So, last night my wife wanted to talk to me about this incident and admitted that she was wrong for being so pissed at how I answered her and ruining our time with my family. She said that she never intended to make a threat, but that she hadn't chosen her words carefully. What she meant was that she thought that if I were to ever to become abusive, she would call the cops; not that she was threatening to make a false allegation. I just took y'alls advice and STFU listening to her. All I ended up saying was: ""Well, then you better say what you mean and mean what you say."" Then my kid came into the room and that ended the conversation.

I agreed to take on the mantle after explaining that my DM style would be a little more story-focused  and began to put in all the extra time DM's usually put in to help run things smoothly. Throughout the campaign, there was only one player who gave me crap about my style - the old DM. Whether it was the world/history I created, the puzzles he didn't want to solve, or the consequences for his actions, it just felt like he was always disappointed with how things were going. I had six people to build a story around and whenever the focus was off him he'd be on his iPad and then complain about not knowing things he would have known if he were paying attention. Love him to death but I would have liked a little more respect and a little less resistance just because I DM differently than he did. *sigh* thanks for letting me vent.	227	57

When you're in a relationship, and you split up, you normally divide things by who it belongs to, even if there is a major difference or similarity in income. I bought the TV, I should keep the TV. You bought the couch, you should keep the couch.

This suddenly change when you enter marriage. The division is now 50/50, even though the contribution could be 90/10.

I come from en economic background, so I just see it as asset placement. The one who contributed the most, should have the most in a settlement.

I know there is such a thing as an enabler. If one partner allows the other partner to work more or be more effective, this can contribute to the overall utility of the home. I.e. the example of the 60's family where there is a houseworking woman and a working man. The woman does all the work at home, so the man can focuses on his work, bringing home income. However this model can't be accurately projected into the present world, where both men and women work equally and split house chores.

So I would find it completely valid if a woman, on average over the period of the marriage, contributed double what her husband did, she should receive double the amount of assets as him. The same goes the other way around.

Take an example of a firm on a stock market. There are 100 contributors to the firm (100 shareholders), 90 of these hold a total value of 9% of the firm i.e. 0.1% each. The remaining 10 hold a total value of 91% of the firm i.e. 9.1% each. If the firm closes down, the assets of the firm shouldn't be split in 100 equal parts. No, it should be split by contribution to the firm. The same goes if the firm produces a dividend, the dividend should be split according to contribution and not equally. This is also how firms legally work.

By splitting it equally it removes the incentive to invest more, why should I invest more than the bare minimum if I'm only able to receive the average under all circumstances?

Now take this back into the relationship, if my spouse produces x amount of income and ""invest"" it into our shared life (Contribution), why should I invest 2x or 100x? I know it's an extreme example, but it gets the point across. Only if I know that I can keep the difference, I have an incentive to invest. Everything else is irrational.

Please take in mind that I'm not up for the ""You bought this, you keep this"" mentality in a marriage, since you could have split your income in-equally i.e. I buy groceries for the month, and you buy the table and chairs we need. If one only buys all the necessary items like food and general supplies, this should be seen just as much of a contribution as buying a table and chairs, under the assumptions that these equal in cost. I'm only focusing on contribution.

As I said, I've not taken any sociologic or politologic assumptions into my thoughts, only the economical aspect.

Hope you can help me out here. I've presented my views to friends and family over the years and most of them sees this as greed or like I have egotistic views. I simply can't see why I should contribute with twice as much as my spouse and expect to share equally. Or how I cannot feel guilty by contributing half as much as my spouse and expect to receive equally. 

This is clearly hypothetical."	88	142

Q4 was a great time for SPG production with consistently high SPG levels and 2 of the highest SPG periods on record. Let’s jump in!

**Q4 Review**

[Smiles per Gallon Q3/4 FY17](https://i.imgur.com/YpV0TG8.png)

Shortly after the Q2/3 review went out, the Thargoid update was released, which provided an incredible opportunity for our firm to secure the highest quality salt ever seen: [the first thargoid kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIACnt8xDEE). A group of our most experienced service agents along with some senior leadership were dispatched to the area to lay claim to this newly discovered deposit. What followed can only be described as a master stroke of business acumen. The thargoid was swiftly dismantled, and SDC had secured sole possession of the spoils.

Shortly after the first thargoid was killed, we became the **first firm to have a solo kill** as well as a kill with e-rated Adders. Days later, after [publishing an instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdl46UsdnR8) showing how to kill one, Frontier had no choice but to make them harder in order to prevent us from entering a death spiral of “SPG Overload.” This little-seen phenomenon is essentially a positive feedback loop that a firm can find itself in which, if left unchecked, can tank market-wide SPG rates. Truly a scary time, but we pulled through.

In mid-October, our intelligence branch reported that we might be the victims of a [Robyn Highart-style gank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yhdhVvmt2s), and needed to prepare ourselves. Our senior leadership rallied the troops and pushed forward fearlessly, [leading to the crushing defeat of our opponents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtwglMARM7M). With such complete destruction of our enemies and a huge reversal of fortunes for them, they raided our Discord hoping to sow discontent. This lead to the creation of one of our most prized passive-SPG generation tools: Sperg Row. Sperg Row is a channel where we confine the worst among us so they can be publicly humiliated and shamed for their mere existence. This leads to a Thunderdome situation where inmates are pitted against each other and fight for their freedom. **Win?** You are granted “stray” tags. **Lose?** *Banished forever.*

Late October brought a joint operation with another firm (Nomads, LLC) against a rival (Adle’s Armada GmbH). The goal here was the **complete and utter destruction** of AA and a 50-50 split of the firm’s assets after the dust settled. AA had been on the downswing for some time now, and needed a killing blow to be finished off for good. The massive pressure brought on by the Trueborn FAO Lord-ing was [too much for them to bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVFNYhi31ww), and the firm filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and all assets were sold for pennies on the dollar.

Following the destruction of AA, a market imbalance was detected in the form of CGs being way the fuck out of the bubble too many times in a short period, so it was decided that [a “hub” would be formed](https://discord.gg/HuShrr3) where random SPG generation could occur within the PvP community itself. It provided a way to regularly showcase the sheer superiority of ***Trueborn FAO Lordship™*** to the greater community. The hub was a massive success and will protect our institutional investments going forward.

At the beginning of December, the SDC Board of Directors put a challenge out to leadership: finish Q4 with a strong SPG performance, and a **massive** bonus would be awarded.

Late, on December 21st, our **SVP of International Relations and Intelligence Gathering**, CMDR Jonuss, indicated that there was a target in the Pleiades system that was ripe for Emergent Content Delivery. I was dispatched to the area of operations, as I was already in the vicinity. The target, CMDR Jarminx, was piloting (poorly) a newly released T-10 and bragging in local about how he was a big streamer. Some quick recon [determined that to be a lie](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Maury-Lie-Detector.jpg), as his audience was merely 2 people at that point in time.

I proceeded to the target area along and found our customer in a heated battle with our SVP and security ships. He had recently fired upon a clean Cobra and was now wanted, with the station taking pot shots at him when he ventured inside the range. We decided that this criminal was in desperate need of our patented *STTC* (straight-through-the-cockpit) delivery of some Emergent Content. Deploying my expertly crafted hardpoints, [we made quick work of this wannabe ganker](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/211539059?t=01h57m12s) and recorded the kill for posterity. What followed can only be described as the lowest-effort SPG generation in SDC history. Jarminx proceeded to lose his mind on stream for the following hour and a half, complaining about anything and everything under the sun. It really was a sight to see.

After celebrating the kill with my teammates, we realized that this was no ordinary gank. A [propaganda film was created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTTJaQynn0) in order to capitalize on our investment, but the Club Jarminx legal team was hot on our tails. After threatening legal action, the video was unfairly removed due to an abuse of the DMCA system, but thankfully our **VP of Media Authentication and Indemnification**, /u/kinmob took charge and justice prevailed. With the video back up, SPG levels have never been higher!

**Q1 Projections**

With the technology changes that will be rolling out market-wide soon, there are many opportunities for SPG generation. OP grandfathered weapons, new unbalanced effects, a ridiculously short-sighted C&amp;P system, and elimination of tried-and-true credit farms provide multiple avenues for SPG.

**Closing**

Q4 was the end to an incredible year for SDC, with some of the greatest salt gathering the universe has ever seen, despite many setbacks and obstacles placed into our path. Leadership has seen fit to provide a [generous bonus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/LD-Fudge-Round.jpg/1200px-LD-Fudge-Round.jpg) to our employees for a successful fiscal year.

The calls were smooth all afternoon, I listened while they spoke to the customer and assisted when needed. Then we got this a caller who made me so angry I cut my trainee off mid-sentence.



Before anyone says anything, I'll remind you all again this is a small call center dealing with accounting. We are nice and will do all we can to help you but if we are not the typical call center employee punching bag that has to take abuse. I have no problems getting stern with a caller. We are also all very close and we adore our new coworker, and I will not let someone take advantage of this because they are understandably not super confident yet and afraid of saying the wrong thing.



Trainee: This is _____, how can I help you?



Caller: Yeah this is (business), I called earlier because I'm trying to bill this online but your website is having an error.



T: Ok! Give me a moment to pull up your information. (Creating an excuse to put them on hold to check with me. I had taken this call earlier in the day without them so they had no idea of what was going on. I filled them in.) Thanks for holding! I see that our website was having a problem, and that my colleagues attempted to fix it earlier and had given you some advice on what to do after that. Were you able to do what they had said?



C: That's not what happened. Where are you getting your information? They said they were going to fix it.



T: (Starting to get a worried look, I let them know to just stay cool and repeat what I had told them.) I'm sorry but I just spoke to them and they said they had given you some instructions to follow. You just needed to-



C: NO, I don't need to do anything! They said they were fixing it!



T: They said they were putting it back online for you so you could collect some information, then for you to fax it to us and cancel the online billing. Were you able to get that information?



C: No, because THEY TOLD ME ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CANCEL IT AND IT WOULD BE FIXED.



T: I apologize for the misunderstanding, please let me speak to my coworkers again to confirm this. 



I hadn't intervened at this point because this was their first irate caller, and they were handling it as well as they could, being new. I assure them what they are saying is right, and that since he had not followed instructions his options were now to call the customer to get this information or to speak to a different department to see if we could speak to the customer for them, or both. They tell the caller this and he does not take it well.



C: Why should I have to do anything when I was told it was taken care of??



Me: *eyeroll*



T: Sir you've misunderstood, we can still help you but we now have fewer options then we did before. I understand it's frustrating but we will do all we can for you. 



C: You're not helping me do anything! You're just telling me it's my problem now after they tricked me into cancelling everything!! I've never spoken to a more useless person in my life! *starts shouting in the background to someone about what's happening, this person also starts yelling and throwing insults*



Nope. Now you've messed up.



T: *upset* Please, sir, I- 



I held my hand up to stop them and immediately flipped the switch that set my headset to the one that the caller could hear.



Me: Sir, my name is sh605 and I was one of the people you spoke to this morning. Do you remember me?



C: Oh thank god, the person before you-



Me: I'm going to stop you right there, as I have been listening to the call since it started. Do you recall when I told you this morning my coworker was replacing this billing in your system, and to wait 10 minutes?


C: Yeah but-



Me: Do you remember me telling you to then write the number listed below the billing and to write it on the receipt and fax it to us? 


C: *starting to fuss*



Me: Do. You. Remember.



C: Well, yeah... But I called someone else later and they said they would take care of it for me.



Me: That person sits directly beside me, sir, and that is not what they told you. They told you exactly what I told you this morning and what my trainee told you at the beginning of the call. It is notated twice in your account and I heard the conversation. When they said they would take care of it, they were directly referring to putting this back on the site for you to get all the info you would need, and after they said that they again asked you to fax the receipt with this information.



C: But-



Me: Now that you have failed to follow the instructions you were given twice, we are still going to help you but you have tied our hands a bit. As I warned you this morning, that information would not be retained after it was cancelled and it was VERY important that you write it down after we put it back for you because you would not be able to retrieve it later. Do you remember this?



C: I know but I made a mistake!



Me: That's alright, sir, we can still fix it. I will send you to a department who will reach out to the customer for you, and you are welcome to reach out to this person as well. As soon as you have it, you just send it and we will pay you what you are owed. There is nothing else that my department can do to help now, but if you have any other billing questions you can always call back for help.



C: Ok, go ahead and transfer me.



Me: Absolutely. *transfer* 


I asked my coworker if they were good, took notes, switched it back over and had them take the next call. Thankfully everything after that was simple!"	354	15

We have lived together for just over a year and it is really taking it's toll on me.  We dated for 2 years before we moved in together and he had a bad temper then too, but it was easier for me to get away from it, plus he just couldn't blame me for as much when we didn't live together.


=========================================



He's a good man.  He loves me.  He works hard.  However, he is unable to deal with stress (of any kind really it seems, which is strange because he has a very stressful position at work so I don't know how he manages it).  At home he is constantly blowing up.



=========================================



I work part time right now because I haven't been able to find a full time position.  However, money is definitely not tight in the least, so that isn't a stress. I work part time and look after our house and our pets and errands, etc.  It actually will become more stressful once I find a full time job because I'm sure things around here will fall through the cracks.



=========================================



The problem is that he's SO angry just under the surface.  He can act nice and normal, but the minute any stupid thing goes wrong he blows up.  And the thing that really irks me is that most of the time the things that go wrong are his things anyway.  For example, he's really into gaming and audio equipment and weights, etc etc.  I'm NOT.  I don't touch any of these things.  But if any of them aren't working properly, he grows increasingly angry and usually either ends up somehow making it my fault (through some crazy way), or if he can't he will start freaking out about random things (WHY is the tap in the bathroom still dripping?? WHY haven't you got that fixed?  &lt;-- stuff like that).


==========================================



My heart rate / blood pressure increases dramatically and I try to calm him down (doesn't work).  Then I become defensive and argue with him that it's not my fault his whatever isn't working, etc.  It ends up in a big fight where we both say nasty things.  This happens A LOT and it's exhausting me.



==========================================




It's not getting better.  He never learns.  It doesn't matter if we talk about it calmly later and I explain how upsetting his blaming and blow-ups are, he will just do it again a few days later.  He was nasty and mean to me on the weekend, and we had a discussion about it.  Now today it's Valentine's Day and he again blew up at me before he left for work because he couldn't find something (that I never touched).  Then he ranted and raved about the fact that the drawers were messy.



=========================================



I feel so sad and alone.  All I want is a happy loving relationship and from my perspective he's the one ruining it.  Is there any hope that an angry man can change?  When we talk about it he apologizes and says he just acts this way because he feels completely comfortable with me.



========================================



**tldr:  bf is an angry person when stressed out over little things, and he is always blowing up at me, which is damaging our relationship.**"	77	47

It's kinda funny how the thing just sorta blew up very conveniently after the second episode was shown. (Why didn't Qanon blow up in the news before 2018 when it was created in 2017?) Also supposedly one of their: 'members' threatened to kill Trump (Wait I thought Qanon supporters were pro Trump?) and now billboards for Qanon are apparently going up? In addition as soon as Qanon did start blowing up in the mainstream some Alt-Right trolls on 4chan themselves weren't sure to trust Qanon, warning other users that it was some kind of prank to make fun of them. 

More importantly, it's already been reported to be a possible prank by Liberals by various different news sources and the biggest evidence of that is how despite feeding weird random far right conspiracy theories it appears to follow the novel Q (A pro liberal piece of Italian literature) written by Luther Blissett an Italian novelist. Various journalists have pointed out that Qanon's posts followed the same tongue-in-cheek attitude as the book. 

Furthermore it's came out recently that Sacha Baron Cohen written a bunch of fake authored books, which again people must really ask the question just how far is he willing to go with all this and is Qanon really just a pro liberal prank to expose America's red state's fragility submitting to random cults. 

In the previous thread I made someone mentioned that Sacha Baron Cohen having 17 individual characters in his name, which includes spaces was nothing to go by. I agree. However; what's interesting is this random Qanon guy is always bringing up the number 17 as well. (At first I did not know this.) Not exactly evidence to anything, but curious.  

Furthermore as far as I'm aware Qanon hasn't gotten anybody killed and more interestingly various far right chan users question what Qanon actually is, so it doesn't seem as if the core has anything to do with the Alt-Right. Qanon itself isn't a group, it's a random 4chan user duping other entire groups of people on various far right chan boards and threads.

In addition Joe Rogen when talking about WhoIsAmerica mentioned that he spoke to one of the staff working on the show and said that it supposedly gets way, way crazier in the last episode. I've said it once and I stick by it, Sacha Baron Cohen isn't going to miss the opportunity to mess with a large portion of far right 4chan users and other far right extremists on the internet. 

Again, not saying that anything is for definite here only merely that this Qanon thing is becoming more and more wackier by the day and the fact that various far right groups are also scratching their heads about it personally leans me to Qanon being a elaborate internet prank for WhoIsAmerica. 

Given the sheer unpredictable nature of this show... Anything is possible. "	21	36

I'm only 19. I really REALLY feel strongly about being child-free. There's really nothing that makes me want to have kids except the pressure of my family, my boyfriend, and his mum.

He says he wants to have kids someday. His mum says i HAVE to have at least ONE. My mum says i'll never know the true joy of life until i have kids...

Everytime I bring up my arguments, like expenses, mental and physical health, the fact that kids are just repulsive to me, they all say ""you're too young, you will change your mind.""

The thing is i KNOW in my heart i'm not going to change my mind. I feel trapped. Especially because I love my boyfriend so much and we've known each other all our lives, I worry that this whole child argument will be the end of us sometime in the future...

Am i really to young to know if i want to be child-free? I'm sick of my feelings being questioned all the time!!"	36	24

Considering the sheer amount of posts regarding the incident, this is now the **ONLY** place to discuss anything relative to the final. I will leave the posts currently on the front page but any and every new post and discussion relative to this event is to be had here. I will delete **every** post from now on regardless if the discussion is civil or not. There are simply too many posts about the same situation and it's cluttering the subreddit.

I understand some of you might think this is a bit late but I had a tiny bit of a hope the spam would stop. Obviously this wasn't the case. For the next week this post will stay up stickied instead of the daily /r/tennis discussion as this is a slow week in terms of tournaments. If you see anything you think I or any other mod might've missed feel free to use the report function. It helps us out a lot.

I will add any new links regarding the situation down below, as well as the ones on the front page. Please try to remain civil. Thank you.

The private board on the nexus you should care about.	https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/9gmz6k/general_mod_author_discussion_the_private_board/	"what's up. I'm GMADLad. I make mods. I make mods that are good enough to get me access to the SUPER SECRET and SUPER ELITE board that is nexus forum's ""general mod author discussion"""". recently, a mod of mine did very well so thanks for that. When you get 500 downloads or something, they invite you and you're in.  JK, my mods aren't very good and they're not very popular. But I somehow made it so yay me. In this thread I'm not gonna name any names or post any screenshots of actual conversations, but I will say that **there is actually no rule written anywhere on the forum that you are NOT allowed to leak stuff from it, so I'm breaking zero rules by talking about this stuff.** Loopholes, yay!

Proof: https://i.imgur.com/DgDkskp.png

I am posting under TOR because last time somebody leaked something, a person said they were friends with the r/skyrimmods moderators and could get IPs. I don't think that's true because the mods here are good (and I don't think reddit mods even see IPs according to google...), but i'm covering my bases. Shout out to the skyrimmods moderators for hopefully not doing that.

---------------------------------------------------------------

You may have heard some stories about this place before, and its mostly true. If you haven't, let me share.

GMAD is a prviate place with no moderation by nexus, where modders can freely talk about basically anything with no consequences. this naturally devolves into a lot of hateful messages towards people who download mods and other mod-makers, because they can say whatever you want.

and boy do they. I don't have a problem with mod dudes having a place to vent. Making mods gets frustrating sometimes. but that's not what the board is. Even though there are theoretically many thousands of people who have access, it's truthfully the same 10-20 users ranting about the same things and the same people. New people turn up sometimes to ask for help, and are either mocked or redirected (one totally funny joke that they like to do is respond with ""what game?"" when new people ask for help with a mod. haha because you didn't know what game they were talking about when they mention dragons and the thalmor, am I right?)

which leads me to what actually led me to make this post. In my picture you can see a thread called 'dumb user comments'. It has 1045 pages and has been running since 2011. in the thread, users (who the denizens of this place treat as some kind of subhuman race who couldn't possibly be competent or trusted with literally anything) are mocked again and again and again by mod makers who copy and paste their comments in order to ridicule them. Some people have it coming, we see a lot of comments that are very rude and ill informed and people get a chuckle. others, not so much.

The topic is mean spirited. Here's an actual example of a post that somebody left on a mod page that got torn to shreds by super-smart mod makers who would take offense to a genuine question:



&gt;""Hey there, from what I have seen, this is a great mod, but it does now work for me. I have both the latest version of SMM and this mod installed, but nothing shows up in my game. Do you know what might me going on? thanks.""

he didn't know which files to download and didn't understand the description/overlooked the answer and had the audacity to ask for help. evil, right? clearly he is a dumb person and deserves to have his post submitted to 'dumb user comments' for all the other mod makers to laugh at!

That thread has been going for **7 years**. It is just a mean hearted thread where mod makers collectively get off on making fun of people who are just trying to have a good time with their work. again, there are bad apples too, but too many genuine people who just don't have good technical know how get caught in the crosshairs. That is just 1 EXAMPLE of the type of place this is.

Another running theme is that, a certain set of mod makers including one very prolific author of a large mod puts ""community"" in quotation marks, because they believe that all users are entitled babies who don't deserve to be part of the community. this started in 2015 after the paid mods fiasco when they boldly declared that the community revealed itself to not be a community at all because they didn't like the paid mods. They openly hate mod users (yet for some reason continue to make mods) and have nothing good to say about them at all.

And boy do they have an axe to grind with this subreddit specifically (https://i.imgur.com/TmN5Na0.png). They REALLY hate r/skyrimmods. like more than I can express. they constantly talk about how reddit is a toxic echo chamber (the irony) where the moderators let toxicity spread for clicks (?). anybody who says this place is good is berated for contributing to the toxicity. dudes there are legitimately unmoored from the culture of the mod scene. they hate the moderation here and they hate that people can post opinions that they don't like. What they hate more is that a lot of times those opinions get upvotes and that a lot of people agree with those opinions.

They also think that ""YouTubers"" are the devil. After the Floating Market drama where a mod maker filed a copyright claim and allegedly started a lawsuit (though two lawyer acquaintences told me that the story we were sold was not how lawsuits actually works), they became a subject of serious ire. https://i.imgur.com/t80BvPD.png

that thread has over 300 pages of people arguing over whether or not youtubers make money off of their work. some people said that it wasn't true, that youtubers who review mods make money from their own work. The others got very angry at this and   started talking about ways to take those evil tubesters down a peg. This video was shown as an example of a bad youtuber: https://youtu.be/owdrVZKwy_M?t=631

the reason was because Oxhorn didn't tell people to download and endorse the mod. THE HORROR !


then there was the movement to come up with DRM for their mods, PULP, that thankfully died in  its cradle. that would have given mods popup messages that boot you to the main menu if you don't agree to the mod maker's terms LOL. looks like you guys already have a thread on that from when it happened though. thanks for the truth, kind stranger! read more here: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/621t4e/some_mod_authors_planning_ingame_pop_up_license/

new users are driven away in droves because of how mean of a place it is. you'd think there would be lots of active people in an exclusive forum for mod makers on the biggest mod site, but there's not. Its the same small amount of people arguing in circles about the same things over and over again for years. literally years. any new blood that turns up just immediately leaves once they see what kind of place it is.


now baby, I'm not naming names. i also don't really want to leak the full posts that some of these people make, so maybe you're doubting what I'm saying. Fraid I can't do anything about that other than the limited screenshots I've showed. you can believe it or not, but I think ive made a pretty convincing case. I intend to burn this account pretty quick but I'll stick around for a short time in case any major questions come up although i doubt they will.

GMAD is a serious problem and a major breeding ground for insane levels of toxicity, and that's a fact. i've been thinking about making a post like this for a long time but wanted to find the best way to do it anonymously and in a way that wouldn't lead to witch hunts. witch hunting is bad, and that's why I'm not sharing any specific names.

And, mods of r/skyrimmods: I think you're doing a good job, keep it up.

The side not being debated will often see this as evidence that there is no response to their ideas and that the prominence of the side who won't debate is caused by socioeconomic factors, such as what the wealthy or the administratively powerful either believe or have a conflict of interest towards enforcing. To give an analogy, Magnus Carlsen would be very well qualified to suggest a chess move to me, but if I know he placed a large cash bet on my opponent, I may choose to ignore his advice -- especially if he refuses to have the debate.

-

Now, say you're a layman on some topic and that you have some evidence that you are not an idiot. That puts you uniquely in a position where you have someone (yourself) who isn't an idiot and is not looking to deceive you or lie to you, meaning they don't have the problems that Side A and Side B both have. Unfortunately, you have zero expertise on the topic and you find yourself at a crossroads. Of the people who claim some knowledge, members of one side might just be idiots filling your head with nonsense while members of the other side might either be compromised or less knowledgeable than they think. No debate will take place, so you can't at least see who zings the other better. 

-

Has anyone written anything good on this sort of dilemma?

You can explain your decision if you wish but you don’t have to. Also I am basing this on the assumption everyone has watched the series. However if you have did your own research into this case you can use that when deciding. So based on what you know (regardless of where you got the information) is Steven Avery guilty or Not Guilty? 	3	227

My dad always asks me if I want some meat, which is actually really mean because I wanted to be vegetarian for years but just wasn't allowed to but now I have been for 4 months (6 months tomorrow which is in less than 45 mins hehe) I love being vegetarian and there's nothing wrong with it so I recommend it.

My uncle thinks its bad then he said about a girl he knows who is vegan and over exercises and just doesn't eat which is not me at all so I just don't understand... My grandmother is also not ok with it but she's just a mean person but still. And I have friends who are also vegetarian and my mum is happy with me doing it. I guess it makes me hate my family more with them being mean to me about caring and I would rather not eat meat as well.

Can someone help me with some reasons I don't know I'm not good at talking. Sorry this is poorly written but I tried.

[Here is the spreadsheet of the responses we got from the survey, just to show transparency.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTNHcMLvd37wqm8id-YYB_J9KC97CiF9_95TW5Ebvuw/edit?usp=sharing) Aside from the meme responses put in, which were expected, the vast majority of the responses agree that we should restrict the amount and nature surrounding the incel ideology and rhetoric that has been posted on this sub recently. These suggestions vary from “do nothing” to “ban them all.” Again, we (well really I) don't think that these users should be banned outright from the get-go. So, here is how we’re going to handle it moving forward:

**Toxic incel ideology will not be tolerated anymore, and any posts including toxic incel ideology will be removed, and points will be given.** New users here that post these things unknowingly will be given a warning, and then points. Users here that have regularly posted these sentiments will immediately be given points. Here are some examples of what is, and isn’t okay:

1. Generalizing a group of people is **not** okay. This includes races, genders, sexualities, and all other groups of people. Things like “gay men have lower standards than women” and “women don’t care about personality” will not be tolerated anymore.

2. Talking about the “incel rebellion” is **not** okay. This might be a little weird to some of you, and we haven’t seen a lot of it on this sub, but [here is the reason that this specifically is going to be prohibited.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/04/27/why-are-incels-so-angry-the-history-of-the-little-known-ideology-behind-the-toronto-attack/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.bab4e32bb25a) 

3. Using certain incel lingo is **not** okay. Calling someone a chad or something like that **is** fine. But unironically using the terms “femoids”, “tallfag”, “rosties”, “Elliot Roger”, “blackpill” etc. will not be allowed, and anything containing these terms **unironically** will be removed. Similarly, incel related jokes **are** okay.

4. Talking about incels in and of themselves **is** okay. As soon as you delve into promoting the toxic ideologies of them unironically will get your shit removed. 

5. Identifying as an incel **is** okay, so long as you do not come after other users, promote the toxic ideology, or just in general cause issues. 

6. Talking about your insecurities **is** okay. There is a difference between “I’m ugly, and I feel like I won’t ever get into a relationship because of it”, and “If you’re ugly and heterosexual, you won’t ever find a girlfriend. Women don’t care about anything but aesthetics.” 

7. Telling someone that they got rejected because of some physical attribute is **not** okay. There are a number of reasons that someone can get turned down from a relationship, and it’s not always because they’re ugly. People who do this are putting an idea in another person’s mind that is more than likely false, and it can lead them down a bad path. 

8. Incel related attacks on other users are **not** okay. This should go without saying, and is already in the rules.

9. Finally, telling someone to “take the blackpill” or “you’re one of us” is **not** okay. This isn’t a cult hazing, and 90% of the time this kind of shit gets posted is in response to when someone is feeling bad about something. We will not tolerate taking advantage of someone when they’re down, and bringing them down even lower when they need to be brought up. 

This is the solution that ***the mod team collectively has decided upon.*** These rules are subject to change and will be modified as needed. This is what was suggested from the user base here, and is now being put into action under mod supervision. Feel free to send in modmail about potential changes to these rules, and any other concerns you may have. This is how it’s going to be as of right now, and complaining about it will probably just get you “baby gonna cry” in the comments.

Sincerely, the mods.

It is an accessory you may add to a ps4 or xbox controller that gives you 2 additional inputs (paddles) on your controller that can be bound to any button. I have seen so many people complaining, reviewing or raving about Scuf, Aim, battle beaver; you name it. Here is my main issue when dealing with these custom controllers....

&amp;#x200B;

1. Many of these custom controllers are well over $150 and can approach $250 at max. Not only is this price absolutely ridiculous, but you are paying for one of the biggest price gouges in modern gaming history. The FPS strike pack is $39.99 and I got mine on sale for 30 USD.  None of the components in these custom controllers justify the price (mainly looking at you SCUF). Cheap plastic and simple electronic works do not cost 1/10 of what they sell for.
2. Inconsistencies with custom controllers: this is mainly an issue with SCUF as you may have heard their recent Vantage has faced many complaints because their hardware and software is failing... randomly disconnects, huge deadzones etc. This is a huge problem for competitive gaming because no one wants to worry about their input device failing them halfway through a tournament with money on the line.

Bottom line: If you own a ps4 and are considering a custom controller because you want to be able to jump and or build without taking your thumb off of the analog stick, I highly recommend going with the strike pack and some thumb grips. Not only is it a cheaper option, but it is BETTER. If you own an xbox then my recommendation is immediately going to be the xbox elite controller. It is hands down the best competitive gaming controller ever released and the price constitutes the quality. But, if you wish to save money then I recommend the strike pack. Please stop shelling away your money to these greedy companies. Invest in a low latency gaming monitor, stream set up...anything other than these terrible high priced custom controllers. I feel for all the 10-12 year olds that are gonna be asking for the new SCUF Vantage because they wanna play like ninja. These companies are destructive to the console gaming community and allow for more companies to gouge prices. The FPS strike pack can do what ever these companies claim their controllers can plus more. Let me know what you guys think

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Wanted to make clear that I am not trying to shame any SCUF or other high end controller owners. It all comes down to preference and if you are happy with your form of input, then that is all that matters! Just wanted to bring this to light in case anyone is on the fence about making this purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: getting a good bit of hate from SCUF/elite owners and I want them to read my whole post because I am not trying to shame anyone and maybe I should have been less aggressive with my title, but I just want people who are looking at different input options to know that there is a very affordable option that I think is better than the high end options. Wish I could change the title as someone pointed out that it is misleading and I only want people who are in the market for a new controller to consider the cheaper options."	91	164

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a history of violence, and I have experienced it a few times. He had been violent about 4 times over the period we have been dating, just over a year. I have witnessed my partner become violent towards his mom (who is 75 years old) twice in the past. The first time was driving and she was making a joke about him. He didn't like what she said, so he slammed on the brakes, causing her face to hit the headrest in front of her and her eye started bleeding. He seemed shocked by what he did afterwards. He did it again tonight. The argument between them was that his mom doesn't like cats, so when the family cat was seen in the kitchen, she quickly got up to open the door for it to get outside. My BF wanted the cat to stay in, but mom didn't want to, and headed to open the door for the cat asap. He ran from the table to stop her. I was cooking, so I did not see what happened entirely.

He then took the keys off the doors after locking them so the cat wouldn't go out. The quarrel continued and because his mom tried to let the cat out again through the main entrance, he commanded her to sit down and eat. That is when his tone of voice changed to a serious and lower one. When she didn't do so, made a move for the door again, he shoved her hard so she fell back, hit her head on the glass door and fell down in a sitting position. When he saw what he did, he pulled her up, and asked her where it hurt. Mom sat down in shock, her face buried in her hands. To my shock, he sat down and resumed lecturing her about how stubborn she is and how horrible a person she is for forcing him to accept her choice about the cat.

His reasoning for pushing, which does not make sense to me at all due to the morals I was raised with that physical violence is never a tool to use in verbal arguments. You just don't hit people, right? It is worse than words I guess that is what I am saying. But at the same time, I know and have experienced how hurtful words are, even more than physical hitting. My bf firmly believes he is wronged every time someone makes him feel guilty and helpless, left without a say, and therefore justified to attack someone physically to also ""make them"" do what he wants. That rationale makes it okay for him to push women around (hard, not a light push) is that people are violent with their words when they force him to take their decision. He said many times that a lack of choice takes away his freedom and is a form of violence. What I witnessed and experienced myself, is what I believe is twisted logic. It makes me rethink whether I should break up with him immediately because I simply cannot agree with him. Is he right?

By the way, after this happened, I think he opened the door, let the cat out himself, put the keys back in the common room, and went upstairs to express his anger to his brother's family about what his mom did: let the cat out without listening to what he wanted. WTF. Seriously, I am so confused. Before to him going up, I confronted the BF at the table and he said to me, that his mother inflicted violence on him by her militant decision and lack of hearing what he wanted. I said that is not a big deal and he says he doesn't want to be pushed around and will not tolerate it. I grew up in an abusive home, so I am trying my best not to be triggered. Is my bf mentally unwell?

I am still shaking a bit as I type, but my main question is what do you think of his logic? How can this be right? AKA how can I demonstrate that this thinking is wrong? Because by his ideas, it just gives him a reasoning to scare and hurt me in the future and anyone else (mostly women).

He believes the law is unfair. That a woman can cheat on a man and break a man's heart without being reprimanded. But if the man retaliates with physical action he gets locked up.

It took me about half an hour and it  came out to just over $100.

It's Saturday so my bank isn't open so I decided to go to a local head shop and try and get a new bong.

(DISCLAIMER: many of you may think im an asshole stoner, being a total chump for doing this but I'll just say it's legal some places and I thoroughly counted the coins twice while not under any kind of influence. I counted using a scale the first time and manually the second so I'm positive of the value.)

I digress. Money is money and I managed to double count in about 30 minutes, yet the cashier called me an asshole and told me to beat it as soon as I asked if they'd accept payment in coins.

$100 is nothing to sneeze at for a small time glass store and I'm honestly surprised they wouldn't take it, and the dude behind the counter was very rude about it.

So, am I the asshole for trying to spend a bunch of money in change?

EDIT: I am indeed the asshole. 

Next time I'll exercise some patience. It's healthy to be told you're flat out wrong every now and then. I'd like to think my activity in this thread was decent discussion of the incident but I've received plenty of downvotes that suggest otherwise.

Met 12 years ago, together 8 years and married 3. We have 1 child together [20monthsF] and both work full time in the IT industry.

Our work can be stressful at times and we manage the housework ourselves.

The things that always bug me and stay as a permanent worry in the back of my mind are firstly, that my husbands relationship with his mother doesn’t seem *healthy*. Second, I seem to do a lot of the “thinking work”, chores and childcare on a practical level even though I work the exact same hours and in a more senior position. And lastly, I feel that my husband doesn’t always support me emotionally in the way that I need him to, or trust me.

I have supported him through several job changes, a full career change and health issues including depression and weight gain resulting in blood pressure issues. I have been a constant these past 8 years and don’t think I could be more accommodating or forgiving, especially considering the issues he has caused with his mother and me. 

For example, early on in our relationship he would tell her every time we had an argument and then she would treat me differently. He would call her up and complain about every little thing that’s been bothering him and then she would think I wasn’t there for him. Eventually she started being sarcastic and “off” with me when she would see me and get involved in our relationship. 

She once didn’t speak to me for a year because I got offended that she was upset we wanted to get a pet together and said “what’s next, a baby?”

After many years of tension we had improved things a lot and argued much less. I thought his mother had kept her nose out of our business and that he was running to her less over every little thing.

Until recently when he’d had a bad day at work on the night of my work Christmas party. I was already at the hotel without my car as I’d hitched a lift with a coworker so couldn’t just run home when he called me up ranting about it and lashing out. We ended the phone call with me upset that he was lashing out and him upset that I hadn’t gone home to support him. He called me back and apologised for how he acted and told me he wanted me to have fun at the Christmas party and I would see him tomorrow. (I was staying over at the hotel)

Important info: we work in the same place and he was staying home with our little one as we didn’t have a sitter. His mum has just had surgery and couldn’t drive. 

I got a snippy text from his mother that night about how she wished he’d had someone at home to talk it out and that he was so so angry and upset and if only she could drive she’d go over to see him. 

I sent it to him and said I didn’t like it. Thought that was the end of it... 

The very next day at work I helped him to get out of the situation he was in that was causing him stress and a good outcome was reached.

Turns out he has complained to her about the fact that I wasn’t home and they’d ended up bitching to each other via text message about not only that, but also about when she’d had her surgery and I was alone with our little one and allowed her to sleep in my bed as she was having a sleep regression and I had work in the morning. Apparently I caused the sleep regression, according to them. He was staying with her at the time as she lives alone. 

We had an argument about it and I told him in no uncertain terms that he should not bitch about me to his mother, ever. He said he couldn’t make that promise but he would try...

Now I question how we will be in 5, 10, 20 years and whether I made a mistake. The other stuff I can sort of live with or work with him on but this mother issue seems to be a big thing and one he has put very little effort into changing.

Some more very important information: he has bipolar II and I have anxiety disorder. 

*TL:DR:* married to a man who runs to his mum all the time and trash talks me. Is it doomed?"	177	34

With all the mobility (rifts/rifts to go/jumping off planes/redeploy) console it at a huge disadvantage to PC because we can’t pick what gun we want before we land. 

If I store rifts to go at the back of my inventory, upon landing it goes to the nearest item (usually another heal) then I cycle back to my shotgun. May not seem like a huge task, but it’s gotten me killed many times. 

PLEASE LET US CYCLE THROUGH/CHOOSE WHAT GUN WE WANT TO HAVE OUT WHEN WE LAND EPIC! 

Edit: and launch pads! Silly me! 

Edit 2: I was not clear with what I said about PC. They can’t cycle though, however, when they land they can instantly switch to any gun with 1 button while console must cycle through. 

Edit 3: Since this is gaining traction and I’m seeing some duplicated comments, if they add this feature it should also be for PC. I’m not trying to gain “an advantage” for console. If you add it to one, add it to all platform. "	6828	443

#Info for Newbies and FAQ!

* [This video](http://vimeo.com/41174743) is the best video I've found that explains the 3 basics of Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO.

* Check out /r/photoclass_2018 (or /r/photoclass for old lessons).
   
* Posting in the Album Thread is a great way to learn!

&gt; 1) It forces you to _select_ which of your photos are worth sharing

&gt; 2) You should judge and critique other people's albums, so you stop, think about and express what you like in other people's photos.

&gt; 3) You will get feedback on which of your photos are good and which are bad, and if you're lucky we'll even tell you why and how to improve!

* If you want to buy a camera, take a look at [our Buyer's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index#wiki\_what\_can\_i\_afford.3F) or [www.dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/)

* If you want a camera to learn on, or a first camera, the beginner camera market is very competitive, so they're all pretty much the same in terms of price/value. Just go to a shop and pick one that feels good in your hands.

* Canon vs. Nikon? Just choose whichever one your friends/family have, so you can ask them for help (button/menu layout) and/or borrow their lenses/batteries/etc.

* /u/mrjon2069 also made a video demonstrating the basic controls of a DSLR camera. You can find it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSKqgZxM108)

As you'll be aware, despite promising our mod team and membership an open debate on /r/TheRedPill over 7 days, TRP have pulled from their commitments and locked their own threads after only 2 days. Both the civil debate and the open ""purge week rules"" free for all.

They haven't told us why they did so. They haven't communicated to us directly at all. 

For those of you who thought the win condition was ""getting them to cry uncle and retreat from an open and fair debate because they couldn't handle one""... You ""won"".

For those of you who thought the win condition was ""learning something new about RP"" and/or ""changing some minds over on TRP, or in a wider audience"" and/or ""having some fun debating RP with some people knowledgable about RP""....I'm sorry to say it looks like we ""lost"". But only because it appears the TRP Mods pulled, handing the ""win"" condition to those above.

It appears they initially tried to continue even though they realised they'd bitten off more than they could chew.

As far as I can see they did so first by ""deleting their own ECs answers when they thought the ECs answers made TRP look like fools"", then later they did so by ""modding away things that made them look bad saying these arguments were not in good faith"" and (possibly) by ""banning people asking questions they found too difficult"", and then (finally), when they realised that it was obvious to any observer this is exactly what they were doing they did so by ""Crying uncle, unstickying and locking their threads, and taking their ball and going home with a big pouty flounce"".

Feel free to use this thread to speculate on why they did so, to give our mod team a long and extended bout of ""I told you so's"", and to do a victory lap if your personal debate ""win"" condition was getting them to go off in a big pouty flounce.

(/u/redpillschool , /u/max_peenor , /u/gaylubeoil , /u/itiswr1tten , /u/KeffirLime , /u/sadomasochrist , or any other TRP or mod who is not already banned and who wants to come here and explain or discuss any of this you are welcome as long as you obey our sub rules/reddit wide rules.).

Normal Rules are in place (and as usual PPD mods commit to moderating those fairly with respect to all sides)."	32	282

There is one thing I kind of wish would be added, sort of like how the color dungeon was added in DX. I want an infinite rogue-like dungeon, somewhere, that actually has LA-type puzzles, maybe not multi-floor puzzles, but at least single floor or single room puzzles. Beyond that, I don't know what purpose it would serve other than maybe bragging rights (it would need to do something substantial to provide any sort of longevity), but it would be nice to have. The game is so short as it is, that it really needs something new to keep people playing beyond replaying the base game for the umpteenth time. Any thoughts? 	0	35

He almost attempted suicide two years ago and was admitted into a hospital for a week. He doesn’t go to therapy (doesn’t want to/can’t afford it excuses) and never took his medication he was prescribed despite my best efforts to get him to so it was pointless for him to even have it. 

Usually, I try and be sympathetic and understanding to his depression but over the past year it has really been wearing me down. His refusal to get help coupled with his terribly pessimistic attitude that he unleashes towards me often is driving me away and is making me not attracted to him . I have also noticed that he uses his depression as a way to manipulate me. 

When we fight, he often tells me he would probably kill himself if I ever left him. This not only leaves fights unresolved because I abandon them to try and make him feel better, but it also scares me to leave if I ever wanted to because I really care for him. His depression leaves him unmotivated and irresponsible, which leaves my sex drive low. He will say really self deprecating things to try and guilt me into improving our sex life instead of fixing what is causing it. Just yesterday, he was in the middle of a depression nap. When he woke up he told me that he was just going to keep sleeping because he doesn’t have any groceries (he does, just not quick meals) and he is hungry. When I offered to buy him some groceries he told me no “because using you as a safety net makes you not want to fuck me” and “thanks for the charity though”. I know he wants me to but is trying to make me feel bad for offering for some reason. Usually when the bad times pass, he apologizes and blames his depression. 

Is this normal depression behavior? How do I deal with this situation without making his depression worse? Is it a lost cause?"	13	11

The reason Digi was wrong, though, was by saying that a 'point' can be made good by being true, when in fact a 'good point' is one that's well-justified or well-argued, or adds substance to an argument, regardless of if it's true. The bit about saying ""Death Note is alright"" -- Digi says this is a good point because it's true. But it's not a good point. It's a banal, trivial point. For it to be a 'good point' it would have to have some substantial place in an argument. We don't say 'good point' to people who point out trivial truths like the sky is blue, 2+2=4 etc., unless it's in the context of adding weight to an argument.


The other thing Digi was wrong about how one wins a debate. Yes, whoever wins a debate is in the eye of the beholder, HOWEVER, there is still criteria for judging who wins a debate that the beholder should apply: namely, whoever makes the better arguments is the one who wins (remembering that the conclusion of an argument doesn't have to be true for it to be a good argument).

In the case of the round-Earther who makes shit arguments against the flat-Earther who makes good arguments, Digi may think the round-Earther won the debate because, though his arguments were shit, what he was saying was true. But Digi would be WRONG TO DO THIS. Because one should judge who wins a debate by who makes the better arguments. If the flat-Earther made better arguments, he wins the debate, regardless of whether his conclusion was true or false.


So ultimately, Digi is wrong to think that Dick won the debate with Destiny, even if what Dick was saying was true. (Shit, not even Dick thinks he won that debate).


^ This is why it's possible for me to say that Digi won the debate even though he was wrong. Otherwise, I'd have to say he lost, even though his performance was way better than Destiny's, just because his point was technically false ... which would be dumb.


P.S.: It's ironic that Digi, despite his claims to relativism, implicitly yields to an objectivist notion of truth with this view: 'truth' trumps justification, or even that 'truth' can make it 'good'. No true relativist would ever pay this much respect to truth. Brush up on your Nietzsche, Dig.﻿"	7	69

BUT does anyone think it was Karma?!?

Let me explain..

First season: she’s the one who chose not to destroy/ deactivate the device before the finale to get rid of the vampires. By not doing this she caused: Tyler’s dad to die, Jeremy’s girlfriend to die, Tyler to crash his car because he heard that sound.. causing Caroline to be severely injured and taken to the hospital, ultimately leading to her confrontation with Katherine.. leading to her death.

There are many many many more facts to side with this argument... I just need to rewatch the seasons.

Thoughts? 

Everyone blamed Katherine. BUT IF it wasn’t for Bonnie’s self righteousness with the vampires and the device none of those factors would’ve been put into motion.

NOT TO MENTION... when Kai linked Elena and Bonnie together. It was because bonnie betrayed him.. and he wanted to get back at her (a watch the part of season 6 finale when he records himself for Bonnie to see in the camera).

Just saying Bonnie isn’t as innocent as most believe she is.."	42	89

His shove on block is getting removed (WTF)
2. His shove is getting slowed down a lot (even though it should have been sped up if anything)
3. Although not so much a nerf, it’s just sort of annoying. His new combo is a 3 chain heavy (which would be pointless in duels)
4. No hyper armor added (not a nerf just annoying for a character literally covered in armor)
5. His ramming attack can now be interrupted (who was asking for that?)
6. Ramming attack damage was reduced (again WTF)

Sure he got minor buffs in some areas (faster top light and zone, and increased damage to some attacks) but the nerfs greatly out weigh the buffs. Over all, Lawbringer was nerfed, not reworked, not buffed, nerfed. 

My suggestion, if this is the “rework” then I don’t want it. I’d rather have nothing than this. Please change course."	0	32

When the Chinese President met with Trump at Trump's Florida resort, the following incident occurred involving some of Trump's staffers

""The group asked the bartender to leave the room so it “could speak confidentially,” according to an email written by Mar-a-Lago’s catering director, Brooke Watson.

View note
The Secret Service guarded the door, according to the email. The bartender wasn’t allowed to return. And members of the group began pouring themselves drinks. No one paid.

Six days later, on April 13, Mar-a-Lago created a bill for those drinks, tallying $838 worth of alcohol plus a 20% service charge. It covered 54 drinks (making for an average price of $18.62 each) of premium liquor: Chopin vodka, Patron and Don Julio Blanco tequilas and Woodford Reserve bourbon. ""

After the State Department refused to pay the bill they received, the forwarded it to the White House, who used taxpayer funds to cover the expense.

this concept of homosexuality being ""unnatural.""

Does the notion of something being natural
imply that it is good? If so, why do humans have a
natural impulse to kill? Is killing good?

And if something is unnatural, does it have to
be bad? If so why do we drive cars, or use cell
phones, or use modern medicine? Those things
aren't natural. Are they bad, too?

The funniest thing, though, is that, in all actuality
homosexuality IS natural. It's found all OVER
the animal kingdom, especially in the case of
primates. The only thing that ISN'T natural about
this is homoPHOBIA. We are the ONLY species that
stigmatizes homosexual desires and activity.

So... it stands to reason that if you are correct
about morality somehow being tied to
nature, then there's still nothing wrong with
homosexuality, but there IS still something wrong
with homophobia."	144	130

We only get to see each other in person every 3-6 weeks depending on our current work schedules/ school. Whenever we see each other, we call off work or make time within our schedules. The last time that I came to her, she worked 2 and a half out of the 4 days that I came to visit. I vented out my frustrated to her before and she apologized and said she couldn’t get those days off because she was saving up her vacation days for our vacation in July. I accepted her apology and we made the best of that weekend. 

This weekend, she’s coming down to visit me. We had planned out our weekend together two months in advance. She claims to have had notified her employer two months ago that she would be taking this weekend off. However, her employer had not granted her one weekday in the middle of the 4 days we had planned together, thus cutting short our time with each other to 2 days instead of the 4 that we had planned together initially. I’ve never had an employer reject a request to take a day off after giving them at least three weeks of notice, so I am doubtful if shes telling the truth or not. Would I be the asshole if I called her out on my belief that she isn't being truthful and also tell her to do better in terms of working out her schedule?

Edit: The issue of me not believing her is because she waited just until now to tell me. Blindsiding me until a couple of days prior to her visitation is not okay, and I will not endure that. If she had addressed the issue in the past, I would understand completely. Some of the comments claim that she is more annoyed than I am but have no idea what week I had prepared with her."	162	96

You plan a meeting at a place and time, but they let you know shortly beforehand something came up and they will have to reschedule to next week. You say ‘ok, that’s totally understandable’. Next week comes around and you show up, but your friends aren’t there. You wait around, but they never show. You try to contact them, but they don’t answer. They don’t say anything about why they didn’t show up, or when they will be free again. The community isn’t upset because we have to wait longer for an answer. We are upset because SP7 isn’t being trustworthy. We’re all here because we love our boys, we would’ve accepted any excuse. But just because we love our boys doesn’t mean we are going to be ok with being stood up.	0	60

I post here a few times a week and my posts generally go with zero replies and that is upsetting haha. 

Anyway, I really do want a relationship, but at the same time I'm not ready to enter one. I've been single for a while now and I'm over my ex but the 2.5-3 years of dating left a gap that's pretty hard to fill once you break up. 

Having said that I do occasionally think about what a relationship used to be. Going to their place or them coming over, having a lot of sex, having that person that gets all your jokes, that you can be entirely yourself with and they absolutely love you for it. I look at places around the world I want to visit, big things that I want to do and it'd be nice to have somebody to share it with. I have a lot of great friends, but of course that isn't the same connection as a significant other.

It's a rough feeling, to WANT someone but know that you shouldn't. Right now, I don't feel like I have enough to offer. I work a full time job, making 32-40k a year, I love my work a lot but it doesn't pay as well as I'd like it to, I don't have any plans to return to school, maybe a trade school though but I'll see. I haven't done much in my life. I've done a LOT of school but dropped out often, I feel depressed, anxious as fuck and everything going on in my head leads to undiagnosed ADHD and as badly as I want to get checked for that, I can't get up and do it. I just overall feel like I don't have control over myself right now at all. Hell, my work days depend solely on praise. I bust my ass so hard just to hear a ""good job"" because that absolutely fuels me, and any single error I make makes me shut down and make a million more errors. I'm just not in a good place, my work (although I love it) is my life right now and I have nothing else I can offer and I don't know how to begin having something to offer.

This turned into quite a rant, but does anyone get how I feel or feel the same way?"	7	11

Embrace that in the grand cosmic scale, you actually matter. These beings of untold power have come to you with a purpose of completing their will in a grand plan. Unlike Paladins and Clerics who rarely receive a divine message in the first place, and pray for powers from above. You are granted extraordinary gifts simply for existing, so live it up. Shoot Eldritch Blasts into the air like fireworks and party like there is no tomorrow. Revel that in the grand cosmic machine you serve a purpose that will truly affect the universe forever in some way. You are an arbiter for a thing of higher understanding and being, so maybe crack open a beer and rub it in your Clerics face that your god actually wants to talk to you."	185	69

- Becky a system administrator from Colorado, saw 80s musical has-beens as a roadie for a local band;
- Eric, an executive producer from California, just doesn't look like a Viagra smuggler; and
- E.J., a project manager from New York, whose first name causes some confusion. E.J. is a two-day champ with earnings of $54,201.

It took champ E.J. a long time to get rolling, but he finally put together a run near the end of DJ, and that combined with late misses by Eric led to a runaway for E.J. at $13,000 vs. $5,600 for Eric and $4,000 for Becky.

DD1, $400 - ""O"" IS FOR OPERA - Spoiler: Eurydice dies in Monteverdi's 1607 opera named for this protagonist (Eric won the table limit of $1,000.)

DD2, $1,200 - IN &amp; AROUND ASIA - Sights in this capital city include the lovely Silver Pagoda &amp; the ghastly Tuol Sleng Museum (E.J. lost $3,000 from his score of $6,000.)

DD3, $1,200 - COMMUNICATION - In the debate between oralism and manualism, this 2-word type of communication, Thomas Gallaudet was a manualist (Eric lost $3,000 from his total of $9,400 vs. $8,600 for E.J.)

FJ - MEDICAL NEWS 2018 - For the first time, the FDA approved a drug for the treatment of this, though there hadn't been a new case in 40 years

Only Eric was correct on FJ, so his late mistakes wound up costing him the game. E.J. escaped with the win, dropping $501 to finish with $12,499 for a three-day total of $66,700. 

Missing the layup: For a clue about a ""Red"" Steinbeck novel, after E.J. was generously given two chances with ""Horse"" and ""Stallion"", his opponents still couldn't come up with ""Pony"".

This day in Trebekistan: Alex gave us a ""gentle reminder"" that the latest Teen Tournament starts on Monday. Thanks for breaking it gently, it helped us prepare ourselves for the unwelcome news.

Correct Qs:
DD1 - Who is Orpheus?
DD2 - What is Phnom Penh?

Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.

She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?"	24240	3575

I have a lot of thinking-Dom friends, mostly whom are xNTx’s. They’re very lovely and of course, intelligent people, but I usually cannot have a harmonious argument with any of them (especially ENTPs).  The only thinking doms that don’t really do this is ISTPs that I’ve noticed. They always tend to disregard my opinions or beliefs, and instead of just “agreeing to disagree”, they continue to prove themselves right until they push me to agree with them or say they’re right. It’s very frustrating because I’d love to have intellectual conversations with these intelligent people, but it’s frustrating when I am consistently pushed into their mindset, and if I’m not, I’m either “not getting it”, or “not intelligent enough” to see why they’re right. And then, I usually stop the argument once I feel that it’s going nowhere, I get told that I’m shutting down because I can’t fight back, not responding because I know they’re right and don’t want to say it, or that I’m getting my feelings hurt. Really, I am just exhausted of being told I’m not understanding because I’m not smart enough — really, I am, I’m just not going to submit to feed ego, nor withstand being insulted. 

Thinking doms, I love you guys so much, but why do some of you do this to me? I just want to have a casual conversation where I can express my opinion without being belittled or coerced into thinking I’m wrong (it’s just an opinion, really). And it also kind of hurts to be told I don’t have the depth to grasp the concept you are putting out. I’m not the most logical person, but I can still understand it. 

Has anyone else noticed this or had this problem? Thinking doms, have you noticed this in yourself at some point? Maybe I’m just being a too-sensitive INFJ?"	88	183

She had already known but it was a reminder and she had forgotten. She proceeded to freak out, screaming at me and talking about how I am leaving her and how its unfair. 

I explained that this is one week and we spend every single day together, and that i never spend time with my family and that I really enjoy that. She called me selfish for leaving her behind to go relax on the beach while she “sits around doing nothing”. I told her to hang out with people and she said no one will be around?? She said I was abandoning her.  She is leaving for college for the first time two weeks into August so she says that at the start of the month she will be very emotional and that its selfish of me to leave her in that state. 

She screamed in my face and told me that was she was going to “make my life a living hell while I’m there”. When I yelled back she threatened to punch me in the face. She decided to set “rules” involving me having to text her at all times and never miss a text, always send my location and a picture, and stay up until at least 3 am every night to make sure she is done talking to me. She expects me to ask my family if I can stay home alone for a week and not go. I don’t know what to do there is no getting through to her. She will not change her mind and keeps insulting me and yelling at me and then will turn around and beg me to stay. 

We’ve had some issues in the past and recently I’ve been noticing a trend of her getting overly angry with me and insulting me. It also seems like she can never admit to being wrong. Every argument we have I end up apologizing even when Ive done nothing wrong.

I’m just very worried about this and I was just wondering what I should do about this.  Should I confront her about this? Or should I just suck it up?

tl;dr - gf wants me to back out of family vacation thats in two months because she will be lonely."	7	10	
4598051	relationships	736723825	https://www.reddit.com//r/relationships/comments/c6mjqp/need_advice_on_how_to_handle_walking_on_egg/	2019-06-28 16:50:52	26862585.0	FerretSummoner	Need advice on how to handle walking on egg shells when it comes to politics and my parents.	https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c6mjqp/need_advice_on_how_to_handle_walking_on_egg/	"My mom is 72 and my dad is 73. I was raised, from birth, as a Conservative Christian by my parents. Currently, I'm a 24 year old boy. I **WAS** a non denominational Christian for many years and witnessed my mom quoting bible verses and praying around the dinner table every meal. My parents could be summarized by the term ""Traditionalists"". They have a routine day and time to connect with some friends by being part of a bible study over Skype where they ""analyze"" the bible.

Let me start out this long post by saying that my Mom means well and loves all three of her children very much. With that, she wants to raise them the best that she knew how and was able to. I wasn't raised poor. We're technically a comfortable middle class so my parents were able to afford giving us amenities that some of my other friends were not able to have. (IE Piano lessons, gaming consoles/devices, our own rooms and bathrooms, three square meals a deal, etc.) 

My parents have given us just about everything with the love that poured out of their hearts. (Part of the reason we were all adopted....the other part was that my brother was killed in the '88 bus wreck in Carrollton, Kentucky by a drunk driver. Understandably, they wanted more children after that.

Anyway, to summarize, I recently moved back in with my parents as my job had recently eliminated my HR position with Sam's Club. They've been helping me a lot and I appreciate everything that they have done. My parents have raised me with the notion that ""You can be anything you want to be so long as you work hard for it"". 

Over time, I began developing and realizing a few of my own preferences. Today, I'm an agnostic democratic homosexual. You can kind of tell where this is going.

Important Note:

When I came out of the closet, she told me that this lifestyle that I had ""chose"" was a sin. She also told me that if you love someone you tell them when they're being ignorant.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, where my dad and I was watching the democratic debate. Naturally, he was smirking and mocking a few things that the candidates had said. He did this to try and prod a reaction from me as he knows all of these factors about me now.  

Following that, my mom entered the room, looked at the TV and called the candidates ""baby killers"".

I didn't know what she meant because I looked at Dad and asked him ""Did one of those candidates really murder a baby? That HAS to be fake news, because then they wouldn't even have a chance at running, right?""

""No, they wouldn't"", he replied.

""Then where does she get this information from?"", I said as we continued to watch the debate.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, the topic of abortion came up. The candidates essentially summarized the topic by saying that it shouldn't be up to the government to dictate a women what she can or can not do with her body because the woman is a person...not a vessel. 

That's when it clicked. Mom wasn't talking about murder. She was talking about abortion.

Oh, but she had more to say. She couldn't' let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

She got in my face and started spouting off to me what the bible says and I had to explain to her that not everyone is a Christian, people may live with different religious standards, and that there's separation of church and state for a reason.  


She  told me that abortion is murder, so I told her that if that were REALLY true then women who get abortions would be sentenced to first degree or second degree murder......which doesn't happen. (Even after the strict laws in Alabama were passed) I also said, ""If abortion is murder, then with that logic a miscarriage would be manslaughter, which isn't the case, is it?""  
I also told her that people who say its murder are only using that as a rhetorical device. then she told me that people don't KNOW right from wrong because they haven't read the bible.  
I told her ""99.99% people KNOW right from wrong, but they just don't care for the consequences. For example, the shooter that shot up the predominately black church KNEW what he did was wrong. That's why he didn't even want a trial. He just wanted the death sentence.""  
And then she told me some other personal not-so-nice things.....eventually I told her that I loved her but that she was brainwashed AND that she lives this ""Christian"" life while fighting for the rights of the rapist instead of the victim. She genuinely believes that it's the women's fault for wanting an abortion after the rapist commits those heinous acts.  
In conclusion, ever since I moved in here, my fuse has been a hell of a lot shorter. My temper is so bad now because i feel like I'm walking on eggshells.  I've been told in the past that if you love someone, you tell them that they're being stupid or ignorant. You don't keep letting them be ignorant. Additionally, I understand that there are certain things that you just have to ""let go"" but when I keep getting berated by statements that aren't even true, I eventually snap. I fear that our differences in politics and lifestyle preferences may result in a rough relationship with my parents and I'm not sure how to cope or what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLRD: Had a verbal altercation with my parents over politics and I'm afraid that it will continue in the future thus ruining our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice from this community would be great! I just want to break down in tears as I'm not sure what I need to do or how I need to act. Do I stab the elephant in the room and risk another argument? (She's already made it clear as hell that they're not going to use their brain, use logic, or listen for that matter.) Do I NOT say anything and make it extremely awkward and just move out in a couple of months only for our relationship to dwindle after not talking to them for months? I don't know."	5	13

The documents include a description of an Oct. 8, 2016, phone call Cohen received from Trump’s campaign communications chief Hope Hicks, during which 'Trump joined the call,' which federal investigators believed was related to an effort to keep porn star Stormy Daniels from going public with her claims of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier.

Hicks was interviewed by the FBI about the phone calls with Cohen, the documents indicate.

The filing by federal prosecutors in New York came a day after the judge in Cohen’s criminal case ordered their release, saying that the end of a probe into those payments meant they should be made public.

This was a 10 second walk and not a big deal. I wasn’t wearing underwear so obviously the front of my shorts weren’t exactly flat, and my mom points this out and says I need underwear (which i was already going to put on) so I responded with “put on a bra” because she walks around without one all the time.

the creator of zelda, has stated that HW takes place in its own separate timeline from the others, and the wiki then states that this means its not canon at all, and so nothing in it actually takes place within the zelda universe, cia doesnt exist, lana doesnt, none of it happened.


this is actual bullshit logic. technically, the other zelda timelines are ALSO OTHER UNIVERSES AND TIMES EXACTLY LIKE HWs, identically, so therefore all games apart from one timeline are non canon with this logic.


so if we use their logic of the timelines, HWs IS actually canon, just as canon as the other timelines, as it itself is a timeline just like them, therefore it all actually happens, including the characters being pulled from their respective timelines to help out, as you've pulled the canonical version of that person from the canon timelines they belong to. since the creator himself has stated it is a timeline/universe within zelda on its own, this MEANS that he has made it officially canonical to the zelda universe, as with the logic of how zelda timelines work it cannot be any other way or you completely destroy its own logic/canon"	4	53

My older sister, Erika, decided that it would be alright because it wasn’t too big, just sightly past her wrists. 

So eventually, we get home and my Mom and Step Dad get after her for wearing a jacket that’s bigger than her normal size. I decide to say that it wasn’t that big and that people often do this because they think it looks good even if others don’t think it would. They say that she shouldn’t be wearing that because it’s way too big for her, little girls should be wearing their own size of clothing because it looks weird to other people, and that her mom should be picking out her outfits. I argue that it doesn’t matter what other people think, it’s not revealing at all, and she just wanted to wear what she thought looked nice on her. They eventually just want to end the argument but then my sister, Giselle, walks in asking what happened and why is my little sister crying so I told her. She agrees with me and my parents just say “stop, we aren’t going to discuss this anymore.” It’s clear to me that they aren’t gonna listen no matter how much I push it so i stop arguing and walk away along with my older sister. 

My question is, Am I The Asshole here?"	11	21

I'm going to make a long story short and just say that I'm going to be starting a very small video series. But I'm looking for different pieces of music for the series.

I currently have a pretty decent catalog of my own music that ranges from Rock to EDM.

But I figure more is better?

Anyways, my ask is

Do you have any instrumental tracks that you'd like to send over for me to possibly use in the series?

Any genre, any style, any tempo, basically anything, I'm more than happy to take a look at and hopefully using in music cues.

If a track isn't mixed and mastered, that's fine, I do mixing and mastering myself, so if it sounds really good, I'd be willing to make a free mix and master for you.

Really looking for upbeat/melodical/happy/energetic/bright songs

I don't know the denomination. For a long time, since I was in middle school, I remember having doubts amd questions and felt uncomfortable in church. I never spoke up about it, but I've had that confusion until I ironically got to a private christian college where I realized christianity just wouldn't work for me. I took classes, I got the knowledge and I just wanted to feel comfortable for once

My family just...refuses to leave me alone. I've had so many things taken from me because its ""too dark"" or its ""demonic"" (one of them was literally a black butler wristband)

I'm now in college. I'm 22 years old and I still deal with these things. I'm a theater tech/design major and I had a prop that I helped make with a summoning circle on it for a new favorite play. It meant so much to me and my mom took it away and its long gone. I just recently got a steven rhodes blanket for my birthday and they're trying to give me an intervention. They're saying my anger is from demons and its like ""No, my anger is from you never leaving me the fuck alone.""

I kept that I was bisexual away from them for so long because I feared the backlash, and I finally felt comfortable to come out but as I predicted, it was met with accusing me of being ""lost"" and ""confused"".

Its like they're in an echo chamber and there's nothing I can say or do that will make them understand or at least TRY to leave their delusional bubble. I thought I could keep things to myself and never bring things up, but they're always trying to get me to go to church or ""become closer with god"". Why can't they just understand that some people don't feel that way? Why do they think something is wrong with me? Why can't they understand that they're pushing me away? I'm literally a grown woman, why can't they just respect my opinions? I wish I could make them talk to someone that wasn't fueling their opinions, but they talk to people just as deep as they are and then I get ganged up on. I never want to come home sometimes.

I really feel like I need help because I'm so tired."	29	19

This has been going on for a few days. I have had an external fixator on for the last 9 months. It has 13 pin sites and all of them have done very well so far. Once I fell and knocked it around and some scar tissue came loose and one of my pins oozed a bit after that, mostly clear yellow fluid. It was extra sore for a few days but it healed.  



Now one of 2 larger pins in my shin is sore and it may not be leaking anything currently but it did overnight, and it’s bright red. The skin immediately around it does look a little red. I have attached a picture, hopefully it’s helpful. The skin around that area is really dry so I apologize for that. https://imgur.com/gallery/8YvjBKE


The skin is not hot to the touch or anything, my leg feels the same temperature as everywhere else. There is some mild pain but honestly it was worse before it leaked anything and it’s not anything I would consider out of the ordinary as my leg hurts a little bit all the time anyway. I don’t have a fever. I have been moving around a lot more lately and I did have to move my leg in a really weird way last night so it could be scar tissue but it looks a little different then last time so I’m worried. This is a much larger and important pin then last time. The one before was a little one on the side and this is one of two major pins holding my leg together. My case is likely to end in amputation either way but I’d like to avoid an infection right before the surgery that will cause me to wait even longer. I have no easy way to go to the doctor right now so if I have to I’ll call an ambulance if it’s really serious but otherwise I can’t get to the doctor right away."	1	1

He led the league four times in passer rating, four times in ANY/A, four times in AY/A, twice in Y/A, three times in Int%, and once in TDs.	132	97

Sometimes it is in response to something I say and sometimes it is irrelevant to the current conversation. Any time I try to counter his statement he enters this feedback loop. His feedback loop either repeats his statement and says you’re wrong, or he says that you misconstrued his point.

I dislike statements when they are completely subjective, yet one view is proposed as a fact. My brother does this often, so I always try to refute those statements. Whenever I do this he alternates between his two feedback loops. As a result, I would get angry and then after a while, blow up at him.

Recently, I have started to just end the conversation before it gets to that point. This is what happens when I attempt to end the conversation.

Me: `“This conversation is over, I’m getting angry.”`    

Brother: `“You get angry too easily, you have anger issues.”`  

Me: `“You are the only person who makes me feel like this.”`  

Brother: `“You still get angry too easily.”`  

Me: `“Shut up.”`  

Brother: `“See, you have anger issues. You need to work on them.”` 

Me: `“Shut the fuck up.”`  

Brother: `“You really are getting worked up over nothing.”`  

Me: `“I’m done. I’m going to my room.”`

Is there any single journalism outlet who is considering the possibility that there are legitimate issues with Biden/Biden's son and also that the President is guilty of something worthy of impeachment?

This kind of thing happens all the time, and I don't understand for the life of me why the answer can't be both.  


It became emails vs. Russia in 2016. Why did NO ONE consider emails AND Russia? Especially considering the results of the Mueller report vs. the [Stonetear](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/546jb9/who_is_stonetear/) stuff here on reddit.

I went to the polls to write in 'none of the above' in 2016 because of all this stuff. I remain thouroughly convinced that this is the primary thing that ails us.

I’ve been in the bath for a long time because I’ve been dreading going to bed with him. 

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him “Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that”. And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said “if you love him so much, why don’t you suck his dick instead of mine”. I couldn’t say anything, I didn’t know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don’t even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it’s going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don’t have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive?

Also I know all of this will sound far made up but I swear to everything I have it is 100% truth.
DM isn't a bad person just a bad DM that got power hungry as fuck and took jokes too far.

Que beginning of summer, around May, me and some friends are at a park when me and DM make a joke retaining to DnD and we soon learn everyone wants to try there hand at a campaign or too. DM says for everyone to make an overpowered character, stats being 18,18,16,14,14,12. Everyone will also be getting a good relic.

Cast:
Me: Moon Druid Elf
DM: Truly Broken Anime protagonist
Kas: Fighter with Sword of Mad

We begin the first few meetings going good, everyone having fun dice rolls aren't shit, but not exactly a set story yet, foreshadowing to say the least, and we are sent on a quest to go through a tomb. There after a scripted character death by Kas and me surviving two finger of deaths back to back, Kas is ressurected by DM's anime waifu, Shera Greenwood for those curious, and literally goes full nice guy to protect her. For an example Kas picked her up whenever she passed out and DM nearly went and had his character attack Kas because ""he should have let him save her."" We then leave the tomb and start Tavern scene.exe.

Now a good thing to note before I continue this campaign is riddle by PC deaths, 1st meeting 2 people died but rolled Nat 20's on both playing a song for god and just straight praying while at the golden gates. My PC for ""dice has chosen"" reasons has died a total of 7, but in game truly only 6 for the 9 death max counter (he installed that after death 4).

Now I'm not the biggest fan of tavern encounters, so I just go to the bar an order a drink, pet my ghost dog (item), and before I could return to my room I am sucked into a 3 hour session of admittedly shitty rolls but unwarranted character locking that ends up with my character being called a pedophile, little girl couldn't find parents it was like 3 o clock in the morning so I said I would buy her a room, this inn had a unwritten rule that if you guy a lady a room your planning on doing the do, and I was thrown in jail to nearly get raped when I went to sleep irl.

After that the sister of the girl reported me to the guard on account of pedophilia and I was then stabbed by Darth Vader and nearly died. What insued was the next four hours of me sitting there watching Kas and another PC getting stomped by an impossible encounter, think pope fight from Shield Hero, where I also died in because I was struck by a rock when I asked a question that ""interrupted the DM.""

When we arrived to the next kingdom me in chains and my armor ruined and we are stopped by yet again another anime reference, the slave trader from shield hero offers me 400 play for the people inside of the carriage I've been dragged behind. It is admittedly not my proudest moment but after being dragged literally for 4 in game days by the people in said carriage and never actually being given money by DM my character accepts. Before the next turn my character is dropped to one by DMPC because unwittingly I sold his Anime Waifu.

Days pass and after learning we can not let the kingdom fall by a Goddess, were gonna get to the title soon I promise, he immediately goes back on that decision and sends us to a new kingdom because the BBEG comes through with his moving war castle that destroys in instantly. Earlier this session I might add my character touched a book, that while it did just take a 9th level call lightning was still standing and got instakilled "" because it contained all of the power of the nine realms in it from continually opening a portal."" 3 hours later of the DM telling me how my PC has been unhelpful and useless to the campaign, and not to make this any longer but I have tried to make my character interesting especially with my artifact but everytine I come up with something it is either shot down by DM or added a negative, we finally get back on track.

We then enter the next kingdom which we are tasked to take down from the inside for ""plot reasons"", actually his reasoning for half of the things we question, and while attending a school, yes school arc of an anime type beat, we are also seemed out for jobs. I am apparently the only druid every seen up here on the floating kingdom so the circus comes and asks for me to be the ring leader. I accept and meeting ends.

Now for the title, as I could not make it to the meeting because irl reasons that everyone is aware of I am randomly called by DM asked if I could make a strength saving throw. I told him I didn't have my dice with me and asked why. His response was don't worry about it and that we will just have someone roll for me. Later that night the joke of my character being raped by both a bear and an elephant comes to my attention because they took a 3 month time skip and didn't know what to do with my character. After an 2 hours of explaining how that was fucked up and I wasn't comfortable with it, DM decides to not go with the joke, yes it was going to be canon until I pleaded with them, and then someone said I was instead now on the run from the circus due to making them out of business for doing all the things they could do and making them irrelevant. So now my character is on the run from the circus and didn't get payed at all.

I know this was long but I do have another campaign to go to now being run by Kas and I can say gladly that he is doing an obsurdly better job. Thanks for listening to this rant, because I needed it."	737	31

There was a friend of hers, an autistic male in his late 20s. So a lot older than me.   
I was eating a chocolat bar. And he was like: Do you need to tell me something?

I was like: Excuse me?

He said: Women eat chocolate because of their menstrual cycle. Awww.

I was flabbergasted. And digusted.  I don't like this biological determinism he excudes. He's a white educated male in his late 20s with a good job. How can a male like that be so dumb to generalize a large segment of the population? I eat chocolate because I damn like it, not because I'm an instinctive animal. 

Oh bonus points, at one point he said that his old male employer advised him to never try to understand women. Because according to that old man, they can't be understood. And this male in his late 20s agreed.   


Is it just me, or is this man pretty aggressive? And irrational? Because of experiences like this I tend to believe that women are a bit smarter than men. But when in anime and series etc someone is depicted as smart, they usually look like him (white male with glasses), so I guess he often gets the benefit of the doubt in his life. It's frustrating that he looks smart, but isn't, while women are smart, but aren't usually depicted as such."	50	57

My issue doesn’t lie with what these people are saying, moreso their methodology. These people do not have the right to walk up to our students to harass them about their beliefs/orientation/sexual habits NOR the right to display very explicit pictures of dead fucking infants. Are you kidding me right now? How is this legal and why should encouraging an environment like this in any way healthy? Being subjected to the name-calling, body-shaming, sex-shaming, moral-shaming is not what I came to this campus to achieve. I understand the reason to have a space to allow people to express their believes, but there are boundaries.

EDIT: All y’all crying about free speech are still missing the point. I do not want to limit what they are saying, I want to limit the dead baby pics, thanks!

FINAL EDIT: You don’t need to be graphic to make a point. This protest is unnecessary for that simple fact, and highlights an issue regarding protesting here and it’s effect on our student body. If you have to resort to shock to make your point, it’s not a very valid argument. I have emailed the dean of students addressing the issue, but if anyone has any constructive ideas about how to approach this, just dm me. Thank you."	107	143

I've taken out the middle seat in the 2nd row to make it easier to get into the third row so I only have 6 seatbelts as required.  I drive in a college town and so far probably 1/3+ of my UberXL requests have had more than 6 passengers.  One last night had probably 10-12 wanting to get in.  

I'm really hesitant to allow groups to downsize as it's resulted in the majority of my 1 stars driving my car for UberX, but at the same time UberXL pickups are frequently longer away and it's really annoying to drive 5-10 minutes, wait 3-4 minutes for them to come out, then only receive a $3.75 cancel fee.  

I'm curious what other UberXL drivers do and if they're having this many requests with more than 6 passengers.  I've thought about texting a message beforehand reminding them that UberXLs are for a maximum of 6 passengers.  Anyone else tried anything like this with success or have best practices?"	25	42

They wanted to visit around France and asked if I wouldn’t mind joining them on the trip to show them around since i speak fluent French and they don’t. My sister’s a little high maintenance so we decided hotel was better then airbnb. To save money we decided to all share one hotel room. I researched and booked a room for 3 cities we’re going to, for two double beds. Twin beds and other usual hotel configurations wouldn’t fit. The total bill was around $1200 so I split it by 3 and asked my sister to transfer me back $800 for her and BIL. She later texted me saying they should only pay $600 since she and BIL are sharing one double bed, and I have my own bed. 

WTF? This seems cheapskate to me and ridiculous. I wouldn’t even be traveling to France from Switzerland if they didn’t ask me to show them around, taking vacation days off. I’m not even asking them to chip in for my train ticket to France. Is it so much to go Dutch on hotel rooms? It seems really petty to split by bed. 

WIBTA if I say no to split by half? 

Edit: I told my sister I don’t see the situation like her and i feel she’s nickeling and diming me. The hotel is a common space more than two double beds units. If she would like me to join, and wants to split by bed, my BIL can take the bed and we sisters can share a bed. They can pay collectively $900, me $300. We can also get an airbnb and split it by 3 evenly. If they’d like to continue split by bedcount, the trip has gotten too expensive for me

We were arguing and he go up and went into his bedroom. I stood at the door and kept talking, trying to get him to understand my point, and he started to get really aggravated and stopped reacting/responding to me. I got angry he just shit down like a child and didn’t want to discuss, and made a smart comment, basically something along the lines of, “You can’t call yourself a man if you can’t even talk like an adult.” I went to walk away, and sort of drug my hand across the door frame, and he slammed the door shut, catching myself middle finger and fracturing the tip. 

Afterwards I cried, but he thought I was just crying because I was upset and I ended up leaving and driving myself to urgent care. He did apologize to me and said it was an accident and it wouldn’t happen again, and I accepted it. But when I retold the story to my family, they weren’t having it. My sister argued that he should have heard my hand scraping the wall, my mom argues that he shouldn’t have slammed the door at all, and my father argues that if he cared about me, he wouldn’t have just let me sit in the living room crying and then let myself out.

I urge you all to go sit in a game of ground war. Every other game will have 1 or 2 PC players on top with 60-90 kills and 0-3 deaths. Why? Well because cheats are already on the market for this game and I'm done with cheaters as of a decade ago. I suggest everyone on console turn off cross-platform and leave it that way. Master race to create an unfair environment is all I see.



*Edit: Before the fanbois start drooling, I am also a PC gamer. This is NOT the first game to have cheats or rampant cheating but to say ""i dun c problem"" at this point probably just points to you being a cheater. So go ahead and argue with me, I'll keep laughing at you.

*Edit2.5: Even without hacking there is a disparity of even and fair gameplay between PC and console. Field of view, higher frames and different peripherals give PC an all around out of the gate advantage. This aside, I am aware not every lobby is full of hackers, and I never said it doesn't happen to console, it just usually takes a LOT longer to mod consoles than program a simple ESP.  

While I game on all 3 as of right this minute I am very much an advocate of flipping the switch and saying goodbye to PC. But I'm glad a majority of you completely zone in on one thing, shows me the different mindsets. Some of you have said you've seen hacking and it doesn't bother you, some are totally against it. I don't ever condone cheating. It's not something I will personally choose to be around and I only wish to have a positive experience... That means getting stomped by legitimate players and crying to myself like a good sport would.

I have a lot of tattoos. My most recent tattoo is a tattoo that I designed with my husband. We got matching ones for our anniversary. It is super personal. 

As I was showing it off to my friends, I notice one girl in our group (who I’m not super close to) was really into it. She even took a picture of it which I thought was strange but I let it slide. 
Let’s call this girl Sarah. 

Sarah does not  have any tattoos that I know of, if she does they are really small and in unnoticed places. So a week or so later I hear through the grape vine that Sarah is trying to get a copy of my tattoo. honestly I suspected this. She told a couple of friends of mine the design, and for some reason, didn’t think that they would tell me. But here comes the crazy part, she comes to me and asks me for a recommendation for an artist. She specifically wanted one that wasn’t too expensive.

I asked her what she was going to get. She was really coy with me and told me that she had not finished thinking about it yet. So I recommend the worst tattoo “artist” I know, let’s call him Bubba. I’ve gotten two “joke” tattoos from Bubba, one is terrible and blown out ,but it’s okay because it’s that duck or rabbit optical illusion. The other one I have had covered up. He works at subway during the day and gives tattoos from his garage. 

I knew she wouldn’t do her proper research and check him out, and she didn’t. She went and got her cheap tattoo from Bubba, and it is *fucked. up* It’s already blown out, the lines aren’t straight,  and may be infected.  My husband and I are howling about this, but a few friends of mine think what I did was really messed up. She’ll be ok, she’ll just have a really really shitty version of my tattoo. I think it’s what she deserves. So let me know reddit, AITA?"	21581	1655

I’m a conservative. I don’t agree with everything Whitmer and the rest of our government have imposed on us. But I’m not dumb, I’m not selfish. I haven’t left my house in 5 weeks. I’m disappointed with all those of a different political view than mine trashing all of the Michigan conservatives. 

Those who went and protested in Lansing WERE idiots. As an American, we have the right to protest and free speech. There was a right way to go about this and they obviously did not do it that way. It’s sad that this was made into a political rally as it was clearly a rally of idiots. 

Now, why does that give liberal the right to trash all conservatives? WE’RE ALL MICHIGANDERS. The majority of people I know have followed the orders as best they can just as I’m sure most of the people I don’t know have. There are almost 10 million people in Michigan. Don’t let a couple thousand idiots not wearing PPE or practicing social distancing form your opinion on conservatives.

It is very hard to raise kids, especially when they're young and cry and nobody is sleeping good. We're both tired all the time but we keep soldiering on. Have had tons of arguments in the last 6 months, screaming at each other, ready to divorce but thinking it'll be better once our youngest isn't so needy.

Tonight I'm trying to get my 3 year old to take a bath but she doesn't want to for some reason, and is crying so I dropped it. But my wife is now freaking out and launching into the whole 'I had to work all day and you only get the kids riled up when I'm trying to watch TV and I have to do EVERYTHING around this house and I never get a break RAAAAA' that I'm sure many of you have experienced.

She calls me lazy, because I spent an hour watching the nfl draft last night. Usually I don't get so things on my own without her freaking out that I don't pull my weight. I do at least at much as she does, I'm a great dad. But she still starts attacking every time and I argue right back because she's so fucking wrong. How do I handle this better? It's so hard not to tell her she's an idiot and she's freaking out over nothing."	16	50

I use Corsair's proprietary software that controls my AIO's fan speed, pump speed, and temp curve. When I play Valorant, my CPU temp is very low. I thought this was due to the game not being resource intensive, but my room would quickly turn into a sauna. So, I looked into it a little bit. My fan and pump speeds are running on MAX when I play Valorant, and there is no way to change it since Vanguard is actively blocking that software. I want to continue playing Valorant, but I don't see how I can, since its a risk to my hardware.	7	14

Me and my friends would joke about them and we’d laugh at all the memes about them too. When my boyfriend told me he was a furry...I wanted to break up with him right then and there (very Ironic Ik) But before I found out, I thought he was cute, funny, and so sweet. He still is. It’s just when I found out it ruined everything. He told me about his “fursona” and how he was a fox...and how he wants a tail 😩. I actually believe he is delusional. But I just rly like him as a person. He does have his cringe moments...yea he has a lot of those. Tbh I want nothing to do with this furry nonsense and if he ever wore some embarrassing furry outfit I’d walk away from him. Don’t get me wrong, I rly like him...but it’s just this furry shit I don’t fuck with. It’s to the point I want to tell him..but I don’t know what to say or how to put it.	1	0	1.0

In my experience they are not nearly as bad as 1's or 3's. In my experience 8's mind their own business and don't bother others unlike 1's and 3's who want to rearrange your life. Any feedback/thoughts are welcome.	https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/gfvh8t/why_are_people_seemingly_afraid_of_enneagram_type/	"I hear intimidating get mentioned a lot when it comes to E 8 but it hasn't been the pattern I've noticed. I'm a 4, and 8's tend to leave me alone. I think the only time an 8 is a problem is if you provoke them first. There seems to be a misconception out there that 8's are proactive and go out looking to cause trouble but I don't think this is true. In fact, 8's seem to not like unnecessary problems and navigate the world with their own agenda and leave others alone until they stand in the 8's way of getting what they're after. Or god forbid you harm someone they care about. 

But aside from that I don't see how they're scary. I don't mean to bash all 1's or 3's either but in my experience, the pattern I've noticed tends to be extremely judgmental behavior from the 1's and 3's, compared to the 8. To me this is more troubling and intimidating, they want to rearrange you even if you don't want them to. 1's can be angry also and verbally trash a person and cut them down in my experience yet they aren't often called intimidating and the 8 is. 

I think 8's have been scapegoated somehow. Maybe people believe someone in their life is an 8 and they dont like that person so they assume all 8's are that way, when it's likely the person wasn't an 8 to begin with (Statistically 8's are not that common).  Or maybe they just read the stereotypes and again just put E 8 and ''Bad person'' as synonymous terms. 

Anyway I just thought I'd talk about this some things I've noticed. Any types feedback are welcome I'm interested."	80	70	0.86

Plus this forum has not really had a lot of action today so instead of being bored, decided I'd contribute. Maybe I've had too much coffee between patients. 

What about the phrases that other doctors or staff say that really grind your gears or get your blood boiling besides the usual antivax stuff, chronic lyme, end stage fibro.....

I'll start with a few

1. saying or documenting maculopapular rash (gets derms blood boiling every time)

2. Saying it like ""alz-timers""

3. Social.Admit. Just say it up front and don't dance around it ER docs. I get it, the K is 0.1 below normal and the creatinine is 0.000001 higher than last time and they look dry. Just hit me with it. Social.Admit.

4. Reading any ophthalmology note as not an ophthalmologist. Those guys and gals are one step away from using emojis only in their notes.

5. **directed at med records from other offices** Do you really need my records STAT from my clinic for an office visit for your patient 3 weeks from now. Stop putting stat on all your damn records request.

Frankly, you all are simply unbelievable. I have done everything in my power to express myself as the kind hearted man I am. Everyday I work towards improving the quality of life in this town by approaching life solution orientated, yet everyday I am continually met with such headstrong opposition from moronic bufoons such as yourself.


Tell me, what drives you all to such stupidity? Were you born with a walnut sized brain, capable of processing only the most basic of commands? Was it because your mother drank too much alcohol in anticipation of having to deal with you? Was it other drugs that caused you to develop such a level of mental retardation? Or is it instead that you're purposefully like this just to annoy me? Are you such sick twisted bastards that your only form of enjoyment is bullying good souls such as me? 


Perhaps it's the likelier candidate, jealousy. I wouldn't be surprised if most of you were jealous at what I've managed to accomplish in my lifetime. I'm a walking, living, breathing example of the American Dream. I mean, I have everything you all could ever want! And most of you are nothing more than idealistic muscians and painters, following a train off its rails and acting like everything is perfectly fine.


I don't understand how you can be so ignorant as to think what it is you do is more important than work that actually means things. To waste and wallow away your days drawing and singing for nickels abd dimes is utterly deplorable. I'm legitimately sorry for those of you in such a position. But, how you could turn it around and tell me I am the one wallowing in misery is inconceivable. I have what you don't, what you never will, yet you act like your passion is enough to give you a meaningful life. You act as if money is something tp be abhorred along with common sense. I just don't, and frankly never will understand such imbecilic behavior.


Those of you who are more sensibly minded, I cannoy believe the level of disrespect you have treated me with. Muscians and other idealistics will of course shun any position that is even vaguely materialistic, yet you others also act as though I am a villain. And the reason? Me expressing my freedom of speech! 


The day what I say and how I say it are reasons to insult me will be a sad day, and the day is today. I have not worked so hard and for so long just to be continually berated and insulted by fools such as you all. I have worked harder and longer than all of you combined, and yet you treat me like dogshit. You treat me like I'm to be wiped away on a welcome mat.


You all will never know what it is like to be me, and for you all to act like you should have a say in my life is undeniably ignorant. I'm the one who has lived my life, not you. I have reached this level of success by my hand, not by any of your hands. Now, when i am so generous as to offer my advice, you cretins deny it! How am I to be viewed as the charitable person I am when I cannot give basic charity without and argument? You all believe my intentions are false and I merely come to argue, yet you are wrong. You are wrong to the ninth degree.


I don't have to say what I say, but I do. I don't have to keep saying it in the face of such attitudes, but I still do. And that is because this is important to me. This town is, believe it or not, important to me. I truly, with what's left of my heart, care for it. I want to see this town turn around. It is very difficult to do so when you all insist I am not. Just because I approach things more directly than you snowflakes doesn't mean I'm an asshole, counter to what society is saying. Sure, I'm an office worker who works for some corporate franchise, but I still live here.


Just, the idiocity radiating from this town on a daily basis is inconceivable. We've had unqualified teachers, inept government, and an incapable police force. Do you truly believe these aren't problems? Do you all truly despise me so much that you let these things continue? The fact that after a few months these issues are not even being *addressed* should say something about the change that needs to occur in our town.

Yet you all squabble with me, driveling and babbling about your useless and idiotic nonsense. How selfish can one town be? I wake up and am shocked at the new answer to this question. I shouldn't have to be saying these things, yet I do because you all are so thick skulled. How do you even hear with a skull so thick? Truly, I believe you haven't heard a word I've ever said to you and just saw me and hated what I said automatically. 

You're all blind sheep, following a shepherd into a slaughterhouse. You're all fish swimming in the middle of the ocean, waiting to be taken. You're all ignorant villagers, listening to some witch doctor to tell you what to do. You're all just so disappointing. That I have to wake up here every morning is the greatest disappointment a man can face."	171	81	0.96

Person 1 makes an inflammatory statement that strongly challenges another's views. Person 2 (the target of the statement) will take the bait and respond, often in a defensive manner as they feel attacked (they were, that was the point of the initial statement). Person 1, elated with themselves, smugly ridicules person 2 and calls them fragile to shut them down. Person 2 wants to respond, but if they defend themselves, person 1 will claim this is proof of their fragility. If they don't reply, person 1 will claim they've won the argument.

This is such a cheap way of scoring meaningless points. Nothing is gained here. No meaningful discussion is had, no views are changed. If anything, all that happens is person 2 ends up with a stronger negative attitude towards people who align themselves with person 1's views, increasing polarisation. 

The goal should be to win over people that hold opposing views with rational argument, patience and understanding. Ridiculing doesn't work, especially not online. I personally feel like a large percentage of social media users needs to take a few deep breaths, stop focusing on 1upping each other with meaningless, toxic argument and focus on commonalities that bring us together rather than militantly pointing out differences that cause frustration and division. Wishful thinking lol.

Edit: It appears in principle this view is quite popular, but in practice I see the dismissive technique I described used all the time, making it arguably popular, which is why I posted here.

Edit: Perhaps I should have used the word provoking instead of offending in the title. Agree with comments about claiming offence being used as a way to shut down meaningful discourse."	35341	2026	0.81

I was walking through the neighborhood and passed my former watering hole where a bartender who I’ve become friends with over the years was outside serving patio customers. We stopped and talked and he immediately commented that I looked like I was a lot healthier and in shape than I was when he last saw me before quarantine. 

Now, I’m not at all “ashamed” of my sobriety or even the problem drinking that led me to it, but I am big on making this my own personal journey and it being nobody else’s business, if that makes sense. I want to be known simply as DancyElephant12, not DancyElephant12 the recovering alcoholic. 

So, I responded to Dan by saying that I’ve just been doing a lot of running lately and that must be why I’m looking healthier. He smiled slyly and said “is that all?”. I asked what he meant and he asked if I had quit a “certain something” recently. I guess as a bartender at a Cheers type bar, he’s had plenty of experience witnessing the nuances and characteristics of every phase of many alcoholics, so I wasn’t the first regular he’s seen go dry. 

I admitted that yes, I am sober but told him not to worry, I’d still come by for food and make sure he got his normal generous tips. He laughed and said he was happy for me and to keep up the good work. He knows my friend group and the industry I work in (restaurant) and how difficult it might be to remain sober, but it feels good to have an ally on the other side of the bar so that ordering my tonic and limes disguised as vodka sodas for my next group outing won’t be so difficult.

Anyways, I have about 3.5 months now and this little experience gave me another tiny boost of validation which always helps in these early months while I’m still trying to establish and come to terms with my identity as someone who doesn’t drink. I know I know, I shouldn’t be seeking the validation of others in this matter, especially my local bartender, but I considered this a step in the right direction for my sober psyche.

Anyways, just wanted to share this small little anecdote because I enjoy reading all of your experiences daily and they’ve helped me get by. Thanks and IWNDWYT."	411	36	1.0

They are given different pronouns depending on which version of the anime or manga you've seen/read. In the original Japanese, they refer to themselves as ""boku"", which is seen as slightly more masculine but is often used informally by any gender. 

They were not given a gender by their creator, and although some interpret this as them being nonbinary (or even genderfluid), others believe it's an invitation to assign Crona a gender based on their needs or preference. 

I personally think both viewpoints are correct, though I'd like to hear others' opinions on the matter. What gender do you think Crona is, if any? Is it acceptable for Crona to be a symbol of LGBTQ+ representation in anime, or is this simply a character with no gender (including agender)?"	3	10	0.62

Or did everyone just forget what a Legacy game is?	https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ipdgo2/am_i_crazy_or_did_everyone_just_forget_what_a/	"I really think I'm going crazy. Everywhere I turn in my local community people have a weird misconception of legacy games that drives me a little bonkers.

I have been having a lot of difficulty explaining to a few people around me what a legacy game is, it'd be easier if I could just play them with my friend and show them but all the ones I have access to are 3+ players. (I got Machi Koro Legacy recently but that was a bad copy that the stickers had come off in packaging and ruined the player boards.)

But even then, the store owner who's my friend (from before she opened her store) believes that legacy games are campaign games. We got into a minor argument over this ""even something like Gloomhaven is a legacy game.""

My response: ""no it isn't.""

""It has legacy components on a technicality."" 

""No it doesn't. Not at all. It's a campaign game. And those stickers you use are entirely aesthetic and have zero gameplay effects really. It says so in the rulebook.""

To which we went back and forth. But she is also under the impression that legacy games are one and done. That after you finish the ""story"" that you don't play it anymore as that's the end of the campaign...

And it drives me nuts! I know it's a minor gripe but every person I talk to about it legit believes that Legacy games are just campaign games and nothing else.

Am I the one that's crazy? 

After I finish playing Clank Legacy (whenever that gets in) I have my own copy of clank now. Which my friend like refuses to understand ""you can add the expansions to clank legacy?"" ""Yes! I told you this!"" ""I'd like to see how you can have gameplay expansions to a campaign.""

Even after I explained to them like seven times that it is juat an evolving game that gives you a unique copy of the game at the end.

Like.

Has the definition of Legacy changed? I played the og Risk Legacy as a store copy when it came out and it made me fall in love with the concept. I have a respect and wholehearted love for the systems that legacy games create. 

But even games like Aeon's End Legacy seem to miss the point of a legacy game. Where as that you play through a campaign and then build out to the normal base game state... which is... antithetical to legacy game design.

Idk.

Just someone please help me. I feel like I'm the only one who has a completed legacy game that I still bring out to play with friends since it's just a unqiue board game I own that nobody else does."	0	56	0.16

They are both Indian and the Indian community set themselves up together. 

I knew one of the guys that dated her, and together they made videos to upload on pornhub. (This guy does this a lot he has a bunch of girls on his profile) They hid their faces, but you can tell its them just by body type. Also too they were uploaded by the same as his IG account. 

I told my buddy he flipped out and dumped her in a huge way. I think what was crazy was she tried to tell him she was a virgin too... It got around that he knew about the videos and that I told him. Now people are mad at me, just people that were mutual friends with the girlfriend. Saying I am the problem. 

that I as a Mexican guy should have no say in this? That Indian culture is bad enough. I don't know what to say here? Like I wouldn't want to marry a woman that claims to be a virgin and has this as a past. I don't know who does Indian or any other race."	24	84	0.64

I have my own hair salon and married my bf of 6 years, Bob(also fake).

 Ana usually hangs out with me in the salon when she is off work, she mentioned she hasn’t done her hair in a while and I proposed to do it charge free. She said that she was okay with it as long as I closed the blinds and Bob doesn’t enter the salon while she isn’t wearing her hijab (he usually comes by after hours to help me close). I texted Bob before hand to not come by and closed down the blinds. Bob seemed annoyed but he promised he wouldn’t come by tonight. 

I started doing Ana’s hair, we put on some music and we were talking and singing while I trimmed and combed her hair. But guess who enters through the salon’s door? Bob. Ana started looking for her hijab while I started screaming at Bob for breaking his promise, he said that it was not that big of a deal and that we should grow up.Ana left upset and in a rush as me and Bob kept arguing. 

Bob said he can enter my salon as he pleases and that Ana is just another client, I told him to leave and I closed the salon myself. I called Ana and she said that I have betrayed her trust for not locking the door, I apologized and explained that I didn’t want to put her in that position. AITA for not making sure it was okay for her to take off her hijab?"	2498	527	0.97

The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.
Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

Since no one on the street opens until 10 we aren’t getting our mail or packages (even tho our post man says he StuffIt in our door) we have complained a few times but the highest person we get is his depot supervisor who says “she can’t contractually ask him to come during business hours” basically it sounds like he enjoys being done work at 9 and it seems to be his right. When I call Canada Post they say he can not deliver before 9 am. CP mail delivery must be between 9 and 5. I e asked the post man if he can come at 9 and I’ll come early to work. He lost his shit and told me the days I get my mail is from the kindness of his heart and that I can complain all I want because a schedule change will “never happen” rudeness aside ..I feel really stuck.

Tonight's debate between the incumbent, President [Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) (R) and challenger, former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden](https://joebiden.com/) (D), will be moderated by [Chris Wallace](https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/chris-wallace) and co-hosted by [Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/debate) and held at the Health Education Campus (HEC) in Cleveland, OH.

The debate will be divided into six segments of approximately 15 minutes each on major topics to be selected by the moderator and announced at least one week before the debate. (Topics listed below)

The moderator will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Candidates will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic.

All debates will be moderated by a single individual and will run from 9:00-10:30 p.m. Eastern Time without commercial breaks. As always, the moderators alone will select the questions to be asked, which are not known to the CPD or to the candidates. The moderators will have the ability both to extend the segments and to ensure that the candidates have equal speaking time. While the focus will properly be on the candidates, the moderator will regulate the conversation so that thoughtful and substantive exchanges occur. ^^[source](https://www.debates.org/2020/09/02/cpd-announces-2020-debate-moderators/)

---

**Tonight's debate topics will include, in no particular order:**

* The Trump and Biden Records
* The Supreme Court
* Covid-19
* The Economy
* Race and Violence in our Cities
* The Integrity of the Election

The format for the first debate calls for six 15-minute time segments dedicated to topics announced in advance in order to encourage deep discussion of the leading issues facing the country. ^^[source](https://www.debates.org/2020/09/22/moderator-announces-topics-for-first-presidential-debate-2/)

The roommate really wanted to sell the house, so she could move on with her life, but daughter didn't. So one day I fell into a conversation with roommate, so was very emotionally distraught. I didn't want to take sides, since the situation was none of my business. However, roommate was VERY distraught, so to end this uncomfortable conversation I suggested to the roommate that she consult a lawyer. Roommate then consulted a lawyer, which resulted in them selling the house. So now daughter is very angry at me for talking to the roommate. I wasn't trying to interfere. AITA?	2196	149	0.97

I've seen this happen a few times now and I haven't even been subscribed to this sub that long. Earlier today I replied to another lady saying how, the first time she used a dildo, she didn't get anything out of it. I commented to basically say *same*. Not one, but two dudes had to reply to me saying pretty much:

1) women must get pleasure from penises because otherwise vaginas wouldn't be shaped like that

2) women get pleasure from all kinds of things, nobody really knows what goes on down there

And I'm like, can these people shut the fuck up and listen for once? Like, there's two women talking among themselves, and you can be certain they're not saying shit to hurt your feelings because they don't even know you're reading. Why do you have to insert yourself in their conversation and go *but muh evolution* or *aCsHUalLy the female orgasm is a mystery*. It's a mystery to you, my man. I know perfectly well what makes me come, and a dick alone sure ain't it.

You'd think that men who follow this sub (I'm assuming these men follow this sub because the post in question wasn't popular enough to have hit /r/all) do so because a) they're familiar with female anatomy and wanna have a chuckle just like us, or b) they're interested in learning. But then something doesn't align with their worldview and oh boy, do they throw a tantrum.

It's nuts because I wouldn't dream of heading over to /r/badmensanatomy and acshually them with my misconceptions. I might try one day. Go over there and tell them I believe men should reach orgasm by rubbing their fingertips or the tip of their tongue because those are the body parts that give *me* an orgasm, so that must be how it works, surely. If they're confused, I'll tell them male pleasure is such a mystery nobody knows for sure.

Male lurkers: if a woman says something about her own pleasure that makes you insecure, either believe her and learn or ignore and jog on. She knows better than you.

**Edit** Somebody reported me as suicidal ([proof](https://imgpile.com/i/uVo6sL)) and, I gotta tell you, out of all the comments and private messages I've received, this is by far the funniest thing this post has brought about. Like, I saw it at work and I couldn't stop laughing, picturing an angry dude, so angry and so powerless that all he could think of was reporting me for being suicidal. If it was done in earnest, I appreciate the concern I guess?, but I'm swell."	19915	3126	0.84

It didn’t go bad, but it didn’t go well either

For a little bit of background info, I’m a college freshman who had been in denial since 7th grade. Recently over the past few months I’ve slowly accepted myself and finally went to university counseling services to figure out how to come out. My parents are also fairly liberal and progressive, so I decided to take the leap of faith

So I decided today I would do it, and I did

What resulted was a lot of invalidation and ignorance. My mom went on to tell me about how I’ve shown zero signs throughout my life and that (these are her words) “transgender people are always clawing to try on their moms clothes, you didn’t do that.” And also went on to say “gay people always show signs that they’re gay, you haven’t shown anything” and “dad and I are liberal but this is over the top even for us.” Now I have to prepare to go home this upcoming weekend and expect a lot of changes, one of the big ones she mentioned being “any chances of med school or grad school are shot up, you screwed that over by doing this. This falls into one of those serious psychological categories so you probably won’t get any decent jobs either.” 

It finally ended with her saying she and my dad are both broken and humiliated with her saying “what are we supposed to do, tell people our son is a lesbian?” 

I could truly use any amount of help or support right now, things feel very uncertain and I don’t know what to do

He says he doesn't feel scared of arguing as people seem to assume, but he finds them debilitating to be in. 

He said on the emotional scale; ""I just don't like being around angry people, who can't control the volume of their voice, and act like they're going to punch me in the face over a misunderstanding.""

I agreed with that. I don't like that either. 

He went on to point out though what he believed was his biggest problem. I'm paraphrasing slightly, but he more or less said; 

&amp;#x200B;

""Honestly it's the length. Most arguments should be done with in the first minute. Person A starts the argument. Person B gives their response. That should be the end of it. If Person A is being a jerk, then B should just walk away instead of getting drawn into it. My problem with arguments is I don't give a shit about having the last word, and everyone else clearly does for some stupid reason, and it just turns into 5 and a half minutes of my life that I'll never get back. If I leave a DVD out by accident and get confronted over it, when I say I'm sorry it was an accident. That's the truth. I feel bad, and it was an accident. The other person therefore should accept that and move on, not give me a two minute lecture on how I need to be more respectful of people's things.""

Was getting lawnscaping quotes from companies to help with my fall yard clean up. My backyard is big and I wanted accurate prices, so invited them to assess in person. Most companies were cordial and visited to provide me a quote quickly.

At 830pm last night, I got a message from one of the companies asking if their guy ever came by with a price. I explained that their company was the only one I had not seen that day. He kept asking for the price, and I explained I never got a price from his company. 

He said he sent over ""his guy"" to assess and quote. I told him, I never saw HIS guy. He then starts to explain his guy met with ""a man and came up with (an unreasonably low price)"" I respond explaining they went to the wrong house. He starts to try and defend ""I gave him your address, and it's ok. He spoke with the man of the house.""

""There IS no man of the house. If he didn't talk to me, then he went to the wrong property."" He starts listing off a price that wouldn't cover my front yard, let alone both yards. ""Sir, your guy is lying or he legit went to the wrong house. Either way, I don't appreciate you assuming that someone else was taking care of this for me, like you have someone taking care of this for you.""

He finally apologized and said there must have been a mix-up. I acknowledged and reinforced that they should be talking only to the exact person that enlisted their services unless clearly told otherwise. 

They're not getting the job simply due to this basic AF misogyny.

One of my bosses has recommended that I become a manager, however, another of my bosses has been treating me quite differently.

Often times, I'm working by myself in my department, and am able to finish my mandatory work well before I need to leave, but this being a retail job, and with me by myself, I'm hesitant to do anything that would keep me from the counter for a while, so I take a seat/lean on something where I can see if any customers are coming, but comfortable enough so that I can read stuff or whatever on my phone.

The boss I have a problem with will come by to check on me every half an hour on shifts that we have together, and if she doesn't see me doing something right then and there, she'll look around the department for anything for me to do for about 10 minutes, and list off a bunch of tasks that I can get done in 5. I honestly feel like she's wasting both of our times just so she can harass me, but I wanna know if I'm alone on this.

Am I the asshole?

Edit 1: I feel like I should clarify this because I don't think the point is coming across to most of the people that are replying. I'm not just sitting there the entire shift. Even if she doesn't come along, I'm still getting up every so often (maybe 5 to 10 minutes), scan the department and the shelves I stock to see if there's anything to do. If something looks like it should be cleaned, I'll clean it, and I still do what my boss says. The problem I have arises when my boss comes in, looks at all the hard work I've done, and because she catches me at a moment where, at that specific time, I'm not doing anything, she has me walk around the department with her and take a fine toothed comb to every surface, and if there's something just slightly off to her, she'll say to fix it."	13	49	0.81

One of the words was ""Chanukah"". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to ""Hanukkah"". She said to my daughter ""you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?"" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.

I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.

The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.

My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday."	29543	2322	0.96

There is no note of anything regarding to the landlord being able to evict I think aside from the usual not paying rent on time / trashing the place / whatever. One unique thing about this property is it is actually a house split into two units, an upper unit which is a business (adult family home), and a lower unit which is for living. The new owner who just bought the property and business has asked us to leave by the end of May as she works for the business (as owner) and says that because it's a business, she has the right to live in the building and our lease is invalid. She says that our lease was essentially invalid in the first place as the space was never meant to be rented out. 

I think this is bullshit though, to my knowledge leases are legally binding and a a transfer of property would transfer everything about the property including legally binding contracts like leases. I don't really know what to do though, the new owner is really pushing this hard. I am willing to fight her on this, I really don't want to move just half a year into the lease. I've reviewed the contract and it says nothing about a lease expiring on transfer of ownership. Please help, don't know what to do."	5	14	0.86

This might be useful in helping locate possible parks by drawing a 7 mile radius from any landmark. Anything in that circle is fair play according to the solved puzzles. Anything else has much less of a possibility of working.  
A majority of the image matches are much closer than 7 miles, and up to a few feet from the casque. The Cleveland terminal tower and the Chicago Water tower are the two furthest.   
This is also important to remember when considering that a true image match does not equal proof of the location of the casque. At best, it can narrow it down tremendously"	18	64	0.71

I'm not going to get political here but I will say there are certain channels out there that claim to be the opposite of those people that whine about everything, you know what I mean like those people who always whine? the people who find problems with everything? yet some of those channels that are against them do the exact same thing, and those channels will crucify the game for thinking it's censored and they will claim a bunch of ""sjws ruining gaming"" stuff so I want to warn? yeah I guess that's the right word, I want to warn you all about this because there will be a good number of people just trashing on the game.

I just wanted to warn everyone so that when it may happen well you'll already know and I know it won't affect or hurt the game but these channels have a big crowd and they will trash on the game and throw words like SJW and woke around at it over thinking it's censored and that will cause a bad outlook on the game from their crowd, again I know it won't hurt the game but people will get the wrong idea about the game, although most people aren't like them so like I said the game will be fine.

I certainly don't think this game is censored and multiple Diablo fans i've seen agree it's not, no underboob? so? and no Amazon behind hanging out? so what? look I get that it didn't need to be changed but them changing it doesn't make it ""sjw"" or ""WOKE"" like Mortal Kombat 11 was accused of being censored and then months later we now have classic female outfits which one of those Female skin packs has major skin being revealed and Sindel has a a majorly revealing outfit that's abit new, the game was never censored it's just that Netherealm simply changed the designs of the characters and it's the same with this game, now I know MK11 is not a remaster or remake and that it's a sequal so changing outfits and designs isn't has big of a deal? but still in D2R it's just design changes and someone thought Andariel was censored because she has her original chain things on her breasts, I know not everyone will know of the original designs and that's fine but a simple google search will show that Andariel was never like completely nude, close to it though"	14	129	0.63

I get mad on how lineant my parents educate him, unlike how they did to me and my older brother, and how my younger brother gets all the things he wants easily, when i was his age, when my parents say No, its a no. We deal with heartbreaks for not getting what we want and toughen up the next day. But to him they are so linent, it gets to my nerve sometimes how they just keep quiet when he talked back to my parents, like how the heck is this even fair? 

I argue with my aprents A LOT because of this and how easily he gets out after making a mistake, and i will ALWAYS compare on how they treated me and how they treat him now. I just feel it's so unfair that they are always backing him up. It really gets on my nerve.

Recently, he wanted to buy some rubic cubes. We have bought for him a lot of LEGOs (worth hundreds of bucks if we collected them all) and a rubic cube before, but he can never take care of them, all those pieces can be found everywhere and even outside of the house. I remember when i was young, i couldn't take care of my puzzles and stuffs and my parents literally stopped buying them for me. So i told my little brother to learn to take care of the things he has first and later he can buy them, and I mentioned how our parents treated me when i couldn't take care of my things, he stomped off pulled a sour face and next thing i know my mom says I'm always breaking his heart and asked me to stop comparing(?)

The blame for this month’s bloodshed lies solely at the feet of Hamas and those who supports and finance this terrorist. 

Those who wish to divert attention from Hamas’s war crimes would like to blame the latest conflict on a complicated legal dispute in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood. But this was a private matter between Jews who have a property deed from the 1800s and the residents of four homes who have refused to pay rent. This cannot be framed as ‘ethnic cleansing’. It is little more than a landlord-tenant squabble. It should have been a matter for the local courts, but instead this small-time event wound up in an appeal at the supreme court, and hit the press. Hamas quickly saw an opportunity.

Hamas does not care where these missiles land. This Islamist terror group is dangerous for our people: we cannot continue to be a conduit for their work. 

Hamas is not fighting for a human rights cause; they are committing war crimes to boost their political standing."	0	55	0.44

It was a straight 25 mins of them telling each other to go off themselves and that they had no friends ect... absolutely no helpful information was exchanged between these two players, and I think, that the rest of the team should have the option to take that line of communication away in a competitive game of league. You go into ranked games with the understanding that everyone is making and earnest effort to win the game, but how can that be the case when you are wasting your efforts trying to find the most creative way to tell someone to go kill themselves. This by definition is the case because 1% of brain power you are dedicated to flaming somone is 1% you aren't using to focus and win the game, But also there is a reason why you aren't allowed to use your phone while driving  \[ you are 4 times as likely to have a crash when using your phone than when you aren't\] ( [https://www.computerworld.com/article/2763161/how-the-brain-works--driving--cell-phones-and-cognitive-abilities.html](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2763161/how-the-brain-works--driving--cell-phones-and-cognitive-abilities.html)) . And just to make this absolutely clear, this isn't going to be a way to completely silence one player, if this were to happen in my game for example, the jungler and support wouldn't be able to communicate with each other, but would be able to talk to everyone else in the game.  And I mean they can have at it in the post game chat when the game is finished, I really couldn't care less what these people want to say to each other in their own time just when you are in a competitive game of LoL  you should be making every effort yo u can to win.	1	4	0.52

With comments talking about preserving the Roman Empire and the Nazi Third Reich, to other commenters calling for a ban on homosexuality and abortion among other conservative ideas. There were even comments I saw upset that were minorities in the Music Video.

I read a while back that the album was meant to be a satire of the Trump era and the political climate surrounding it, and yet the comment section is overwhelmingly Pro-Trump and Far Right. I know it's not the guys political views but it's so bizarre that the song is so beloved among the Alt-Right. 

I'm assuming some Pro-Trump people have used the song and it grew on that group, or it's people missing the point of the song, but it's bizarre that a song by MGMT would be so loved by the far-right. I just don't get why.

EDIT : I was looking at the comments and apparently the song is popular with Neo-Nazi compilations online which is disappointing."	98	45	0.97

This isn't to say people who have been fed propaganda about this bill are innately racist. 

Below is the word for word text of everything the ""controversial"" bill Says pertaining to critical race theory, which by the way isn't said once.

■■■■■

(4) a teacher, administrator, or other employee of a state agency, school district, 
or open-enrollment charter school is prohibited from: 

(A) being required to engage in training, orientation, or therapy that 
presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or blame on the basis of race 
or sex; and 

(B) requiring or making part of a course the concept that: 

(i) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; 

(ii) an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, is 
inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or 
unconsciously; 

(iii) an individual should be discriminated against or receive 
adverse treatment solely or partly because of the individual's race 
or sex; 

(iv) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to 
treat others without respect to race or sex; 

(v) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by the 
individual's race or sex; 

(vi) an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, bears 
responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members 
of the same race or sex; 

(vii) an individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any 
other form of psychological distress on account of the individual's 
race or sex; or 


SRC-CAP C.S.H.B. 3979 87(R) Page 3 of 3 

(viii) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or 
sexist or were created by members of a particular race to oppress 
members of another race

■■■■■

If you oppose any of the text above, you are a racist. There is simply no other way to get around it. The text can be summed up as ""don't teach that one trait has inherent trait, don't stereotype, don't teach people to hold different standards for other races,  and don't teach that good ethics pertain to one race"" if you don't believe those things, you are racist. 

It's amazing because I'm almost certain some very brave governors from the north  signed bills almost identical to these back in the age of Jim crow, democrats probably railed against those bills back then as well. 

As a a side note, the bill doesn't ban teaching about current events, it openly acknowledges that teachers can teach it, the bill just also says that. 

(1) teachers can't be *compelled* to teach current events

(2) if a teacher does decide to teach current events, they must present controversial issues in a multi faceted way."	110	323	0.8

I genuinely hope he sees this as well.

So, I put out an ad looking for a partner. In my ad I disclosed that I did not want a smut to be the main focus of our roleplay. I don’t mind smut, I actually love to write it, but I usually disclose this just to keep the weirdos from messaging me. Anyways, I got a few responses, one specifically from this guy who seemed actually seemed up to par with what I was searching for in a partner! We hit it off incredibly well! I won’t discredit his writing ability, he was an amazing writer! But ooc chatter seemed to start getting…. intense.

We were very open with each other about certain things! Like what our kinks were so we could later use them in our story if we wanted to which I was okay with! So after opening up to one another about or sexual preferences and all that, things took a very quick turn. I mean so fast that so didnt see any of this coming. Our story heavily started to lean towards smut, and that’s okay I guess. I don’t mind erp, I have a lot of wholesome stories going on right now so so guess it was a nice change of pace. It wasn’t until he started asking me about if I get off to the stories I write and all that stuff that it started to get weird. It made me uncomfortable, but it’s not the first time a male writer has asked me such a thing. I don’t like confrontation so I’m usually pretty good about just giggling and moving on with the conversation, whatever. I didn’t think much of it.

Fast forward, this person asks me if I have ever been r*p*d. That didn’t throw me off guard, but what threw me off guard was him saying “But before you answer, if you have, my apologies if it turns me on.” Which made me extremely sick to my stomach and it triggered me a lot. I think he could tell he messed up because I didn’t answer nor speak to him for the rest of the night. I couldn’t look at my discord, I felt so gross. 

When I finally did look at my discord, he had messaged me a few times asking if he had done something wrong, I expressed to him that what he said made me really uncomfortable and it triggered me a lot. He apologized (which i appreciated) but I wasn’t ready to talk to him right that moment. I needed a bit of space. So I fell asleep that night and when I woke up, I had 23 missed messages from him, profusely apologizing and insisting that I continue our story together. This may sound stupid but I was willing to give this guy another chance!
So I told him I accepted his apology and would be able to write a response to our story short but I couldn’t right that moment because I’ve been busy! (Work and birthday stuff.) Real life just gets busy sometimes you know? I even gave him a heads up and told him i wouldn’t be able to respond every day due to this. Plus this was a novella styled roleplay so it’s not like i could just take ten minutes out of my day and write response! I needed time to sit down and write. Time I just didn’t have this last day or so! 

Not even 48 hours goes by and I get a message telling me that I better respond by the end of the day or he will be finding someone else to roleplay with.

When I tell you my jaw hit the floor. Safe to say I cut ties with him entirely and we are no longer even added on each other’s discord’s. 

It really sucks that a few really pervy male writers ruin it for others! I’ve had so many GREAT male partners, but now i’m just scared to even write with them because of guys like him. Men do better!!! (not all men obviously)"	85	55	0.97

This one customer, however was trying to contact an employee that wasn’t answering so I just told her she passed away which my coworker (40f) took great offense to for some reason. My manager later confronts me about the issue and I of course deny everything I’m accused of until my stupid coworker yells out “liar” before leaving for whatever reason. Since my coworker tends to be more of a slacker and more of a loud-mouth than I am, I successfully convince my manager that coworker was the one talking to the customer. Coworker is furious with me because she got written up and she has a small, stupid child but she wouldn’t have been involved at all if she didn’t insert herself into it and just let me convince my manager that the customer was lying to get a discount or something. My parents keep scolding me for messing with a mother’s job but why is it okay for her to mess with mine? They say it’s because I started everything. AITA?

UPDATE:

First, I would like to clear up a few things I keeps seeing in the comments of my last post:

The coworker I got in trouble is not the coworker I lied about dying.

I did not intent to use my Autism as an excuse, that’s a very offensive assumption, the only reason I even mentioned it was because someone asked me why I thought it would’ve a good idea to lie about someone dying and I said that my Autism MIGHT have played a partial factor along with other things.

Lastly, I 100% accept my judgment, I accept that I am TA and that the things I did were wrong, I just don’t care that they’re wrong and I am not going to do anything to reverse my coworker’s writeup because I don’t care about her and I only care about leaving this job with a good reference.

Onto the update: I did start applying to other jobs and I’ve heard back from a much-classier store. Hopefully they’ll hire me and get me out of this Hell-hole soon, wish me luck!"	127	532	0.7

Have Kids - I have kids, who live with their mother. They visit Wednesday evenings and every other weekend. People should be able to choose the extent of their involvement and my availability.

For background: We both have been having living away from our family since undergraduate. She really priortizes the independence lifestyle that comes with it. Both of us are family oriented and infact she talks to her parents everyday.

I broke up with my girlfriend awhile ago because we wanted different things in life down the line. I wanted to stay with family and she wanted a nuclear lifestyle. We did try to come up with middleground solutions like staying close to the family but not in the same house. If we do stay in the same house and it doesnt workout she would want out. These solutions didnt sit well with me over time. And during the process she seemed very skeptical about them so that didnt instill any confidence in either of us. I really want a partner who is family oriented and would gel with family and I dont get that vibe from her after all these discussions which is so confusing and frustrating bc she loves her family.

We have other issues between us which made me pull the trigger like long distance problems, lack of trust, lack of me giving time to her bc of family commitments, alot of “me” instead of we, lack of emotional maturity in the relationship and co-dependency. I started feeling I had to justify everything I did in my life and relationship to her. Dont get me wrong I think these could be solved (?) but it just seemed like alot of effort along with the major problem.

I really love her and miss her alot. Infact everyday since we broke up. And idk what to do

Tl;dr - broke up with my girlfriend, cannot get over her and thinking of discussing things again with her"	0	12	0.5

Examples:

Yamato staying in Wano

Yamato getting in love for Momo

Yamato getting in kid or law crews

Yamato protecting Wano or becoming Shogun 
Or everything else just for her not to join

Imagine you use same type of logic of this theories to all other characters. 

Make a theory ignoring Luffy ambition and make him become a Marine. It's unfair for the character and bad writing after Luffy repeatedly saying multiple times he wants to be a pirate and Pirate King.

Now do this to all strawhats and remove their ambitions and make them into other things, this is unfair to the reader and characters who were constantly seeing and repeating same thing for a long time.


Imagine making theory to not let Zoro beating Mihawk or even not being swordsman never again.
Nami not getting what she wants
Robin getting caught again 
Chopper not reaching his so desired dream he works so hard to reach.


Making Yamato stay in wano or become Momo retainer is ignoring her ambition and dream just for the sake of a invented theory and destroys every Build up moment wasted with her character. 

One piece is everything about ambition, characters with a high level of will, they never give up of what they want when they have the chance to pursue it. Yamato is a women with conqueros haki, there is people that don't have it and still go to get their dreams, this is One piece, where you pursue your dreams.

This is partly because that I have a C++ and Haskell background, and can see many good stuff directly inherited and a lot of the problems addressed by Rust. 

Recently I introduced Rust to my gf who has about two years experience in Python, and she immediately fall in love with it. This makes me think that rust can also be great for less experienced programmers as well. I would like to share some of the advantages of Rust that we've discussed:

1. It is extremely easy to start a project and start coding immediately, with the help of cargo (maybe also with `cargo-edit`), and have all the tests, docs, lint, vcs, etc. automatically available for you. Python did this so badly that my gf was shocked by how easy it was in Rust.
2. It doesn't require deep understanding to comprehend and follow the examples. It is in fact easy to do some real stuff after reading docs and examples of crates like reqwest, rocket, etc. What a program wants to do is well expressed, and how exactly it's done is not important at the beginning.
3. That being said, Rust encourages more understanding of ""how"", and more importantly, makes it interesting and rewarding. It feels like learning about programming and computer with each Rust concept being learned. Every step you go deeper means something, unlike in Python, you kinda need to just remember those fancy featues, weird conventions, and little inconsistencies, and it contributes little to your understanding of programming in general.

Though I mostly establish my point against python, I think most of them will hold true with other languages as well. I sure hope Rust gain more love from junior programmers, show them the real interest in programming, and help them become more confident and professional."	466	142	0.95

Take this example, If WOTC wanted to say for example current drow are offensive what does that mean? Are they saying the drow an evil race of cave people can be linked to irl black people because they are both black so it might offend someone? See now that’s racist, taking a fake dark skin race and applying it to an irl group is racist. A dark skin race that happens to be evil existing in a fantasy world isn’t.

She's temporarily moved back in with her parents, she's extremely depressed, has no interest in continuing down the career she started, and has ghosted most of her friends. I don't want her to spiral into isolating herself from the world forever.

We started dating in college 8 years ago, broke up about 2.5 years ago, and got back together 1.5 years ago through covid. Sure enough, we fell back into the same painful dynamic, and things fell apart again a few weeks ago while she was on a trip to see her parents.

She has been in a crippling depression for the last year, waking up at 1pm and puttering around the house not seeing friends or working much. I started a small business a few years ago out of school, and she found herself getting more and more involved with, even though at the time I had been uneasy mixing business with such an important personal relationship. It turned out to be really hard to work with each other while still providing the support and reassurance that she needed. I was able to provide her a partial salary as thanks for the time she worked on my company, but her ability to work and participate has been much more limited than either of us could have possibly expected. She's also had renewed physical health troubles that have compounded the profound grief and depression she's experienced since her dog died a year ago.

She's been afraid of commitment and marriage for as long as I've known her, and has routinely broken up with me, which she describes as a pressure valve for when she's not sure she can live up to being a supportive partner, often because of limits of her physical/mental health, or because her focus will be elsewhere for a time. She never cheated on me, even during those ""breaks"", eventually I just started ignoring it although the instability of the relationship was extremely destabilizing to me, and removed any space I felt to tell her what wasn't working.

So far she has avoided telling most of her friends about our breakup, although I made sure that one of her close friends and her family know. She was very unhappy that I told her friend and her sister to look after her.

Her family is wealthy and plausibly could support her financially, but it sounds like they aren't interested in doing that (or at least not without substantial strings). They've routinely lied to her that there would always be a trust fund in her name but it turns out there's apparently nothing anymore (or at least, nothing unless she marries the man they pick out for her, and she shows up as needed so they can look fancy at parties). She doesn't have the energy to get a fulltime job, although she loves doing freelance graphic design and might be able to make some money with that. After our company dissolved, I was able to get a pretty well paying job and before our breakup I offered to support her for a year while she restarted her life -- she's saying I owe it to her because she let me live at her apartment rent-free for a few months, and because she introduced me to a few people who ultimately turned out to become our biggest customers. I want to honor that promise because (a) a promise is a promise, even if we're not together and (b) because I know her whole life she's been strung along by her family, and I think if she had an opportunity for a fresh start, she might really be able to get some level of independence (learn how to drive, start building her own career, reconnect with her friends who she ignored through covid and before). But her ""I owe her this"" narrative drives me a bit crazy. 

I'm not sure honestly what other details to add. i just don't know how to support her. I don't know how she pulls herself out of this. She's kind, empathetic, brilliant, and beautiful -- but so deep in this hole.

[Centre's Bo McMillin on his way to the only score of the upset.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/BoMcMillin.jpg)

An upset so big that [people still talk about it](https://www.kentucky.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/mark-story/article255343201.html), on October 29, 1921 the [Centre Praying Colonels defeated the Harvard Crimson 6-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_Centre_vs._Harvard_football_game). Joyous Centre fans painted ""C6H0"" all around Danville, Kentucky in celebration. In 1950 the Assoicated Press named the game the biggest upset in the past 50 years, and in 2005 The New York Times called it ""arguably the upset of the century in college football.""

Up to that point, Harvard had never lost to a team outside the East, and had not lost a game since 1918, a 25-game winning streak. [In losing to the smallest college it had ever played, Harvard suffered its first intersectional defeat in four decades.](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828181448/http://www.centre.edu/web/library/sc/special/C6h0/ziegler.html) Harvard had won the [1920 Rose Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Rose_Bowl), and had been undefeated [national champion in 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_Harvard_Crimson_football_team) (their 4th national title in the prior 10 years). Through the first 6 games of 1921, Harvard was undefeated, and Centre was 4-0. The Centre win over Harvard turned out to be no fluke, as they would finish the season 10-1, with wins over Arizona, Auburn, Clemson, and VPI (now Virginia Tech). The only loss was to Texas A&amp;M, 22–14, in the [1922 Dixie Classic Bowl game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1922_Dixie_Classic) where A&amp;M's famous [""12th man""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditions_of_Texas_A%26M_University#12th_Man) was born."	182	70	0.96

Seriously, the wank is unreal. You can't have a thread with Time Lords without some shit like ""Doctor Who with no TARDIS and only the Screwdriver beats bloodlusted Superman/JLA in a fist fight"", ""the Doctor with no weapons would beat Thanos/whoever via making an anti Thanos gun out of a coffee strainer and tennis rackets"" or ""a single Time Lord with a shitty TARDIS like the Doctor's can beat the Spectre."" Usually based off of some shoddy logic like ""Doctor Who\*\* is multiversal since he beat the incarnation of all Satans!"" or something equally bad.

The Time Lords are wanked somehow to being stronger than omnipotents, because people cite the Eternals and Chronovores as being ""Q-like"", and Q *says* he is ""omnipotent"" so therefore THEY are also omnipotent and so the Time Lords are ""greater than omnipotent""!?!

The amount of sillytech the Time Lords apprently have (that incidentally never appeared in any show canon ever) is stupid. More generally, the idea of the Time Lords suddenly having some bullshit weapon that is exactly perfect to take out their foe no matter their opponent is nonsense that gives me flashbacks to ""adaptation wank Borg.""

Also because the Time Lords are so wanked every species that poses even a minor threat to them in series even if that is because of horrible plot contrivance/whatever is automatically one of the ""highest tiers in fiction"" following by SB logic, so obviously Sontarans (whose time travel tech was either used as a glorified troop transport/or just failed ridiculously) would curbstomp Forerunners, Sith/Galactic Empire, Imperium of Man, etc. ""because they invaded Gallifrey!!1!!"" Let's also not forget ""the Transduction Barrier is unbreakable because to break it you need to show that \[x\] beat a TB in their own verse"" (obviously impossible because the TB is Who exclusive).

And of course, people often forget how, at crucial moments, the Time Lords (and incidentally the Daleks) have been screwed over by some random human companion shooting something or shutting some machine down before they can stop them. Where the hell was the vaunted Time Lord ability to ""freeze \[them\] in time in less than a microsecond and then make it so they never existed and never could exist and that all recursive versions of them could meet with only failure via time loop nonsense"" during all this?

AFAIK the majority of these more out there interpretations come from the seemingly ridiculous bookwank the series has got, from what I can tell most of these ""feats"" come from characters standing in one place while going on and on about how strong and great the Time Lords are. And IIRC, the majority of the books were not officially canonized in the ""official"" canon, unlike say Star Trek or more obviously Star Wars.

It's greatly disappointing to me to see such an interesting show get turned into such a piece of incoherent mush by battleboarding, rivaling on what's been done to LoTR through ""lol Silmarillion calcs."" TBH, at this point, with the show going ""downhill"" and all, I wouldn't really be sorry to see the show get canceled (again), hopefully for the last time.

&amp;#x200B;

\*I would bet money that if the Daleks were written up as they are right now for Halo or Star Wars/Star Trek/any series instead of Who, the debaters I've encountered would claim that the Time Lords would ""rape them/destroy them"".

\*\* Incidentally, an older Time Lord rpg series (I think the original one actually) statted out the Doctor. Hint: he's not ""multiversal"". At all. That same series also statted out the Transduction barrier (and the lesser known quantum force field) and it is far from some omnipotent omni shield. It might be useful to note that RPG series have historically played major roles in helping to flesh out a canon verse, such as in the case of the Star Wars rpg and canon."	119	120	0.92

I have now received over 1000 responses to the poll so I am about to finally close it and post a final update of the results.

These are the results recorded after 573 responses to the Covid-19 vaccination poll, which is still open and can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l1WwHyfLEuctt\_d4sn6RLfxVfRRaUcfVQ4-54x6gyBU/viewform?edit\_requested=true](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l1WwHyfLEuctt_d4sn6RLfxVfRRaUcfVQ4-54x6gyBU/viewform?edit_requested=true)

I might wait a few more days before closing the poll and providing the final results, but since a quite a few people seemed curious I thought I would provide an update.

Compared to the general population there is definitely an overrepresentation of some of the MBTI types, but that is to be expected with this sort of poll (there were a lot of INFJ and INTJ respondents). There is also the issue of participation bias and other factors to consider. But nonetheless here is a summary of the results thus far:

Then, literally as soon as I got them, I started seeing these ads warning me against Shein because of lead? I definitely won't order any more also because of the environmental stuff, but is it safe for me to wear the clothes I got? Honestly, these are the first jeans in a while that fit me well. And I was super excited.

Are they any more toxic to me than other cheap clothes? Or is this an overreaction? I've also bought clothes from Walmart, boohoo and fashion nova (back when it wasn't as big) so idk if Shein is truly especially horrible or if it's one of those things where people are afraid of foreign items (which has definitely been the case before). Because I wouldn't be surprised if America lowkey wasnt all that great either,, even if we technically have laws because thats never stopped big corporations from cutting corners for prices. I'd like some unbiased advice as I already have the clothes.

Also, any way to wash the clothes to rid some of the toxins?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses! I've been at work so I haven't been able to read through everyone's input, but I promise I will! 

Also, my concern is heavily about the danger of toxins in the fabric that may pose a risk for me to wear. I have already decided that I will not shop at Shein again for their unethical practice and harm to the environment, but I want to know if it is safe to wear the clothes I received already"	402	275	0.86

Please keep all DRS related questions here.	https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/r8c4ez/subreddit_update_drs_frequently_asked_questions/	"Over the past several days we have received 100s of posts about DRS. Many of these posts are duplicative or outside the scope of our customer service guideline (rule #8) or are spam. We have compiled our most frequently asked questions around DRS transfers below including an updated, “Can I DRS from an IRA?” If you have questions related to DRS please keep them on this post.

At this time, all original posts to our subreddit are under manual review before being posted. Please keep all posts related to the 11/30 GME event on the existing threads related to the topic. If you have a question outside this topic, please feel free to post.

**How do I start the process of direct registration for a non-retirement account?**

If you’d like to start the process of direct registration for a non-retirement account, please give us a call. When prompted by the automated system, say ""stock certificates"" to be connected with the correct customer service representative.

[Contact Customer Service](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/contact-us)

**Can I DRS shares from an IRA?**

Currently, Fidelity can only process DRS transfers from non-retirement accounts. Computershare per its website does not offer IRA accounts as a Direct Registration System (DRS) option for GME shares. There have been questions on if we can be the custodian of the IRA, here is the answer: Fidelity is the IRA custodian for brokerage assets held at Fidelity in an IRA account. Fidelity must have custody of any fully-paid security held in a brokerage account on the Fidelity platform per SEC rules. Fidelity would not have custody of assets that are held on the Computershare DRS platform.

Accordingly, a Fidelity customer holding GME shares in a Fidelity IRA account cannot transfer these shares DRS with Computershare without first distributing those shares in kind from a Fidelity IRA account to a non-retirement Fidelity account. After the distribution of the shares to a non-retirement brokerage account, a customer would then be able to direct the shares to be transferred DRS to Computershare for registration. However, please note that an in-kind distribution of GME shares from an IRA account to a non-retirement account would be considered a taxable and reportable distribution to the IRA owner and, if the IRA owner is under 59 ½, the distribution would also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Customers considering taking this action should carefully weigh the tax consequences involved.

**What happens when my shares are sent to the transfer agent?**

It is important to understand that DRS shares are no longer held at Fidelity, and that the issuer or transfer agent becomes responsible for dividend and interest payments, proxies, annual report mailings, account statements evidencing ownership of the security, and other recordkeeping and transactions for the security going forward. All trades occur through the transfer agent and are subject to their fees.

**Why is my cost basis from a recent DRS transfer from Fidelity incorrect at Computershare?**

When you send a DRS, Fidelity does not immediately send the cost basis information with the shares. The cost basis information will follow the shares within 15 days of the transfer. This allows us time to process specific share requests from clients, so the customer can provide us with details on which share lot they want transferred.

We have heard that Computershare is initially listing the cost basis of your shares as the market price at the time they received the security. They then update your cost basis to the actual cost once Fidelity delivers that information to them. In this case, it appears that your actual cost has not yet been delivered yet.

**Do I legally own my shares or does Fidelity own my shares?**

Shares held at Fidelity are registered as ""street name."" This means the name appearing on the stock or bond ""certificate"" is that of the broker, but the person who paid for the securities retains ownership rights. Shares purchased in a cash account or margin account without borrowing are considered fully owned by the account owner. Fidelity does not lend out shares held in cash accounts or, when no margin debit exists, in margin accounts.

**What does this mean for dividend payments?**

If your shares are not being loaned out, you’ll receive a dividend payment on the pay date of the security for the full amount. Fidelity also offers dividend reinvestment programs that will allow you to have your dividend applied toward the purchase of additional shares (including fractional shares).

**How does Fidelity lend shares?**

1. Drinking cold/ice water leads to weight gain and acne. I'm slightly overweight so I have to be prepared for a lecture if I want a cold glass of water when I'm home.


2. Turmeric/garlic cures literally everything. I can't really list all the benefits of drinking a glass of warm glass of water with turmeric dissolved in it every morning. There are just so many.


3. Anything that isn't ""natural"" is bad. I started drinking soluble fiber every morning because it keeps me regular and may help with cholesterol (conflicting studies) and it's like I may as well be drinking poison.


4. This is a weird one. When someone in my family gets a bad sinus infection, one of the things they do is boil water, throw in some Vicks vapor rub, and then put their face over it with a blanket covering them. Basically hotboxing Vicks vapor rub... I tried to explain to them why this is ineffective at best and can cause respiratory problems at worst, but nope.


5. Certain symptoms, such as headaches, are only normal in adults. When I was growing up, if I had a headache or diarrhea/constipation or something, I couldn't tell my parents. If I did, I'd have to hear about how I'm ""too young"" to have such symptoms.


6. One should not have more than 1 episode of illness every two years. I'm a doctor now and I'm treating sick people constantly--including covid when we were in the thick of it. This year, I got a cold twice. I had to hear about how sickly I am. I've never had any major medical problems...


Anyone else have any of these home remedies it medical factoids? I'd like to know more so I can recommend them to my patients..."	43	24	0.99

My younger sister went through a pretty rough time as a young adult, drinking and doing drugs and generally being wild, she ended up getting pregnant and giving birth at age 18 when I was just a few weeks away from turning 21, she did not want the child after giving birth, she refused to even pick up the child and would leave her sitting in dirty nappies.

Despite never wanting children myself either I stepped in and adopted my newborn niece as my daughter, my then boyfriend who i'd been with for 3 years gave me an ultimatum, him or her as he didn't want children either I picked her and he left me which resulted in me suddenly being a single mother, the first few years were rough as a single parent barely making ends meet but I managed and my sister had nothing to do with us. I never once hid the truth from my daughter that she was adopted but always assured her I loved her so much and was her Mummy.

When my daughter was six my sister was finally clean and wanted to have access to her, I allowed it but stressed she would just be an Aunt to her and she accepted this though it's clear she struggled with the concept and sometimes acted more like a mother which I always squashed quickly.

Now my daughter is eight and i've been offered a job in a different country, the pay is almost double my current salary and the company is helping us find a home, putting my daughter in an international school and after school care, so of course i'm going to take it but this resulted in my family having a meltdown about how I can't do this and how it's cruel to take my daughter away from her family and how it's not fair to my sister. My sister has told me she won't allow me move away with her and that she'll fight in Court to get my daughter back I've talked to lawyers and it seems she doesn't have a leg to stand on as my daughter is legally my daughter but the rest of my family is telling me i'm being extremely cruel and if I cared about my sister i'd turn this job down.

I left home at 16 and finished my education, my sister meanwhile is the golden child who gets away with everything, she even now lives with our parents and doesn't work.

My daughter while sad to be leaving her School and friends is excited for the move, i've been teaching her about the Country every night before bed and we've gone to some authentic restaurants to try food from there, i've also promised her we'll fly back at least once a year to visit and she can facetime/call her friends.

I feel like my family are angling for me to eventually just hand my daughter back over as if I was just a temporary filler for my sister which will obviously never happen and my lawyers are involved in this matter."	3110	261	0.99

Quite a few people are complaining about how Oda is now rushing things or that the writing quality has declined and that's why we're getting this kind of fight, but I'd like to remind people about Enies Lobby and the Jabra fight.

The parallels between Sanji VS Queen and Sanji VS Jabra are quite strong and it reflects how the writing on that side hasn't really changed much, but that people have changed their own perspective over time.

Here are the main similarities and why Jabra would have been buried into the ground by the community if Enies Lobby was released nowadays:

* Both are set to be the 3rd strongest (really close to the 2nd) in a group that at that point is considered to have a mayor power gap against the Strawhats.
* In both cases, Sanji sustains previous injuries due to fighting against a woman, putting him at a small disadvantage.
* At the start of the fight, he strongly kicks the enemy away protecting a crew member.

* During most of the fight, which is only end ch 413-ch 414 for Jabra while it's more spread around against Queen, Sanji mostly dodges the enemy attacks and repeatedly deals damage against the enemy. This is when people say Sanji was just playing around with Queen, without realizing Sanji mostly focuses on evasion during his fights, even if now he has better defense due to modifications.

&amp;#x200B;

* For the final encounter (ch 415 for Jabra and most likely 1034 for Queen), Sanji receives some damage and quickly finishes the fight with a new Diable/Ifrit Jambe, with the enemy flying away in the last page.

Does this all make Jabra and Queen weaklings for being defeated by a damaged Sanji without dealing him much damage? Absolutely not. Is the portrayal of the fight not as exciting as some people would wish? Sure, but it's not something new.

I'm not saying how the fight developed is the best, but lets not delude ourselves into thinking this is not how Oda has done things before and let's not subestimate Queen just because the way Sanji fights makes it harder to quantify the strength of the enemy. Not everyone has to be Zoro or Luffy, tanking hits every moment of the fight, some characters can be nimbler making it seem like they're putting less effort in the fight, while still being close in overall strength to other characters.

TLDR: Don't bash Queen so much based on the Sanji fight (bash him for being an over confident idiot for basically handing out the cure to the virus) and accept that One Piece has never been a perfect story, mostly in the fights department."	400	157	0.96

**Background**

The man who needs no introduction is Drizzy. Aubrey. Champagne Papi. 6 Man. 6 God. Wheelchair Jimmy. And so many more nicknames and pseudonyms to go around. Drake announced he was working on his next endeavor in mid-2019 telling the world that he was in album mode. Dropping a few teasers here and there throughout that year, Drake had yet to tease any new music yet but just telling everyone that 2020 was the year. 

...

As it turns out, Drake was a lying jerk, and to delay his album, Drake created a global pandemic causing the deaths of millions of people. Not cool. Drake teased a few songs throughout the year. With the release of *Dark Lane Demo Tapes* containing leftovers and loosies from the Scorpion and CLB era, Drake officially announced that CLB would drop in late 2020. Teasing the album throughout the year, he released more CLB leftovers by giving Greece and Pop Star to DJ Khaled. With the debut single “Laugh Now Cry Later” dropping mid-august. While finishing off the year with more songs like Outta Time with Bryson Tiller, B.B King Freestyle with Lil Wayne, and You’re Mines Still with Young Bleu, the hype was at an all-time high, and the release would soon be in our hands.

It didn’t release. Drake then said January 2021. So did Odell Beckham Jr. (who I thought I could trust because he was in the music video for the lead single). It turns out that Odell is Mr. liar-liar pants on fire, so the album didn’t drop in January. As a Browns fan, I’m glad we got rid of him. Drake claimed that ouch owie my leg, so no album. In early March, Drake released Scary Hours 2 with What’s Next, Wants and Needs with Lil Baby, and Lemon Pepper Freestyle with Rick Ross. Knowing the original Scary Hours leading up to Scorpion, the album was so close you could almost taste it!

April came and went with another CLB loosie titled Solid featuring Young Thug and Gunna dropping on Slime Language 2. May came and went with Nicki Minaj’s Seeing Green featuring Drake and Lil Wayne. June came and went with Migos’s Having Our Way releasing with Drake. July came and went with Brent Faiyaz’s Wasting Times and Smiley’s Over the Top releasing where Smiley washed Drake throughout the entire song. August almost didn’t have a Drake song, but Trippie Redd didn’t fumble the Drake bag and released Betrayal at the end of August. 

Drake being the top-selling Hip-Hop artist in the world comes with a lot of perks. One of those perks is casually announcing the release date of *Certified Lover Boy* on the morning intro of SportsCenter [(which I posted)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/pcmz7p/sportscenter_cuts_to_a_message_announcing_drakes/). He began doing a major promo with billboards of lyrics from the album while also announcing every feature on the project in billboards from their hometowns (ex. Rick Ross billboard in Miami, Jay-Z billboard in NYC, and Lil Durk billboard in Chicago).

After feening for the album for two and a half years, Drake couldn’t even release the album at midnight. We had to wait two more hours to hear this damn thing. Thank God Drake is not Kanye, and it was actually released.  The Lover Boys around the world rejoiced as we were given an album with every single leading up to the album left behind in favor of 83 minutes of new Drake.

**Review**

The long-awaited *Certified Lover Boy* begins utilizing the beat of Masego’s Navajo on the track “Champagne Poetry”. On the track, Drake gives an update on his life mentioning his son, his relationship with others, and just throwing some flexes around like it is nothing on an effortless flow showing that Drake is still on top of the world. The song transitions into its second half where Drake brings the energy over a beautiful gospel sample of “Until I Found The Lord”. The second half focuses on the issues Drake has witnessed and experienced since his last album discussing gang violence in his hometown of Toronto (as well as the criticism he faced from it), racial injustice throughout North America, how his dedication to music has caused him to lose focus on what matters most to him, and how him and his baby momma, Sophie Brussaux have worked together to take care of their child.

After setting the bar high with the opening track, Drake repurposes the classic Montell Jordan song “Daddy’s Home” into “Papi’s Home” where he lets the rap world know that he’s back and is ready to run the industry again. The song includes a brief unlisted cameo from Nicki Minaj that adds a nice flair to the track. The chipmunkified sample and the hard-hitting drums reminiscent of UGK done by Supah Mario allow for Drake’s charisma and flow to slide through the instrumental like butter. It’s irresistibly fun. After going two for two on the album Drake goes into his melodic style on “Girls Want Girls” with Lil Baby. The track opens with the now infamous line “say that you a lesbian, girl, me too”. The track is carried by Lil Baby and the ethereal instrumentation. I think Drake flows well on the verse and the pre-chorus is irresistible, but the chorus is very cheesy. The song transitions perfectly into “In The Bible” with previous collaborates Lil Durk and GIVĒON. The style of the track is almost identical to “Girls Want Girls”, but Drake delivers a stronger performance than the predecessor, and Lil Durk slides on the track with ease. GIVĒON’s outro is beautiful and is a fantastic addition to the track. He takes over the backhand of the track stripping everything but the ambient synth swirling in the background letting his voice do the heavy lifting.

“Love All” featuring JAY-Z might be my favorite of the sung tracks on the album done by Drake. The soulful sample and somber tone of Drake’s voice sounds like he’s been betrayed, and he’s not mad but disappointed. JAY-Z drops probably his best verse of the year on the track talking about how he could ruin anyone if they do him wrong and you definitely do not want to get on his bad side. His rhyme scheme on it is pretty cool! I always think it’s funny when songs sample other songs that came out less than 2 years ago or on albums that came out this year which “Fair Trade” featuring Travis Scott does. Sampling Mountains by the wonderful Charlotte Day Wilson, Drake talks about how he doesn’t need fake friends in his life and cutting them off is good for his mental health while Travis Scott just scraps the song’s topic and flexes his money being up. At least he flows well over it… 

The next song was initially a  ??? moment for me on the album, but now I know every single word to this stupid song and I listen to it almost daily at this point. On “Way 2 Sexy”, Drake enlists Future on hook and verse duty while also throwing Young Thug on the track. I don’t even have much to say, the sample and reinterpretation of I'm Too Sexy by Right Said Fred helps turn the track into Cardi B and Megan’s WAP but for men. (i saw a tweet that said that, and they aren’t wrong. I feel empowered and inspired listening to way 2 sexy). Drake, Future, and Young Thug all just talk about how great and beautiful they are, and that’s really it.

The next songs are tributes to H-Town and the Houston music scene with TSU (Texas Southern University) starting with a sample of choppednotslopped legend OG Ron C shouting out the entire state of Texas. Utilizing a sample of *NSYNC, the instrumental is very vaporwave-esque and Drake delivers a legendary melodic performance that you can’t just help yourself to not smile at. The Houston vibes continue with “N 2 Deep” (while sampling a UGK song lol) with Future. The song consists of a slow and moody beat with synths going up and down the scale and distorted guitars that would make Mike Dean smirk. The production is quite minimal with the only drums being a snap track that comes in around the 2-minute mark of the song. The song metaphorically takes off like a … into the second half with Drake’s vocal going in and out speaker on the chorus while Future comes back for seconds dropping a beautifully melodic verse to end the song off. I’d like to think that the track tells a little story where he’s initially outside of the club with a girl, and he is convinced to go inside the club. It’s not Sing About Me, I’m Dying Of Thirst, but it’s pretty cool.

Working on Dying gets called in for “Pipe Down” where Drake talks about how to silence the thoughts of a girl he’s not over and get over the feelings he has for her even with how much money and things he has. Drake sounds pretty upset on the track and delivers a tone I have never heard from before. It’s nice. The track flows nicely into “YEBBA’s Heartbreak” which is similar to other interludes on his albums (“Summers Over Interlude”, “Jorja Interlude”, “4422”, and “Wednesday Night Interlude”) where he lets an R&amp;B singer take an interlude. YEBBA continues the themes of love and desire from the album beautifully. The piano is fantastic, and I definitely have a newfound appreciation for her after only being mildly aware of her music.

There are two cheat codes to make me instantly love a hip-hop song which are 808 Cowbells and Three 6 Mafia/Memphis Rap samples. “No Friends In The Industry” has both. The track is the first of two Ye diss tracks and the first of two Memphis-style tracks. The beat of course is reminiscent of the Memphis lo-fi beats utilizing very pixelated and low-quality instrumentation throughout. The synths are dope and Drake brings the energy to create a perfect workout track. He follows it up with “Knife Talk” featuring Project Pat (in sample) and 21 Savage and production by Metro Boomin. Drake and 21 trade verses over the horrorcore beat with 21 giving his standard laidback but aggressive performance with Drake comes in with viciousness and anger that helps balance the track out. Though they go back and forth, they have entirely different flows which add a good variation throughout the song.

You know when there’s a time and a date, it’s a high-quality Drake song. “7 am on Bridle Path” is no different where Drake disses Kanye and drops a one verse no hook track. He features the line “Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo” in reference to [a tweet that predicts he would do such a thing](https://twitter.com/mrgordian/status/1417697435837779968). I think that’s pretty funny. “Race My Mind” reminds me of Nothing Was The Same or Take Care drake with his more youthful performance. He sings on most of the track but drops a heartfelt rap verse on the backend of the track. It’s clean and the harp on the track is pretty dope.

“Fountains” features up-and-coming afrobeat singer “Tems”. The track is pretty solid but feels like a more lowkey “One Dance” without all the flair the views track had. Drake keeps the R&amp;B style on “Get Along Better” with Ty Dolla $ign on background vocals. In my opinion, it’s the most forgettable song on the entire album just from its general blandness. It is not bad, but at the same time, it’s nothing special.

Legendary producer Bink! gets called in to produce “You Only Live Twice”, the sequel to The Motto featuring Rick Ross and Lil Wayne who are both major collaborators with Drake. It starts with a wonderful transition from “Get Along Better” with Rick Ross’s Maybach Music ad-libs echoing through the stereo speaker in silence before the beat comes in. Rick Ross takes the first minute of the track delivering his bombastic vocals over the instrumental. These beats are always perfect for Rozay as he slides in through the AC vents of a topless convertible. When you put Drake with two rap legends of course he’s gonna give a hungry and feisty performance where he flexes on everyone and compares himself to the modern-day Michael Jackson. Wheezy continues his feature streak by delivering a fast and addictive verse to finish the track off. It’s phenomenal.

Drake and Kid Cudi squash the beef on “IMY2” where Cudi takes over the majority of the track and mostly puts Drake on his back. Drake delivers a decent performance, but it feels like a Kid Cudi song with a Drake feature than what it actually is. Drake grabs OVO signee PARTYNEXTDOOR to do background vocals on “Fucking Fans” where he regrets … fucking. fans? i guess? i dunno. Pretty forgettable track on a strong album. He doesn’t like fucking fans. I guess. Drake finishes the album like he always does with his long one verse over a mellow soul sample type of track with “The Remorse”. It turns out the sample is not a sample and is original vocals by Anthony Hamilton just pitched up. Similar to the second half of the opener where he talks about the relationship he has with others and the problems he’s been going through while also flexing his net worth and announcing that he owns his own masters which is a win for anyone in the industry. I always have a sweet spot for Drake closers like “Do Not Disturb”. They’re always a bright spot in any Drake album.

Other than a standard Drake album with themes of love, loss, and money, cohesively the album is all over the place. Even if you hated Scorpion, the album is consistent with its rap side and its sing-songy R&amp;B side. On CLB, Drake will bounce around both losing some of the cohesion. Though on the first listen I thought the album was really bad and bland, a few hours later on my second listen, I fell in love with the album and constantly see myself jumping into a few songs and even the entire album more than most projects from this year. It’s fun, it’s carefree, the features are stacked, and the production is solid like you would expect from Mr. Drizzy. I can see what people's issues are with the project, but I think it's cool.

No. There is no precedent!

I sometimes use violence as a way of defending myself because I know I will never win with talk, I really get angry and do stuff that I regret afterwards. I use silence sometimes to avoid problems but there is a person (I don't want to mention his/her name) who know that and try to push me to an argument by looking down at me and not giving me the respect I deserve. He/she doesn't like me and think Im stupid, I get very angry when he/she does that and I really want to use violence to satisfy my anger of being disrespected.	26	25	0.94

In a 6-3 ruling, the Court judged that requiring employees at large businesses to be vaccinated against COVID, or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask, exceeded the authority granted by Congress.  All three liberal justices dissented.

At the same time, in a second unsigned opinion, Court has allowed the administration to continue enforcement of a vaccinate mandate for healthcare workers at facilities that receive Medicaid or Medicare funding. This measure is expected to affect 10 million workers and takes effect this month. Conservative justices Thomas, Aliton, Gorsuch, and Barrett dissented, while Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh sided with their liberal collogues.

Compared to the original Kamigawa, there is no charm in Neon Dynasty. There is nothing eerie and foreboding. There is nothing real. 


My apologies to the artists who had to work on this set. All of the ideas given to you have been trash. That especially goes for the nostalgia pieces which, in my eyes, are nothing more than trite overly sanitized soulless stand-ins for the real characters from the original Kamigawa block which we may not see again. You know what, that's fine, I'd rather not see them again because I'm sure that they would be ruined. 


The ninja turtles, mortal kombat, and shitty Voltron references are just obscene grotesque simulacra of the real card game that Wizards of the Coast used to produce. The people behind designing the ideas for this spittle should be totally ashamed of themselves in the most profound way. 


You fucking bug people ruin every single thing that you touch as though you were king Midas, but for shit instead of gold. You are idiotic janissaries fighting for the worst people and the worst ideas. That's why you are better called jannies. But instead of seeing this decrepit limping-along civilization and wanting to clean it up, you see your job as flinging some more refuse around.

Remember when rates rise... bonds go down in value... we are too focussed on the index's but the fixed world is much much bigger...

Investment in fixed income securities **typically decrease in value** when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term securities. 

In 2020, U.S. long-term fixed income issuance reached $12.2 trillion, a 48.1% increase from the previous year. Mortgage-backed securities issuance increased by 96.2% to $4.0 trillion, followed by corporate bonds (+60.4% to $2.3 trillion) and Treasury securities (+32.7% to $3.9 trillion). U.S. long-term municipal bond issuance increased 13.6% to $484.5 billion, while federal agency securities increased 26.5% to $1.3 trillion. Asset-backed securities issuance volume fell 30.0% to $304.3 billion.

As posted above, corporate debt issued last year was $2.5 trillion. **So if you took all the cash out there, and all the bonds - theres no way these large U.S companies can pay all that DEBT back.** And the greedy bankers just printed bonds for years and years and years (Looking at you Evergrande).

Once the FED raises rates, the price of bonds will have to come down. This will effect every Fixed asset out there. The FED would rather have crazy high inflation than raise rates. The accounts will lose value and marge will call. 

**TLDR: Raising rates will be the final nail in the coffin if MOASS has not started by then.** 

P.S Financial Advisors are too retarded to realize that a 50/50 stock bond pf had a 7% annualized return because of this - 50/50 bond/stock portfolios are going to be toiler paper going forward and it makes the whole DTCC business sort of worthless. The FED loses power as their treasuries are not worth shit.

The majority of it was very helpful. I sat my son down and told him that I'd give him 100% control on his money and card again but that he needed to be smarter with his purchases, and that if he was truly struggling with managing his money I'd get him finance managing classes. As most people in the comments said he told me that the reason he was being very impulsive with the money was because he was a teenager and he probably wouldn't feel that financially free when he had to pay rent and be an adult and be in college etc. The last thing I'd ever want is for me and my son to not be close anymore because he's my world and I've had to raise him by myself for 17 years. So thank you everyone for the advice and comments. 

So for the backstory I have a 17 year old teenage son and I wish I was being dramatic but he is genuinely the most irresponsible person with money. He will spend hundreds of dollars that was given to him in a day or two and have no thought about it, and I wouldn't mind if the things that he bought he used often or were fun/helpful but they aren't. I can't even count the amount of times he bought a 60$ new game and then played it once and never touched it again. He'll also spend a ridiculous amount on food delivery apps when I was planning to cook dinner or when I just grocery shopped. For Christmas he received 300$ total and spent it all in 4 days between Amazon, food, subscriptions, and games. 

He currently doesn't have a job so all the money he gets is from sometimes helping his family with something or it being gifted to him. He told me he planned on getting a job and I obviously want him to but I'm not sure if that'll increase his spending tenfold or maybe teach him the value of the dollar. But anyways, he helped his uncle with something over the weekend and handed me the money(225$) and said to give it to him and say thank you for the help. My son was aware he gave me the money and asked that I transfered it into his debit card. I told him that anytime he's given a large amount of money he will spend it all in a few days so I obviously won't keep his money but I'll manage it and anytime he wants to buy something I'll transfer the amount to his card. He got very angry and said that it was his money and I shouldn't have any control of what he worked for, I agreed but said that he will still have all of his money but he just won't receive it all at once and that once he proves that he's responsible with money then he can have full control. He told me I was being manipulating and controlling and that even if he's irresponsible with money it's still his, I told him that as a parent it's already my fault that I let him get very irresponsible with money and that if he keeps up with his spending into adulthood he'll be homeless. Its been kind of awkward around the house and I do feel bad since it does feel controlling but I want to make sure he has good financial skills for the future. Also this detail might be important in some people's decisions but his uncle texted him asking if he got the money and he told him that his mom was holding it and would only give him the amount when he needed to buy something. He texted me asking about it and when I told him about how anytime he's given any money he'll spend it all in a couple days on temporary satisfaction or things he'll only use once he just chuckled and said he supports my decision but to make sure he still gets the money whether that's all at once or in small amounts.

Extreme tracking of player’s movements, unnatural bizarre animation timings, and endless “fakeout” attack combos where it looks like the enemy has ended their moves, only to instantly go into another quick attack or yet another combo that no player could ever predict.

After endless bosses in Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, it’s not fun to study these movements anymore, it’s just annoying. In Sekiro it didn’t matter because the player can deflect at any time while having infinite dodge/sprint. Elden Ring offers no such repose.

Playing Demon’s Souls remake was such a breath of fresh air because Fromsoft didn’t rely on this kind of ultra fast paced enemy design back then. Enemies moved in ways that made sense, they didn’t have ridiculous combos that made my brain malfunction wondering how the fuck they could even track that or continue attacking, and it was the right level of difficulty and fairness.

Also, what happened to bosses limping and getting hurt towards the end of a fight? It feels like every boss just goes ultra aggro and attacks non stop towards the end of their healthbar. 

Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 was pushing it with 10x combo ultra fast ultra tracky bosses, but Elden Ring seems like the worst offender. It's like I'm just fighting the ""dancer"" boss from DS3 again and again and again.

If this is what all of Elden Ring is with one or two outliers, I worry I might put it down before completing it. And this is coming from someone who played and loved the other fromsoft games."	901	865	0.8

i like the levelups because they involve a choice for the player. what stats you want to focus on and how you want your build to work. the idea is to make your character more ""refined"" instead of just making them ""better"". the gear, spells and armor you can use depends on what stats you focus on.

for weaponupgrades its the opposite. this mechanic actually reduces meaningful choices for the player. the obvious most efficient way to use upgrade materials is to put everything into one weapon. this invalidates the option of choosing different weapons for different situations, you now only have 1 viable weapon, its the one you upgraded. there might be some situations where it still makes sense to use a different weapon but without the upgrade system that would always be the case, rather than an exception.

&gt;but dark souls 1 and demons souls have upgrade paths. you can add elemental dmg/scaling to your weapon at certain upgrade-levels. this significantly changes the weapon, and doesnt just make it ""better"".

i think ds2 and ds3 handles this issue better with infusions and whatever its called in ds2. it seperates the infusion choice from the ""weapon do more dmg"" mechanic.

i am proposing a system where if you find a cool looking weapon in the lategame, you can use it right away and be effective. instead of having to visit the blacksmith, buy/farm upgrade materials and so on.




edit.

in dark souls1 you could upgrade armor. in ds3 you cannot upgrade armor. isnt it just amazing that you can find new armor and immediately put it on without being at a significant disadvantage?

in ds1 you can not upgrade talismans or catalysts. in ds3 you upgrade talismans and catalysts just like weapons. is that really better? if you play a caster in ds1 and finally get manus catalyst in the endgame, do you really think like: ""man, i wish the game forced me to upgrade this thing before i could use it effectively"" ?"	192	416	0.66

At first, it was just going to be about sex for me, while my wife is more demisexual and needs a strong connection. Shortly after that, I realized that the only sex idea was a little short sighted of me, and I wanted to be open to the possibility of a relationship. I vocalized this, and my wife agreed that would be okay.

Our main issue seems to be we disagree on overnights. I think it should be a reasonable expectation that sometimes I stay with my secondary overnight. Not all the time, but part time. My wife thinks that's weird. I want to respect reasonable boundaries, and we've done compromising. I think it's weird to never allow sleepovers, while she thinks it's weird to allow them. 

For information before anyone asks, I'm not ignoring my anchor, nor am I failing to make time for her or shower her with affirmations. I know she's just feeling jealousy and it will fade with time, but I just want to get an idea for how many people think it's reasonable for sleepovers. Also: I'm specifically talking about a situation where I'm out until 10:30 or 11 with an hour drive home, and needing to be up by 4 to get to work. I think it would be more than reasonable to expect the okay, especially in this situation, to stay over so I can get a good night sleep.

EDIT: Putting this in here, because I've said it a few times in the comments, spoke to my wife on the phone and compromised that overnights are for serious relationships, and not for early dating. I think the both of us were/are blinded by our own wants and weren't communicating properly."	85	88	0.92

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.

The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.

Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.

In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.

The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

Ever since pregnancy it’s been constant fights over the littlest things, and those fights will last the whole day if not, multiple days. The most recent was “my driving” as I’m the main one who drives - but every time I drive it’s either I’m going too fast, too slow, taking turns too fast, taking turns too slow (you get the point). Now, I told her I’m done driving and when we go places she can drive because I’m tired of it. Everyday it’s a argument over the littlest things, and I will say - sometimes it’s my fault but I normally own up and apologize, from her she never apologizes and sulks all day and the argument keeps going. Obviously I know hormones are all over the place during pregnancy but any tips because keep being patient? It’s getting so bad!	6	20	0.81

Is it pride? What am I supposed to do? Is there a chance for me to go to Heaven?

I was able to leave behind the corrupting estrogen and my life is now free of that sin.

According to the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, an estimated 1.7 million embryos have been discarded in the United Kingdom since 1991. 

In the US, there are over 400,000 embryos currently in storage and many of these embryos have been abandoned, discarded as medical waste, or donated for research.

If abortion is murder, is discarding an embryo or donating it for medical research also murder? What about discarding an embryo that underwent genetic testing and was deemed incompatible?

If abortion bans were truly about protecting life and not about controlling a woman’s body, where are the laws regulating every embryo created during IVF? Why the disconnect between how public policy treats women who undergo IVF and women who have abortions?

When a woman who has undergone IVF has embryos she’s not planning to use, the state doesn’t require her to undergo counseling before the clinic can discard them. Nor does she have to wait 48 hours to think about her choice, walk through a line of protesters screaming at her, or carry a stigma that might make her afraid to talk about her experience.

There is no difference between a fertilized egg in a lab and a fertilized egg in a person, yet a woman who gives a clinic permission to discard her embryo doesn’t have to deal with any of the legislative or cultural toxicity that surround women seeking abortions.

If you dislike abortion because you believe every embryo is a person, you should hate IVF, which results in the destruction of millions of embryos."	169	988	0.96

I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage. 

My brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally. His boyfriend also contacted me later and told me that their romantic lives doesn't concern me and to stay out of it.

She very quickly flashed between complete disbelief, laughter, confusion and then pissed the fuck off. I've read similar posts on these pages before and boy do yall like bashing dudes. And not in the way some of the dudes enjoy it. In all seriousness she suggested a minimum 2 questions before people should be allowed to ""give advice"" a lead in question and a related follow up or clarification question. Most of yall  couldn't have been further from the reality of our relationship. I never forced her to do anything. Not once. I'm sure there are sometimes she didn't want to but did it anyway because she loves me. For some that's enough. Others not so much. I kept asking questions and kept pushing her to get in touch with herself because my gut told me something was off and the last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt her. It would have been all to easy to ignore that feeling and just accept what I wanted. She was giving it freely and saying things were ok the whole time. But you wonderful dime store therapists immediately jumped all over the narrative that I'm forcing her into some fetish she has no interest in (hers are much more taboo btw). So next time before you start vomiting cheap psychology today quotes or other bad advice you found while hiding from your significant others in the bathroom remind yourself that there are real people on the other end. Had mine and her communications been what they were a few years ago this could have hurt one or both of us. I'm gonna leave this up for another hour or two then remove this post. Happy July 4 weekend and stay safe yall. 

What am I supposed to do when my wife is repulsed by my need to be a little submissive in the bedroom? We've tried every way there is to experiment and find where she can fit into that with me. I've asked, demanded, calmly expressed my needs and feelings, begged, bribed and yelled. I regret some of it but none of it came with bad intentions. I've had a feeling for a year or two now that she's just not into that. She'll do it for me and even have fun with it occasionally. I don't want to be one of those assholes that asks her to do something she doesn't like and her do it just for me though. It's a big part of me and the only place I can feel even a little bit vulnerable. It's been bleeding over into the rest of my life for about a year now. My confidence has been shot to hell. Not just sexually but in other areas to. I used be an outgoing guy that had no problem walking up to strangers and walking away with some new friends. Now it's nerve wracking just to go out. I trip over my words and couldn't make a witty joke if you put a gun to my head. How is it that the one person in the world that should want me, that I forsaked all others for doesn't want me? I'm so lost rn.

Edit: wow man you people are something else. At least half of you didn't even finish reading the post before you were typing what a terrible husband I am. And the other half picked thru what I wrote without ever trying to understand what I was saying. And all of you suggested couples counseling and or divorce. As far as couples counseling, if it were an option we'd have already done it. Next time you want to suggest something so stupidly obvious to someone asking for advice or help look up a therapist in their area. Paste a website to some practices an article about the benefits of couples therapy. Don't be so lazy and condensending. The divorce part might be an option for you. If you need to quit and break someones heart or a family cause you're to lazy to put in the work. Or unreliable to keep your word and your vows. That's fine for you but I'm better than that and she deserves more than that. So come on keyboard warriors tear into that one."	41	51	0.64

We are not on good terms in the first place (we don't speak to each other except at family events and only to be polite). I am also a vegetarian, which is not something she has ever accepted despite me being with my husband for over 14 years now. If I were to attend, I would have to bring all of my own food and cook it inside while everyone else is outside around the barbecue (I'm honestly fine with this).

We are out of town the weekend before and arrive home three days before we would have to leave for this barbecue. We would also have to stay overnight in a tent on their property as they only have two bedrooms and the second one is promised to other older family members. We can't bring our two dogs with us as it's not a dog-friendly place, so we would have to leave them with my parents who will have had them for the majority of the week prior due to us being out of town. While they love my dogs, they are a lot of work in addition to my parents' own two dogs.

In addition to this, I am currently in the thick of marathon training and by that point will be 7 weeks out; I have a 20-mile run scheduled for the morning after this barbecue so I would have to complete this in a place I don't know, on a new route that I would have to figure out as I run, after sleeping in a tent and being around the family until most likely very late (ie: sleep will be poor and short).

I have refused to attend; my husband is on the fence but feels like he should because this is so important to his mother (I am fine with him going if he is healthy; if he feels sick at all he will not be going as he can't risk giving COVID to his mother or to his father who was recently diagnosed with a heart condition).

MIL \*WILL NOT\* accept this answer and has been arguing with my husband for three days about how I should just go, my running isn't that important, and it's not a big deal if we have to sleep in a tent. Apparently I should just suck it up and go because she needs her family around her because she almost died (she didn't; her cancer was caught early and though yes absolutely it would have been scary for her, she was never considered terminal or anywhere close to dying).

My answer isn't changing. If she wants to get her nose out of joint about this, go right ahead. I will enjoy my weekend to myself with my dogs, my running, and sleeping in my own bed."	699	109	0.98

She comes to my house daily!
My son loves the company, but the girl is a massive brat.
This girl comes over and plays with my son, the whole time scolding him because he is being a typical toddler, complaining to me that he is acting like a typical toddler all while helping herself to our food, and wasting most of whatever she takes and complaining that we dont have anything good to eat.  Lately I've been outside working, I have watched her parents push her out the door and send her over while I'm literally covered in dirt and sweat from the complicated tasks I am doing with no intention of stopping anytime soon.  Right away she starts asking me over and over again if she can go inside, i explain over and over, not unattended because i have a reactive dog and they are too young to be left in the house alone.  Then she asks interchangeably if i can hurry and finish so we can go inside while also asking for misc. Snacks and beverages. 
Ive been getting snappy because I hate stopping what I'm doing when I'm not finished and explaining things over and over again is a pet peeve for me.
I've literally gave up on my front yard and moved to my back yard in hopes of not being seen, but she has figured that out and let's her self in.  
She also sits at the door trying to figure out the lock code, rings our door bell over and over again and peaks in the windows when we don't answer the door, which we have been doing a lot because even if I say he can't play because we are... (insert reason here) she will just sit there and argue with me to let them play. She has ruined many nap times which has left me with a nasty cranky toddler.
I did feel bad for turning her away and at first i wouldn't be doing so if we really didnt have things to do, ie: naptime, bath time, eat, go to the store, go to the doctors... 
But having to literally argue with a 5 year old child who isn't mine has me avoiding this girl at all costs now.

Do some of y'all just see ""identity"" as synonymous with ""sexuality"" and that's why you don't include polyamory? Because I see identity as *whatever you feel you are*, which is never a choice. Am I out of touch? Is this wrong?

2. Floyd Mayweather
3. Jay-Z
4. A-Rod
5.  Blake Shelton
6. Steven Spielberg
7. Kim Kardashian
8. Mark Walburg
9. Oprah Winfrey
10. Travis Scott 

I don't know how accurate or legit this is, the article says the data comes from from a data analyst company called Yard who may just track celebs jets the same way anyone can, and they work out the carbon footprint.

Does anyone have any strong opinions on this? I don't remember Taylor ever taking a public stance on climate change (I remember a photoshoot in the Lover era she wore 2nd hand clothes for sustainability reasons) so one couldn't accuse her of being hypocritical.

However, is this something you would like her to be more conscientious about in the current climate situation? Or do accept this is part of celeb/elite culture and it's just the way it is?

How is it that so many people people are obsessed with regulating the behavior and public access of such a tiny group of people? Statistically, there's a good chance that almost no one arguing about trans issues even know a single trans person. At best, they see depictions on TV and that's it.

I'm rewriting my 10 page  webisode pilot and am trying to condense and trim back a few things on my pilot in order to flesh out a few small aspects on my project.

I'm trying to work on my pacing some and still trying to keep my characters distinct, the theme more prevalent and I got a decent protagonist and am trying to keep her as her own worst enemy. I 'm mostly curious if my work is engaging and can hold interest.

This is the mundane part of the script before she peruses the gangster for the reward and then the supernatural stuff. I wanted to create someone who is sympathetic and easy to root for when things go south.

Any feedback is appreciated and my work should only eat up a few minutes of your time."	0	26	0.5

I've been playing pokémon for over 12 years at this point, I started out with Diamond when I was 6 and have played every main series game up until now. So, I'm by no means a ""veteran"" at all, but I've been around the block. This game is significantly easier than some of the previous titles and I will admit it has its issues, such as Team Yell being super lame (Team Galactic is the best ever) and also the game feeling a tad too linear. However, I'm still enjoying it quite a bit, I try to remember this is a game made for kids. Plus, going into college this fall, I enjoy how it's a little easier due to lack of time I have to just sit down and play for hours on end. Not having the full dex sucks, but I already have a living dex from gens 1 - 5. Anyways, I am enjoying the games and I'm incredibly hyped for getting Scarlet this November. I know people complain a lot, and many are valid, but I personally enjoy the new goofy little hats and having the legendaries at the start, it's almost like Toothless and Hiccup from HTTYD. It helps you bond with them more and hopefully their will be some cool bonding moments. 

TL;DR

Pokemon S&amp;S is actually fun, I will no longer let other people's influence decide whether or not I play a game.

Edit: Thank you for bringing to my attention many of the gripes some people have with the games. I understand them and I agree for the most part. Still, I enjoy the games personally and that's what matters to me.

Edit #2: Damn, I wasn't expecting the level of ferocity in the comments. I enjoy the discourse however, it's fun hearing everyone's opinions. Like I've also said, this post is a lot about me learning that online communities and things like that shouldn't influence how I view a game. That may seem stupid, but a lot of people haven't opened their eyes to that, so I was just sharing that I have. If you haven't, you should too."	3502	1617	0.74

By attacking I mean things like “are you a scuba diver because your head is so far up your ass”. No one asked. 

I’m really conflicted on this one because I didn’t think it mattered at all, but she will not stop crying about it (I mean this literally) and it makes me feel really bad. 
EDIT NUMBER THREE: since people are still convinced that i’m in denial. i’m a lesbian. there’s nothing romantic. 
also, a commentor asked why we did not add “bro/sis” after the words… we might actually do that now, it just hadn’t come up. 

EDIT NUMBER TWO: …I saw a comment that says that I’m “in denial about my feelings”… no words. That sort of mentality is the problem, we’re basically siblings. Girls and guys can be just friends, it is possible. 

Edit for random context: 
1) Devon does not want to remove the tattoo either, nor does he want me to remove it 
2) We have never been together romantically at any point in our friendship. 
3) We’ve both had issues with our mental health and we’ve been the only ones to help each other through it, over family, other friends, and partners. The ‘light’ concept is because we brought light into the other’s world when it felt completely hopeless. 
4) Bianca said that because I was a girl, the tattoo meant something else, and she wouldn’t have cared if I were a guy. 
5) Reiterating that when we say “I love you” it’s completely platonic. But we’ve been through a lot together, how could we not love each other? I have other friends who I say it to also (maybe not as much) but its not an exclusive thing at all). He’s the same with his other friends. Also it has meaning for us, especially me. I went through a period where I constantly felt unworthy of love and unloveable and him being there for me and bringing me out of that mindset means a lot and will always stay with me. 

So basically, I (19f) have been best friends with “Devon” (20m) since we were teenagers, around 13-14 years old. We have been extremely close since then, and his friendship means more to me than any other relationship in my life. When we were around 16, he casually said “hey maybe we should get matching tattoos to remind us that we’re always there for each other” and I said it sounded cool and it wasn’t really mentioned again (we were minors so it wasn’t exactly plausible). 

But recently, we passed a tattoo place and I joked “remember when were younger and we wanted to get matching tattoos” which led to a discussion leading up to us deciding that we wanted to do it for real. We took a few days to decide on the design (my friend is a graphic designer so she made it for us), but it’s basically a lightbulb shaped like a heart with the words ‘i’ll be your light, love you always’ sort of woven through the image. The lightbulb thing is an inside thing between us, and we always say “love you/i love you,” so it wasn’t anything off putting. 

And then the day before the appointment was scheduled, Devon’s girlfriend “Bianca” came up to me hysterically, saying that we couldn’t go through with the tattoos (I’m assuming Devon must have told her). She didn’t really give me any room to speak, but she talked a lot about how uncomfortable the idea made her (they’ve been in an extremely serious relationship for a while, and he was starting to consider proposal). But I told her that I was still getting the tattoo, as Devon had been an important part of my life for years, and meant a lot to me. And the tattoo was our idea together, not just mine.

Obviously, we went through with it, and it felt really nice for a while… until Bianca called me and started freaking out. Apparently I’m a horrible person and the tattoo was too romantic (even though it WAS NOT. We’re just extremely close friends. I’m sure she has friends she would say “I love you” to. It’s not a big deal). But now she’s saying she wants it to be removed and I really don’t know what to do. Because on one hand, I don’t want to be responsible for ruining Devon’s relationship/possible marriage, but on the other hand, I do not want to get rid of the tattoo."	6588	3594	0.91

My SIL used to be a drug addict, with no stable job and trapped in toxic relationships, till she got pregnant 2 years ago, but ended up miscarrying cause of her unhinged behaviour, which left her a mark on her. Since then she turned her life around, accepted to get help for her addiction and she's clean and has a stable income.  

However, there's still one problem with her : she still mourns her lost pregnancy almost everytime we see her, which I understood initially, as it would be a pretty big trauma for everyone, but it's been years since then and her pity parties already got pretty old, especially ( and I know I might sound cynical ) when her lost pregnancy was what made her turn her life around for the better.

Fast forward, I (28F) got pregnant with my husband of 3 years (29M) and yesterday we made a gender reveal party for our families ( it's a boy btw ). His sister was of course there and not long after the reveal she started to reminiscence about much she'd wanted to become a mother as well and how much she got affected by her pregnancy. I quickly got sick of this, as not only she was once again pulling this stunt, but she was doing at my gender reveal in order to get all the attention on her.

And so I told her that she should reconsider her miscarriage as a blessing in disguise, as it finally gave her the help she needed to turn her life around. She looked shocked at me and then asked me if I seriously think that her miscarriage was a good thing. I told her that considering that back then she was a drug addict who was changing her jobs and partners faster than sockets, with a father who wasn't in the picture ( at least that's what she told us, but knowing her past lifestyle I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't even know who the father was and was too embarrassed to tell us ), it's probably for the better that her child wasn't brought into the world in these conditions. After that she, together with my parents-in-law, started blowing off at me, telling me that just because I lack empathy doesn't mean I get to reduce her trauma to a good thing.

My husband intervened and finally managed to calm them down and the party ended abruptly. After everyone left, my husband took aside and told me that what I said was really out of line and my pregnancy hormones aren't an excuse to act so unhinged. That made me blew off at me, telling him to cut the misogynistic crap about pregnant women being out of control, as there was nothing unhinged about what I said to his sister, it was just the rational truth and if he wants to see unhinged behaviour, he should look no further than his own family. 

He got too ashamed to say anything else after that and I made him sleep on the couch, so I wouldn't need to hear any more BS coming from his mouth.

My husband, if I send him to the store for a few things, will come back with a ton of stuff I didn’t put on the list. 

Today, the chicken I took out of the freezer for dinner smelled funky. I was frustrated so we just picked up some chicken from the Publix deli. We decided to see if the frozen veggies we usually get are on sale. They are. I’m looking for the bag of sea salt &amp; pepper brussel sprouts and my husband is like “those aren’t the ones we get. The ones we get are sauced”. No. This is what we get. Birds Eye has these, plain, and the oven roasted. 

Eventually I give up and I’m just like “okay whatever. These are the ones I’m getting”. We get home. I make them. He looks in the bag. “Oh. Maybe these are the ones we get.” Tastes them. “Yeah these are the ones we get.” NO SHIT. IM THE ONE THAT DOES OUR SHOPPING. I KNOW WHAT WE GET. -.-

I am very detail oriented and planned my/our wedding with my husband very meticulously. Everything was color coordinated and everything was aesthetically pleasing. Our colors were pink and black.

I wanted parents and grandparents to also wear our wedding colors so the wedding photos would be cohesive. I specifically spoke with each person and told them the color scheme and how I would very much like everyone to color coordinate. Nobody had an issue with this, so I thought. 

Both sets husbands grandparents went out shopping to find clothes to explicitly match our wedding party. I thought that was so cute and appreciated it immensely. My mom and I went shopping for my grandparents, because they asked us to. So they were also matching.

I offered to take my mother in law shopping to pick out something to wear but she declined and said she would go with her friends. I said okay and kind of forgot about it. The night of the rehearsal, my mom asks my MIL what she is wearing and she responds with a long dress in the wedding colors. 

Next day I am getting ready in the bridal suite And my MIL moseys on up and is wearing a royal purple ball gown. She doesn’t wear makeup that often, and I was shocked to see she was wearing neon blue eyeshadow and bright pink lipstick. Her husband wore a matching tie. I was livid, but ignored it because I didn’t want it to ruin my big day. 

My FIL asked me how he looked  during pictures and I responded “you and MIL stick out like big sore purple thumbs”. He asked what that was supposed to mean, and I told him that they knew the dress code. Now they look out of place. He said he wore was given to him and would relay the message to my MIL. 

My mother in law approached me later in the night and asked me my issue. I asked her why she lied about her outfit choice. She said she never bought a dress that would go with our wedding colors and planned on wearing the purple dress she found. It was more true to her and that’s what mattered. I said that’s fine, I’ll fix the pictures in post production. She said I would not adjust anything, they paid for the pictures and I would not alter anything. 

I said, any picture I post with her in it will be altered on my end, so they have no control of what I do. I excused myself and enjoyed the rest of my wedding. 

My MIL has a habit of trying to make things about her and make little comments like “well I am the mother of the groom, my opinion counts.” Or “I can make decisions too, I’m the mother of the groom and we are helping pay for this wedding”. 

My parents paid for 70% of the wedding my in laws paid for the photographer and the rehearsal dinner. 

The photographer was their friend and only charged them $800 for the whole night. The rehearsal dinner cost $300 because they chose the cheapest options for everything possible.

*** I only asked my parents, his parents, my grandparents and his grandparents to please wear black and pink. All the men wore black tuxes and pink or black ties. The women minus my mil wore black dresses or pink dresses. 
NO OTHER GUEST HAD STIPULATIONS TO THEIR ATTIRE EXCEPT “Please wear formal attire”.

+++Edit: My FIL knew about the color scheme, and went along with my mother in laws plan because he wanted to prove a point. 

+++My MIL went out and purchased the purple dress when she had a beautiful black dress in her closet."	6684	2086	0.96

We are both nurses in Australia, I'm 10 years her senior. I have worked every Sunday night 9pm to 7.30am on my own for 8 months, and before that every second Sunday for 5 years, until the other Sunday worker decided she didn't want them. J has not worked Sundays before. My unit self-rosters and because I've been given the same shifts every fortnight for months now, I don't usually bother filling in the template. J left it on the bench tonight and has rostered herself for a Sunday night coming up. Now, we don't ""own"" a shift, but this particular Sunday night rolls into a holiday so after midnight we are paid 250% of our normal rate. She's going away the next day for 2 weeks, and has also requested the Sunday the week she gets back (I am irritated about this one, but less than the first one). She's done this because the 2 weeks she is taking off are unpaid as she has no paid leave left, so she's trying to get as many shifts as possible in this week, and her first week back. I have the option to take it as a free paid day off but don't really want to. 

I feel that J shouldn't be entitled to this Sunday because I've been working that shift for so long and one of the perks of always giving up my Sundays is I get the Monday holiday rate when they come around. 

So, WIBTB for saying no I'm not giving up my shift and forcing J to be a day short for these 2 weeks?

ETA

- J was pulled up for taking loads of LWOP, leaving gaps in the roster. She was told to reduce her contract or cool it on the LWOP. It's not about money for her, whereas this will affect my bottom line. 

- We use an online program to submit patterns. I already had mine set for that roster period because I'm on holidays until late September from next week so had to submit it already so I don't miss the deadline. J only put hers in today. She doesn't want to do the 2 open shifts, so she requested that one. 

- We are meant to ask if we want to swap with someone. She didn't."	201	104	0.95

This started out as a Shang Chi jump, as even with all the problems I have with that movie, i still like the Rings. Then it became a hybrid jump with the Eternals, another movie i have alot of problems with. Then it quickly developed into a MCU jump, using the jump i'd started making for MCU last year to combine them all into one. Now, there are many perks and items missing, that I didnt add because other MCU jumps have them, and I didn't manage to create the perks/items with my own text for them. There are also a lot of companions missing, for now, but i deemed this a functional v1.0 for the jump, and I'm more likely to continue update it with a version already posted alongside feedback from the community.

I am trying something new, which I started with the Cyberpunk Edgerunner jump, which is pictures accompanying certain aspects of the jump. Mostly the companions for now. I also added a What If section, mostly because I was tempted with going for a Generic MCU jump. Might change it towards that in the future, or scrap it if people don't like it.

So here it is. Tell me what you think

I get it! Restaurants charge a lot for food and service. Servers should be paid a LIVING wage (not minimum wage) and tips should be optional and not expected. But screwing over a server by not paying them tips is not gonna achieve that goal,  the best case scenario is that they will quit and look for a job that could very well pay them less, and the worst case scenario is that they won't make rent that month or be able to buy food for themselves. Keep in mind many servers make a base pay per hour (not including tips) that is so low, that all of it goes towards taxes.

Until servers are payed an hourly LIVING wage, it doesn't matter. They need the tips to survive. I'm sorry to break it to some of the people on this sub, but $15 an hour is not a living wage. It should be around 25-45 dollars an hour depending on what area you live in. Or we could just abolish the whole system altogether and have food, water, shelter, and clothing be a human right

If you have a personal gripe with how much you pay for restaurant food, don't eat at a restaurant. Go get fast food or takeout. If you have the time to sit in a restaurant, and the money to pay for a food there (not including service fees), then you have the time and money to buy and cook food yourself. 

Encouraging people to quit their jobs works on a case by case basis - I don't want anyone here to end up in a position where they don't have the money needed to survive. But surely shorting someone out of their money after their labor is not the right way to encourage them to quit their job, cmon"	6281	3010	0.8

I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.

He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.

AITA?

I used to do a lot of outdoor sports photography and really needed the weather-proof, sturdy build that these things bring to the table. Paired with the wide range of fast, sharp lenses it gave me all I ever wanted.

In the last few years, I started shooting more for myself and mostly used the camera for traveling and usually only brought the 24-70. But that's a bulky, heavy kit to walk around in a city or hiking mountains. Also, in poorer regions of the world, it screams ""professional/expensive"" since it really stands out in regards of size, which made mit not use it as often as I maybe could have.

Now of course I still love it's performance in low light, the fast lens, the details the big sensor gives me and the all around performance of the system. But I am starting to think about changing to a smaller system - if there is one that performs similarly. I would be willing to sell my gear and even invest some money if that means I'm getting a good alternative.

Question: Has anyone ever moved on from a pro setup // full frame like the 5D to something smaller like Fuji's X-T4/5 and hasn't regretted it? If so: what system did you move to?

Before we ever met she and her sister had been working on her being a surrogate for her sister and her sister's husband. Global things delayed that, we talked about her agreement before we got together and now she's pregnant for them. She is staying with them for now but she comes over to my place frequently to spend time with me when she's free. Its not so bad but either she raids my kitchen or she complains nothing looks good and wanted me to keep some of her for-sure cravings on hand. 

My parents came to visit me and asked me if I wanted them to pick anything up for me on their way. They had to pass one of my favorite restaurants to get here so I said yes. They showed up, we visited with each other. I ate a little bit of what they brought me since I wasn't really hungry yet and put the rest in the fridge for dinner that night. My girlfriend wound up coming over for a bit after they left. She got hungry and wanted a snack, and came out with the container I put my leftovers in and goes ""Can I have some of this?""

I told her yes. She came back with a plate and she didn't take some of it, she took all of it and put all kinds of shit on it so we couldn't even share. I told her that I said she could have some and she just ate all of what I intended to have for dinner so I asked her to either send me money to pay for so I could go get some myself, or she could make the drive and get me another order. She didn't want to drive that far and she didn't think she should have to pay me anything. I told her she should because it'd just be nice of her to do since I get she gets cravings but it's not like she's pregnant with my kid or we live together. She left at that point, left half the food uneaten and I wouldn't eat it cause of what she put on it. A couple hours later my mother called. My gf text her about what happened. My mom gave me an earful about how I have no idea what its like for my gf right now and I need to be supportive and let things go."	13169	3386	0.93

Maybe the show gets a lot better in future arcs, but so far JJk had a better story, better characters, and even a better power system. I also find the humor in Chainsaw Man to extremely cringe, and a lot of the social interactions in the show just seem disconnected.

For context, I (25F) got married in November. My MIL doesn't really like me, even trying to steal the spotlight at my wedding, but is still overly traditional. At Thanksgiving, I was having a really bad hair day so I wore a black leather cap (a dressier newsboy-style one), which my husband said looked great on me. The holiday was hostile, even more so than prior gatherings I'd been to, and hubby said MIL said it was because I wore a hat, but I know it was just an excuse. I told MIL I wouldn't come to Christmas with them, then blocked her number and Facebook.

My husband is trying to keep us both happy since he doesn't like conflict. He wants me to come to one more celebration to see if maybe people are getting used to me. He’s told MIL she needs to be nice and treat me as part of the family since I am and that if I feel unwelcome at Christmas like I did at Thanksgiving, that we won’t attend future events and she see him much anymore. I understand why he wants me to give her one final chance and haven’t had any conflict with him. Marriage is about compromise and I get that he doesn’t want to cut her off since she’s his mother, but I just don’t want to be involved with her unless I have to be.

I wanted to see if MIL was listening to him so I asked my husband to request that I be allowed to wear the same hat to Christmas. Hubby said he thought I’d worn it since I had a bad hair day, but this time it’s as a statement that they shouldn’t treat me as an outsider, either because I wear hats all the time (right now it’s just a sports visor, which I’d never wear to a holiday, so it’s not like I’m doing that) or they just don’t like me. If they won’t let me wear a hat, what else are they going to restrict about me? Let me be me or I won’t come. Period.

My husband agreed and relayed this to MIL and she’s been asking him why he married the devil. He’s growing tense with me and I told him he’ll probably have to pick a side sooner or later and that I never intended it that way. He spent last night at a friend’s house because he needed to think. I feel bad because I care about him and know conflict stresses him out. I told him to text me when he was ready to talk. He hasn't yet.

My friends think that my hat request was unnecessary, and maybe I strained my relationship with my husband. I think he just needed space to think because conflict stresses him out, so I gotta ask: AITA for saying I won't come if I don't wear a hat?

UPDATE: My husband just texted me saying he just got off the phone with his mother. He told her off for calling me ""the devil"" and said that if I can't wear a hat, he's not coming either, and that she really should get over her antiquated BS. She did not respond well. I don't think we're going to Christmas there now so maybe we'll have a Friendmas? IDK! We'll think of something."	13798	5177	0.92

Guys, I’m tired. 

My almost 2.5 y/o is constantly throwing things, often hitting me (this has been going on for too long), biting, overall just driving me into the ground. 

Did I mention the whining and the tantrums? I love him so much, but seriously he’s a drama queen. (I was too so some of this is karma)

I’m a SAHM, pregnant with our second and just not sure how much more I can take.

I try to be “gentle” but not permissive. I am not the star student of gentle parenting and I don’t think I ever will be, but I don’t full on lose my cool. I use time out, but I’m trying to figure out how else to set my boundaries and be firm with my son without constant timeouts. I know it is partly normal (I’m hoping at least) for his age, but I also know I am clearly not in control here. I’m just looking for advice I guess. Solidarity would be great too, I’ll even take pity at this point! 

He also keeps asking me to draw people crying, or asking me to “cry” (fake crying is hilarious to him) and being so burned out I’m getting to where I’m questioning if I’m raising a little psychopath. Most days I can see that’s not actually the case, but again guys I am so tired. 

If anybody has been through similar, I imagine plenty have, and survived to have a great child and be a capable parent please chime in because I can’t see the forest through the trees today. Thank you!!"	1	4	1.0

The condition of the house was not represented in a way that I feel was appropriate.  
 
From the sellers disclosure, the furnace and roof were both under 10 years old. I think they wrote random numbers that seemed attractive to buyers. 
- The furnace was actually 21 years older than they listed, broken, and needed immediate replacement (10k) 
- The roof is 14 years older than stated, end of life, minor leaks since purchase, and needs replacement (14k)

Other misc things that weren’t on the disclosure or weren’t represented in an honest way: chimney is leaking (5k), water in basement when it rains, dishwasher wasn’t hooked up, slider door broken (7k), sump pump broken. 

I budgeted enough to absorb some of these expenses but the roof and chimney (20k+) weren’t on my radar and it had been a huge relief at the time of purchase that the roof wasn’t that old (purportedly) since I knew other things needed attention. 

Is there any recourse here or can the seller just write down random numbers on the disclosure form and get max price for a house they didn’t maintain? My realtor also told me the roof was 8-9 years old, likely based on info he got from the sellers realtor. I’m currently trying to get more info from my realtor but I’m not sure how to proceed.

Edit: Inspection happened after closing, inspections were simply not happening in my city earlier this year. My offer was accepted contingent on waiving the inspection (I was able to get a basement inspection at least), and based on the info I had at the time I was not expecting the major issues that have emerged. I wouldn’t be able to buy at the current rates in reality; this year has been lose/lose for FTHBs in my region. 
This post is about current options, I can’t time travel so please don’t waste your breath with tsk-tsk’ing. We all know the purpose and benefit of inspections, and we all know that it’s been nearly impossible to get an offer with inspection accepted in some cities."	7	221	0.53

Sometimes we can earn more or even sacrifice some salary and buy more holiday but the company has to let us have it. You have to consult with your manager and plan a little but it is still there and in most cases forced to take.

So seeing lots of posts here with people being denied time off is ridiculous. I understand there's lots of businesses that rely on exploitation so as soon as 1 person is off for a day then everything falls apart but surely then that business shouldn't survive?

Could some Americans enlighten me as to how the country would react if paid sick and leave (say starting with 4 weeks per year) were put into law and every business had to follow?"	9	20	0.92

Ancap believes that EVERYTHING should be privatized.

I believe that EVERYTHING should be privatized, including the state and government.

That means cities like Prospera is very legitimate in my book.

And for some reasons, Ancaps disagree with me.

Say you buy an apartment, is that morally correct? Sure you can buy anything. An Apartment is on top of some land and thousands of years ago those land are conquered from..... yada yada yada... Look, we don't really need to go that far. Besides if after a few hundred years old the exchange is peaceful with lots of up and down, it's still legitimate. The price of the land depends on civilization that build the land anyway. A little compensation to past wrongdoing could fix that issue if that's an issue in the first place.

Say your apartments are owned by some owners. So you buy an apartment, but the apartment building is owned by a corporation. Is that legitimate? Yes.

The owners have rules that you have to agree with before buying apartment? So. No problem.

That means the apartment building has rulers. Namely the owners. Yap. No problemo.

Say 1k people live in that apartment building. In democratic countries, politicians need votes. In non democratic countries they need warriors. Don't want to antagonize 1k people. So the rules tend to favor 1k people. See there are strength in number. You want freedom? You need a balance between individualism and collectivism. Too individualists and you are weak. With common goals, we have numbers, with numbers we have power. Collectivism can help that. Too collectivist we're not free.

Still, whether the apartment practice individualism or collectivism, it's not going to be a big a deal. You don't like it you just don't buy it. In some apartments, for example, the building owners decide where I can get internet. That sucks. But yea it's part of the deal.

Then the building owners say, okay apartment owners, you now own building per contract. Tada you have democratic apartment. Every apartment owners can vote once. Usually there are arrangements where the votes are weighted by number of apartment owners have but can be vetoed by another body where each guy vote once. Basically it prevents someone that own 51% of apartments to make bad deals. I am sure it's in the contract too.

Then what?

Then similar process happened again. This time with a city. A corporation build a city. Who owned the city? The corporation.

**A city is just a very big apartment.**

Does this violate any NAP? Nope. If every single person agreed on explicit contract, no unreasonable or deceitful terms, it's all fair and game. City is just very big apartments. Roads are just big corridors.

As 10k - 1 million people live in the city, then we start having powah. Perhaps a city can just legalize drugs. Again, politicians not wanting to antagonize 1 million people will just say, hey, it's your city.

Unlike apartments, people come and go to the city. How do we prevent commies from coming in and vote socialism.

Let's go back to apartment. How do we prevent commies from coming in and vote socialism? Well, the voters need to own an apartment. Not everybody can vote. Renters don't vote. Visitors don't vote.

Same with cities. It's a private property. The whole city is a private property. The owners, or collective owners can make the rules.

Just like only apartment owners can vote in apartments, we can arrange that only land owners can vote.

That's just private property. No violation of NAP here.

What about commies coming in and buy lots of apartments and turn socialism? Well. Socialism sucks. But that still doesn't violate NAP. Whoever want to sell those apartment to commies get money right? They just use the money to buy another apartment.

It'll be like Elon buying twitter and change the policies. Well, he bought it.

If apartment owners want some socialism, like buying an ambulance to more quickly transport sick resident out? Who cares. If owners of the building collectively agree (say by majority vote) to buy that, then that's legitimate. It's like a corporation agreeing to buy new buildings or new cars. Besides, the ambulance may increase valuation of your apartment.

The same way socialized government facility may not always be wrong. If we own shares in a corporation and the corporation own a city and that corporation wants to build road, that doesn't violate NAP.

The difference between this and democracy is that private companies that want to max out profit tend to do things cost effectively. Will this road make people want to live in my city? If so will that means the valuation of corporate share go up? If so, build the road. If not, don't build it. Even shareholders that do not like the road will benefit from the road if the roads increase citizenship/shares price.

In democracy, most public utilities are build cost ineffectively and only benefit a fraction of voters, often those that contribute the least to the economy and well being of the state. Public schools and welfare, for example, mainly benefit people that contribute nothing to the economy and pay the least amount of tax.

So that's the practical differences. Private companies being run for profit tend to be best at providing anything, including a libertarian place to live.

Another difference is the principal aspect. It's a private apartments/cities/countries. Owners should have the right to decide what they want to build.

It should be kosher in Ancap books and it is indeed practically economically efficient just as any private firms.

If we collectively own a corporation, then we can vote for what the corporation do. The same way if we collectively own a city, we can vote for what the city do. No violation of NAP. Just make sure anyone coming in agree to the rule and anyone wanting to also own share in the city should sign explicit contract.

Some people would say, what happened to the guy that are born in the city?

The same thing with people that are born in an apartment.

He is still subject to the rules of apartment.

Can he vote? When he bought his own apartment/apartment shares/city shares.

Simple.

What about country?

Can we have a country that is both democratic and yet doesn't violate any ANCAP principle.

Yes.

Same principle with apartment. The country should have clear owners. The voting power and right over the country should be obtainable through capitalistic mean.

**A country is just a very big city**

And that's not even always true. Singapore, for example, is a country smaller than Jakarta, a city.

The only differences between Ancap ""Kosher"" cities/countries and oppressively democratic countries is simple.

1. Do the apartments/cities/country have clear owners
2. Do shares in apartments/cities/countries obtainable through capitalistic mean.

That is why I reach a very different conclusion than most Ancaps.

Why eliminate government?

Just privatize government. Make states and government to have rights and obligation more similar to private corporation.

What about cradle to grave welfare recipients? Well. They can't vote right? In cities, we can just tell them to get out. The city is a private property. You can tell people to get out. You can demand entry tickets for those coming in. Head tax in private property is like Disneyland's entry tickets. Again, nothing violating NAP here.

Countries cannot just banish citizens. Or can they? Yea you can always make deals with normal democratic countries to get paid to accept your banished citizens. Besides those banished citizens own share of our ancapnistan and those share worth some money. They can start of again outside and came back when they're rich.

Just like in apartment buildings.

People can't afford buying an apartment in an apartment, yea they move out to other apartments. I don't see how cities and countries should be any differences."	0	19	0.27

I was with my best friend and her boyfriend. He sourced the tabs. We all had never tried it. They put it on their tongues, as did I, and eventually they spat it out and thought it was a dud. I kept it in until it dissolved. Here’s what I remember and I remember it all vividly..

We were watching broad city on mute, and laughing at their facial expressions. The dude (bf) had a laughing fit and he got ‘stuck’ and couldn’t stop until my best friend (his girlfriend) had to forcibly restrain his body. We all at this stage didn’t feel anything major but sort of just like a weed high giddiness. We then all went into another room and there it started. I looked at him, and like a movie the world slowed, he and her were in slow motion and I saw blue and red auras around them. It was as if I was watching a 3D movie without the glasses on. He had millions of fingers when he tried to gesture and I was in a transient state as they both acted envious of my experiences on it. The oxygen turned to water and every movement and sound was a melody on scripture paper. Anyways, My best friend left to have a shower and I waited for her for 3 hrs as her boyfriend was alone in his room. I went to my guest bedroom and decided to change. I closed the door and only had a lamp on. I looked down at my feet and my entire body had spagettified as if my feet were being sucked down to a singularity. I tried to dress myself but then I saw two black hands with long skinny fingers wrap over my two shoulders and into my view. This dark figure dressed me and I remember thinking ‘who are you?’ As well as being confused for help. I tried to look at his face but he disappeared back into the corner of the room. He was at least 7 ft tall as well, because I remember feeling the height even from behind me. He didn’t speak, but he attached himself to me like a wave of melancholy, death and darkness. 

After this seemingly 3 hr time warp, I went back to knock on the shower door and my friend said ‘yeah I’m coming out I just got in basically’. After I told her I thought I got stuck in a different realm, she showed me the time and it had in fact been 10 minutes. I was certain it had been 3 hrs, and I remember after I shut the guest bedroom door it felt soundproof and distant from reality. 

We then went for a walk as her boyfriend parading the idea that nature is supposed to be fun when you’re tripping. I heard screaming on the walk but couldn’t differentiate reality from my delusions. But then an old lady stepped out from her house in a robe and talked to us and asked if we heard the screaming, and we got scared and said no and shuffled away. I looked in this ladies eyes, and she had pins for eyes, or simply no eyes at all. She spoke, but her face did not move, and her mouth was open and not workable, as if the nerves didn’t work or something. 

We got back to his place, and it was time for bed as they felt like the effects were wearing off, but for me I was wide eyed awake for 12 hrs in total. They remember their experience as mediocre as I remember being forced into a dark, welcoming realm. I didn’t sleep a wink for the wide- eyed 12 hrs straight, but I wasn’t alone in the guest bedroom, because I had a visitor.  A voice came into my mind and ears and I listened as I laid on the bed. He told me he wasn’t from earth, and that I don’t know him. But he felt safe as a general vibe. He told me ‘the (my name) who’s awake will understand better than the one that’s here now’. He welcomed me to the dimension he was in, and he said welcome to the realm. He said as a slight warning and also invitation. “If you want to miss out on the current reality you’re in… which is life by the way… then you can continue to do that and there’s nothing the human race can do to stop you”. He wanted me to decide to move onto a new realm or stay. I knew I had entered a glitch, and slipped into another dimension, and I wanted to leave. But he was there with an inviting tone in his voice as well as letting me decide. As I was frozen, he sped up the time to 5am and I checked my phone and he was right, and time had in fact sped up. He let me decide my fate with this tone of ‘this isn’t the last time we will meet’ and I felt him leave my mind and presence as the sun filled the room with light. 

I’ll never forget the experiences of being alone on LSD. And whatever door I opened, has traumatised me since. All in all it was a bad trip and haunted me as I felt lost and alone and my 2 friends were fine. Have never done it again but always had been curious if I would meet him again, or the puppet man. I explained my experiences to multiple people and every person has been shocked.

Edit: I know the exact date because I wrote in my notes app the things this ‘being’ was telling me so as to not forget when I went back to ‘the normal’ realm. I also acknowledge that I story tell in a novel- like way so can understand why it seems fiction but ask any question about the night and I can tell you what I know and remember."	8	33	0.78

I’ve had frequent dreams of being chased by police or arrested.	https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/10s0oki/what_do_dreams_of_police_mean_ive_had_frequent/	Woke up from a dream that I was being chased by police on the road with my entire family in the car, even my cat. They said something on the speakers that I forget, before shooting like a rocket launcher at our vehicle which missed twice and the third one hit and spiraled us off course and crashed. No one died. I was the first one out with my hands up but I was angry at the police, but didn’t express it just felt it. I think it’s cause maybe they could’ve hurt my cat. Even the cat put his hands up which is weird and funny now that I think about it. Also they lined us up after handcuffing us and I was in the lead even before my parent.	8	4	1.0

The core of my struggle is that it’s fake, so I’m not grasping the full extent of why it’s so upsetting to the people getting their faces taken. 

I get the legal pov, the fact of using someone’s likeness, from a business perspective I get it being a problem. Also just someone profiting without consent or paying the person is for sure not cool from a copyright perspective. 

I can also understand a broad scale perspective how it seems to tie in with stalking and dangerous behaviours. That part of the upset, as it being a scary cog of a scary machine, I can see that. 

I get how revenge porn is upsetting, that’s a breach of trust. 

But on its own, in isolation, it feels like a meme, like a joke, like someone photoshopping something of someone. I struggle to see the difference, just cause it’s fake, it’s like that’s an obstacle to something in my brain.  

The body dismorphia pov I get, I can see how the comparison would be disturbing. 

But on its own, I don’t get it. Maybe cause when I imagine someone doing it to me I think of it as a stupid joke. I just can’t see myself getting bothered outside of the money aspect.

Update: thanks to your comments, I can see how this is a matter of truth. I can now see how something like this affects peoples connection to the truth. Jokes are beautifully done lies, where the risks are minimized. But these videos aren’t jokes nor are they meant to be. On their own, these videos in isolation, they put the truth at risk, and that’s what I was missing. Thank you very much."	18	52	0.77

Before the conversation (this being the 3rd or 4th one) between us and them in the fall, it got to the point in-laws would completely ignore me no matter if husband and/or our children where around, smart mouth comments, telling us they would be going (with our children) to one place (a day trip) only to go in the complete opposite direction hours away and when our children asked if they should call us to let us know (kids didn't haven't a phone at this time, honestly this is the reason they got a phone to take with them anytime they went with in-laws) in-laws replied with, ""no, they will figure it how when we drop yall back off to them"", in-laws getting mad/upset because they have been told to follow different rules since kids are getting older, telling our children to go against our rules (that they as well as the kids have been told about before hand) and then getting mad with kids and me because our kids refused to go against the rules they know and yes it was throwed back in our face that our child told FIL ""no, if my mom has changed that rule then i need to hear it from her"". had the nerve to tell us(yelled it at me in front of husband and kids) they were not ok with us (the parents) taking our kids on a trip to see family who leaves states away all because we told them no they couldn't take our children 8 hours away by themselves for a few days but we could all go as a family. That didn't sit well because MIL laughed in our faces when we offered that compromise and and said if we (husband and i) are there then there isn'ta reason for thrm to be there. So now after the last conversation the disrespect was addressed and told it would not continue, we'll after 3.5 months they are back to doing it again, they are going all the way around me thinking they will get there way, lying to me saying husband contacts them about seeing the kids and when I call them out on the lies (because husband doesn't do that and keeps me fully informed/ involved when in-laws try to go through him) they act like they didn't even hear me or they act like they are entitled to our children. I am on my personal final straw with these in-laws (husband said he is about to the point of just walking away from them but doesn't want to deal with the hurt feelings/ guilt trips they will throw at him because  he knows that is what will happen (his words- I grew up having to deal with them every other weekend, they act the same now as they did then, their love /affection is conditional not unconditional). I honestly don't know how much I am suppose to keep giving nor do I think/feel I have more than an ounce left for them. I have tried to keep a calm face and some kind of a relationship going with in-laws because I know they care about our kids and my husband and I am trying very hard not to completely cut them out due to hoping my kids and husband can have some sort of a good relationship with them but I am at a dead end with the disrespect.

The only command the dog knows is sit, but the worst thing is that he is mouthy and will jump on people when they come through the door. It didn't use to be a problem when he was a puppy, but now that he weighs almost 40 pounds it's quite the problem. This past friday they insisted I come over for drinks instead of us meeting at a bar, and when I came through the door their dog came running towards me at full speed and jumped at me while Amy and her bf laughed. I put up my hands on instinct to shield my face and brace myself since I am quite short, and I ended up scratching the dog's eye with my nails. Amy and her boyfriend got really mad at me and had to take their dog to the vet later in the night because he wasn't doing well.

Today I got a text with the vet bill included, and them asking me to pay itfully, which I refused for two reasons: One, the vet bill is nearly the same amount as my rent, and I simply can't afford it without breaking the bank, and two, I've been telling them to train their damn dog for nearly a year now which they haven't done, and it lunges and chews on anything that moves.

Our friends heard of what happened through Amy, and although they haven't scolded me or sent me any direct scathing messages, I can feel that some of them think I am the asshole and that I'm not doing the right thing. As for Amy and her boyfriend, they  think that I am being an irresponsable adult and have made it clear that they themselves cannot afford the surprise expense. My roommate also thinks that I should partially help with the bill. AITA ?

EDIT for additional info: the total bill they want me to pay amounts to $1088."	2234	594	0.95

No car payments. No cc debt. One student loan with one year of payments left. No other debts. 

With our recent raises we are now earning 120k a year. 

We have been pre approved and have looked at houses. But I don’t like most of the houses that I’m seeing for sale because they are way overpriced, need work, or have some other downside. 

My fear is that I don’t want to get locked into a large mortgage payment and give up my ultra affordable mortgage payment. Our current mortgage affords us a ton of savings and purchasing power. 

At the same time my wife’s home office being shared with the living room, stone driveway, no ac and a leaky basement are getting old.

1. The broken spinning screen where you cant exit is far from user friendly nor ADA accessible (sorry, web coordinator brain talking here). 

2. A league match could take 5 minutes, 3 minutes or 7, depending on a number of factors- if your opponent is speedy with choosing cards, if they INTENTIONALLY sabotage the time knowing league end so do not tap the 'end turn' button, if they disconnect or concede the match.

3. The match was started prior to league end. Why not allow it to carry over if the player was a shield away from the next rank? Rankings are important to players for a number of reasons, one of the most important being the difference in REWARDS.
