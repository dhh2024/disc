I was diagnosed bipolar when I was sixteen years old and am now eighteen. I have been on meds for bipolar disorder since February of 2014. I've been committed to the adolescent unit of a mental hospital twice (first time at sixteen for suicidal ideation, second time at seventeen for refusing to take meds), and I stayed in a residential treatment center for two weeks when I was seventeen. I am NOT speaking out of ignorance, but rather out of concern for the millions of people who have been and will be labeled mentally ill.

There are no objective tests to see if someone is bipolar or schizophrenic, no brain scans, lab tests, blood tests, MRI's, nothing. All diagnoses are based on observable patterns of behavior; however, psychiatrists are the ones who make diagnoses and they don't have much time to observe someone's behavior. Instead, they interview them and go through a checklist of symptoms. In order to be diagnosed with depression, you only need to meet five of nine major depressive symptoms. You can't really call that objective science. The psychiatrist at the first hospital I went to diagnosed me as bipolar within five minutes of talking to me. 

Psychiatrists say that mental illnesses result from a ""chemical imbalance;"" however, no known chemical imbalances have been found. Chemical imbalance theory is relatively new and was first promoted in the 1970's in an effort to re-medicalize psychiatry and to move towards a biological model of psychiatry rather than a Freudian one. Doctors have taken brain scans of people diagnosed mentally ill before they started drug therapy and have found the patients' neurotransmitter levels to be completely normal. The whole deal with neurotransmitters is that because antidepressants were found to increase or to lower certain neurotransmitters in the brain, psychiatrists hypothesized that mental illness must be caused by too much or too little of these neurotransmitters. Do you see the flaw in that logic?! That's like saying headaches are caused by a deficiency of aspirin!

Every time I see my therapist, it's a $20 co-payment, same with my psychiatrist. The drugs used to treat mental illness actually do more harm than good. In some cases they are about as effective as a placebo or a sugar pill, and in other cases they are much worse. Researchers have done studies testing the effectiveness of well-known antidepressants vs. placebos. The antidepressants were only slightly better than the placebos, and while the difference, though small, was statistically significant, it was not clinically significant. The researchers hypothesized that the reason patients felt better on the real drug was because they felt side effects and correctly guessed that they were on the real drug, so they re-did the experiment, this time with an active placebo that caused side effects. This time, the researchers found NO DIFFERENCE between the placebo and the antidepressant. 

Many psychotropic medications are very harmful and should not be given to children. When I was on the drug Abilify, I lost control of my joints and wasn't able to write or type because I couldn't move my fingers. I didn't have control over my tongue or any of the muscles in my mouth and found it very difficult to speak. I felt intense pain in my neck and my side and was doubled over as I feebly tried to walk. I also experienced something called akathisia, a side effect of certain antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs that causes extreme restlessness, agitation, and distress. I felt the constant need to move because of this inner restlessness, and I couldn't stop talking. I was so restless that I couldn't relax and sleep. My therapist labeled all of this as a manic episode (this was after I'd already been diagnosed bipolar), despite the fact that I had NEVER acted this way before and that my inability to stay still or think clearly was very obviously drug-induced.  A couple days after being on this drug, I felt that I was about to faint and had to be rushed to the emergency room (I was already at the hospital for a blood test). There wasn't much the doctor could do except tell me to get off of Ability as soon as I could. I was later put on mood-stabilizing drugs like Zyprexa and lithium, which caused me to gain over 46 pounds. Lithium destroyed my thyroid, and long-term use of lithium can be toxic to the blood and can damage the kidneys. I'm also on a drug called Geodon, which can cause diabetes. Taking psychotropic medications has come with its own slew of health problems that I wouldn't wish on anyone, yet pharmaceutical companies have spent billions of dollars in advertising to convince the field of medicine and the general public that these drugs are safe and necessary.

Thomas Szasz, a Hungarian-born American psychiatrist said that ""mental illness"" is a myth and that mental illness is merely a metaphor for ""problems in living."" In his words, ""labeling someone with a mental disorder is stigmatization, not diagnosis, and giving them drugs is poisoning, not treatment."" Szasz, who died in 2012, was strongly against involuntary hospitalization of those labeled mentally ill and believed that all humans have the right to end their lives in the act of suicide. 

I have mixed feelings about some of Szasz's views because I do feel that my first hospitalization helped me, but it wasn't because of the psychiatrist there or the drugs I received. I only found it helpful because I was able to meet teenagers who were going through the same thing I was and we were able to encourage one another in these dark times. I'm grateful I didn't kill myself and I believe that people's lives are valuable and that it's worth it to try to keep them around; however, sometimes people are in so much emotional distress (or physical pain) that it seems that the most humane thing to do would be to let them kill themselves, rather than making them suffer through the pain. 

Mental illnesses are voted into the DSM by a team of psychiatrists. Additions to the DSM are based on opinion, not double-blind, peer-reviewed studies. In the 1970's, Robert Spitzer led the coalition to re-medicalize psychiatry and move it away from the old Freudian school of thought. The DSM-III was very different from DSM's I and II. Now most psychiatrists spend very little time on talk therapy and mostly just prescribe drugs, although my last psychiatrist was pretty nice and actually took a genuine interest in my life. A lot of what we consider to be mental illness is based on what we consider to be socially unacceptable. Homosexuality was included in the DSM for political reasons and later excluded for political reasons. Drapetomania was the name of the ""condition"" given to black slaves who fled slavery, while the term ""hysteria"" was assigned to women who did not passively obey their husbands. 

Psychiatrists receive more money from pharmaceutical companies than any other group of physicians, and big-name pharmaceutical companies help fund advocacy groups like National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (ASFP).

I personally believe that depression comes down to more than just chemicals (if chemicals even have anything to do with it), especially if someone experiences the soul-crushing, torturous depression that I once did. My deep unhappiness was built upon a pile of broken dreams and shattered hopes, and the encouragement and inspiration I received from those who believed in me is what has ultimately kept me alive, not the pills I take every day. Too often we reduce people to their chemicals, and in doing so, we dehumanize them. Too often we compare depression to diabetes or cancer, and while I think that depression is a very serious state to be in, it should not be treated like cancer or diabetes. I'm an atheist, but depression is a sickness of the soul and the spirit, and it must be treated as such."	10	10

That's never made any sense to me growing up because it implies that instead of helping those around us we should instead think of our own well being.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety growing up and many times I've heard people telling me that others have it worse than me. No shit. People out here in prison; dealing with cancer; aids; drugs; etc. If course they got it worse. Its not a fucking competition to see who has the worse life. 

How is knowing others around you have a more shittier life then you supposed to make me happy? How is looking at starving kids while stuffing my face with a cheeseburger suppose to help them?

That's like getting stabbed but your friend got shot. Am I suppose to be happy about this?

It's basically saying you can't have problems because others have it worse than you. Like I can't be happy because others have it better? 

Don't get me wrong, many people out here whine and moan about petty idiotic things for one reason or another but pain is pain. 

If everyone around you is miserable, you shouldn't be happy about it. You should help them. I'd rather give an unwanted cheeseburger a fat kid didn't want to a starving child  then force that little shit to eat it.

Are we as a society so vain and sadistic that the pain and suffering of others bring us joy?"	3	7

But what I don't agree with is the fact that they want marriage and for it to be called marriage.

Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, that's just the way it has always been. In a world where traditions and all that shit are being phased out / long forgotten, wouldn't it be nice to just keep some things from our past?

I just don't get why they can't have all the same rights and perks of marriage but just have it called something else. That way everyone wins. And if that's not good enough, then well then your just being a selfish cunt who wants everything their way.

It doesn't make you any less human to have your union with a same sex partner called something else. You want to change something that has been around for 1000s of years just to suit you. That's called selfish.

At the end of the day I don't care what they call it, this world's already broken and pretty shit as it is, but I'm just sick of gay seeing gay people whinging on my newsfeed that it's '2017 why co we have to do this'. 

I seriously don't mean to offend anyone, this is just my opinion.

However, after living in Asia and the Middle East and discovering the bidet, I've come to see it as backwards.

If you got shit on any other part of your body, would you be satisfied with a paper towel? Hell no, you'd scrub with soap and water and possibly even hand sanitizer as well.  Just because your ass isn't exposed, doesn't mean you should walk around with feces residue in your butt cheeks.  Especially on a hot day. I fail to see how wipes haven't caught on as the norm.

Edited for clarity

Edit2: This has gotten more comments than I expected. Just to be clear, I mean ""disgusting"" in the sense of swabbing your keyboard and seeing how much bacteria is on there, not ""disgusting"" like having sex with a dead corpse. Most people do a good enough job wiping with TP that they don't notice anything down there. (But I'm sure if you did an up close comparison, the Bidet/Wet Wipe user would have the cleaner bum.)

And for those who say that suicide is selfish because then your family has to suffer can go fuck themselves. Some people feel as though they are living in hell every single day and no one should have to go through that just to make someone else happy.

___SPOILERS BELOW___
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Its just amazing to me how much of a genius the director is, with all the hidden things that im still uncovering to this day through youtube videos and such. A lot of people said it got boring towards the middle, but I think it just made you want to watch it even more to figure out what the hell just happened at multiple points. The acting from everyone was perfect, and very demanding from quite a few cast members. Every interaction and thing that happened was completely realistic. The way Peter was crying at two points is something I didn't like at first,  as many people don't,  but I realized that is absolutely the way people would act in that situation, its like Ari Aster studied PTSD cases or some shit. It's also the fault of other horror movies that people expected him to not act this way, and simply seem more chill about it. The way Peter acted during the decapitation scene is also something that almost everyone I bring to the theater is confused about, and people online don't like,   but I saw absolutely nothing wrong with it, on the contrary actually. That was one of the best acted scenes I've ever seen-- That and the dinner scene.  I got hooked the first time seeing this movie after I realized it would not rely on special effects, and would instead rely on your natural evolved intuition to be scared of certain things, such as when the guy at the funeral was smiling at Charlie and when the grandma appeared in Annie's room. Shit honestly had me hooked. I knew I was in for a loopy hellride. Something people also complain about is the end. People say it was corny or it revealed too much. I think if it wasn't included it would've left out too much however,  and the old people weren't corny- thats genuinely how pagan rituals are done.   Also,  the head banging on the attic door has created its own cliche, that shits gonna stick with me.

There's a lot more I could get into but you all probably know it by now, and I want to keep this rambling concise. Just know I love this movie so much that I genuinely cry when I think about it for too long,  its just too much of a masterpiece.

edit: yes,  this means I think its better than the Exorcist,  etc..    Don't give me the ""those were better for their time"" as I've heard before because my response to that is always ""This movie could have been made back then"",  and it could have! Just think about it. The only scenes that they used CGI were the flies from the attic, and the ants.  The flies could have been real flies,  or just not there,   and the ants could have been real ants on a doll,  either way,  if people in the 60's/70's were prepared to write something like this,  they could have absolutely done it.

* Personally bought a sony camera and was better quality for 1/4th of the price
* Gopro doesn't have the best menu layout for navigating it and isn't always reliable.
* Touch screen is slow and can be unresponsive, especially if you have fat fingers
* The people I've seen buy Gopros are wannabe sports enthusiast who in reality rarely use it.
* New Gopros get priced in around 300 while you get the equivalent for 50 like a Campark
* Gopro's battery life sucks when compared to other cameras, I will even go as far as to say it has probably the worst battery life in any camera you could get.
* My Dad's Gopro we used isn't the most reliable
* Gopro cameras overheats too quickly
* Gopro cameras don't come with a wall socket just usb
* My last point just to emphasise that the video quality is just not that good compared to other cameras that are far cheaper.

If your thinking about buying a GoPro I would strongly suggest you go on Youtube and look at comparison videos to see for yourself."	0	2

Subs like r/meirl which thrive on this sanitized, ""relatable"" kind of depression are awful, because they remove the reality from the situation. They want to act like just being sad for a little bit is depression, or link specific objects and actions to being ""sad and lonely"". People shouldn't want to relate to people that are depressed. You should be striving to look at r/meirl and not laugh at all because depression is terrible and has no benefits.

People also like to throw around this idea of anxiety. It seems like 90% of society has anxiety. So then... maybe you're not unique for feeling it sometimes. Maybe the 10% of people that aren't anxious are special for not having it. So stop labeling any type of nervousness as anxiety. Just because you are worried about your exam in a week doesn't mean you should be diagnosed with anxiety.

I hate music that is made specifically to be ""sad"". Specifically, this new wave of ""emo"" rap that tries to make sadness seem to be so seductive and smooth. It's so shallow and lame, most of this music doesn't seem interested in being a genuine portrayal of the mental illness depression, but rather just ""a vibe"". There is obviously music that presents it in a much stronger and deliberate light, but artists like Lil Peep have this incredibly superficial portrayal of just ""aww so sad"".

Please don't want to try to ""relate"" to mental illness. Cause it's not nice. Just because you feel sad sometimes doesn't make you depressed.

If you are making a case that 'Muslims are human like us to' then yes, I agree.

However, randomly take one Muslim from the middle east and one random person from the west, and chances are, they will disagree on many things. Yes, people can behave properly and get along, but in a lot of cases, there will be conflict, whether large or small.

And before you add 'well Christianity too'... Yes, Christianity says a lot of things that Islam says, however, for some reason or another, Christians don't seem to take those things literally. 

Now, the majority of Muslims want or like Sharia law. More muslims believe that homosexuals should be punished, some say through death, others less extreme and say through jail.

I'm going to bring up multiple points that I think are well thought out and probably fairly controversial, or maybe just haven't been given much light, and perhaps many will agree with me. Now, On with it!

(1) Firstly, I think that if you give consent while intoxicated, you're still giving consent. I don't think that you're in the right mind to give consent, I know that drugs (of which alcohol is one) can alter your thought process. However, drinking alcohol, smoking weed, taking other drugs, were all your own choice. I have a similar opinion about overdosing. Sure, maybe you got addicted, but it was still most likely your choice to begin with. But in this situation, you chose to become intoxicated. You chose to intentionally alter your decision making, and as such the consent you give, albiet a result of alerted brain function, is your own responsibility. (1)

(2) Second, I think that if you live in an area where laws state that nobody under 18 may consent with any person over 18, statutory rape should be looked at differently. If a child tells you that they're 18, and they're not obviously younger than 16, and you can prove that they told you they were 18, then you should get off free, and they should be punished with whatever your sentence would have been. If they claim to be 18 to get sex, but you don't have sex, they should be able to be charged with conspiracy to commit a crime.  (2)

(3) I don't think that we should believe people who claimed they were raped until they can prove it. We live in a society with a legal system that is supposed to go by ""innocent until proven guilty"", an ideal that dates back even to Roman times. The accuser, potential victim, is the one upon which the burden of proof lies. It's a lot easier to fake proof of being raped than it is to prove you didn't rape anybody. As someone who has been falsely accused of rape by multiple girls, I have a very strong opinion on this. Yes, some rapists will get away, but many Innocents will be spared. I had a girl accuse me of rape because we agreed to kiss when we met up, we met up, mutually kissed, and then she felt uncomfortable and we stopped. There's nothing there for her to warrant a rape claim on, but if she changed the story a little bit, got her friend to say she saw it, and maybe a few other things, she could have gone to court with it. (3)

(4) rape kits should be important parts in determining guilt. If you wait so long a rape kit can no longer accurately determine whether or not any sexual activity happened, then your claim should be ignored unless you have other hard evidence. A rape kit can be effective up to 72 hours if I remember correctly, and 3 days is more than enough time to report. I do know that rape kits won't always be effective, such as if he was wearing a condom, in which case they should look for signs that she was forced (bruises on wrists or throat, signs of forced penetration, etc) which, while it could still be faked, is a good sign that something happened. (4)

If you'd like to dispute any of my points, please include the number of the one which you would like to dispute so I know that we're on the same page. Thank you. "	0	102

As long as you’re polite, you say “trick or treat”, and you try to have a costume (unless for some reason you can’t), you should get candy for trick or treating and not be criticized for doing so.

This opinion is mainly based off of the criticism of teenagers when they decide to go trick or treating and various laws/rules that even outlaw it in certain places. I think it’s ridiculous that even people who are still technically kids are told by adults that they’re too old, or that they’re even nasty to those older than ~12 that just want to have a good time with their friends doing something that was a big part of their childhood.

I get teenagers can be dumb and selfish sometimes - and so can older adults - but a few rotten eggs shouldn’t spoil the whole bunch."	5	6

We should be teaching women to *use their words* and explicitly communicate/understand what they want sexually, instead of scaring men into trying to mind-read their sexual partners. The Aziz Ansari incident was ultimately a confused young woman who didn’t make a definitive decision about how far she wanted to go sexually and retroactively held Aziz accountable for not determining boundaries that she herself wasn’t sure about, which is an impossibly high and hypocritical standard for men. Instead of giving men the ridiculous task of parsing out a woman’s sexual desires in situations where she herself doesn’t have that same self-knowledge, women should be responsible for determining and communicating their desires and boundaries."	27	30

That said, I still do not think it is wrong to put that out there, Because it’s actually correct! I understand that actions speak louder than words, so When a tragedy happens, my peers and I really do think, talk, empathize, and even mourn about it for a long while. And when I’m around people who do pray, they willingly mention anyone who was affected by whatever had happened. And whether you believe in that or not, I think that is a lot better than just pretending like nothings wrong and forgetting about it. Just a lot of people aren’t really in the position to do anything significant about it. They just can’t.

I’m guessing people get mad at this saying because it seems effortless and careless? I can understand that, but if they really didn’t care, they would just shrug their shoulders and forget about it. Really though, the people that say this mean well, and most of the time, “thoughts and prayers” is all they can do about it. They honestly aren’t harming anyone.

And I am not saying that this is an ideal thing to say in the event of a tragedy and that every comment that says “thoughts and prayers” should get upvoted or liked. I’m just saying that the people who get mad about that are overreacting a little.

I’m not even saying you have to agree with me, it is fine if you don’t, but this sub is called r/unpopularopinion , so this is quite frankly, just my opinion.

DVA is a literal cliche within cliches, she has this kawaii anime voice, a skin tight suit and is Korean, this character is literally FUCKING FAP BAIT for the 14 yr olds who play this game. Not to mention her in Game lore is mediocre at best; after the omnic crisis (a robotic uprising) began the Korean government used mechs piloted by GAMERS, (because that translates over for some reason) so DVA and her stereotype squad (don’t get me started) protected Korea during the omnic crisis blah blah blah.

“But op, that’s just her lore, she isn’t tha-“ YES. Yes she is.

Her abilities are bullshit, with her being able to project a cone that eats up EVERY projectile in the game because FUCK YOU THATS WHY, and that’s not including her stupid fucking taunts and voice lines, or how obnoxious micro missiles are. 

“But op, she must not be very popular with the community then, right?

FUCKING WRONG 

DVA has a fan base that has built her entire character into a fucking meme, known as munchkin dva, who drinks Mountain Dew and eats doritos because mlg gamer food or some shit. 

That’s not even mentioning the worse part...

Everybody is nice to her, there are no negative reactions to her presence at all by ANY character, the worst (as far as I know) is Widowmaker (a brainwashed overwatch founders wife turned deadly badass assassin) says “A battleground is no place for children.” 

That’s fucking IT?

Tl;dr DVA is a fucking twat of a character in lore, game, and fan base.

\- Police / Firefighters

\- K - 12 grade

\- Medicaid

\- Social security

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets talk about welfare. Regardless of how you feel about it, it exists. It costs a trillionish dollars a year.  Census says 52 million people (21%) depend on it. What are they doing with this welfare you ask? They're getting food, rent, transportation, education, healthcare and whatever else our economy offers them. Its paying to employee someone that will exchange a good or service for the recipient. Who in return is spending their money on another good or service and so on. What I'm getting at is our economy now depends on welfare recipients to stay afloat.

&amp;#x200B;

If we cut these people off and do survive the crash that would inevitably follow, we would then need to survive the pitchforks of people with nothing left to lose. So there is only one option, continue to support them. Except we're doing it badly. We're bandaging an infection that will continue to grow.  Rather than teaching them to fish we give them enough fish to live another year.

&amp;#x200B;

How do we as a country survive this trend? What do we do when we reach 30%, 40%, 50%? There is eventually going to be a tipping point.

&amp;#x200B;

We should say fuck it and educate the fuck out of our citizens. How many ex classmates do you see working at walmart, fridays, or some other menial job 10, 20 even 30 years later? This is a shame. Our citizens skills shouldn't be replaceable by people from third world countries. Some cashier at mc donalds may have been able to cure heart disease. An angry uber driver may have found a way to more efficiently store energy into electric cars. That best buy associate maybe able to build a practical quantum computer for the masses. What I'm saying is everyone should have the opportunity to thrive in our country. In doing so they will bring new products to market and create more jobs that will improve our lives and efficiency."	6	9

At the same time I feel like there isn't enough risk either and these two things are not mutually exclusive. This I believe has a direct link to higher mental issues.

If you do everything you're supposed to do and take no risks, you can live a pretty good life. This unfortunately leads to people feeling controlled, aimless, and unfulfilled.

On the other hand if you try and take a risk, such has trying to shoot for a promotion, or start a business, or try to go to school later on in life (especially with a family) and you fail you are essentially fucked. There is something to be said for with big risks come big rewards but if you fail it's very possible you ruin your life. This can lead to anxiety, paranoia, and a acute feeling of worthlessness if you fail.

I think there are several factors here that contribute to this. First everything is regulated/committee-tized/recorded. The second is lack of jobs. And the third is the low wages that plauge the western world. The forth is lack of community. Wages have been on the down swing for a very long time this has lead to a poor job market as companies know people will work for low wages because they have too. Then they offer as little jobs as possible because they know they can work thier employees to the bone.  So now if you take any kind of risk be it physical, mentally, or professionally it is possible to ruin your life, there is nothing to fall back on. Used to be you could potentially rely on your neighborhood to help you or your family but since most people nowadays barely know the names of thier next door neighbors what community is there?

Used to be even if you took a risk there was the chance you could ruin your life but at the same time there was a decent chance you could fix it in time before it all went to shit. Or if you really fucked up you could leave town and start somewhere new but now you can't do that because your history could be just a Google search away. 

 I guess what I am getting at here societal safety nets are gone so any risk someone could of taken before is now such a risk that the cons of failing is just too much risk.

For a bit of ancedotal evidence, if I lost my current job me and my family would be completely fucked. We decided to take a risk and move to Florida where there would be more work for me and my wife. We both got decent jobs but as we are just starting out in the civilian world we are having trouble building our savings for our own safety net as we used our savings from before to move here. We have lived here for about 7 months now and I have no idea who my neighbors are and not from lack of trying. If me or my wife try to take a risk right now we could have to move all the way back to Missouri to live with one of our parents if we fail. So we don't take any risks and now both of us feel constrained and without self-will when it comes to our lives."	6	5

Instead, he wasted precious police resources (up to 12 detectives for 3 weeks) just because he wanted to be a victim.

I’m just terrified of the debt I’m getting, even if I wanted a drink I’m so conservative with my money I can’t spend it on alcohol to drink that problem away. It’s so expensive for the SHIT I’m getting. Horrible food, gaining no “skills”, so what’s the point of college?  

One minor thing. My English professor is the hardest English professor in the university (not exaggerating, hardest one on rate my professor), making us read a 420 page book in one week like holy hell I have test and other classes dude I’m not losing sleep for your shit.  

I think I’m getting into a depression or something, I’m just seeing no point in anything. I’m religious so idk about you guys, but I sorta just want to die and join God."	5	11

The funny thing is, I have never once called myself a victim or did any of the above in any capacity. I wonder if maybe the fact that people who act like and call themselves victims, exaggerate their experiences, act dramatic, and even those who self diagnose are to blame for perpetuating these harmful stereotypes?

If you call yourself a victim, stop.

And stop diagnosing yourself too unless you have the qualifications to do so, so people don’t invalidate the diagnoses of those that *actually have them.*

You can either be a victim or be a survivor. Choose the latter, or make yourself and everyone else who is struggling be invalidated and treated unfairly for things that are out of their control. 

What you *can* control are your words. And your attitude. Don’t be a victim, rise above that weak mentality and quit giving everyone else a bad name.

&gt;The actual arguments advocated by Secretary Mellon had nothing to do with a ""trickle-down theory."" Mellon pointed out that, under the high income tax rates at the end of the Woodrow Wilson administration in 1921, vast sums of money had been put into tax shelters such as tax-exempt municipal bonds, instead of being invested in the private economy, where this money would create more output, incomes, and jobs. It was an argument that would be made at various times over the years by others -- and repeatedly evaded by attacks on a ""trickle-down"" theory found only in the rhetoric of opponents.  


&gt;What actually followed the cuts in tax rates in the 1920s were rising output, rising employment to produce that output, rising incomes as a result of rising tax revenues for the government because of the rising incomes, even though the tax rates had been lowered. Another consequence was that people in higher income brackets not only paid a larger total amount of taxes than before, but a higher percentage of all taxes, after what have been called ""tax cuts for the rich."" There were somewhat similar results in later years after high tax rates were cut during the John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush administrations. After the 1920s tax cuts, it was not simply that investors' incomes rose but that this was now taxable income, since the lower tax rates made it profitable to get higher returns by investing outside of tax shelters.  


&gt;The facts are unmistakably plain, for those who bother to check the facts. In 1921, when the tax rate on people making over $100,000 a year was 73%, the federal government collected a little over $700 million in income taxes, of which 30% was paid by those making over $100,000. By 1929, after a series of tax rate reductions had cut the tax rate to 24% on those making over $100,000, the federal government collected more than a billion dollars in income taxes, of which 65% was collected from those making over $100,000.  


&gt;There was nothing mysterious about this. Under the sharply rising tax rates during the Woodrow Wilson administration, fewer and fewer people reported high taxable incomes, whether by putting their money into tax-exempt securities or by any of the other ways of rearranging their financial affairs to minimize their tax liability. Under Woodrow Wilson's escalating escalating income tax rates, to pay for the high costs of the First World War, the number of people reporting taxable incomes of more than $300,000—a huge sum in the money of that era—declined from well over a thousand in 1916 to fewer than three hundred in 1921. The total amount of taxable income earned by people making over $300,000 declined by more than four-fifths during those years. Since these were years of generally rising incomes, as Mellon pointed out, there was no reason to believe that the wealthy were suddenly suffering drastic reductions in their own incomes, but considerable reason to believe that they were receiving tax-exempt incomes that did not have to be reported under existing laws at that time.  


&gt;Andrew Mellon pointed out that ""The man of large income has tended more and more to invest his capital in such a way that the tax collector cannot reach it."" The value of tax-exempt securities, he said, ""Will be greatest in the case of the wealthiest taxpayer"" and will be ""relatively worthless"" to a small investor, so that the cost of such tax losses by the government must fall on those other taxpayers ""who do not or cannot take refuge in tax-exempt securities."" Mellon called it an ""almost grotesque"" result to have ""higher taxes on all the rest in order to make up the resulting deficiency in the revenues.""

In other words, rich people have the ability to hide their wealth from the tax man (that hasn't changed) and WILL hide their wealth to limit their tax liabilities, because raising taxes on them literally incentives then to hide their money or ""go where they are treated best.""

Humans operate off incentives. Period. That's the way it is.

The not so wealthy people have no such abilities and are left to pickup the slack.

But when taxes are lowered for the rich, the incentive is now to report taxes, so more taxes are collected overall and that burden is no longer on the little guy to pickup the slack. And now the US becomes the place to go ""where you are treated the best.""

If you raise taxes on the wealthiest earners so it is no longer advantageous for them to pay such high taxes they WILL find a way to not pay those taxes.

Others cannot do that (even though I'm sure if they could, they would).

So literally it has the exact opposite effect.

Yet, attacking this fact with ""trickle down economics"" and ""tax cuts for the rich!"" Is nothing more than underhanded, dishonest rhetoric to get the common man on your side, under the illusion you're helping them, when you are doing nothing of the sort. "	6	10

1. Velcro. Many bowling shoes come with Velcro straps, as opposed to laces. This not only is convenient, it is a bit nostalgic. It’s not easy finding fashionably appropriate Velcro shoes as an adult. It brings me back to feeling like a kid! 

2. Sizing. In many shoes, my size fluctuates depending on the style/brand. I’m consistently a solid 7 in every bowling shoe. Not only is the size just accurate, they always feel extremely comfortable! Loosey-goosey in the toes, but secure on the foot. 

3. Tippy-Tappy Soles. Nothing beats the feeling and sound of the smooth bottom of bowling shoes. They make you feel like a tap dancer and glide like an ice skater. 

4. They’re Funky. Honestly, I just love the whole aesthetic of bowling shoes. With the overall “party clown” look, they really are just so ugly you can’t help but love them. Kind of like pugs, ya know? 

And no, I am not sponsored by any bowling alleys... but if you’re interested, I’ll gladly promote any/all bowling shoes if provided.

I guess I should also say younger men as well; I won't try to speak for men outside my (20, M, duh) demographic. From personal experience and talking to my friends about their relationships as well as seeing how some of them handled it, I can put forward these perspectives:

I've thought I've loved 3 girls in my life, unfortunately all of them left me (I got a lot of working on myself to do). It always went like this: at first I feel like shit, I might act out, get depressed, but it only lasts for maybe a week at most. After that I'm not necessarily back to being my happy normal self, but I'm managing. But when I think about the effort of finding other women, or see/hear about my friends or other guys I know seeing girls, I naturally get reminded of my recently past relationship, and start to compare myself to other men and my capability to get/keep women/pussy. 

The thing that makes me think what I have is just a case of me beating myself up over some fucked up idea of my lack of manhood is that as soon as I do find another girl, those aforementioned feelings and thoughts don't bother me anymore. 

Do other men go through this? Did I make a big self-discovery? Or am I looking too much into it? 

I think there's enough truth to it, since I see it a lot in myself, my male friends, and just this sadboi culture in general.

I currently use a laptop running Linux and an Android phone.

But I'm not the majority of people. The majority of people have different priorities than me, or the fat tech obsessed neckbeards of Reddit. Apple is just easier for most normal people for a multitude of reasons.

\1. Apple is better for you socially

You can use iMessage/FaceTime on Apple stuff which helps massively. Most 3rd party social media apps run much better on iPhone. 

Along with that, Apple products just bring more social capital than anything else. Apple products are seen as normal, much more than anything else. Using one brings you into that fold.

This of course only applies in the US for the most part. 

\2. Apple is better for most people technologically

Let's face it, most people are absolutely tech retarded. They're either incapable of learning how to use technology, or in most cases they just don't care about that nerd shit. 

Apple makes it so that the end user just never sees the complicated shit and all they see is beautiful animations. They can't break anything because they aren't allowed to. Is that frustrating for anyone who knows what they're doing? Absolutely. But most people just don't know what they're doing. 

\3. Apple is better for privacy for most people

Apple, for now at least, seems to be as privacy focused as they can pragmatically be for the most part. Tim Cook seems to be the one privacy obsessed person at his level in Silicon Valley. And while most Apple users are too tech incompetent to care about that, they're still getting these benefits anyway. 

Unless you're willing to spend a ton of time on setting up Linux or AOSP, you cannot have the same level of privacy on non-Apple devices. Privacy can't exist in the same room as Google or Microsoft, and most aren't willing or even able to extricate them from their devices. So privacy in most cases is much better on Apple. "	8	42

Men also own firearms at a higher rate than women (men own a little over 60% of guns). Access to guns is a major factor in suicide. Of those who attempt, but do not complete a suicide, only 1 in 10 will die at their own hands. Firearms are extremely lethal and quick at completing the suicide, so that accounts for a large part of the equation. 

The primary method for women is poisoning (pills or whatnot). Pills only have a 1.4% rate of completion, and take much longer to kill the person. They have more time to reconsider their choice and can call for help if they reconsider. With firearms, that is not an option. 

Men have a higher suicide rate, because they have more access to guns, and guns are more effective. If you really care about Male suicide, your primary focus should be gun control.

You wanna know why? Cuz he’s dead. Why can’t people just let it go? Literally no one fucken cares, the guy died like 10 years ago. The only reason I’m complaining is because from time to time I listen to MJ’s music and google just starts suggesting news related articles in the google app regarding MJ. All I see is Leaving Neverland articles. The problem with these victims coming out now is that the mother fucker is long gone, so even if you prove you were abused, there’s going to be no one held accountable for it. At least not in a satisfying way. You can’t put a dead guy in prison, so just keep this subject like Michael Jackson, dead. If you want to spread awareness about sexual abuse, that’s fine, I’m sure there’s plenty of ways to that, rather than beating a dead horse, and dragging MJ’s family through this shit again and again. 	10	16

Hundreds of people replied to the thread, half of which were about how the opinion wasn't unpopular.

Well, excuse the person who made that post for not knowing that Reddit has something against old people, alright?

People need to realize that something being unpopular is entirely subjective - for all you know, everyone around a certain poster's life can disagree with them. I'm sure there are a lot of people who will disagree with the idea that Baby Boomers ruined everything, for example. 

The main problem is that when hundreds of people say ""ThIs IsN'T PoPulAr"", they're only filling up the comments with unnecessary junk. We get it, people agree with it. Who cares. The thread still caused a lot of people to talk about it. Move on with your life."	11	5

 Its the same with hate speech. In Britain you can’t critique mass immigration without actually being arrested for hate crime/ hate speech. Why would anyone put such restriction on speech if they knew they were true? They know they’re wrong. If you cut off a mans tongue it only shows you’re afraid of what he may say, not that you’re right. 

 Anyone should be able to debate their views. I don’t care who you are. People don’t realize that the more they censor people, the more appetizing their view point gets to the masses.

I ran away when I was a kid to escape an abusive home. Things became worse for me when I was recaptured. But in the eyes of the system, I was ""missing"" (even though I knew exactly where I was the whole time), and it was just assumed that I was safer at home than I was on the road.

For reference: “The UN says that farmed livestock accounts for 14.5% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions (with cow burps a surprisingly big culprit). To put that into perspective, the BBC reported that this is roughly equivalent to the exhaust emissions of every car, train, ship and aircraft on the planet.”

In an ideal world, if everyone went vegan, our food related emissions would drop by an estimated 70% by 2050. 

Now that’s obviously never going to happen. And there are clearly other things contributing to the damage we’re doing to the environment and other changes we, individually, industrially and politically, need to make. 

Nonetheless, the point still stands that if you’re concerned about the environment and haven’t at least cut down your consumption of animal products, you’re a contributor. 

Ideally, we vote with our money and stop supporting industries that are negatively affecting the environment. 

This is, in some ways, easier than other routes. It’s easier to adjust your diet than your travel, for example. We don’t all have the money to go out and buy a new electric car. We need to travel by plane for work or visit family. 

Changing your diet, by comparison, is a pretty achievable aim. And the environmental impact of livestock farming is undeniable. 

While veganism, plant-based food alternatives, and initiatives like “Meatless Monday” continue to grow in popularity, getting away from animal products is something we all should be taking more seriously.

This appears to happen often and is annoying.

I don't think this is very debatable, but it will still likely grind some gears and it flies in the faces of all those people who pester others about voting. I'm sure a lot of people have done the math so I won't provide an example here (just Google ""voting is irrational"" or something like that), but your expected payoff from voting is lower than the cost of going to the polls. This is due to the improbability of your vote actually making a difference which is due to all of the people voting. It's especially useless to bother voting if almost everyone votes for the same candidate (I'm looking at you, California).

You may object ""But if everyone thinks this way then no one will vote."" Not quite: If a few people know that everyone thinks this way and they know that everyone else doesn't know that everyone thinks this way, then it's to their advantage to vote because only those few people would be voting. But more importantly, this is a fictional situation because *not everyone thinks this way*. For as long as a huge number of people behave irrationally when it comes to voting, it is to your advantage not to vote.

You also may object ""But it is my civil duty to vote."" And I don't have anything to say about this other than that voting because of something that intangible is silly.

Now maybe the math has failed to account for how little of an inconvenience it is for you to vote, but I'm here to warn you that it's quite likely that your vote almost doesn't matter at all.

I'm assuming that you don't get fined or rewarded for voting."	0	11

Take the vaquita, for instance. The smallest and most endangered porpoise on the planet, with now only about 10 individuals left. They are on the brink of extinction because they drown in gillnets set by fishermen meant for illegally catching the also protected totoaba fish (for the Chinese hocuspocus-market, of course... they want totoaba swim bladder soup, no matter what).

Apparently, there's nothing that can be done to save the species; they keep fishing totoaba illegally and vaquitas keep dying in their nets, despite major conservation efforts. The vaquita will soon disappear from the face of the planet, entirely, for good.

**That would not have happened had they systematically hunted and torpedoed all illegal fisher boats in the area when there were still several hundred vaquitas left.**

Edit: here's a pic of the vaquita, they're adorable:  [https://www.vallartadaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vaquita-marina-1\_1.jpg](https://www.vallartadaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vaquita-marina-1_1.jpg)

While rhinos in Africa and Asia are disappearing (again, thanks to the Chinese hocuspocus-market), there's a Park in India where rhinos are thriving, despite the huge demand and the high prices paid for their horns.

How? Well, their forest department is a militarized service, with park rangers wearing uniform-style khakis, carrying guns and gadgets such as drones, and having the authority to prosecute any offenders. **And they are ordered to shoot poachers on sight**.

[https://allthatsinteresting.com/rhino-india-poachers](https://allthatsinteresting.com/rhino-india-poachers)

Considering the severity of the situation of wildlife worldwide, this should be the standard approach in any protected area and in relation with any protected animal species.

I'd advocate the creation of internationally funded, specialized brigades that actively and systematically hunt and kill poachers and traffickers everywhere on the planet.

**1 human life is NOT more valuable than an entire species!**

Someone showed me a Doritos commercial of a naked girl covered in Doritos and said that was bad. I countered by showing a commercial where 3 women forecefully strip a guy naked and photograph his genitals (yes that's an actual commercial and the company that made it is still active today).

That's another part that hammers the point home. When a company does something bad to women, there's a PR nightmare. It's blasted over the internet. When a company portrays men in a bad way...you get...nothing."	19	37

These are just terms they use to make it seem like the Southern States were just defending themselves when it wasn’t. Matter of fact using those terms would be incorrect because the South were the ones that fired the first shots at the Battle of Fort Sumter beginning the Civil War. The North was never aggressive during the lead up to the war.

The economic trade exists between the buyer paying money and the seller giving them a chance at possibly getting more money, without any guarantees and the odds stacked way against the buyer. Not only is this an inherently unequal market that is skewed far too much toward the seller's advantage, what makes matters worse is that for the buyers, the nature of gambling dictates that for the vast majority of the time and for the vast majority of money spent, a trade has not actually occurred as the gambler will not win anything, and just gave up their money for nothing.

While some may argue that they did in fact purchase something, namely the thrill of the gamble, for many people, gambling is an addiction. Just because they do it, doesn't mean the necessarily want to. Addictions are not rational things, and saying ""that person knew the risks, they shouldn't have done it "", etc doesn't actually help anyone.

Many, many studies have demonstrated that certain people simply have a predisposition to gambling addiction, which they can't really help. The sale of gambling is extremely predatory to these people (hence the need for governments to regulate it) and I would argue is a form of oppression since we know that some people are much more predisposed to getting addicted to gambling than others.

TL;DR: Gambling is a 100% predatory and insidious service/product that offers little to no benefit for anyone involved, and often preys on those who are most vulnerable to falling into the downward spiral of addiction. Given that it is an economic sinkhole that can ruin lives and as such lead to dead weight loss in an economy, the benefits of outlawing gambling outweigh the costs."	8	55

But I would choose Velveeta cheese product, or even the store brand knockoffs thereof, over all of them any day of the week.

Velveeta is superior in many respects. It can be consumed in several different ways, for example- melted over nachos or Mac n cheese, cubed and served with crackers, thin-sliced and put on a sandwich... The possibilities are endless. Try doing THAT with Vermont sharp cheddar. The melting abilities of real cheese are particularly disappointing. And while real cheese may pair well with wine, Velveeta pairs well with vodka- surely a more appropriate drink in light of growing income inequality. 

And the taste- perfect. Just the right amount of tanginess, and it melts in your mouth effortlessly. Not too strong, not too mild. In truth I could eat a whole block of this stuff. To top it all off, the product is shelf stable. I still gaze in awe when I find a beautiful block of Velveeta nestled among the box mixes of Mac n cheese at the supermarket.

It must be disappointing to be a cheese maker- centuries of craftsmanship shit on by the miracle of food science- but hey, I don't create reality, I just live in it.

I dream of a world where we can cease the charade of pretending to enjoy real cheese. Where we all admit we have stayed from God's light, where we toss every ounce of blasphemous mozzarella and feta into a live volcano and replace it with pure, creamy blocks of Velveeta.

It seems to be a cool factor to hate the Kardashians for no reason. 

I don’t understand nor do I agree with it. They’re business women and work very hard for all they have. Yes, Kim’s sex tape was the match that lit the flame, but they’ve worked tirelessly to make sure that the flame does not burn out. Lots of random girls make sex tapes but you don’t see any of them becoming multi-millionaires. It takes talent, hard work, business acumen, and overall skill to make one sex tape into what they are today. 

What angers me the most is that people brand them as “bad role models”. For those people, the Kardashians don’t exist to serve you. They’re not here to be your role model. If you want a role model, look to your mother, aunt, uncle, etc. The expectation that complete strangers should change their way of life to set a “good” example for you or make you feel better is completely ridiculous. 

And on to the topic of plastic surgery - yes, they have gotten quite a few procedures, but so has everyone in Hollywood. Without all the fame, they are just people doing what they can to feel the best about themselves. If Kylie Jenner wants to alter her face/lips, she’s well within her rights to do so because it makes her happy. Mind your business!

I am not aware of any time in human history when pockets have been considered unfashionable. But guess what, when they are directly in the groin area the space is a little restricted and it can even stifle your range of motion. Put them on the fucking side of the pant leg. It makes more sense. Plus, the front pockets are nice for resting your hands in when you feel like it, but if you try to do that and find your pocket is too full, it is slightly unpleasant.

What pisses me off the most is people who say it is childish to wear cargo shorts. No, it isn't. Asking other people to hold things for you because you choose to wear impractical garments is fucking childish. Chino shorts are more adult, more mature, more manly? Get the fuck out of here. The stereotype of a man is someone who is handy and always carrying tools and whatnot. You have no pockets that are of any fucking use. Do you wear a tool belt everywhere? Me neither. That's why I like to have pants that meet basic every day functions.

Some people argue that cargo shorts are objectionable purely on a fashion-based aesthetic. That is also wrong and stupid. Compare the two styles in this image. The author of the article I grabbed it from praised the chino for its ability to show off the ""trim silhouette"" of the leg. I don't think men are generally concerned about accentuating the trim silhouettes of their legs, and I don't think they should be chastised for not caring. And if you demand that we conform to value this aesthetic, you are a petty and unreasonable asshole.

Part of me thinks it’s due to the popularity of YouTube channels like Cinema Sins who ironically nitpick as a joke.  Everyone these days seems to think it’s cool to criticize every single movie. Nobody can just say “oh I liked that movie” without someone else stepping in to say “well I didn’t and here’s all the reasons it’s bad.”  

Maybe at least on the internet there are places where fans gather, but in real life conversations, sometimes I feel like I’m the only person who actually enjoys movies. 

Back in high school, when I went to the movies with friends, we enjoyed them and talked about our favorite parts once the movie ended. 

These days, whether it be family, my girlfriend, or my college buddies from back when I went to college, as soon as the movie ends, everyone needs to make sure everyone else knows they didn’t like the movie and exactly what about it could have been done better. The *best case* scenario is someone saying something like “it was pretty okay, I just didn’t like...”

Jesus fuckin Christ, people, movies are fun and liking fun things is good. You’re not cool and you don’t seem intelligent for always having a reason to tear down every movie. 

Lately I’ve been going to the movies by myself and it’s overall a better experience. Now I can enjoy a movie and continue to enjoy it after I leave. Before, everyone else would just make me feel bad and I couldn’t help but like the movie less. Hearing nonstop criticisms makes you question if it really was good and it makes subsequent viewings less enjoyable, especially if those who criticize and nitpick it are friends, family, your SO, or anyone else who’s opinion you value. 

So please, for the love of god, just enjoy the movie. If you absolutely must find a way to try to make yourself look cool, smart, and/or sophisticated, come up with a complicated reason why you liked it. At least then you’re not killing the joy of others and pressuring people into subconsciously liking a movie less due to our natural tendency towards empathy."	25	13

The unethical part is questionable though, since over the past 30+ years the diamond industry has received an insane amount of scrutiny and regulation, which means they may be one of the most ethically mined material. Ever hear of the Kimberly Process? What about the rare earth elements and other metals in your phone, computer, smart watch, TV? Majority of those are mined in China, likely unethically. When you look at it, we look past so much unethical shit that goes into making our gadgets because they are useful and entertaining, but because diamonds are strictly a vanity item, they get an disproportionate amount of hate.	2	2

Social media does not have to be democratic. Social media is not a popularity contest. Take away the “likes” and “hearts” and votes from FB, IG, Reddit, etc. If social media sites continue to allow these voting systems, they’re only cultivating a culture where the stupidest posts rise to the top.

The vast majority of documented canine-related fatalities involve pits and pit-like breeds.  Detractors of this hypothesis may argue that these statistics are biased because no one reports on small dog attacks, but that argument is ridiculous; no one reports on small dog attacks because small dogs are very nearly incapable of killing humans and thus never do.

While pits do not 'attack' more than other breeds, when they do (and sometimes they do) the results can be catastrophic to their targets.  It's a matter of strength and size and the sheer physical ability to rend flesh.  This is something that a full grown healthy pit can do quite well, whereas full grown shitzu can not.

""It's not the dog, it's the owner"" is a common rallying cry of pit supporters, but this is a fallacy. Dogs are not machines built by their owners. They are animals and like all animals, they can lose control of themselves. When a powerful breed loses control for even a moment, it can do enormous, irreversible damage. Further, there is no control or regulation over ownership...there is no 'test' to determine if a potential owner is a 'good' one, so it's a moot point. Personal anecdotes about the loving family pit are meaningless, since we are discussing the issue at an aggregated, macro level.

Personally, I would support a gradual elimination of such breeds in moderate- to high-population centers.

But as an open-minded person, I also understand and respect the opinions of those who disagree, even though they are wrong.

It's totally ridiculous. There's nothing WRONG with having kids, but can we at least admit that it's selfish? (And again, there's nothing wrong with that!)

As a woman, I have endured conversation after conversation about why I don't want children. Most of society seems to view it as my solemn duty to have children. You know what, though? I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO. And yes, of course that's selfish! We have the right to be selfish! I'm just saying the least you can do is be honest about it.

The thing with me not wanting children, though, is that people want to tell me I'm selfish for that. Well EXCUSE ME, Deborah, but I'm living my life for ME. Any chance you're willing to admit that you are too?? No? Didn't think so.

Having children is not noble. Having children is not inevitable. Having children is a choice, and a selfish one at that.

It's your biological right to have kids if you want to (although if you have a bunch of them I do think you're a HUGE asshole, given the current state of the planet). But you have to at least admit that you are doing it for YOU.

When you have a kid, you are creating a life that will have to endure this world, without their consent.

If you have a kid because you think you're supposed to, you created a life to satisfy your own fulfillment of your societal role.

If you have a kid because you think your worldview is great or to leave a legacy, you created a life to force your views on the world. And sure, maybe your world view IS great, but you still wouldn't force a stranger to participate in it with you, and that's no different than creating a new life for that purpose.

If you have a kid because you think your genetics are just super duper awesome, you created a life to force your DNA on the world.

If you have a kid because you want to extend your tribe, you either created a life to extend your social influence or because you want a friend.

If you have a kid because you want security or comfort in your old age, you LITERALLY CREATED A LIFE BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO SERVE YOU.

There's just not a single reason to create a new life that doesn't boil down to ""because I wanted it."" And the kicker, for those who somehow still convince themselves that they are being morally righteous? There are METRIC SHIT LOADS of children in the adoption and foster systems waiting for homes. What, are those ones just not good enough? (If so, that's fine! Still selfish though.)

I’m gonna be honest: unless you’re obese, you’re barely going to be looked at differently. Sure, you may have trouble finding your size, and you might feel insecure, but in the street no one is going to be staring at you and thinking “damn what a fatty”.

Also, fatness isn’t something you’re born with. It’s a choice (there are exceptions, medical reasons, abusing or over coddling parents who forced overweightness). If you’re making this choice to be like this, why does the world need to bend to suit you?

I’ve seen so many takes on it, from tumblr and instagram and YouTube. 

People trying to claim that they’re being oppressed by their size, or people shouldn’t speak up about their self love because they’re “skinny passing” or what other nonsense.

Now that being said: the beauty standard we have going on rn is impossible for a lot of people to achieve and is pretty unrealistic. Most men can’t look like the rock, and most women can’t look like Kim Kardashian (well, she’s mostly plastic so more like no one can look like her...).

The beauty at all sizes thing is great! Skinny, curvy, average, overweight, etc. being appreciated for their beauty and distinct looks even though they don’t meet the typical standards in amazing. However, it’s becoming “beauty in overweightness” only. 

People skinny shame with no remorse, people saying skinny or average women shouldn’t be allowed to talk about their insecurities, people say all brands need to be hyper inclusive, etc. I know most of this is from the SJW type (which I don’t really like to say, bc there are social justice advocates who are nice), but it’s still shoved in my face everywhere I go on the internet.

Idk if I put that well, feel free to correct me in the comments on grammar mistakes or any place my argument was weak."	12	13

It's a daily occurrence that I have someone bring me in either broken junk, or cheapo items, asking astronomical prices and not understanding why I can't.

The conversation goes like this

Customer: I need $100 for this

Me: it's $50 brand new at Walmart

Customer: OK I'll take $50

Me: noooo... I can't give you new prices, I'm a business, I have to make money. I'd probably sell it for like $30.

Customer: alright, I'll take $30.

Me:.....(internally screaming)


This is also a good one. We offer layaway, it's 10% down. This is a verbatim transcript

Customer: how much it to put that tv in layaway?

If you got a carry on for all 4 family members, just check those in goddamnit. People cash out on Tesla’s, buy $5 Starbucks coffee every day and yet being cheap on their luggage.

Additionally, this wouldn’t be such as big of an issue if airlines, like Delta and JetBlue, didnt charge $35 per bag, maybe people would actually send them away. 

So please, when you fly, don’t be an ass. Pay $35 and spare everyone a headache. Or better yet, learn how to pack properly without carrying a ton of extras. You can survive your 1 week trip without some items.

Chinese students come to America for better education. With that education, a lot of them join the tech industry only to espionage and sell out American technology to China. China seems to have no concept of intellectual property.

I was appalled at how mainland Chinese students protested against Pro-HK student demonstrations. They take privilege of living and studying in a democratic country for granted while criticizing the very same values. If China is so great, why don't they stay in China?

Regarding Chinese tourists, yes I know they bring money, but at what cost? A lot of these tourists seem to lack basic human respect and public etiquette. When you start getting large group of Chinese tourists, it drives away tourists from other nations who are much more civil and respectful. It's a negative chain reaction. 

Also, when Chinese money come into local economy, they only harm the ecosystem. For instance, look at the price of houses sky-rocket once Chinese money hit the market. It makes it impossible for most locals who were born in their cities to ever buy housing there.

I want to point out that this is not true to all Chinese people and I don't consider people of Hong Kong and Taiwan to be Chinese.

Usually it's the people the girl knows, was most likely manipulated or felt threatened to do what they want because if what they might be capable of. There are people who even think that it's not considered rape if it was anal or oral, given or received, and think its impossible for a man to get raped.

I could seriously care less. 

Okay. Let’s start reasonable and then proceed to get more outrageous with my opinion. 

Of course, I never want anyone to harm themselves or others. If you need help, please reach out. There are a copious amount of hotlines and people who will listen to you. 

In this post, when I refer to someone who wants to use assisted suicide, I’m referring to anyone who would want to use the service, this is not to the whole community of people who have mental illness. 

I think Dr. Assisted Suicide for medical patients with a terminal illness is a no-brainer. If you think that people going through severe pain everyday must wait until their soul leaves their deteriorating body, you are a cruel person. People with terminal illnesses should be able to end things on their own terms and with their family and dignity. That’s my opinion on an already popular debate. 

Now let’s get crazy. 

I think people who want to have a Dr assisted suicide should be able to just head to the hospital and agree to literally sign their life away. I think the only stipulations would have to be that the person must be 18+ years old and must fill out the paperwork and maybe state on camera that they want to die this way. There should not have to be a reason for the person to want to commit suicide for us to accept their plea. Let’s dive into the reasons why people should be allowed to get Dr. assisted suicide. 

1) Mental illness is a bitch. Losing an everyday battle against your own noggin must be a tough way to live life. Why should these people have to live through that? Because you enjoy riding your bike on a sunny day, Karen? You think depressed people never tried enjoying a ride on their bike? Arbitrary things don’t solve mental illness. Sure these people could try therapy and medication (which work wonders for some) but others just don’t feel like life works for them, otherwise suicide wouldn’t exist which leads to my next point. 

2) It would be much cleaner, physically and emotionally. Death to one’s self usually causes a lot of blood (physical) which can lead to a lot of trauma for first responders, cleaners and the victim’s family (emotion). Assisted suicide would be done in a way that wouldn’t cause a mess. Assisted suicide may also be better for donating organs but you’d have to fact check me on that one. If not, I’m sure we can develop better ways. 

3) The world can be vile. The world is filled with creeps, racists, corrupt billionaires. I’m surprised anyone wants to live with that shit, but even if you do, you have to slave your life away at your job to be able to do anything. Our bodies are not designed to work long hours. Humans are naturally designed to literally run down animals to hunt them. Humans are not designed to sit all day, work 40 hours a week until we’re 65. If you said “well that’s too bad, that’s the society we live in”, then that’s 1 point for me because that’s the exact point I’m trying to make. If people genuinely don’t want to live in that society, they can check out without facing social repercussions (btw those social repercussions probably contribute to them wanting assisted suicide anyways so quit being a jerk to people) 

4) We are very near (or at) a global overpopulation problem. We are making the world hotter, using up the world’s resources, running out of space to grow resources and that’s just the obvious things. We are maxing out our planet. Sorry to be blunt but less people = more resources. 

Bottom line is that I think it’s important to promote autonomy around one’s own life. If someone feels like their own life isn’t worth contributing or living, they should have an ethical way to leave to “a better place”. 

Once again, if you do need help, please reach out to someone. This is in no way to encourage suicide but a way to create a conversation for people who wish to commit an ethical suicide."	146	59

I feel like being a genuinely nice person involves being kind fairly consistently, and to most everyone. I'm not saying that you have to be nice to people that are terrible to you; you don't have to let people walk all over you for the sake of niceness. My point is that nice people don't go out of their way to retaliate against or antagonize people they just don't like. 

(I'm talking specifically about being nice to people you don't like, not people in situations where they are bullied or being threatened or taken advantage of, etc. Your personal safety is more important than someone's feelings. My point is that nice people don't engage in petty behaviors when they don't like someone, they just move on.)"	70	14

IMO a footballer is someone that embodies the passion of the game, Roy Keane in his emotional play style and the sacrifices he makes and the great leader he was truly embodies the game and is a great representation of what the beautiful game truly is and it leads me to believe he is the greatest footballer because of the sacrifices he has shown in his career helping Manchester United to the treble at the expense of him missing the Champions League Final.

There's nothing wrong with identifying the bad that your own people have done, however, there are certain points to where it becomes a bit overboard and superficial, where it seems less about actively pointing out history, and more about looking good in front of another group of people.

For example, I recently got into a discussion a friend who happens to be Nigerian, and another woman she's friends with that was white. The conversation diverted into history, which the woman began going on a rant about how much damage and destruction whites have caused on the world and especially the innocent Nigerians who have done nothing wrong throughout history. My friend, who felt the comments were a bit overdone, refuted with asking about some of the negative things done in Nigerian history which the woman began switching her opinion about and suddenly saying ""oh yea that's so true!"". After that talk my friend mentioned to me that the hate against her own people (virtue signaling) felt TOO forced and sort of pathetic and I can't help but agree."	49	23

Also no one wants kids, I sure as hell wish I didn’t have a son. I could have avoided that by just working out my arm that night instead of drunkingly hooking up with a random woman.

That’s the biggest bullshit thing I’ve ever heard. 

Athletes make millions because they’re in a multi-billion dollar industry that allows them to make that much money. I understand that they have less stress on them, all they have to do is practice and play, etc. but if this is the case, then why should actors get paid millions of dollars for movies and tv shows? Why should any other form of entertainment pay more than minimum wage? If one argues that athletes shouldn’t make millions because they are unessential then I urge them to never watch any sporting events, tv shows, or any movies ever again because none of them are essential, in their eyes, and without their viewership it wouldn’t be a billion dollar industry. 

With that being said, thank you to all of the people who are sacrificing so much to be on the frontlines and help everyone. I am, in no way, arguing against their cause. They are the only form working to combat this pandemic and are the most important. From a person who wants to have a career in the medical field and is studying medicine at college, I am not arguing against them.

It’s possible there is something lost in translation,but I’ve seen so many people who watched the movie via subtitles that I thought it was going to blow my mind. It has a 99% tomato score...how? Did I miss something?

She is one of the few artists who have been writing songs since their inception, unlike some artists who sing over instrumentals curated by talented producers (cough cough Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Beyonce). Even when she has co writers, they are at the most 2, unlike Beyonce who has had 14 co writers on one song. For last years Grammy's she was the only person to have a solo written song in the best song of the year category. While I understand why people have a negative reaction to her personal life and controversies, I believe her musical talents are underrated, and this is a hill I will die on :)	7	29

I saw some people get angry at my university for cutting salaries for professors. The same people cheered when our state introduced heavy restrictions on what you can do and where you can go. 

It’s like people think that money grows on trees, and that they are entitled to it. The restrictive measures make it so businesses have less revenue, so there is no way to avoid cutting salaries or laying people off. 

TLDR: If you want heavy restrictions, you need to be prepared that there will be severe economic consequences. Almost nobody talks about the fact that we need a smart balance between economic consequences (people die from those too) and deaths from the disease."	12	3

If you’re safe, have had checkups for sexual health, the number of people really shouldn’t matter as long as you are healthy. 

However, people experience life different.  And yes, some people are sexual deviants so getting tested once in a new relationship on both parts should probably happen anyway.   And if anyone acts offended, the prime idea is to make sure both parties are safe in this day and age.  That and if anyone objects to being tested should tell you enough about whether or not you really want to engage into a relationship with them.

It’s not so much how many people, but the disregard on basic health, and personal sexual health that a lot people need to brush up on.  
Go ahead.  Bang, have some kinky sex.  Just make sure that you’re using protection, have STD/STI &amp; HIV/AIDS testing done if you’re going to have sex.  Be 100 x infinity + 10 responsible with your life.  

I digress... 

I say this because far too many people are stigmatized, and made to feel ashamed about themselves because some people are insecure about themselves and project.  

After reading that post about the girl (I assume she’s a girl) told her fiancé about a gangbang back in her wild college days.  He was upset and I guess tried to even the score by saying he had a threesome, but...  really, who cares?  Anyone who presses personal information that has nothing to do with them is a red flag.  

Sorry, not sorry if a lot of people disagree.  But it is personal right to disclose or not disclose personal information regarding your previous love life. 

As long as you’re safe, fuck away.  Also, feel free to say no because being harassed about your love life is just as degrading.  Sex really doesn’t determine your worth in society.  And, if more people are upset by this... oh well.

They probably have an answer to every question you've ever imagined, but Quora is complete trash. 

Have you ever gone onto one of the forums and realized that:

1.) The answer is either overdone, to show off IQ

2.) The answer completely avoids the question

Because that's basically the only two answers you'll be getting from that website. 

A person could ask, ""Help! I need to study for my mid-terms. How should I study?""

And the answer would be either:

1.) ""First, we must recall the past of studying. Such ideas are fundamental to how we, as a society, have evolved the idea of studying, and how we will influence the practice of studying in the future. I have developed a concept for the efficient practice of studying, the ""3-2-1 Method"". 3 writing instruments, 2 notebooks, 1 person. Ideas such as these will improve your IQ.""

2.) ""As Mark Twain once said, 'Don't let schooling interfere with your education.' Education does not mean success. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard. Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Go out. Enjoy the world. Look at the trees, the greenery; the world that you can shape without the presence of a pencil, notebook, and professor.""

To get to my point,  Quora always shows up when it's nearly useless in most cases."	121	28

This is really annoying, both with posts and with comments. Not because I disagree with approval-only subreddits, but because I think they should advertise this fact plainly.

It's rather frustrating spending 5, 10, 20, 60 minutes on writing something only to be told ""Yeah, no, fuck off, we'll only allow this here if we like it, and it might take us 1 week to get to it, by which point it'll be buried 10 pages back"". Especially since all of these subreddits could be informing you about this before a post is made.

I get that some communities might want gates, in order to hold back various forms of discussion, but that's why private subreddits exit. Heck, you could even create a read-only mirror for your private subreddit.

I get that some communities might want to be ""half gated"", but it's still worth advertising the level of ""gatedness"" of a given community.

It not only serves to save people time and frustration, it also serves to display bias. If a subreddit has 80% post-ban and 95% comment ban rate that tells a different story from one with and 8% and 9.5% ban rate. It would be useful if you want to spot ""cultish"" subreddits, and I do have a feel even popular subreddit have managed to become very cultish due to very good auto-moderation systems."	317	34

What’s the point if you read Harry Potter for example but instead you watch the movies which takes a shorter amount of time? Like seriously, what is the point of reading books. Now we have the internet to look up the lore to make sure the movie isn’t hiding something important from what the book says. Now we get the the fact books.

All in all, this is nothing more than the classic SJW power play:  
1. Identify a ""problem"".

If you hate them so much don’t participate.	https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gkqqxl/why_do_people_glorify_toxicunhealthy/	"I seriously cannot wrap my head around why people willingly participate in a shitty relationship. You see all these tiktoks and social media posts they make fun of these relationships. EX: Me ignoring all the signs of a toxic relationship EX: Memes that show people trying to trick the other partner into cheating on them by hiring others or doing it themselves EX: Being super suspicious over everything, also cheating is common.

My best guess as to why anyone would WILLINGLY do these things is that you want power in the relationship and clout. 
However, if it’s physically abusive, I know it’s hard to leave, it’s a different situation entirely from what I am hating on.

Also you always see memes of people hiding their phones or hiding contacts as dominos pizza. It’s horrible. Why can’t people treat others with some respect? I know there are bigger issues in the world but that’s not what we are talking about.

Further, if you says “it’s just memes, it’s a joke bro”. You are wrong. Lenin, although he was a brutal dictator, said a relevant and insightful statement: “A lie told often enough becomes the truth.” It’s logic can be applied to memes in general because if you constantly expose yourself to enough toxic relationship memes, you therefore are reprogramming yourself to behave this way and set expectations. 

In some of these “relationships”, all they seem to care for is sex, not each other. Yeah this can be considered a hookup but they will try to treat this as a “relationship”.

This rant is a bit janky because I just vomited all my thoughts on paper.

In many ways, love is dead and you killed it with these cancerous memes and real life practice.

Yes season 8 definitely wasnt good as the other seasons but we cant say for sure why it was. Was it rushed? DnD had no clue where to go? Not enough seasons? anyways. The first few episodes from S8 episode 1-3 were good. They had bad dialogues and all but overall were good. There were some bad parts like.

 Arya stark sex scene. Like why? They never go together and they she just left him for no reason. Sansa betraying Jons trust by telling everyone about his family. She was so good in season 6 and 7 then they just made her do that and especially when she got along with Jon very well. The Glovers not aiding the North. Why would they swear fealty to Jon and then not goto winterfell when they would we guarded by 2 dragons and 50k men. Daenerys turning mad, WHAT. THE. FUCK. DnD expects us to get shocked when the whole thing was out of character. Very smart DnD. How the Northern army and Targaryen army all come back to life. Wtf in episode 4 their were barely any troops and then all of the sudden at the siege of kingslanding they have a big army. 

The good parts of S8 episode 1-3 were: Jon and arya reunion, The Long night was really good especially the music, Infact Ramin Djawadis soundtrack made the whole season good. Theon and Sansa reunion made me cry. Theon protecting bran made me cry. Samwell Tarly finding out about the execution of the Tarlys, That made me cry. Brienne getting Knighted. Jenny of oldstones scene really captured the mood that they were all going to die. The Night King scene was amazing.

After episode 3 it went to shit. The plot got lazy and the time where Daenerys turned mad made no sense she was so kind and merciful then she turned into The mad Queen which was so stupid. And then Bran became the king... The crippled boring bland bran the broken becomes king... Really? I wouldve rather cersei to win then see him on the throne. Bran is the most boring character in GOT. I think i wouldve been more amused to see hotpie on the throne.

Overall, I dont think all the hate is need espcially r/freefolk which is just a echo chamber of GOT bad. Lord Of The Rings good. Its so hypocritical when their in a GOT subreddit and if they hated it so much they should goto r/lotr or r/breakingbad but nope they continue to complain. Most of the stuff they bring up also makes no sense."	0	9	0.47

He says both shows are good, but the Legend of Korra is better due to the expanded Avatar Universe, the story behind The Spirit World, and the fact that all nations are living amongst each other.

I on the other hand, think The Last Airbender is better the better of the two. There's a lot of life lessons and I think the way the each main character deals with inner conflict is unique and the character development is much better.

This is just plain dangerous for ANY content creator.

Look at the fine print in the description. The instructions will almost always tell you that you have to credit the song. *That. Is. Copyright.* More to the point, it's pretty much Creative Commons Attribution licensing without actually telling you this. 

So, as for being dangerous on another level: Do you know what public domain is? Creative Commons 0? Basically that says that the work in question has an open policy in regards to what you can do with it. Basically everything except copyright that work, because in both these instances the Copyright belongs to the public. It is still copyrighted, even if you are free to create with it with no restrictions.

If a work exists without copyright, basically that means that anyone can come along and claim it as their own. Imagine if someone took Entry of the Gladiators - a song that has been around since 1897, and was told, ""Oh, this is copyright free, I can just take it for myself!"". It doesn't work like that. The composition is free to use as you like, but you can't just take it and then claim every other performance of it. No. Public Domain exists to protect works to be open and free. Now, what you can copyright is the *performance* of the said piece. But that is another story.

Basically, if you see a video or song that claims to be ""copyright free"", it isn't. It's Royalty Free, and you need to recognize the difference if you are a content creator."	4	2	0.83

Rock music is far from dead, and it will never be dead. 

It's not as prominent as it was, but there are still bands and songs that get playing time. Like Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, Bring Me The Horizon. 

Yeah, the general crowd of teens that used to listen to rock (the skaters, the punks, the emo's etc) are now into hip hop but that's because hip has blended all these genre's. 

Emo Rap is more popular than ever thanks to Lil Peep and Juice WRLD for example. 

Metal is also prominent in rap. Look at Ho99o9, Bones or Ghostmane for example. Same for (pop) punk with FEVER333 and Machine Gun Kelly. 

Even popstars are now experimenting with Rock music. 

Travis Barker is collaborating with everyone and their grandma, Halsey worked with Bring Me The Horizon on a song for the Birds Of Prey soundtrack and Poppy released and entire nu-metal project which would be hugely successful in the same era as Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. 

And besides, what's easier? Getting a microphone, download a beat of the internet and rap over it, or start a band? Which requires you pay considerably more and find friends to play with.


TL;DR: 

Rock isn't dead or dying, it's just not popular as it's used to be. Which can be said for lots of genre's."	30	39	0.85

(a) Animal abuse for no reason is bad. Beating up an animal for absolutely no reason is a good example.

(b) Some examples of animal cruelty/killing can be bad for non-moral reasons - killing all of the bees is bad because then no fruits will be pollinated. It just isn't morally wrong.

Now, let's get into it.

You know feedlots? Yes, they have a bunch of other reasons for being bad, including a moral argument against them. That moral argument is completely invalid. I'm against feedlots because they can spread diseases and end up breeding bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.

As long as the reason for animal abuse isn't for animal abuse's sake, there's nothing wrong with it.

Take, for example, lab mice. They lead torturous existences so that we can learn more about different drugs without human testing.

We should expand testing to more animals, and cut regulations.

Stop being a wuss. We're using animals to better the development of ourselves. This is completely okay. It'll help progress science, and benefit humanity, at the cost of... freaking nothing. Animal lives will be created and then destroyed. It's not like the ecosystem will be hurt in a non-negligible way. It's not like any humans will die.

&amp;#x200B;

When an insect invades your house, you swat it and kill it. You don't peacefully capture it and let it out (unless you're a nature-loving lunatic... no offense), because that takes more time. We poison certain locations in our houses to kill potential rats. Fumigation services also exist. We spray our fruit with pesticides to kill insects that might damage it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do we consider this stuff to be morally wrong? No! So let's expand the practices to larger animals. They're just animals, after all.

UPDATE: Apparently, most people have empathy towards animals. For me, this only extends to other human beings. So yeah. "	0	32	0.38

But other than that, I hate camping, fishing, long hikes in the forest, sleeping in tents etc. It boils down to two main reasons. 

1. Bugs. Given the chance, bugs would rather live in your home than outside. Even goddamn bugs hate it outdoors.  Mosquitos, flies, ticks.  You can’t enjoy a meal without some bug getting close to your food or crawling up your leg. You can’t enjoy sitting on your patio furniture without thinking there may be a bug living in it and crawling up your back. 

2. Smells. I know you think it’s “only smellz”, but wtf is that earthy smell that ends up in your water when you drink it outside? I’m pretty sure that’s where the dogs get that smell too. 

Even when I BBQ I’d rather take my food inside to eat it. In fact, most people I think don’t even like camping, they do everything they can to make it like they are at home (generator, toilet, mobile shower, premium cottages, bringing their devices, tv’s). What is the real point??"	7	18	0.77

- Platinum, for an outstanding contribution.

- Inappropriate awards. Everyone knows the  lassic Reddit Moment of adding a ""Wholesome"" award to an article about people dying. 

- Awards locked to non - Reddit Premium users. 

- Argentium, which is basically the ""I don't know how to spend money responsibly"" award. It costs way more than Platinum and doesn't even have the value to back it.

The problem with questions like this is that they are missing context. Better for what purpose? What do you intend to use the color for?

The only thing i can see is that we have different types of scenery you can visit such as the mountains, deserts, snow, or the beach. But after living here for a long time all i see how it’s hot all the time even sometimes in winter, it’s extremely overpriced wether you’re trying to live here or visit, politics (whether you’re right or left) suck, and major populated cities are extremely dirty and filled with homeless people. You will be driving along the freeways and see trash along the side and graffiti on the freeway signs for “gangs”. There is trash everywhere and graffiti. If you go into Santa Monica you have dirt, trash, dirty needles and homeless people. Nothing against homeless people because i have met cool people out there but you would think for California being a hotspot to visit you’d take more pride in your state or county. I find it funny that the stereotypical vision of California is you’re gonna visit here and you’ll meet and see all these celebrities when in reality you don’t.

What rarely happens is the show garnering praise for what it does really well, namely its lampooning of the work culture of academia.

TBBT is one of the few sitcoms to have been set in such an environment, and its portrayal of fundraising, departmental politics, and general enthusiasm for research is as spot-on as The Office (any generic workplace), Parks &amp; Rec (local government), or 30 Rock (TV production) with their settings. The show was also renowned for its accuracy and attention to detail (while still being accessible) with the scientific aspects of the show, with Howard's astronaut training and the various equations on the whiteboards being particularly praised for accuracy. It's why numerous famous scientists have served as guest stars, as well as helping the show add an actual neuroscience PhD to the main cast.

By no means am I saying that TBBT is the greatest show on TV, or even that another show won't come along and do even better. But the show was very good at what it set out to do and deserves more credit than it gets."	41	15	0.75

“OMG, those two birds I mentioned? Well I just saw them drink water and it was the most adorable thing!!! *heart emoji *sun emoji”

No one %!$^ cares. Seriously, nothing against anyone positive in their day to day life. But if you are sharing it constantly to the point it’s everyday , please also understand that at some point people may start to get annoyed. Under this lockdown we all can use positivity at times but for god’s sake sometimes just don’t ducking mention it or text it just keep it to your own damn self.

Maybe it is just me but I for one love happiness and happy people, big fan and small stupid things also make me happy but I don’t feel like sharing every waking happy moment with everybody else. 

Especially under the covid situation, my patience wore out for people who do this so much to the point I actually start disliking them. Like just, stop. There has to be a threshold to a happiness before a human being should fucking be able to share it, not every damn thing. 

So Susans and Joshuas who do this, fuck you and fuck your insufferable self righteous happy bullshit.

Edit: this is worse when you actually have a conversation with these people and they talk down to you from a high horse and become the most negative and self righteous pieces of shits ever as soon as you show any emotion at all. Honestly all fake."	149	20	0.93

Even *more* specially in the NFL because that's where I see it the most. I don't get the literal football field sized flag and the airforce flyover (I know they are mostly built into training exercises) and all the other stuff. It's not even a political thing for me, it just seems too excessive. I tune into football about 5-10 minutes after start time to just skip it. Though what's MORE annoying to me are friends and family that complain about the kneeling and whatnot. I've told some of them to just do what I do and skip the anthem all together. They don't like that suggestion much. It also isn't a statement against the armed men and women serving, I have nothing but respect for them unless they give me a reason to feel otherwise. I just feel like we don't need to kick off something as minor as a sporting event that happens as regularly as they do with the anthem.	13	26	0.73

I believe that people’s inability to empathize with others is a result of trauma, either generational trauma or not. 

I think most people inherit their mental health from their family, and it’s hard to talk about because so many people have such fragile senses of self/fragile egos that they can’t handle looking into a mirror because they can’t rationalize that they’re “good” when they do so. 
I think it’s getting worse with social media, and it’s not the “narcissism” it’s the fact that people are able to further isolate and harm themselves with cheap gratification that it makes it harder for them to understand how their own brain works in the long run. 

I think we need to generally be more forgiving and gentle with the population because of this. I think so many people experience anxiety and alienation they are forced to either act out in violence against other people (physical or social, for example assaulting people that are viewed to be “less than” or gravitating to communities dedicated to “owning the *insert group here*) or they are left to completely self destruct with addiction or self-harm in one way or the other. 

When I see how people interact on the internet and in certain situations I’m left feeling like those interactions aren’t participated in with 100% mentally healthy people. It makes me sad but hopeful for the future with the leaps and bounds in research for mental health."	71	27	0.8

High school teachers and guidance counsellors need to play a significantly larger role in laying out the facts and data for students before they go all in when choosing a major in college/university. Salaries, demand in the field, etc. Parents don’t always know best or for some they may not even be around. 

While I understand actually enjoying your line of work is a large part of being happy in life and you should pursue your dreams, young students need to set realistic goals and at the minimum have a backup strategy laid out ready to execute should their plan A fail.

Edit: If you had a childhood dream and succeeded in pursuing that dream I’m happy for you, really. But the reality is, the possibility of digging yourself into a massive student debt hole (mainly applicable to US tuition because it’s just absurd) with little to no job prospects to recover from is something teenagers should fully comprehend.

A pretty hefty part of the greenhouse emission comes directily and indirectly from the meat industry. Rainforests are destroyed along with its biodiversity because we need space for crops, which most of is used to feed the animals that we eat. 

As the world population gows, so does the need for food and if we use all of the space available to feed the animals, we could run into a problem where we run out of it. Also the incrased heat and water level destroys farmland that would be used to feed the animals. In turn, the reduction of space and increase in population would make the prices increase with it and we could run into a food crisis.

Also the animals themselves and the processing emit large ammounts of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. The Co2 in the air makes the oceans more acidic when they absorb it, which destroys the coral reefs and them ruins the life that was dependent of it.

While these jokes were funny the first couple of times, now it just feels overused and not even that accurate. Like, everyone, even the most shallow and dumbest person ever, has a complex personality, certain habits, quirks, ect that makes them who they are. For example, the person who's orientation had ""become their personality"" may be kind and sweet to his family, or exerts stereotypically feminine traits because he had deep intimate relationship with his mom (for instance, he watched her doing makeup and he was fascinated by it). And maybe he doesn't like baseball because his father forced him to be traditionally masculine and had traumatized him in the process. Besides, people who say this usually don't know the person so much, they know only the surface-level information and later analyzed it through their experience, but already proceed to judge someone. In conclusion, don't be judgemental

First of all, the hardware power is on the 6th gen level. It's basically a GameCube cranked up to 11, and it might not even be more powerful than the OG Xbox. It couldn't even do HD graphics, something that was a standard for the Xbox 360 and PS3.

Second, the console is more so focused on single player and local multiplayer, and had a somewhat lacking online play system without any DLC or patches.

This is in stark contrast to the Xbox 360 and PS3, where online play and downloads were an integral part of the experience. If you didn't have an internet connected console, you couldn't download the patches and were therefore left with a buggy ass game. That wasn't a problem with the Wii, like at all.

So yeah, those are my thoughts. The Wii is clearly a 6th console deep down, and is only a 7th gen console in name."	4	14	0.67

 First of all nofap is a great thing if you have a proplematic  relationionship with masturbation. If you are dependent on it and not  able to withstand masturbation for a few days or weeks. If you are  generally speaking a addict. It helps with building self control and in  return you feel confident. 

  If you never had these issues to begin with, it wont help you. In fact,  it can harm you. Whenever you relapse for some reason and beat yourself  up about it and make yourself feel miserable you make everything worse.  Some people also feel stressed because of that.

   In the End masturbation is just like alcohol. A alcoholic should never  ever drink again, period. But if you manage to have the discipline to not  fall into that trap everything is okay. Just work on your goals and  implement good habits in your life.  Dont use masturbation to escape reality.  Try nofap out, it is a experience every men should have, but it will not  make your life success full. The only thing that can make your life  successful is you!"	11	11	0.75

I wanna start off by mentioning the average school day, it may come off as antedotal but have you noticed how regulated the average school day is? The teacher expects complete obedience, you had to follow commands such as: sit down, open your textbook to page X, you were punished for coming a minute late, talking to classmates, and making jokes, class started with a bell and ended with a bell and you had to ask permission to use the bathroom. These traits sound similar to what prison inmates would go through daily, so whenever I heard a kid say school is like prison there’s weight behind that statement due to the similarities between the two institutions. 

Another part I’d like to add to my statement is standardized testing, we obsess over it, yet when it comes to Global Ranking in standardized testing we’re usually behind our allies in other developed countries such as Japan and Korea for example. Our obsession with testing has lead students to memorize this info for the test, regurgitate it back to pass the test, and then forget about the info, this applies most to the AP classes, well in my state we call it AP, I noticed that the point of the class was literally to pass a test at the end of the year, which is actually very disappointing and goes against my opinionated meaning of education, which is the accumulation of knowledge through teaching and not testing, this culture of obsessing over testing has lead students to lack the skills to learn effectively, which is one of the greatest disservices that we could ever do to children and teens. 

I also believe that the system stomps out one of the most Important traits that ANY student could have, and that’s innovation. As I said before, students are heavily regulated in school, and this applies most to academics, we’re always taught in math to solve a problem this way, or in English to interpret something in this way, or that thinking outside the box isn’t permitted in some situations, I believe that the current school system doesn’t promote thinking outside of the suggested way to solve problems, and when a student is faced with that over a period of years it stomps out that innovation factor they had, which really fucking sucks because I believe that innovation is key to our development of a human race as a whole. 

I also need to put in a quick mention of what is taught at school, I’ll be taking 2 subjects: Latin and Home Economics, guess which one is taught more? If you said Latin you’d be correct, school doesn’t teach actual important subjects that are detrimental to a student find a path in life after finishing high school and heading off to college, which usually leads to a set of lost kids who don’t know what way to go in life.

Also we need to mention how online school has EXPOSED how horrid the American Education system is. Ima get a bit antidotal and talk about myself. I’m an 18 year old attending a university majoring in engineering, I thought that college would be different, that maybe I can actually accumulate knowledge about my major and become a engineer with the best of my knowledge, but in reality it’s just high school standardized testing all over again, it’s me usually learning some info, regurgitating it on a test, forgetting about the info and repeat, all I have to say is that it really fucking sucks, I’ve lost complete motivation and I’m seriously contemplating dropping out of college, I can’t force myself to continue anymore, it’s bland and depressing to do this day in and day out. I know I can’t be the only person feeling this way. Also school districts across the COUNTRY have recorded failing grades doubling or tripling in some subjects such as math, English, ect....... 

And this is just me talking about academics, I could always talk about how schools are rapidly becoming privatized, leading to things like the college admissions scandal and bribery, or how the SAT &amp; ACT are tests of economical status and not actual learning skills and so much more, but this is what I want to focus on. 

Lastly the teachers, I feel SO BAD for the teachers. These teachers work countless hours, whether it be grading or lesson planning, our obsession with testing means the teachers have to FLOOD out assignments &amp; tests for them to meet the requirements given to them, not to mention the fact that they don’t get paid during the summer break in some places and have to pick up a Job during the summer to make ends meet. We also have to talk about how UNDERFUNDED they are as well, teachers barely make enough when school is in session, I’ve heard countless stories about how teachers have to pay out of pocket for supplies, which is such a depressing thing to hear. That’s why here in the US Teacher’s usually quit their jobs, because they’re overworked &amp; underpaid.

I believe we need a MASSIVE overhaul of the American education system, it’s outdated, it’s depressing, it sucks, and it’s completely WORTHLESS.

For convenience, I will use a man (he/him) asking a woman (she/her) out romantically. She says, no, I'm not interested, but we can be friends. He agrees to being friends. 2 weeks later she calls him and asks him for help. He helps her. She continues asking for help etc. This is not mixed signals, this is her being a shitty friend. The unpopular opinion is that somehow we can't seem to treat this situation the same as if they were straight, same sex friends. If my friend was a drama queen in constant need of rescue, I'd call her a shitty friend. It doesn't matter if he previously liked her, what matters is he needs to take up accountability. If he's disappointed and wants more, he can move on. It's your choice to be friends or not. It's your choice to call her out or not. But ultimately, it isn't 'mixed signals'. 

I think the unpopular opinion is that I don't think there is such thing as 'mixed signals'. you can be confused if they like you or not prior to asking, but you won't know until you ask. People being friendly is not 'mixed signals'. your male classmate asking for a pencil is not 'trying to hit on you'."	2	0	1.0

The mochi broke a little and the tiny freezer in my dorm fridge barely kept the ice cream from being fully liquid, but it was soft and tasted good. Since then, I've had mochi ice cream three other times and each time the ice cream was watery or a slushy consistency and the outside was tough and dry, even after letting the ice cream melt.

I see posts every day where the OP is perfectly capable to helping their family or SO or a complete stranger who is in a dire situation. All these situation doesn’t require money but basic human decency and love and care for their family. People nowadays are so selfish that they basically think only about themselves and I have lost hope in humanity if this is the case."	31	8	0.88

Someone reposted a tik tok that basically said, ""I hate going out with people that ask if they're going have to take care of me / if I'm going to get super smashed, either puke with me at the bar or don't come!"" The comments were full of people agreeing, saying that they ""hate the mom friend"", how it was such ""pick me energy"" to say things like that, and that if you were choosing to keep hanging out with people you had to take care of you should take responsibility for ""enabling"" them because if you keep choosing to spend time with them, it's your fault. ??

People who drink less tend to get stuck with dealing with the consequences of drunk people's shitty actions. I'm not a stick in the mud; I drink too, I smoke weed, I love me some good psychedelics, and I'm by no means saying you can't have fun, or overindulge sometimes. But if you can't even stand up at the end of the night, that is alcohol abuse. If you drink until you black out, or pass out, that's alcohol abuse. It's prioritizing your need to get fucked up over the safety and needs of everyone else around you. It's not counterculture and quirky to get so fucked up other people have to make sure you don't hurt yourself or someone else, only for you to shit on them after for being wary of being put in that situation again. People who get that fucked up consistently wake up thinking everything they did was hilarious and all in good fun, because they have fucking no clue what actually happened. I try not to be put in that situation, but you can't control who shows up where, and how much they drink. And you can't always refuse to help them, either - I'm not going to leave a drunk woman passing out on the street, even if I didn't know her, just because I don't want to be put in the position of caring for a drunk person.

I drink less because drinking just doesn't make me feel that good, and mostly just  makes me tired. I don't care if you drink, and I'm not trying to ""mother"" anyone - but I'm so tired of being considerate on behalf of other people who are too inconsiderate to take care of their own damn selves, purely because I don't want to leave them to get hurt and no one else is around to help them. I WANT to let loose and have fun!! You know what is the opposite of that? Having to clean up other people's puke. Having to police your friends so you don't get kicked out of the bar. Having to shepherd drunk women into ubers so they don't end up passed out on the street. Having to apologize for the people around you behaving like assholes to strangers because they're too smashed to even know it's happening. It's fucking embarassing, and it's only fun for the assholes who let other people experience the consequences of the actions they don't even remember.

ETA: Just as an extra note to people that still say ""well just don't hang out with people like that!""... I grew up with an alcoholic parent. So, yes, I'm probably more sensitive to this than other people might be, but I also know first hand it isn't always as simple as just never hanging out with or around someone that might get too drunk. I want to party too! I just want everyone to be safe while they do it!"	1072	141	0.95

Many people have accounts there producing content in topics such as fashion and cooking. There could be even more people there expanding the range of content, and they should be seriously explored as an alternative for YouTube channels, especially considering that it can sometimes be risky putting all your eggs in the biggest basket. 

Several incidents with gratuitous copyright strikes have led others to figure out how to better handle their content, and YouTube's support has a reputation of being terrible with handling them. The creators that depend the most on YouTube for revenue are at risk of being hit the hardest. Also, YouTube has gotten too pro-corporate over the years and this disappoints a lot of independent creators and their fans alike. OnlyFans has no such issue, they highlight independent creators better, their tools for personalized feeds are good enough.

As for other video hosting websites, let's take a look at the other major alternatives. Vimeo and DailyMotion do not have the same emphasis towards building fandoms, and their format for hosting videos and fan interaction in no way matches YouTube's. OnlyFans has a better interface for that. And as for those video websites that are supported by decentralized currencies, while it's great how they pay creators directly, they're even more niche. They get the reputation of mostly attracting marketing type videos and too much shilling of products going on. I think it will be very difficult for those video platforms to have their heyday unless they can manage to attract a wider range of people. And plus many more people have heard of OF than Steemit or whatever other crypto-based social media there is now.

OnlyFans has a solid platform for hosting videos, pictures, and a payment system for extra bonus content for paying viewers. It is the closest thing to YouTube and Patreon rolled into one, and having this extra money funnel integrated into the system is super convenient. So for creators sick of the YouTube red tape or just want to diversify their earnings, it is a legitimate platform to go with. Of all the video sites out there, OnlyFans has the biggest potential to compete with YouTube."	0	8	0.46

I'm fucking sick of this Image Comics, lazy, middle school boy type storytelling device. 

Making your adult marketed cartoon or superhero or fantasy story full of gore and blood and rape and mass murder and whatever else does not make it more mature, or more nuanced, or any variety of better storytelling. And I'm not a prude for saying so.

And before you say *It's a deconstruction of the genre! It's subversive!* Let me stop you. Gritty stories are not unique or interesting or subversive anymore. They haven't been for DECADES. Walk down the aisle of any comic book shop and you'll see the market is absolutely saturated with this type of story. When Watchmen or Song of Ice and Fire did it, THEY were being subversive. It went against the established genre norms to do something new and unique and to elevate the genre. Now Watchmen style stories ARE the norm! Or no. I don't even want to say Watchmen style. Because Watchmen had craft and nuance and was interested in meaningful storytelling. It used its subversiveness as a way to make a statement, not as gross-out theatre masquerading as gravitas. 

In this day and age, I would argue it's way more subversive to tell a story with compassion and empathy for your characters and your audience. It allows you to go against genre norms and tell stories in ways that are new and interesting and engaging! Some of the best, most successful fantasy storytelling of the modern era have come from kid's shows like Adventure Time and Steven Universe and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Those are the stories that are bringing genre fiction forward. All these 80's Punisher wannabe stories are just trying to hold it back. 

If you like gritty stories, fine. I know different people have different tastes. But just do everyone a favor and admit that they're not inherently better stories for being dark. Admit that you just want to like the stuff you liked when you were a kid without being embarrassed about liking kid stuff. 

Seriously! Can we all just grow up a little and admit we like dragons and superheroes and space battles without having to prove how mature we are by loading these stories down with meaningless hyper-violence? Please???"	25	21	0.69

This makes sense, in many major metropolitan areas.

But I live in a semi rural suburb in Texas. Nobody walks anywhere here very often, and the speed limits on most roads are 45+mph. It shouldn't be illegal or frowned upon for a cyclist to use the sidewalk in a town like mine so long as they yield to the very rare occasion that they come across a pedestrian on the sidewalk, when cyclists do take up lanes here they always only take the far right lane and completely ignore traffic laws and use crosswalks anyways when it comes time for them to make a turn, they don't use the turn lanes.

In Austin, where foot traffic and bike traffic is as dense as the motor traffic, these laws make sense, and when there is no sidewalk available, it makes sense, and I always yield to them and pass slowly and carefully. But I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would PREFER to be on a bicycle on the same road as cars going 50mph around twists and turns on bumpy roads with small lanes and people in trucks too big for them to know where their passenger side tires are half the time, when a sidewalk that is almost never used is available."	10	15	0.73

Right now, I have my own little menagerie at home consisting of dogs, snakes, lizards, fishes, turtles, and tarantulas. If I were to rank all my pets according to maintenance, from highest to lowest it would be:
1. Dogs
2. Fishes
3. Lizards
4. Turtles
5. Snakes
6. Tarantulas

What makes snakes and tarantulas so low maintenance compared to the other pets is the fact that they only require weekly feeding (and their metabolisms are so slow there’s no harm in taking a week off), weekly cleaning in the case of snakes, and no cleaning at all for tarantulas (the key is to release a biological cleanup crew - springtails, isopods, etc. to do the cleaning for you). Snakes are a bit more personable since they can be held while tarantulas are better off as display pets, however both animals can generally be left on their own for days on end as long as their enclosures are clean and they have a water source. 

Compare this to dogs (I own 4) which require daily feeding and walking, weekly bathing, annual vet visits, and of course get very attached to their owners and need regular playtime/enrichment. Sadly, it’s very common for some people, especially families with children, to get a dog as a first pet to ‘teach the value of responsibility’ only for the poor animal to eventually end up being neglected or become problematic due to lack of training or enrichment. Every time I watch shows like Dog Whisperer or It’s Me or the Dog that show aggressive and/or out of control dogs caused by neglect or lack of training due to the owners’ busy schedule, it really makes me think that they would have been better off just getting a snake or tarantula instead.

Tl;dr: dogs are super high maintenance pets, snakes/tarantulas are not, thus the latter makes for a much better first pet"	9	24	0.63

If you’ve seen Into The Spider Verse, you know what it is. It’s basically different spider people from different universes. That’s a short summary of the film. 

Spider-Man: Far From Home ends with his identity being revealed and being framed as a murder. There are little to no details as to what spider man far from home is about. The spider verse may have a big part in it, it may not. From set photos so far, there isn’t much of a sign of the spider verse yet. 

I don’t have much hope that this is gonna be a spider verse movie. There’s rumors of characters from completely different universes being in the film. Like two different spider men, and a bunch of villains. If spider man 3s villains were considered much, just imagine no way home. Having to fit all that in one film. With into the spider verse, it has more room to focus on it. 

No way home is probably gonna start where it left off, with Peter Parker on the run. There’s still so much about this film that’s unknown. Maybe Spider-Man will get sucked into another universe. Maybe it’ll just be in his universe but the spider verse comes to him. Or maybe the spider verse won’t have anything to do with it at all and it’s just Peter on the run. Who knows. I’m gonna watch the film either way because I do think it would be interesting to see the mcu’s take on the spider verse. I just prefer they save it for another Spider-Man movie.

It would create more variety and some individualism. Men can still wear the basics too. 

Men’s targeted clothing:

T-shirts, pants, jeans, button up shirts, jackets, occasional tank tops

Women’s targeted clothing:

Tube tops, blouses, camis, off the shoulder tops, cardigans, balloon sleeve shirts, crop tops, cold shoulders, high rise jeans, low rise jeans, skirts, poplin shirts, dresses, rompers, jumpsuits, skorts, yoga pants, puff sleeve tops, smocked ruffle baby tees, leggings, flared jeans, henleys, pointelle shirts, halter tops, paper bag shorts, etc.

You may say, “men can wear that too”, and that’s true, however the sizing and build is for women so it’s hard to find a good size. So basically I’m saying is clothing brands should market those clothing options for men, and more importantly for it to be more normalized. They need to be normalized FIRST or most companies likely won’t make that change. 


In addition, companies can make the clothing options more masculine seeming. For example, they should make a side cinched shirt to start off and it’s slightly oversized rather than cropped"	44	22	0.88

I'm not one of these esoteric healing stones, oils or homeopathy idiots. But. Most docs need to make money and have to manage their time. In the vast majority of illnesses they will provide you with the right care if you already have a condition. If the situation is more tricky and you're smart enough to understand science (and there are trainings for that) you can be up to date more than a doc who has less time to spend on your case than you do. I'm not talking about googling your symptoms. I'm talking about the newest research on a specific condition and what might be strategies in your case.
Of course you will have to talk to a doc about it again, but reading about it, educating yourself about it, bringing some papers with you and talk on a similar level with your doc is possible and you might lead him to something that he hasn't thought of yet, because he hasn't had the time to read and study the newest revelations. Especially when they're older it feels to me they're more likely to treat ""like we used to"" or ""like I learned it"".

Oh and if you want to stay healthy and care about longevity there's so much so good info on how to prevent getting sick in the first place. Almost no doc talks about this with you.

I’m currently 7 months pregnant and can’t enjoy the beach at all , anywhere I go there are groups of people smoking around me. I don’t know if I’m extra sensitive to the smell but it feels im breathing in everyone’s second hand smoke within a 30 feet radius.

Also one caught smoking should be fined. 

Pros:
Less littering; 
Less pollution; 
Cleaner air ; 
Extra fines can go toward beach clean up. 

Cons:
Smokers will be upset

Edit #2: after everyone’s comments I think a good solution is if there was a designated smoking (or non smoking) area/ beach to create a separation, as it’s outside of there is enough space between the two areas it would be ok. Also then there can be enough facilities/ashtrays/ trashcans for smokers to throw away there butts and authorities could heavily patrol and fine anyone leaving cigarette butts in the smoking area so hopefully less pollution. 

Edit: 
Wow I wasn’t expecting this to be sooo unpopular! 

In today’s times everyone knowing how bad it is for your own health and those around you + covid , I thought there would be a lot more ppl on board for this.

Anyway I get the points ppl are making... I guess 7 months pregnant just made me rant here and was hoping to get some support buuut will happily just try my best to avoid smokers as much as possible lol

This is a bad system for a number of reasons.  I think that all groups (employees, employers, and consumers) would benefit from moving away from this model. 

1) It warps the incentive of the worker negatively - there is no incentive to work hard or well beyond what pressure management applies or the character of the worker. 

2) It rewards the wrong people while harming those who deserve reward - people who work hard and or well deserve to have the efforts/talents rewarded. likewise, people who do 2 hours of work in an 8 hour day do not deserve it.  inevitably, the top people are discouraged by the fact that their high performance is likely not seen and definitely not rewarded.

3) it is endlessly less satisfying to the worker -  no matter what you do, your day doesn't change. Many people are very achievement driven. many of us naturally love checking boxes, leveling up in games, running faster times, or whatever it is that scratches that natural drive. 

4) the customers suffer from less timely and less quality service 

5) innovation/efficiency is naturally stifled. with no incentive to improve it is unlikely to.

6) it allows decreased economic mobility: when you're paid by the hour, there is minimal ability to raise your income level without changing jobs or adding shifts (which may not be an option)

There are however certain jobs that hourly systems work best. These are jobs that require that someone be in a place for a certain amount of time and they cannot control the productivity. These include many restaurant workers, retail workers, etc... 

Lastly, there still needs to be a minimum wage to an extent so an entire company isn't paying everyone 3$ per 1000 calls made or something clearly abusive. 

Additional fine-tuning is needed to close loop holes/abuses, but in principle my point stands."	9	11	0.84

Even for birthdays, if there is a nice message in there from a relative i would much prefer they pick up the phone and have a conversation with me. The only caveat i will add to this is that i understand some of my older relatives struggle with technology so sending a card is much easier for them.

Of course, M&amp;K is better than either in some ways, but there will always be a place for controllers because of controller movement and convenience, and they're just fun to use.

I can (kind of) understand looking down on people who got butt implants because they decided to take the easy route instead of putting in the work to gain results.

but... you can't work out boobies! The most you can do really is gain weight, make boobies fatter, then try to slowly and gradually lose weight to return to your original physique, and hope to god that the booby fat stays. that's tedious, and doesn't always work.

Big boobies make women feel better about their body, and if you don't have big boobies but want big boobies, the only option really is to get big boobie implants, right?

Disclaimer: I'm not a teacher btw.

With all that said, let's get into my opinion.

I've noticed that usually, the students are being assholes to the teachers, and the teachers have no other choice than punishing the students or they have to deal with the students forever.

for example, if someone destroy or hide some teacher material, and then complain about the teacher being too harsh to their friends, then they're clearly assholes, because if the teachers do not tell the students off, then they will turn out terrible human beings.

I personally think that the teachers take too much shit on being an teacher, especially if they're teaching around 30 students in the classroom, and half of the class are messy, oh i can just imagine what a nightmare to be in that horrible situation.

The reason this is posted in unpopular sub, is because i've seen everywhere about redditors complaining about the teachers being idiots, and countless times in internet itself.

Oh, and some of these class-clowns(not all) are assholes too, because they're ruining the education for some of the students in the classroom.

Let me know what you think about this post in the comments.

Cheers!

As far as Rotten Tomatoes is concerned, it's neck and neck with the first. And from what I saw on YouTube and such, people vastly prefer this one over the first. ""This one was much more fun,"" ""The characters and plot were so much better."" I don't get it.

I really enjoyed the first one and I just recently saw the second one with my sister. What did I think? It was uh... decent.

Before I get into why it doesn't live up to the first, I'll go over real quick what I DID like about it. I like the majority of the song covers (even though there was no point to many of them), the characters were still the same lovable characters from the first, and they delivered one hell of a final performance.

That's pretty much it. Everything else made me question what this movie world even was anymore.

The reason why the first one had so much heart to it, was because they really made you feel Moon's desperation. It did a good job of encompassing not only how much this koala loves his theater, but how it's on its last legs and Moon is doing ANYTHING to keep it alive. Even when he lies about how much money he's offering for the reward, for one it was genuinely an accident, but also you realize that he can't afford to be upfront about how much of a pickle he's actually in. His passion for the theater and his optimism is just so enthralling that you can't help but buy into it. And not only that, but ALL of the main characters are likable (except Mike) and have sympathetic situations so that you want all of them to succeed.

In the sequel however, it wasn't about keeping a dream alive, but more so making it to the big leagues to say ""screw you"" to one critic. Think about it. They don't need to do this. They're already a success in their own city. Moon achieved what he set out to achieve. Now it's just a pride thing. A pride thing that could have worked if the stakes were toned down a LOT. I know that sounds super hypocritical. I was just talking about how the first film worked so well because the stakes were so high, now it's too much? Stories like this need stakes but they need to be believable. A gangster wolf who is so obsessed with show business in the big city that he's willing to commit murder in front of hundreds of witnesses when he doesn't get his way is not believable. At the start, it was kind of working. Him being a hard to please talent agent who is rejecting every act except one that really spoke to him, that was sort of on the right track. The stakes were matching the situation. There's nothing wrong with trying to better yourself and keep improving till you get to higher places then where you are. Simply trying to show people outside of your city your talent was a good enough goal as is. But the added plot of trying to not die from this crazy murderous gangster wolf who cares way too much about being disappointed was just way too over the top. Moon isn't simply passionate, but more like we have to be the best. His lying here isn't accidental or a last ditch effort, but him just getting so confident that he got carried away and is refusing to back down. They tried to take that desperation from the first and apply it to a situation where it's not warranted.

It was fun... at times... but I don't think it recaptured that same heart and passion from the first.

As Korey Coleman (Double Toasted) put it, ""this is a sequel that's made to be a sequel."""	14	11	0.89

If they can pick inclusive and positive categories for themselves, why should cisgendered people be stuck with that as a name? I get that cis means ""on the side of"". This is ambiguous enough to relate to anything.

Hetero-gendered
hetero as in heterosexual seems like an appropriate choice. Hetero meaning other, different, or dissimilar.

This isn't something I'm seriously advocating for, but I think is interesting food for thought. Please note I'm not based in the United States.

Basically, when there isn't sufficient space on the shoulder or the berm, road work signs should be placed in the car lane instead of the bike lane or the sidewalk.

Why?

1. Knowledge.
Drivers are required to be licensed to drive, so you can have a reasonable expectation that drivers will know what to do when encountering a hazard in their lane. Meanwhile, this expectation doesn't exist for people on bikes, because anybody can ride bikes, including kids.


2. Mobility/Skills.
Drivers are tested on their skills, so again, there is a reasonable expectation that they will be able to maneuver past the hazard. Additionally, most motor vehicles have similar capabilities. Meanwhile, there is a huge range of skill levels and mobilities for people on bikes and pedestrians, such as children, people who are beginners at road biking, people riding trikes or cargo bikes, people pulling trailers, people pushing prams, people using wheelchairs, and so forth. 
You can have an expectation for the mobility of a driver encountering a hazard, but not for people on bikes and pedestrians.


3. Safety.
It is safer to force drivers to slow down to maneuver around a hazard than to force people on bikes (and potentially pedestrians) into high speed traffic. Although most work sites reduce the speed limit to 30kmhr / 18mph many drivers continue through at 50kmhr / 31mph which is enough to seriously injure or kill someone.


4. Use of Space.
On most roads, the majority of the space is reserved for cars, both moving and parked, while only a little is reserved for people on bikes and pedestrians (who are sometimes forced to share). Therefore, it is unfair to use that already small space to place messaging that is for drivers, who already use the majority of space.
This isn't even to mention how bike lanes in particular carry more people per hour than most urban roads, making them a more efficient use of space which shouldn't be misappropriated.


Last but not least,


5. Legality.
Where I live it is illegal to place road work signs in the bike lane unless a) the bike lane is formally closed, and b) delineated space is created on the road for people on bikes. This is possibly the most important reason.

people don't often consider other people with sensory issues and how they might need certain settings and whatnot, motion blur is essential for low FPS games, like old console games.

when people say motion blur is bad they're talking about camera-based motion blur, there are actually two types of motion blur, the other being motion/object-based. if you want a good example of object based motion blur then look at from software games, they use object-based motion blur to make the animations look better. 

on sekiro for instance, motion blur was off for half of my playthrough and I was frustrated with how tired my eyes were when looking around on the scenery and exploring, I was even getting a headache etc. turning on motion blur alleviated this issue, it made it easier for me to pan across the scene and explore without my eyes getting tired. 

Elden Ring too, I think motion blur in elden ring is really really well done and it makes the game *feel* smoother. 

I believe from software games use camera-based motion blur as well but it's not nearly as bad as other games I've played and actually I like it. that's just an example another game I like the motion blur implementation of is The Witcher 3. 

I know some people may be opposite of me, I've heard of people feeling sick like nauseous whenever they play games with heavy motion blur implementation, but people often don't see the other side of the coin as well. I think there's definitely a place for motion blur and games going forward.

I see a lot of hate for landlords which is sometimes deserved but not always.  I also see a lot of hate on short term rental vacation spots in large cities causing a housing shortage like Airbnb. I think a big part of the problem is really housing and eviction laws that seem to give more protections to trespassers or bad tenants than laws supporting property owners.  I understand the reason during the shutdowns (US) that evictions stopped,  but that seemed to move the financial burden from home renters to the owner of the property.  Anyone who is renting out a property as a landlord is doing so as finicial gain not the kindness of their hearts. I think that burden along with difficulty of eviction made short term rentals more appealing to people trying to make money.  Running a short team rental helped prevent someone being considered a resident meaning no need to drag out time and waste money trying to evict a bad tenant. Think about it if you knew you could generate the same money doing a short term rental, and avoiding having to deal with a longer term renter who sucks  what would you choose? A lot of smaller landlords have other things to do and not enough time or spare money to risk wasting it doing evictions. I think everyone deserves stable living conditions, but that burden should not be placed on your average person renting out a second home or apartment.	1	1	1.0

Whether it be between a parent and child, lovers, pet owners, or just friends, it doesn't matter if they cannot reciprocate and respect the love they are given. Most forms of love aren't romantic and I feel like more people should realize that love from friends and family is just as or more important than the love your partner gives. Love is conditional and the conditions for every form of love are different. A dog can love an ugly person, but a lot of lovers can't. The love from a parent can love almost anyone but the love from a friend forms when you have something they like about you. Love is a very strong thing but even love has it's limits.	1	1	1.0

In school, it is often the case that your teachers assumed 2 main responsibilites at the same time: to teach you knowledge, and to give exam and grade you on that knowledge. I think that system is stupid. 

Why ? 

Because if a teacher is weak, ie: don’t have strong knowledge of the subject, not good at explaining concept …etc… then such teacher could design easier tests, quizzes, or grade papers leniently… to make it easy on the student to pass, and to in turn covering up their weak teaching skill. This will lead to a dove of Incompetence student who even though pass the subject but basically clueless. 

And weak teachers will then don’t have much motivation to do half as good a job as some random Indian YouTube guy. 

So therefore I think that system is flawed. 

I think it would be better if the people who teach you knowledge are seperate from the people who design/give tests and grade you.

In such system, if a teacher is weak, their student will likely have a harder time understanding the subject, and it will show on their GPA while doing exams designed and graded  by independent test givers.  

Whereas for stronger teachers, their student will likely have higher GPA. 

In such system, the student GPA will become an accurate indicator for the teacher’s performance. If it’s too low, the teacher shouldn’t be teaching. 

Of course, in the begining of every semester, the test givers will sit down with the teachers, they will agree on what all the tests will looks like, how they will be graded, what is the outcome expectation of the student… etc… so that the teachers can see a clear goal and then design a syllabus and teaching methods that can help student achieve that outcome."	1	1	1.0

The difference being that Legacy stuck to the fantasy multiverse storyline.

**TLDR:** Mortal Kombat’s story is a convoluted mess and needs to be fixed. Rebirth stripped away the convoluted elements for a more interesting and grounded story. And should have become the new canon. 

Rebirth took the idea of Mortal Kombat, a multidimensional tournament where if your dimension loses 10 times in a row you get invaded (except for when people decide to invade ignoring the rules). Into a less convoluted plot where a criminal kingpin hosts a fighting tournament of the world’s best serial killers and assassins. 

Rebirth gets little to no attention now a days for how compelling it made the franchise. Reptile turned from a Lizardman race of ninjas into a disfigured serial killer who keeps heads of his victims to eat. Baraka turned from an Outworld creature with blades in its arms and a large maw into a plastic surgeon who went crazy and disfigured himself and gave himself retractable arm blades. 

It made the dynamic a lot more focused on the personal stories of the characters without relying on the convoluted lore of the games."	1	1	1.0

It feels really weird to me and mostly in a bad way, and this weirdness makes me anxious and uncomfortable. I have smoked weed many times so I gave it a lot of chances so this conclusion is pretty clear to me. Considering how weed is depicted in pop culture and stuff I think this is probably an unpopular opinion. That said, don’t have any problem with anyone else smoking weed and I definitely think it should be legalised. I can’t understand why it’s so popular though. I guess it must react really differently with different people’s brains or something because if other people were experiencing the same feeling as me surely weed would not be popular. It’s just not my my thing at all I would much rather get drunk. That said, weed isn’t the worst thing I have tried, shrooms are even worse like weed x1000 in my opinion, so I want to warn anyone reading this, if weed makes you anxious, for the love of god don’t take shrooms. Anyway yeah, that’s my opinion.	1	1	1.0

Everyone shames that term. 

Meanwhile, in neuroscience, which is kinda like the fact based psychology (psychology is basically all theories made off of facts, which is why I didn’t like studying it), supports the evidence of empaths heavily.

So while everyone blindly believes a lot of psychology as fact, despite psychology being an opinion and theory based science 99% of the time… y’all choose to invalidate one of the things heavily supported by neuroscience, the more fact based study? Really?

Empaths are essentially people with an above average amount of mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are responsible for copying how a person feels and acts and making you feel and act the same way. Have you ever copied what your friend does? That’s your mirror neurons in action. Have you ever looked at someone who is sad or angry and then felt sad or angry? Mirror neurons.

For empathy, this can go as far as they literally accidentally mirror everything about a person, as if they are that person. This could go so far as you’re literally copying someone’s every move mid conversation because an empath is that locked in on them.

Empaths are one of the more proven things in psychology and neurology. And yet y’all hate on it and invalidate it. It’s beyond me. Do better research."	1	1	1.0

Think about the times people have called you lazy in the past for not doing a specific thing. What's the real reason you didn't do it? The task might’ve seemed overwhelming, you were tired, or, simply, you didn't want to do it. Maybe you assumed it wasn't such a big deal, or you're used to someone else doing it for you. There's always a reason, no matter if anyone believes it to be valid or not.

I realised it was a device used to shame others when I'd get defensive about ever being called lazy, but I still thought of other people as lazy, instead of attempting to understand their situation. People seem lazier when they're struggling, not when they're thriving. Entitlement isn't lazy, but I've included it as struggling as well, because I know it will be brought up.
