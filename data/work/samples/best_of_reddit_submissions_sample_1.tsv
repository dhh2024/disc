Yesterday.. I was finally able to get back to campus in Pennsylvania after being stuck at home for 2 weeks with nothing to do.  Had no trees and that just didn't make out for a good time.

Anyway.. Here's how it all went down.

As soon as I had the chance, I hit up two of my friends and asked if they had bud.  One was completely out and the other texted me back saying he was in North Carolina hunting deer.. - wtf..  So.. I was fucked I thought.

Hit up another friend and he says he'll try for me.  Two hours later, he calls me back.. says he has a g he'll smoke me up with and I'll get an 8th later from someone he knows.

On my way over to his house, I walk by some people on the street talking about how they want to get ""legal trees"" and I stopped and thought.. wait a second.. (Legal + Trees + Pennsylvania = huh?)  So, I talk to them.. find out they are from Colorado and they showed me their Med card and one thing leads to another and I give them my number so they can hit me up later in the night.

Get to friends.. smoke the G with him and get my 8th and smoke another G with them and head out.. On my way back, I get a call from the Coloradans and they are across the street walking so they come back to my place and I give them a G for 20 and we roll a couple Js with both our stuff.

They leave an hour later and another friend of mine calls and comes over.  I end up at his friend's place who just starts packing bowls specifically for me and him and then I roll up another J of mine and enjoyed the rest of my night.

**TLDR: Got really baked with random people last night in a post-Xmas adventure.**

From age 14 on I smoked pretty much daily. From age 18 on I was pretty much high *all* the time, every single day.

I remember being a teenager and always thinking, ""Man I wish I had some weed right now"". I remember sitting anxiously with my friends saying ""Man I hope that guy would calls us back soon."" and being heartbroken when he finally did call and say ""Sorry, not tonight.""  

I remember picking chaffe and stems out of the carpet and scraping pieces. I remember the incredible anxiety if I did not smoke for a day, and the immense relief when I finally did.  

I remember taking huge risks to get high (bringing weed into secured areas like airplanes). I remember spending way too much money to travel to areas where I knew I could get weed, sometimes hundreds of dollars and thousands of miles.  

I remember failing drug tests I *needed* to pass, because I just could not go a few weeks without smoking. I remember how difficult it was to finally quit, the irritability, the emotional roller coaster. Being a week clean, then seeing someone with weed and practically begging them for some, and the immediate grief after I got high.  

I pretty much was finally able to quit weed last fall. I took a hit like 4 different times since then and always got ""too high"" and basically regretted it.  

This week I got some weed. I packed a small bowl and took life half a hit. It was very enjoyable. For the next two days I stayed home watching movies and surfing the internet, smoking weed and slowly increasing the dose. I ran out and felt inclined to go buy some more. So far I have decided not to.  

I am not typing all this because I think weed is ""bad"". On the contrary, I think weed is great, it is fun and helps you think in ways you would not have without it. I think it has a myriad of medicinal uses and there are very few, if any, negative effects of THC. I think weed should be completely legalized.  

I am just trying to spread my belief that weed is addictive, and bring awareness to the uncomforts a weed addiction can bring. I see *a whole lot* of posts and comics on r/trees that lead me to believe others experience the addiction as well.  

what do you think?

**TL;DR: My experience smoking weed for a long time leads me to believe that weed is actually addictive.**"	3	8

I'm not sure if others share this view or not, but I think it works great when interpreted this way.

My PROPOSED ADDENDUM based on the above interpretation:

Your **[11]** would be used to say you are ***currently* higher than you've ever been**. When you come back down to your [10], the [11] would, henceforth, be redefined as [10], so that *after* the event, [10] still defines the highest you've ever been.

This would effectively be a temporary state used as a way to logically self-calibrate your highness scale AND give you, an r/trees user, effective language to describe your state of mind.

Thoughts?

I just found out I will need to take a drug test in a couple days. I knew I would have to take one two weeks ago, so I have abstained from smoking and have been drinking tons of water and running every night. I took a test last night just for curiosity's sake (I thought I had until at least next Saturday) and still positive. I was a heavy user (at least one to two bowls per day). I guess at this point I will have to resort to synthetic urine. I was wondering what the best options for me out there are? I know there are many products online that I could choose, but was hoping to get any input from you all with any experience as to the best bet. I'll be going to a Quest Diagnostics, so presumably they won't be watching me pee...

thank you in advance for all your help!!!

EDIT: Before I go take the test, any tips on how to conceal? I guess I'll rubberband the warmer to the urine about 2 hours before I leave, should be warm enough, and conceal it in my boxer briefs tucked under my ""guys"". Then I'll just drop trousers, pee a little bit into the toilet then stop, fill the cup, and then finish peeing in the toilet...does that sound fine? Sorry, I'm just very nervous about this. I've never done anything remotely like this before, and this is a huge job and was totally not expecting a drug test this soon."	1	5

I haven't played this game since elementary school, but I was thankfully reminded of it by the recent post about r/trees writing a book together.

Let's all burn some trees and tell a story together.  The game ends whenever the story reaches a point such that the authors unanimously recognize that the story is complete and there is nothing more to tell.  This point in time will be easily recognized since the story will cease to grow or change.

Hint:  For an added challenge try using only quotations or avoid using certain letters or words.

Don't forget that you must not laugh while the story is being created.  This is very important so you should always be thinking about it.

[6]	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/n8cz4/i_just_figured_out_something_very_important_about/	"So, I was just thinking about the universe, and somehow ending up in deep thought about pulsars.  They are these huge stars that emit intense radiation in beams.  They rotate so rapidly that we can see, if the pulsar in aligned with us, we can see that beam pulse at rates up to once per second.  This means that the pulsar is emitting this bright blast of light in the shape of an infinitely dense and infinitely wide spiral spread across the entire universe.  So in thinking about pulsars, I remembered that one of those space probes we sent out decades ago was affixed with an engraving of Earth's position in our galaxy based on the positions of local pulsars.

When we think about finding aliens, what do we look for? Are we going to stumble on their home planet? No.  We are going to see some UFO in the sky or some piece of technology on mars, and only then we will begin to postulate their existence.  Now believe me, I don't believe in UFO's or anything I'm just saying this is the evidence we are looking for first.

So, we are the ones who are sending out synthetically made technology into the universe, with our probes.  And that engraving was designed for aliens to find us.  But we are the aliens.

We are the aliens."	4	4

I just worked my ass off through college. I had minimal sleep or socialization for five years and now I plan on rewarding myself.

I am not particularly concerned by the prospect of immediate employment (I'm looking forward to having no job for the first time in over five years) and my life won't be over if I somehow blow through $75k in only two years. I own a home in the DC area which I can sell/rent/live in if I need to.

Here are some possibilities that I have not at all evaluated for feasibility:

* Moving someplace in the US with medical marijuana where I could live permanently

* Buying property somewhere in the US where I could grow and/or open a shop for medical marijuana

* Attempting to relocate to somewhere in Canada because ""fuck America""

* Running away to Jamaica

* Hopping from one tree friendly city/country to another until I can no longer get a Visa or I run out of money.

* Finding some hippie sustainable living community to live in that won't oust me for weed

So, where can I start over or live comfortably for a few years as a stoner? Where would you go if you saved up a similar amount of money? Is there some happy tree-friendly community out there that I may be totally unaware of? My primary goal is to live around a community of open-minded people (or just hippies) somewhere where I can legally (or mostly legally) use cannabis.

I was going to post in r/asktrees but I'm hoping for some actual discussion on tree-friendly communities worldwide and I already know that I can only get a 90 day Visa for staying in Amsterdam. Although imagine how awesome blowing through $75k in 90 days would be staying there."	3	9

We had smoked a bowl before a party (smoking while driving is strikes 1 and 2 already) and had just bought some alcohol and were a block away from our apartment when we were pulled over for having a brake light out. Being flustered and scared we quickly cracked under pressure when the cop questioned us separately. Being good friends with the driver we both took responsibility for what was ours. He took the rap for possession and I took it for drug paraphernalia. He was arrested and I was let go to drive his car home. 

Because we were pulled over by campus police the school was notified and I had to have a hearing with the dean, which resulted in me having a scheduled drug test a month later. **now this is where the dumbest mistakes of my life happened** I stopped smoking for this upcoming drug test, but 2 days before the test, I was stupid and took some Xanax, without a prescription, for anxiety. This showed up on the drug test, and because of this I have to attend drug treatment this fall to stay in school, and that's why for about the next 5 months I won't be smoking.

**There is a silver lining to this though:** Immediately after I was free to go, I checked the brake lights. I found it strange that the cop specifically told us we could not look at them during the stop. They were working when I checked, so I immediately hired a lawyer and requested the video. Well, 2 days ago Ents, I received [this letter.](http://i.imgur.com/Rajni.png) That's right **my case got dismissed!** unfortunately, the school doesn't care about that since the drug test is all the evidence they need. **Toke one up for me Ents, and don't fuck up like I did!**"	1	0

[6]	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/yqiuc/how_do_you_tell_a_trees_age_change_ent_vocab_6/	"[Hello fellow ent](http://theberad.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/281231d5b2071cc3bcd690c98dad19a00792f50b_m.gif) :) Let me start by saying I hope you've spent some time with the trees today. And whether [](/high0) or [](/high9), I have an inquiry of our forest. Let me ask you, are you a sapling? an eldertree? or somewhere in between? What I'm trying to ask is,

How long have you been *smoking marijuana?*

See how the whole tone of the conversation changed there? Kind of ruined the whole, inner circle r/Trees thing. We went from being [bonded by pineapple](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/16j4jyx.jpg1.gif) to [probing strangers](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/the_dude_nope.gif). 

So, let me ask you again man, if you don't mind - are you a sapling? an eldertree? or somewhere in between? What I'm trying to ask is, how many rings do you have Ent?

*What? rings? I don't have any rings man, I ain't married. what are you talking about?*

[Trees have rings man!](http://www.extension.org/sites/default/files/w/4/42/Tree_rings.jpg) Trees have rings in the base of their trunk. Every year, they grow a new ring and get thicker! [One ring = one year.](http://assets.knowledge.allianz.com/img/treerings_proxy_st_42441.jpg). It's how they tell the ages of trees. And since we weren't always Ents, it's a fair question to ask - how many rings does an Ent have? So Ents, I dunno about you, but I'm an Ent with 3 rings. 

at a [6] figured it'd be a great way to keep the Ent vocab growing. Keep on hanging with the Trees guys :D

**TL;DR - Trees grow rings in their trunks. One ring a year. Instead of asking ""how many years have you been smoking?"", let's ask ""how many rings do you have?""**"	6	19

I can't smoke because I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled, and it sucks because I've been super stressed and a bit depressed the past week or so, and could really use something to chill me out.

I've contemplated the idea of smoking through my nose, maybe even stick a joint in each nostril and become a Weed Walrus of sorts, but I think it would thin my blood out too much and stop it from clotting properly. I might be able to make a smoothie of sorts, by making firecrackers or something and then blending them up with Ice cream, but these are all just theories.

The point is, I'm unable to smoke for a while, and this makes me sad. So, my friends: smoke for me, for I cannot.

She and I are both musicians though, and use our lungs quite a lot, and she is very paranoid about smoking anything at all. Pipes/joints are a complete no, bongs are a no also, she is absolutely down for baking edibles, but that is not the easiest thing. She is however interested in vaporizers. I've been looking a bit at getting a vape from a friend, they have a barely used MFLB that they don't want anymore (due to volcano) and I could probably get a pretty sweet deal from them. But before she really decides, I need some more details.

Here's what I (think that I) know about vaporizers:

1. They don't burn the weed
2. They heat the air and water vapor, and this activates the THC, which you then breathe in in steam form
3. They effectively cut out most (all?) negative gunk
4. Used weed can then be sprinkled onto/into food

Is there anything that I'm wrong about here? Is there anything else you can tell me about how they work, or a site you can direct me to that will help me? Thank you so much, you are all awesome.

A few questions you guys could answer that would really help! 

what are some reasons marijuana is illegal?

What does the legalization of recreational marijuana in Washington and Colorado mean to the people in prisons for marijuana related charges?do they stay in jail or get let go?

Will businesses still not hire you if you test positive for marijuana? 

How could it negatively effect the economy? 

Or  you could just drop in and shine some light on a new perspective of legalization! 

Any little bit helps!

This post consists of story and a rant. Beware wall of text...

I recently moved to a new city for work.  I was upgrading my earnings and the city is great for a family so it was an easy decision.  But of course the access to trees was going to be difficult, at least for while.  I was somewhat concerned going without for a while because in the past I know I drink way to much when I'm not able to smoke.  One vice replacing another not very healthy I know.  But this gave me an incentive to find another source.  And being in Canada I didn't think it would be too difficult.

So its been about 6 months and I was able to acquire some once at a show, but nothing consistent.  Previously I was used to having a very business like arrangement and it was great.  Having a wife and kids reduces the chances to meet fellow tokers.  But I'm always on the lookout.  This sets the stage for the tory I am about to tell...

So I work downtown and was walking around at lunch and noticed there was some big Paul McCartney/Beatles exhibits going on around city hall.  I to see what was going on and there were cover bands and british stuff.  Pretty cheesy but I get talking to a dude who's probably in his 50s and who probably smokes based on my sterotyping (big music fan, and long hair).  We are actually both from the same city originally and he seems to be a pretty laid back kind of guy, so I bring up my plight and he offers to help me out.  This seems great, he's an older guy, has a family, not crazy, not homeless, no red flags going off.

He has a good connection in town he says.  Great.  It's his son Joe (not real name).  What?  Ok, not what I was expecting but I guess I'll go along with this.  He asks for my number and I'm already kind of scared to give my number to a guy, but I give my personal cell number and he puts it into his phone.  Now I'm already thinking great I'm in some guy's phone, what am I doing.  Luckily pot doesn't make me any more paranoid than I already am.

So anyways later that day (this was a Friday) I get a call from a guy Steve (again not real name) asking if I'm looking to pick up.  I say I was expecting to hear from Joe and this guy goes ""oh, I thought he was your friend.""  So obviously now I'm dealing third hand from a guy I didn't even know to begin with.  Seeming a bit wierd but I think let's go through with this, the guy has my phone number already at this point, it's probably going to be fine.  

He offers to come by my place.  Uh, no thanks, let's meet somewhere else.  I ask what part of the city he is in and we arrange to meet up in 2 hours.  We're going to meet at the mall.  I get there and wait for his call, of course he's not on time, what do you expect, not a big deal.  But by this time it's about 9:00 pm.  He tells me where he's parked and I got to meet him.  

As I'm leaving the mall there's a kid just inside the doors getting hassled by the cops over something.  This mall has bars in it so there's going to be security around.  Again this just adds to my stress level.  I get out to the guy's truck and there are two guys inside.  I'm coming from the passenger's side and the guy in the deat is basically screaming into a cell phone, obviously in some kind of argument.  I go around to the driver's side.

The guy rolls down his window and I confirm that this is Steve.  Meanwhile this crazy shouting match is going on with the passenger who doesn't seem to care that I have shown up.  Steve and I make our arrangements and he pulls out a small duffle bag which I noticed is filled with cocaine, and pills and shit I don't even recognize.  I got what I came for and quickly leave.

The point of this story?

Here I am simply wanting to pay money to get something that is actually much healthier for me to have than not.  I am willing to pay a premium for this and would gladly accept taxes well beyond what I paid.  I just want to walk up, pay my money, get what I came for, and go home.  Not wander around amall and wind up dealing with some idiot who is driving around with potentially years in prison in a jacked up pickup truck.  And doing deals while some psycho in passenger seat yells at his girlfriend on his phone with a police car parked 100 meters away.

I cannot tolerate this shit.  I am never doing this again.  If some reputable source I am comfortable with falls into my lap then fine, but I am not seeking out weed from people ever again.  This means that what I have today might be the last I get for a while and I can live with that.  My liver might not like it, but I have sufficient willpower.

As I said, I have money I am willing to spend, but I think now it's better spent on supporting legalization.  I know there are tons of ents in Canada and I would love to know what organizations working on legalization are out there that deserve support.  There has to be someone or some group working seriously on this issue.  Seeing the legalization efforts in the US gives me some hope, but where should efforts be focused?

tl;dr - trying to find weed in a new city can be sketchy, so tell me where my money to support legalization in Canada would be best spent "	4	8

Since i'm only 17 and this was my first job it took forever to find anywhere that would even consider my application let alone hire me. After several interviews i finally thought i had found a job when a fast food restaurant (im avoiding naming it, yes) i had interviewed at had practically guaranteed me a job. I was told i should hear back in a few days, and after a week of waiting i called back several times to talk to the manager and after a few more weeks i finally started up. The work was boring, my coworkers were all assholes and tried to all act like my boss even though we had the same job, and i'd always get blamed for ranom things and bitched at about being to slow when preparing food (my boss literally stood over my shoulder with a stopwatch while i was taking peoples orders and preparing their food and despite me meeting above average speed, i'd still get bitched at (and there were NEVER lines anyways). So after months of that and a huge argument with my manager and being hung up on, i decided it wasn't worth the shitty 2 days a week (5 hour shifts, and i had been begging for months for more hours, being initially told that i needed to improve my speed first, then just being flat out ignored) and i quit. Now's the part where i beg, i realized how unhappy i would be stuck at another shitty job like that, being treated like absolute shit, and would really like to do something i genuinely enjoy and think that other people enjoy as well (i've posted and got alot of great feed back that i really apreciate btw). That being said, here are some of my illustrations, many have been posted here before: http://imgur.com/5cvUl http://imgur.com/9QC8l http://imgur.com/IJWES http://imgur.com/LT8M8 http://imgur.com/qACqb http://imgur.com/qACqb http://imgur.com/NcxDM http://imgur.com/a/FBSCI#0

My parents have recently bought a new house and it came with an extra shed. My father already has one of his own so it was given to me and my brothers. But, for the most part, it will be mine. Obviously it has to be a stoner shed. That's obvious. However, while I do have some idea's for it, I thought there was no better place to ask what to stock this lovely home away from home with than here. So, I ask you wonderful people, what do I need? Anything. Furniture, food, posters, lighting, absolutely anything. Let your imaginations roam. It will probably be filled with mostly blue as my friend and I are leaning towards a 'underwater looking up at the stars' kinda theme. Solid [7] when we thought that up. Anyways, looking for ideas of what to buy or make so, whatcha got? C:	2	5

If you don't want to read my previous post, basically, I went from enjoying weed every day to a single a puff giving me a full-on panic attack. This was confusing, scary, and kind of sad.

I've been seeing a psychiatrist. I knew I was dealing with some mental issue(s), I just wasn't sure what it was exactly (and I still don't really KNOW what it is. Using psychiatric drugs is not an exact science). I started with anti-depressants, an SSRI, which, unlike Alex Jones may warn, didn't make me want to slaughter dozens of people. But it also didn't work.

As soon as I was prescribed Klonopin for daily use - I'm talking first or second dose - I knew it fixed a lot of the mental anguish I was experiencing. Got off the SSRI very recently, life is a lot better, and oh, trees and me are like this again: &lt;3

Just my story so far. I am absolutely not endorsing pharmaceuticals as a cure-all. Bud also isn't a cure-all. No drug is. This is just something to possibly help guide or provide empathy to those who don't feel quite right."	2	0

He acted as if he was confident. His night black hair fuzzy, and thick rubbed up against his palms as he plotted out his next move. He lunges forward, with a skateboard in his left hand he sets it down with surprising grace as he seemingly positions himself into a riding stance on the skateboard in the same motion. He needed extra speed, as the stair set he was approaching had limited runway,as it was also was bigger than he would have preferred.  Bending his knees in preparation, he pops his back foot hitting the tail of the board to the cement, and slides his front, his feet “stick” to the board as he jumps over a set of six stairs, also having to jump over to the other side of the hand rail in the middle of said set. CRASH! 
The skater clears the stairs and landed on his board, but his balance is wobbly at best. This causes his wheels to scrape up against the bottom of his board, and throws the husky, average sized teenager off of it.  He does a forward roll, and a half as his hands slap the ground to break his fall. 

“Fucking wheel bite!” He says. “You alright Twon, you had that ollie over the rail?!?” Asks another teen who is filming the incident. “I’m over it” exclaims Twon, better known as Tweezy to those who know him. “You’re fucking close dude!” Blaze, the filmer says in protest. “I got other shit to do man fuck wasting my time on this shit, my trucks are shit they keep giving me the wobbles.” Tweezy dusts himself off, and checks his pockets to make sure he has something, he puts on a backpack, and checks his phone. “Excuses, excuses, where you headed? You gonna mess with those Bummerall cats huh mayne?” Blaze asked referring to the neighborhood kids from across the town bridge.

Twon jumped back on his board and flicked off his friend, as he rode away towards the Bummerall. He thought that nickname was stupid, and unnecessary but for the neighborhood, it worked. He put on his headphones and switched to playlist of  Lupe Fiasco’s “Kick,Push"", UGK, and Modest Mouse. Twon seemed as if in meditation while he cruised along the streets skating to the music , he also loved the freedom of skating as he started popping random ollies over cracks, and speed bumps. He thought about his next sale, a “dub sack” of brick weed, or about nine or ten grams of pot probably imported from somewhere in latin America, the pot is of low quality because it is well traveled and sold for quantity, hence the “bricks” of dried buds pressed together so they can fit in car engines, tires, who knows what else.

Now he was at Bomerall and a few streets away from his destination, his speed slowed down significantly as the asphalt was rough, and he had to push his board for speed quite often now. He always thought the name Bomerall was stupid, then he remembered that Lance guy who had somehow conned his way into stealing Twons red and yellow Snodgrass “color changing pipe” he was quite pissed about that since it was an authentic and all. Those kids were shady, he also remembered his friend, Jap J (his only fellow friend who was also a Asian/islander mix) who recently was murdered there minding his own business, walking to the neighborhood park to watch something stupid like a fight or something. Now Tweezy was a little more serious, and his eyes focused he found the shortcut to the park, and jumped the wooden fence into the back of the park. A tall kid wearing an even taller person’s shirt and oversized basketball shorts flagged him down, “Right chea Tweezy, Right chea!”

Great, Tweezy thought, this guy. Bud was one of the “bumerall” kids, he usually didn’t have enough for a “dub sack”, but it was a Friday, and he had somehow gotten an extra 5 from his pops, by telling his father that he had a “hot date.” Bud and Tweezy had PE together throughout middle school, and were just acquaintances now since its been a few years since they had a class together. Tweezy still considered them “cool”, but he did know that Bud hung out with all the shadier kids in the neighborhood, and was known for pulling some stunts from time to tme.

“Let’s go right here Tweez, I got somethin’ for ya bitch azz “ Bud said in his most southern accent, he kept fidgeting around in his shorts. As he motioned for them to sit on some park benches.

“C’mon man quit fucking around, I got a trick I had homeboy filming” now Tweez wished he as back trying to jump stairs, as he noticed Bud looked like he might be carrying something, maybe a .9 mm. Twon now wished he was carrying, but didn't think he needed to for a skate session, and to sell a $20 bag.

“Damn man, hold up, gotta get my shit right” Bud sounded annoyed. Twon started to remember the times he’s seen Bud pull moves on other people, and started watching him closely.

“Damn mayne, what the hell these shorts ain’t coming through I gotta take this shit out right” Bud started fidgeting around, and Tweez saw some sort of metal flash and for some reason thought of his late friend Jap J, and how he wished he could just be skating and not selling a bag. Bud continued to fidget around making Twon nervous now he noticed that Bud was reaching deeper and had a certain glow in his eyes. Twon knew that this meant trouble, he gripped harder on his skateboard trucks. He saw that Bud was reaching deeper into his stash, and so he reacted. Two lifted his board and twisted his body as he brought it up. BAM! He might have reacted too quickly and instead of swinging the board into Bud’s hands it hit his fellow schoolmate in the side of the head. Bud spun, and fell off the bench towards the ground with his arms spread eagle, blood already coming from his temple, flying across the air. Twon looked down sweating, breathing heavily, and with his heart bumping like the bass at a rap show. In Bud’s hands was his coveted Snod grass pipe, and a $20…. "	3	0

And on Monday we all smoked for six hours straight. Under a tree, in the attic of a barn while looking out in the night sky, and on a porch. We messed with some illegal fireworks and we freestyled to each other the entire night. We rode in a car and appreciated the music that was playing. It was an amazing few days and I just want to make sure all the young ents growing up appreciate the friends around y'all, because when you grow up and go your own ways, that's when life changes the most. 	0	0

I have about a thousand dollars saved up from working, and I figure it's about time I splurge and buy myself a bong.

I was pretty high about a [7] when my girlfriend started to freak out saying she was going to die and her heart was racing and needed fresh air. I drove her home and I layed in bed with her to keep her calm. She started to shake a lot, I was getting scared because I had never seen this. Does anyone know why that happened. My guess is we smoked a lot for her, and with a heavy strain. I felt horrible but she stopped after a while and fell asleep.

Just found out I'm not actually a girl. AMA	http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1istng/im_34_just_found_out_im_not_actually_a_girl_ama/	"I'm completely confused at the moment. The past 6 months has been a whirlwind of life shattering revelations, but I suppose I should start at the beginning. 

First off, I'm [fucked up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloacal_exstrophy). Being born like that.. well, the doctors sewed me back up as best they could. Dozens of surgeries later, I have no rectum (permanent colostomy, not even a hole down there) and no reproductive system - no vagina, and no clitoris. Growing up like that sucked hard, but I survived. Met a great guy that didn't mind me not having a vagina. I thought life would be ok. Got a good job, with insurance. It was finally time to look in to reconstructive surgery, just to get some semblance of normality. You can't begin to understand how difficult pleasing a guy is when you can't have sex, or anal sex, at all, ever. Not that sexy time is pleasurable for me, I lack the required equipment. It's completely for the other person's benefit. There is something cathartic about it tho, like I'm having fun at a party I wasn't invited to. But maybe it was now time to get some artificial equipment, yes? 

Turns out, fuck no. My doctors do an exam. Put a camera inside my bladder and have a look see at what's happening down there. After, they inform me that I don't have any of the spare tissue required for the process (they'd have to put these cup things on my thighs and stimulate some tissue growth and.. it's a gross and weird process) - and oh yeah, by the way, your blood work shows you're actually male. 

That... is a hell of a thing to discover at 34 years old. I cracked. Completely lost my mind for a while. I turned to my best friend, my rock.. my christian, anti-gay boyfriend. He had no interest in being with a male. That would make him gay apparently. Even if that male was gender assigned female at birth because the doctors had to pick one, and you can't make an artificial penis for an infant. They told my Mom as I left the hospital as an infant. She never ""found the right time"" to tell me. That was a bombshell. My mental state degraded a bit more after I lost my job - I couldn't stay on task, got very depressed.

I know I'm not the only fucked up person in the world. So what the hell am I supposed to do? I've been transgendered my whole life and never knew. Tho, I suppose it does explain a lot. Like why I never really was ""in love"" with a guy. Sure I said the words, but it was always just words.. I have had female friends that I was completely in love with, but I always rationalized it as ""best friend"" feelings that were probably normal. 

If anyone has questions, talking about it will probably help. Besides, where else are you gonna have the chance to ask a ""girl"" like me questions?  People like me are 1:400,000. And less than 1/3 of those cases were gender reassigned (according to Dr. Gearhart at Johns Hopkins). If I did my math right, that's less than 400 people like me in the United States. To use a phrase another of my doctors used, I'm ""rare as rocking horse shit"". 

I don't want to ramble. My illusion that I'll ever have a shred of normality in my life is shattered. I just want to know if anyone else has some sage advice on how a person like myself can move on from something like this. Am I destined to die alone, or is there more? How would I even meet people that wouldn't condemn me instantly for being what I am? 

EDIT: I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the support you have all shown. I've spent the last 6 hours reading and replying, crying and being cheered up. I don't feel as alone as I did, and I appreciate all of your comments. Right now I just feel like I need to go make some new lesbian friends somewhere and start over. Thank you again for your kindness.

EDIT OF AN EDIT (.... editception?) - 17 hours later and I'm still getting tons of messages and replies. I am doing my best to read all of them. Another common theme in my personal messages is how many of you see me as inspiration in facing your own problems. I'm truly humbled that anyone could see my fucked up life and be positively impacted by it. That in itself has made this entire post worth it to me. Thank you again for all the positive support, and for contributing to the discussion."	2529	748

By this time next year, we will have started our wandering.  We've been discussing this for a while now, and we've decided that we're going on a journey for a while, an adventure of sorts.  We're going to become travelers, wanderers, and adventurers, on a journey of self discovery, wonder, and drugs.  We're going to see as much as we can for as long as we can do it.  Currently we're thinking of using my car at first to get an idea of what things will be like then when we feel ready we'll leave the vehicle behind (at my parent's house) and venture out into the world on foot, experiencing life in a dangerous, but epic, way that would seem foolish to most.  We understand what's coming, we actually really enjoy hanging out with wanderers and bums, if they're coherent.  They have the most amazing stories, and are often some of the chillest people in the world.  We want to learn more about ourselves and see the world from a different angle.  We get that there will be crazy risks, but that's a part of it's appeal.  Living life so mundanely just isn't cutting it anymore.  But, we have plans for later.  If we don't end up somewhere, content and happy, we have money saved up and plans for the farther future.  This started out as a high-dea about becoming gurus, but it became a pretty fucking awesome plan, if I may say so myself.  It may be fucking stupid, but it's what we feel we need to do. 

Cheers! Toke on, Ents!

tl;dr - My buddy and I are going wandering for a while, trying to experience as much as life as we can, despite the risks. Danger is fun!"	1	3

It's actually in her personality to be very outgoing and energic, and thus also very stressful, like every day. 

I would want to recommend her to smoke cannabis, but the problem is that the Swedish State Propaganda has made her think that you become stupid if you smoke, and then there's the illegal status on the drug. She might loose her job and driving license if they find out that she smokes, and she really isn't the person that could keep any secrets. So I basically can't recommend her to try cannabis even though I know she would really have great use from it.

It makes me sad. I see how she suffers every day... :(

""hi is Edgar or Poe there"" he had to call the land line because its obvious neither one of these creepy kids had a cell. ""they are on their way out.....thank you mrs.wollof... good bye"". cheech hangs up the phone nervously ""something sounded off"",
""huh"" I look at him
""their mom sounded scared""
as soon as my high mind registered what he was saying there came 2 loud bangs on the window next to my ear . I look to my right to see the smirking face of Edgar, he was Italian so he hair was all jelled back he had a no sleave shirt on that showed is depressing tattoos, he was a just slick character. but where was Poe?
BANG BANG!!
the two larger bangs made me jump out of my seat swung to the right to see 6foot 3 Poe banging his head on the window(he wasn't to bright). we motioned for them to get there asses in the car. they hopped in the back. we were pulling out of the drive way when I heard Poe mumble something to his brother"" uh oh, mom is coming with Allan"" 
edgar snapped to attention ""drive"" he yelled
everything happened at once..
the screaming first, it was a high pitched shriek coming out of the lips of their mom running at us, then there was a bang from what looked like a jar a marble exploding onto the tree next to us. she had thrown something at us!! we speed away leaving behind and old women clutching a life size doll  and shaking a stick at us. nobody spoke we just waited till we got down town where we thought we were safe...

Last week, the Department of Justice released their guidance in light of ballot initiatives in Colorado and Washington -- we thought you'd want to see the news:

Justice Department Announces Update to Marijuana Enforcement Policy

Today, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an update to its federal marijuana enforcement policy in light of recent state ballot initiatives that legalize, under state law, the possession of small amounts of marijuana and provide for the regulation of marijuana production, processing, and sale.

In a new memorandum outlining the policy, the Department makes clear that marijuana remains an illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act and that federal prosecutors will continue to aggressively enforce this statute. To this end, the Department identifies eight (8) enforcement areas that federal prosecutors should prioritize. These are the same enforcement priorities that have traditionally driven the Department¹s efforts in this area.

Outside of these enforcement priorities, however, the federal government has traditionally relied on state and local authorizes to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws. This guidance continues that policy.

For states such as Colorado and Washington that have enacted laws to authorize the production, distribution and possession of marijuana, the Department expects these states to establish strict regulatory schemes that protect the eight federal interests identified in the Department¹s guidance. These schemes must be tough in practice, not just on paper, and include strong, state-based enforcement efforts, backed by adequate funding. Based on assurances that those states will impose an appropriately strict regulatory system, the Department has informed the governors of both states that it is deferring its right to challenge their legalization laws at this time. But if any of the stated harms do materialize -- either despite a strict regulatory scheme or because of the lack of one -- federal prosecutors will act aggressively to bring individual prosecutions focused on federal enforcement priorities and the Department may challenge the regulatory scheme themselves in these states.

Tell us what you think about this update."	3	2

How does this switch works? a molecule with a bond in the middle that allows both halves to work (like a grinder, as example) and rotate in different directions. Well, when we see something, a photon strikes each of these rotary bonds, causing them to spin on their axis (cis- to trans-), and sending a signal to our brain that this happened. Imagine that each of these molecules is like a gong: and there are millions of them, a giant curved wall of them, all gongs, ready to be struck with mallots. Then, switch it so that you can see color: Your eye is a vast curve of mallots, with thousands of gongs of every shape and size (photons of different color) flying at them, and when they strike, they produce different tones that resonate up to an observer.

All our nervous system works in this way, with our senses being struck and resonating outside our bodies, carried in through tunnels of music, and then...us? perhaps. Or there is someone else listening deep inside the cathedrals of our minds, listening to the acoustics. Or perhaps our halls are empty, and the sounds of life vibrate through ourselves, the instruments of the universe, for the benefit of none other but themselves. 
Just think of yourself as a giant pipe organ/fiber optic system. 

Peace out, use those minds."	10	2

Here's mine:

Last year I got pulled over with a frient after we'd just smoked a bowl. My frient was smoking a cig so we were pretty hopeful that the cop wouldn't smell anything. Asks for license and insurance, yadda yadda, says I made a left hand turn where there was a temporary no left turn sign. I apologized, politely explaining that I didn't see it and wasn't from around the area. He understood, but had a strange look on his face. 

""Ma'am, do you have a hamster or something, because I've gotta tell you, as soon as you opened your window I smelled something funny."" I tried not to let my terror show as I quickly responded with ""I have 2 dogs, and a cat, I took them for a car ride earlier, must be bath time if you can still smell them!""

He then cracked a smile, thanked me for being so pleasant, and advised me to pay better attention to street signs because some of his colleagues ""aren't as fond of that smell"". Luck was on my side that day. He didn't even ticket me for the illegal turn.

**TL;DR** Got pulled over after smoking in the car, thought I was screwed, cop turned out to be super cool."	19	13

The preamble:

When I started working out more heavily, eating a lot more, and drinking protein shakes, as well as a lot more milk than I usually did I noticed that my facial acne got a lot worse. It was painful, uncomfortable and a bit embarrasing as I'm in my 20s, and hadn't had much acne since my late teens. After researching a lot of causes this led me to realize that there's no single cause for acne, it's unique to the individual, and I would have to figure out what was causing my acne myself.

The setup:

I would do one week of 'cleansing' for my face, where I didn't use any cleaning products to remove oil build up (at the time I was using a few different facial scrubs/soaps to see what worked best for me) and would simply rinse my face with water twice daily, once in the morning, and once after working out. From there I would begin by adding modifiers to my facial routine first, while my diet would remain the same. After that I would add in environmental modifiers (a humidifier), and then begin focusing on diet. I'm not going to get into my diet other than what I removed from the process as everyone's diet will vary, and what affected me will probably be totally different than what affected you. Let's step through the weeks so you can get an idea of performing these tests yourself. Keep in mind this is a LONG process, but the payoff was completely worth it to me.

Week 1: Cleanse, mediocre to no improvement, acne was still heavy around nose/chin area.

Week 2: Begin with a mild facial scrub twice a day, no alcohol of any kind, no improvement.

week 3: Begin using a facial moisturizer after washing face twice daily, acne actually got worse.

week 4: Begin using humidifier for one week, mild improvement in skin dryness, no improvement to acne itself.

week 5: Stop eating all red meat, no improvement.

week 6: Stop eating all meat, no improvement.

week 7: Stop drinking cow's milk (using water in protein shakes), slight improvement, the best change thus far, but acne was still bad.

week 8: Stop eating chocolate (I only ate small amounts anyways), no improvement.

week 9: Remove whey protein shakes from diet (I replaced them with eating homemade jerky), major improvement, almost no acne all week.

week 10: Acne came back this week, realized that I had eaten quite a few meals out, and there had been high fructose corn syrup in what I had been eating (ketchup, and a few other things), decided to let face reset for one week.

week 11: Cut high fructose corn syrup, started drinking protein shakes again with water, mild improvement.

week 12: Cut high fructose corn syrup, and all whey based products, added in a facial cleanse that wasn't alcohol based, acne cleared up.

week 13: Added goat's milk to diet as it's easy protein/calories, acne still clear.

week 14: Tested whey protein again with some protein bars, acne flaired up badly.

week 15: Avoided eating any whey protein or high fructose corn syrup, continued drinking goat's milk, and washing face with non-alcohol cleanse, acne cleared up.

week 16: Repeat of week 15 to ensure it wasn't just a fluke, acne continued to stay clear.

Week 17 and onwards: Continue avoiding high fructose corn syrup (I noticed it would flair up the next day after eating any), and acne continued to stay clear.

So that's pretty much it. It took me almost 18 weeks to figure out what was causing my acne, but in the end it's been worth it. For me it ended up being a bad combination of whey protein, and high fructose corn syrup (and a bit cow's milk, but not much), once I cut those out my acne has been almost completely clear while maintaining the same workout schedule.

TLDR: Get a plan together for what you're going to cut or add in, then make it happen, you might be able to improve your acne!"	709	760

Getting away with smoking(vape).	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1p3cpa/dorm_life_getting_away_with_smokingvape/	"So the first day my freshman year of college I decided to vape in my room. (Don't ever smoke in your dorm unless you know people wont care...). 
I got lucky. After vaping an RA knocked on our door. He told us it smelled in the halls and we said sorry and put it away. Luckily all I was charged for was a Noxious odor. I payed 20 bucks to the ra and that was that. 
Im going to make a step by step guide so you dont get busted for vaping. 
1. Buy 3m hooks(the ones that attach to your wall with adhesive)

2. Place them above the window(if you dont have a window dont vape)

3. Poke 1 hole in each corner of a blanket or large towel/tapestry

4. Put the holes on the hooks so the blanket covers most of the window(like blinds)

5. Place a towel at the door, tape any large gaps in the door if needed

6. Buy a fan if you dont have one and put it in front of the window so it sucks in the air from ur room.

7. (optional) place a second fan in front of the door facing the window for extra circulation.

8. Turn of the air unit in your room if you have one.

9. Make a zoom tube (scented dryer sheets in a water bottle and poke holes in the bottom, breath your hit through the cap)

10. Before you start getting stoned make some popcorn. This covers up smell and gives u munchies for later.

11. Now stand in front of the window and put the blanket that you hung up behind you so your in something like a fort. This will prevent vapor and smell to leak. 

12. Set the vape to a low heat. Take small hits and blow it into the zoom tube at the fan. 

13. when you are done remove the blanket and move the fan so its in front of your door blowing air at the still open window. This makes sure any vapor that escaped leaves your room. 

14. Spray some air freshener and enjoy the popcorn!"	4	5

Over the summer I dabbled in a bit of every kind of consumption and got myself out there trying them all (to date vape is my favorite, especially for college ;) ). But recently I haven't had the desire or urge to smoke, I have about an eighth stored up for whenever but just don't use it as much. My parents found out through an old frient from high school and were oddly cool about it.Now I'm not saying that they would light up with me but they understood that people do their own thing and there isn't one drug for everyone, also I think they were happy I didn't smoke cigs like they do. Anyhow it got me thinking on the world and how it is changing and accepting trees as a good alternative to more harsh and legal drugs. It's a great world and sometimes experiencing it sober is awesome and it would really surprise you. Like I said to each their own, I know I will toke here and there but for now I'm soaking in my surroundings ad also saving a ton of money. I guess what this rant is trying to say is if you are smoking to run away from something, as much as it sucks you gotta face it. I ran away for a year and to face my problem head on was a huge weight off my shoulders. Anyway toke on fellow ents and I will join you high in the clouds another day. Happily at a [0], OrangeySponge :)Also for anyone that has already enjoyed their trees or is still reading, you might like the dubstep music video for Heavy On, on the UKD dubstep YouTube page	1	0

Weed made me normal for an hour.	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1wl975/how_can_i_reexperience_this_weed_made_me_normal/	"Alright well I had to quit smoking weed a few months ago and when I used to smoke I'd always get anxious and could never really enjoy it. 

In general I'm a pretty awkward person; I've dealt with depression, anxiety and a few months ago started developing psychosis (which is why I had to stop blazing). 

After I quit smoking weed I decided to work towards improving my life - I started working out, quit smoking cigarettes, my psychosis went away and I've been doing better in school.

Yesterday I took 5 bong rips before this all happened; after I smoked I was higher than I'd been in a long time and it actually felt like I was in a different reality. I laid down on my couch and just tripped out to the ceiling - the patterns in my ceiling made me trip out and I felt like I was floating. It kind of felt like I was having an out of body experience. 

My friends came in the room while this happened and it was like all my anxiousness left me. I felt like my consciousness was expanding and I could live in the moment without fear. I felt an incredible zen-like energy throughout my body - I felt completely comfortable with my friends and could just enjoy the present. I was able to speak whatever came to mind and it actually made sense and sounded normal. I felt normal. 

I could feel my friends reactions to this - I was able to sense their underlying emotions and used that to guide my behaviour. I could sense they were proud of me, they wanted me to act like this - to act normal. It was a mental breakthrough I had - it was like I finally learned how to behave and the fear I used to have was all due to overthinking - I need to live in the present and without worry. 

After an hour or so I started coming down and the effects of this were lost for the most part. 

So do you have any advice on re-experiencing this and making the changes permanent? I saw such an improvement, I can't let that go to waste. Maybe meditation will help? I don't know, I'd really appreciate some ideas though. "	2	6

I realize that this isn't completely true, as other factors like how much you exercise and your body fat can make it longer. However, if someone hadn't smoked in a month, and then smoked only one time, do you think it's a safe (obviously can't be 100% sure, but fairly sure) bet that their system will be cleaned out enough for a court ordered UA within 2 weeks or so? (Long story short, I got way way way too drunk and hit the blunt that was going around out of habit without even thinking about it several times.

[8]	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2d79yq/my_family_reunion_8/	"This world is full of unexpected happenings. Sometimes, events occur that you thought only happen in dreams...like smoking with most of your extended family. Normally I would recant a crazy story like this to my family, but seeing as this story is about my family, I figured you guys would be the next best thing. Before I start, I should probably warn you. I am so high right now. I feel like Every word I type is being crafted by the Norse gods of word forgery. Anyways. I don't see my family too often. I live in spokane, and they live in Seattle, plus i'm always so busy that it's hard to find time to visit. The last time I was able to see this much of my family was about 2 years ago, and I hated it. My family is sort of...competitive. Many of my family members are pretty successful, so everyone is constantly trying to one up each other. It's a never ending barrage of light-hearted insults that are taken not so light heartedly behind a fake smile and laugh. So, when I was informed of this years family reunion, you can imagine how excited I wasn't. Now the good part. I got to my uncles house, late, only to be greeted by the entire family. Things proceeded normally, after the champagne broke out everyone receded into their pompous state of one-uppery. My cousin asked me if I wanted to longboard so I took the opportunity to get the hell out of that ring of pride. We grabbed our longboards and headed out. The last time I saw my cousin he was a whiny little brown-noser and I couldn't stand to be around him. This time, he seemed...laid back. He even made me laugh a few times. Things are improving. We catch up on our past few months, and finally, the question arises. ""You smoke man? Because I sure hope we can make this reunion a lot more interesting."" HELL. YES. I don't know when this kid decided to stop acting like a used tampon, but my cousin is finally a man! I tell him yes, and he's all like ""Well, let's do this."" We smoked a few bowls in the forest behind his house, and came back to the reunion.
Enter: Two of my uncles.
""So what were you two doing there? Starting fires? Smells like you guys were rolling around with a skunk"" 
Fuck.
""You know, weed isn't enjoyable guys...unless your smoking it with your two coolest uncles.""
*HIGH FUCKING FIVE EACH OTHER*
We kind of just stand there, baffled...we figured we were screwed...but then we realized they were serious... And it didn't stop there.
One of my uncles, who by the way, is my cousins father, tells us to stay there, and returns about 4 minutes later with:
My aunt, 6 of my cousins, and 2 of my cousins wives.
In his hand is a pipe, and a green film vial...full of that sweeeet Seattle kush. We all get in cars and drive to a pond...I smoked with 12 family members. Now I'm playing my guitar an singing kids by MGMT to my whole family. Nobody is insulting. No one is trying to one up each other. Thank you Mary Jane. 
TL;DR: I smoked with 12 of my family members at a big family reunion and I'm pretty sure it fixed my family problems. "	1	3

Keep in mind everyone's experience is a little different. I'll start of by describing the body high, picture a master masseuse firmly and deeply massaging every muscle in your body; and that wonderful feeling is more concentrated where you have more muscle (legs/back/chest/etc).
 Now for the head high,I would describe sober thoughts as linear, while high thoughts are abstract. For example, sober person : that's a nice car, wish I could drive it. High person : that's a nice car, probably gets windy in there, why is there wind?
The head and body high aren't the only pleasurable by-products of ganja, but in my opinion are the defining features. Another feeling you will experience is slight pressure behind your eye balls, and things will look a little different too, more vivid and colorful. You will notice yourself getting hungry even if you don't need more food, but you should eat more anyway because it will be awesome. Also your sense of touch is intensified, making everything more enjoyable. Now that you know what to expect, enjoy your first time. And smoke on ents"	6	1	
4595008	MMA	143150834	https://www.reddit.com//r/MMA/comments/2d87w2/i_got_in_a_street_fight_with_a_kangaroo/	2014-08-11 12:08:56		hard5tyle	I got in a street fight with a kangaroo	http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2d87w2/i_got_in_a_street_fight_with_a_kangaroo/	"I went for a run after work with my dogs, my 3 year old Amy, and 7 year old Lexy. They're typical playful labs without an aggressive bone in their body... anyway I'm running along my usual track when the dogs (on leads because without them they will out run me and not come home for a week) suddenly veer off to the right. I look up and see why - this huge 7 foot kangaroo sitting in the grass staring back at us.

I pull back on their leads and slide to a stop while they're going crazy. Not ""I wanna kill this fucking thing crazy"" but ""I wanna play with that thing!"" crazy.

My dogs aren't huge but I was buggered and struggling to hold them back, we were inching closer and closer to the stoney behemoth in front of us. It glared back with piercing eyes, completely still with a pose like a cobra ready to strike.

I didn't have my knife on me, just my 1 hand free with the other clamped tightly around their leads, holding them back from what I imagine they thought was going to be the most fun time of their life. Rammstein was blaring through my headphones, my phone strapped to my arm. I shouted ""FUCK OFF CUNT"" at the beast. He didn't flinch.

The dogs exploded and pulled me forward, making me fall face first in the dirt and lose hold of their leads. What happened next was a blur but I will describe it as best I can remember.

I think I managed to scramble to my feet when everything went bright and I flashed back onto the ground. Rammstein had been replaced by a ringing sound, not just in my ears but somehow through my whole body. I look up and see the roo throwing kicks at my hounds, one caught Lexy in the hips and skidded her through the grass, her mouth opened in what I imagine was a loud yelp and then the dogs bolted.

I was still on the ground, dazed and confused. I instinctively stood up and my opponent, his back facing me, lifted himself up on his tail and turned 180 degrees to look me dead in the eyes. Now I knew what was happening. I had two choices - get my ass beat by my coat of arms, or fight this motherfucker and hope to get away relatively alive.

He made the first move, throwing a double kick using his tail as a base. Even in my exhausted and confused state I surprisingly dodged this with ease, my animal instincts taking over. I answered immediately with a counter right which landed flush on his temple. Now I'm not a particularly strong man, nor am I trained in striking. But I hit this cunt HARD and he didn't even blink.

I don't know if it was the adrenaline or a possible concussion, but everything was happening in slow motion now. When my punch landed I remember thinking ""OH SHIT, I've made a huge mistake"". I'd thrown my whole weight into the shot and fallen forward onto the bastard. 

Suddenly time speeded up and I had been cut a dozen times, my shirt was torn to shreds in an instant and the prick wasn't slowing down - I reacted and pushed forward, his claws dug into me as I reached behind him. I felt him leaning back to throw another double kick at point black, with no escape this time and without a split second to spare I clasped my hands together behind his back and pulled guard.

Now I have watched a lot of MMA, had a few drunken wrassles with my brother and taken a 1 hour lesson on the basics of jiu jitsu. I have no fucking idea how to pull guard, but somehow it worked. I had nullified his hands and wrapped my legs around him, my feet desperately trying to hold the grip.

The pace of the fight returned to real time. Here, in the middle of nowhere, I was wrapped around this hulking kangaroo, neither of us knowing what to do. His t-rex arms struggled, his sharp claws digging into my chest, but by now I wasn't feeling pain and it didn't make an ounce of difference. After about 10 seconds of standing around he started to pivot, trying to throw me off, but there was no fucking way I was letting go of this cocksucker.

He became increasingly frantic, rocking around until eventually he leaned too far back and I moved all my weight upwards to plant this sucker on the ground.

I don't know how I did it, but in the split seconds as he fell back and tried to stabilise himself with his tail I pulled to the left. I felt the momentum shift and I adjusted and prepared to move to the right.

We hit the ground where I knew I had the advantage, this dickhead can't even lay on his back let alone fight off of it. I loosened my grip and exploded over to the right. By the time he got to his feet it was too late - I had taken the cunt's back.

He was standing again and somehow I had him in a body triangle and I began fighting my way by his weakling arms to secure a choke. It was a matter of seconds before I sunk it in, his thin and exposed neck crumpling beneath my arms. In a last ditch attempt he began hopping around aimlessly before making a final run forward, trying to escape me. Too bad I was stuck to him like glue.

With each hop he got slower and slower until eventually he collapsed. Being an animal lover I didn't want to hurt him if I didn't have to do in order to protect my wellbeing, so I held onto the choke for a few seconds until I was sure he was completely limp and unconcious.

I slowly let go of my submission, ready to reapply if I felt any sudden outbursts, but he was out cold. I released, got to my feet and looked at him for a few seconds and still in shock, not really thinking, reached for my phone - I could see it through my arm strap, the screen completely obliterated. Then I noticed a sleight movement and realised even if I could take a photo, I would rather quit while I was ahead and get the fuck out of there.

I ran down the track towards my house, only looking back as I was about to head downhill and out of sight - I saw my opponent standing. I stopped, a few hundred metres away from the safety of my home. He was sniffing around, very slowly and looking very hazy. Eventually he hopped away. I'd like to think his shoulders were slumped as if he was crushed by defeat, but more likely he was just confused.

I got home and for the first time ever my dogs had ran off and returned to the yard - the gate was open but they were cowering near the door. They came over to greet me, tails wagging as if to say ""Glad you caught up!"", playing off the whole ""we abandoned you"" reality.

Now I'm 8 beers deep and still stinging from the antiseptic in my wounds. Good fight, wasn't close.


Edit: Wow this really blew up. Unfortunately it is a work of fiction. I hope you pricks enjoyed it anyway, I had fun writing it and imagining it playing out. 

For the record I do see kangaroos when I take the dogs for a run, but they don't usually get close or move away pretty quickly. Never scrapped with one though"	1080	270

I spent a lot of time smoking in groups, planned sessions. Recently I decided that I wanted to just chill, smoke a bowl to myself, and relax. I stopped about halfway through the bowl and started smoking a cigarette and putting music on. When I sat back down to finish smoking I picked up the pipe and said out loud to myself, ""The cigarette holders that old movie actresses used where classy because you smoke with your pinky up"". It was as these words left my mouth and I lit the bowl that the high smacked me right in the head. I had grown so used to talking and being active while I was getting high that I hadn't actually felt what it was like on the way up. I had forgotten the process, only ever achieving the end goal after distracting myself with conversation or FIFA. 

Anyway that's all. Really love the community here. "	3	0

I fleshed out my own contribution into a **lengthy** blog post, which I'll paste here in it's entirety. There's a link at the bottom which features links to BGG, Amazon and a picture of a cat about to eat my Quarriors set, should you wish to see the original post. 

Kids don’t come with instruction manuals, right? From the time you leave the hospital to the time you blink and they’re 25 years old with a car, it’s all pretty much common sense, luck and a whole bucket full of teachable moments. Fortunately for us gamers, all of our games do come with instruction manuals. These two thoughts have been swimming through the grey matter between my ears for a few days now, bumping into each other and generally causing havoc while I’m trying to think about other things. In order to get them out of my head and onto this page where they’ll leave me alone for a bit, I decided to write this rough guide to raising your own gaming group.

I’m not a child psychologist (although I do hold an MEd.) and I’m not a perfect parent (but I do have two kids who are poised to be better people than I am) but what I do have is an overactive brain and a lot of experience in playing games with kids. So please do not consider this the be-all end-all guide to playing age appropriate games with your kids. It’s just one man’s experience guiding his two daughters from “spit it out! Spit out that meeple!” to “I know it says 14+ but I think you can handle this game”.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list but more of an overview with a few highlights that I feel really pull out the best of both the games and the children, as well as us parents. They may not be your favorite games, but they’re at least (in the early years) tolerable and not inclined to cause a backyard incident with a My Little Pet Shop Monopoly board and a charcoal grill. This is what worked for my wife and I with our kids and perhaps you can pull something from this list that will work for you and yours.

**Ages 0-2**

I recommend a good set of blocks. Something that can be chewed upon without inflicting serious damage on the child or the toy. Sitting in the lap of an adult and mucking about with some sturdy game pieces can also be fun but really, adult supervision is required. A child this age may attempt to eat, bend, drool on, shove into various orifices or otherwise mangle game pieces. Blocks are the way to go. Use them to stack, use them to start letter recognition, etc. If you have games with big, chunky components that won’t scar when bitten, letting the kids play with the pieces is also a lot of fun. They may not get the game but building a familiarity with the bits and just having fun with them works too!

**Ages 2-4**

We started both of my kids off pretty young (3-4) with **Hi Ho Cherry-O** and **Candyland**. While not the most fun things to play, they did perform several very important roles. They’re both great games at showing children how to take turns, how to play fair and how to win/lose with at least a modicum of grace. They’re also great in reinforcing things like counting in a game. Other games we’ve tried that also help with these skills are Connect 4. As my kids got closer to 4, we also introduced **Guess Who** – a fun guessing game that teaches kids how to organize their thoughts and how to ask appropriate questions.

**Ages 5-6**

After we got through those games and when each kid hit about 5, we started a heavy rotation of Gamewright Games. We also kept Guess Who  in the rotation but modified it using the same methods Tom Vasel (Dice Tower) suggests – each player chooses 2 people. Changes the whole game, and for the better! It’s already familiar but this new aspect makes asking more rounded and general questions key.

Back to Gamewright - **Feed the Kitty** and **Hisss** were particular favorites. They move the ideas of fair play, taking turns and whatnot forward a simple step, and also provide games that won’t land parents in Arkham Asylum after six plays in a row. **The Curse of the Ruby Rhino** is another great game that involves lots of tactile throwing coins into a treasure chest (the game box) and pulling them out again.

**Ages 6-7**

From there we moved on to more Gamewright games including **Slamwich**, which was a favorite. Other similar type games were any of the **Magic Labyrinth** style games, **Blast Off** and **King Toad**. **Sorry** is a great game because it forces kids to deal with major setbacks, which with a little thought are recoverable but at the time seem waaaaay huge. A few games of Sorry for each kid helped teach them the concept of the long game. We also got ahold of **Catan Junior** when my youngest was about six and a half. That was a huge hit for our whole family. Enough of a decent game to keep the adults entertained but the kids can still win using their developing sense of strategy. Also introduced at this age was **Zombie Dice** – which my youngest still loves. We shied away from this perhaps a little longer than we had to mostly because of the theme and the use of shotguns to blow zombies brains out through the backsides of their heads.

**Ages 7-8**

We introduced **Frog Juice**(a neat component collecting, spell casting game) and started looking at broader, more strategic games. This is the age where **Forbidden Desert**, **Forbidden Island**, **Castle Panic**, **Cube Quest**, **My Happy Farm** (a far more complex, interesting game than it sounds) and **Carcassonne** sans farmers come into play. The beauty of this age is that you can see them getting it with each subsequent play. It’s a real joy to watch both of my girls broaden their strategy and bump into new concepts. Those light bulb moments are great, and applicable outside of gaming as well. With the co-op games, I found myself generally playing the guide for them on the first few play throughs until they got the fact that it wasn’t a competition and until they became accustomed to the rules. In both cases, my kids picked up the individual quirks of the co-ops within 2-3 games and haven’t looked back since. **Tsuro** is another title that we introduced recently and the whole family enjoys it. It’s a pretty laid back version of cut-throat.

The big hit at this age, for both my then 10 year old and 7 year old – **King of Tokyo**. Oh. My. Goodness! They ate this game up! The push your luck aspect, with the chucking of a bunch of dice and giant robots and creatures. Instantly a hit.

**Ages 8-10**

My 8 year old is about a month away from 9 and she’s started taking a real interest in **Magic: The Gathering**, **Diamonds**, **Dominion**, and even **X-Wing**. Of my two kids, she’s the gamer. We’ve also started playing a lot of **Love Letter** and **Hanabi** at her request. She’ll dabble in other titles too. For both kids (and our family as a whole) **Ticket to Ride** is a must-play and is still very much requested. **Got ‘Em!** is another great game that combines some interesting strategy with random card draws and is also another big request.

**Ages 10-14**

My 11 year old is entering her teen years. That combined with the fact that anything I do can’t be cool has her not gaming as much. She still loves a good game of Dominion though and her and her younger sister recently went all kinds of bonkers when I gave them my somewhat meager stash of Magic cards. So the fire’s still there.

She’s good enough at Dominion that she wins about 40% of the time when playing against adults. She’s also dabbled in other games and seems to enjoy trick taking games like Diamonds as well. While a lot of games are marked 14+, I think my 11 year old has the wherewithal to play those titles as well, just not perhaps the interest to invest the time into them.

**Dependent more on Ability than Age**

Some kids, particularly if raised by gamer parent(s) I think, just get the whole thing. They may be able to handle the complexities of games aimed at older people sooner than other kids. Also, every child is an individual and you know your kids, so don’t pass up an opportunity to try something more complex, but be mindful of theme

Both kids also love the classic board game **Dungeon** and have played (the 8 year old with more help than the 11 year old) **Seasons**. They really like that one, but it’s kind of a chore for us adults to help them out so it makes it to the table perhaps only once a month. We also enjoy **Dungeon Roll** although I’m not sure how much of that is because of the neat box and excellent dice. I like the game personally but it can get a little long in 3-4 player configurations.

My almost 9 year old plays the heck out of **Quarriors** but doesn’t always take the time to read/understand all the card effects and still needs a bit of help with them. This game features so many dice it’s been a hit with nearly every kid I’ve ever introduced to it. At first they all seem to base their strategy on one of two things – either getting one of every color on offer, or going for the Dragon if it’s out. Later on they get some of the card effects though and actually start to develop some real strategy. I will say that lately my youngest can get a little frustrated with the many, many choices on offer though so we don’t play this one as much as we used too.

A few other games that both kids really enjoy: **Tokaido**, a game of 19th century Japanese tourism. It’s a wonderful game of walking down a major road, with a neat turn mechanic while players try to eat the best food and collect the most sites and souvenirs.

My 8 year old is somewhat obsessed with **Baldrick’s Tomb** another dungeon crawl, based on the old procedurally generated video game such as Nethack or Diablo. I like it too!

Both girls also really like **Bohnanza** the card game of bean farming. It’s a great trading game played over an hour and a half or so with up to seven people. They can hold their own and they get to play with a group of adults too.

**In conclusion**

I’m sure there are a ton and a half of games that I’ve left out, forgotten about or just haven’t played. That’s the blessing and the curse of living in a golden age – no more scarcity! Too many games! You of course will know your own children far better than I do – their capabilities, their limitations, that zombies may enthrall them or give them nightmares for weeks. This is meant to be the reflection of one parent who set about to grow his own gaming group, so to speak. Hopefully you’ll be able to pull some suggestions from this list!

I started my microwave dinner, which said to put it in for 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

But I didn't put it in there for 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

I put it in there for 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

I had just finished loading my bowl full, which is honestly too big of a bowl to be smoking by yourself... But I was happy I finished this huge webcam presentation on a Wednesday, when it was actually due on Sunday. I deserved it.

So I started my chicken fried steak dinner in the microwave, and I ran to my backdoor to smoke my bong (I don't like the smell of weed in the house). I smoked that whole bowl to myself in 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

Fast forward to me eating and as I'm eating, I decide to watch my presentation one more time. I started it, and it was the WORST thing I've ever seen in my life! I didn't even remember saying a lot of it! The thing that made me laugh though was how it took me getting stoned off my ass to realize how shitty it was.

I emailed my professor and she deleted it for me to resubmit when I please.

But what about the warm, possibly dead baby you ask?

When I got up after emailing my professor, I sat in a different chair for about 5 minutes to look at my games. I went back to that chair to go on the internet, but when I sat down this time, I felt something warm and kind of lumpy under me. Like awkwardly warm... Me, in my stoned haze, thinks ""what if it's a dead baby"" and then, I think it could possibly be true. Know that I am the only one home right now and there are no babies in the family.

I decide to check just in case... It was just a warm pillow from the plate that was sitting there with my food for a bit.

tl;dr: Entered 4:20 on the microwave timer instead of 4:30, sat on a warm pillow stoned."	9	1

Once in the shower everything was going pretty normal that is until the dreadful end. When you have to get out of the nice warm shower, to the testicle shrinking cold out side. But, instead of getting out I decided to do the normal thing. That is to practice winking, I'm trying to get into a habit of doing this when I make random eye contact with some one spacing off in my direction. Practicing for a couple minutes, even going so far as to pretend I was at a gathering I am attending later. I then decided it would be funny if I pretended to exaggerate blink, as if winking with both eyes. I did this for far longer than I'd like to admit. Finally realizing what I had been doing all this time I laughed pretty hard at myself, and thought it best to get out of the shower.	1	0

Mostly related...	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2wyk27/need_to_rant_mostly_related/	"To provide context for the story, I go to school which this year has had a few problems with drugs.
Kid overdosed on coke earlier this year, recently had a few people expelled for doing stupid weed related things, as well as a large group of people get in trouble for alcohol.

So of course after these chain of events, my school invited someone to speak on front of the whole school about substance abuse. They invited a real doctor from a real hospital who specializes in drugs, and their effect on the human brain. He talked about the standard meth and heroin ruining your life. He showed a bunch of CAT scans and shit, throwing numbers at us, which I legitimately believe were mostly true. I have no problem with this so far, its pretty reasonable. Here's where I start to get upset. This doctor starts making claims which are so easily disproved, and essentially lies.
He states that 80-something percent of weed contains meth, yeah you heard that right, meth, while quietly saying this is based on one instance of a small group of people. This is only one of the many absurd generalizations based on some numbers he pulled out of his ass. At this point I was pretty annoyed, and couldn't think of anyone that would believe what he was saying. As we are leaving the assembly, I start venting/talking to my friends about it. What surprised me was that some of them who had smoked before, and were pretty well educated on Marijuana, actually took what he said as fact. Their justification? ""He's a doctor, he can't just lie about things like that."" Despite my bombardment of facts and studies, they kept saying mockingly; ""Yeah, you definitely know more about this than the guy who is a doctor, and who's job it is to study these things.""

I find this to be a total abuse of the title of doctor on his part.
Furthermore, I think that it was irresponsible of the school to allow this man to convey these statements as fact, especially considering it is supposed to be an educational facility.
What irks me the most though, is people's blind belief of other people, as long as it is said confidantly enough.

[7]	http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/330hr3/what_if_7/	"When people smoke the thc guides them into the moment and that is why they feel so happy and euphoric . They are so happy and hilarious because they have been forced into the moment for a brief amount of time. That is why it seems that time slows down . It is because your perception is now one from a consciousness living in the moment. And the reason that people who smoke more are more open to foreign ideas and spiritual ideas is because they have seen the moment every time they smoked and grew to love living in the moment. This is why they search for answers to their infinite questions on what consciousness is and how to be enlightened to stay in the moment forever and be forever peaceful. And then they become aware of spirituality and begin to practice it as to learn how to purposefully stay in the moment as long as possible. And that is why ""stoners"" are the way they are. They are more present than the average blind consumer of media bullshit and propaganda. The consumers lack the perception that the plant gives them. And that is why stoners are a special breed of human that has unlocked more of their conscious to turn the collective unconscious into the collective conscious so that the next era of human life begins. The one that begins on dimensions beyond our current one. To ultimately become the ""creator"".

The thing is, if I don't smoke for 2 days I will feel way more confident and have a more laid back attitude during the day. Honestly, zero anxiety.

I took one hit (pretty small around 0.1 grams) and then a much larger hit around 0.3 grams, I dont usually take very large hits but today I thought what the hell, I proceed to take a shower immediatly and feel myself rising fast. I'm feeling pretty high and I get very very mild visual distortion but I ignore it since its fairly normal for me around 5-10 mins after taking a big hit, then I start to get stronger and stronger visual disortion and it starts to feel like im hallicinating, my vision starts throbbing red and I start to hear a very loud high pitched sound. It keeps on getting louder and louder and my visuals start to get stronger. At this point I can barely see to the other side of the room and I somehow manage to walk over to my towel, now I'm seriously starting to lose my sight but somehow manage to turn off the music on my phone(I could barely hear it over the deafening rining in my ears). My knees then get so weak that I need to lay down and I think I pass out for what seems to be a couple of minutes. When I wake up the visuals and the sound are still there but they quickly start to pass and I mange to dry myself enough to go lay in my bed about 5 minutes later. After the whole ordeal I still felt slightly light headed and exhauseted, after that the high felt normal excpt for the rining continued for about an hour but it was only a very tiny fraction of what it was before. Does anyone know what this could be caused by? Has anyone experienced this before?  Thanks for the replies in advance. Also it might be relevant that I had not eaten breakfast prior to this and the only water I had was after I took the hit since my throat was burning.   
TL;DR: blacked out from weed, lost hearing and sight before blacking out

Last night I took MDMA (around 0.4g) along with alcohol and a large amount of weed from both blunts and bongs. That night I had a bad panic attack, where I felt very depersonalised and altogether anxious. I had done MDMA before in the week and I also smoked more weed than I should have. I'm new to smoking and clearly did not know my limits.

This mourning I'm left feeling light headed and still a bit depersonalised. When talking to friends I often find myself trying to appear normal, and wondering if they can tell how I'm feeling. I'm far less paranoid than I was during my panic attack, but I'm still very worried.

What should I do? I've read about people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks months or years after having this sort of attack and it's making me even more worried. I'm trying to eat and drink (I think I was probably pretty dehydrated) but I still feel this way.
Any advice on what to do would be very appreciated. Also and idea as to how long this will last would be great!

Thanks

Edit: I'm usually a fairly anxious person, I tend to overly worry about things. I'm starting to get a little terrified that I've set off some sort of panic disorder."	0	5

I have a few benzos left from my prescription a year or two ago so if I absolutely need it to be able to sleep tonight I can take it but I don't want to. I hate taking shit that I know is terrible for me in the long term.

I know it will pass. I know anxiety is just anxiety and it doesn't lead to worse things. I know I'll be fine. But GOD DAMN do I feel miserable right now. No idea when I'll be able to get some more. 

So those of you with a reliable supply, I'm truly, truly happy for you. I'm glad we're seeing a change in the tides of corruption and lunacy of this failed war on drugs because I don't think I could deal with this otherwise.

Thanks for listening, I know I'm not alone :(."	15	15

Because of timezones being different, I mean at 42 minutes past your current hour, remind me to take the pizza out. So it's 11:25 for me, right? As I write this, not the actual time you read this, but look at the timestamp for the post.

Shit, I'm confused. Just remind me when your hour hits 42 minutes. I hope you understand but I'm too high to explain it.

EDIT: I put it in at microwave time, and microwave time is different from computer time. So, when your clock reaches hour:46, remind me then, because my microwave time is like 4 minutes behind computer time.

This is due to odd side effects I experience when i smoke. Whenever I do I feel like heart race and it almost feels like it beats irregularly. However, the strange thing is that when I check my pulse to count my heartrate it is always normal. This is unfortunate because it makes me very uncomfortable and forces me to sorta give up smoking all together, and when I do smoke I can not really smoke a lot for the fear that my heart will 'explode'. 

I also wanted to mention that I smoked all throughout high school ( not a ton but a few times a month) and I never had these side effects. I am now about to be a sophomore in college and this has been going on for over a year. Please help!"	5	6

It usually goes like this: I debate whether or not I'm high yet,  I realize I'm super high but I only really feel it when I'm still, I get super disoriented and the world doesn't seem real to me, everything that I think about is amplified a lot, i create answers to every question that pops into my head, I feel this pleasure rushing through my body (only when im completely still though.) and I get super paranoid about someone coming in my room and catching me. I guess this is pretty normal, but I do not understand why I feel good only when I'm completely still. That seems weird to me.	2	4

I think it's my favorite movie of the year. The whole situation hit me about an hour after the movie was over and I had a ""OH HOLY FUCK NO WAY"" moment I haven't had since the end of seven. That's not to say there was a huge twist, just everything connected in my head. 

I also thought going into this that it was a comedy and I was at an [8] so I was thoroughly confused/slightly uncomfortable which might've helped the effect of the movie. I'm actually watching the movie a second time today-- sober for the moment-- and it holds up, just FYI lol.

Have a few questions concerning correct dosing that arent nessecarily mentioned in the FAQ but first a littlr background on me. Low tolerance 22 year old heavy set male with dicey experience with edibles. The first few times i made edibles i got nothing but a buzz or tierd while my low tolerance cousin was blitzed. I assume it was because i didn't decarb. i didnt know whati was doing but once i made a fire cracker receipe with about a gram and a bit of mids . i smoked a tiny bit as well to see if it would help and well. I dunno if it did but i was laughing my ass offin the principals office way more blazed than a few hits should of got me forcabout an hour (i was 17ish, Im 22 now) with my most recent batches i had a friend make them because im in a situation whrre i can not. Both high quality trees but on the first go he didnt decarb. Bye bye ounce. (Luckily i know a guy who will enjoy to buy it) the second time around i had him decarb a half ounce then use the magical butter machine to yield 2 cups of cannabis coconut oil. So my questions are to make sure i dont waste my oil are 1. Shouldi eat before or after dosing 2.assuming the thc percentage of my bud was 18 percent and there are 32 tablespons in a tablespoon how many spoons should i use in a meal like oatmeal or toast 3.what other tricks cani do to make sure it processes correctly in my digestive system 4. I hear mycerene helps with the blood brain barrier. Lemongrass is high in it. Should i get fresh or is packaged good?

At this point no one is in handcuffs we are all just sitting or standing in pure silence. After what seems like an eternity the cop tells us how he could have got us for distributing to minors and maintaining a common nuisance but he doesn't. Just a possession of pot and paraphernalia citation go home immediately to my mom's take her to gas station for a pack of cigarettes I see D and M I go oh shit Mom that's misdemeanor squad.

The second example is my best friend of 10+ years brought a bong for 1200$ when we were seniors in hs and we named it King Wizard. That thing got you ripped in one hit, but if you smoked a full bowl of it to your face it gave you the most annoying headache ever.

A while back I was chilling with my friends in a local park to smoke a joint. Beautiful fall weather and terrific day. After smoking we decide to cruise around town and I had this weird thought the entire time. I was at a good [4 - 5] and was thinking about how me and my friends are continuing this tradition of being young adults hanging out in town. I felt like ever since the native Americans roamed the countryside they must've hung out around each other while smoking. Or how 70s children used to smoke and hang out at a bowling alley.

I would get high anywhere and everywhere and be ok. I could go to school high, talk to parents, adults, and teachers while high. Hell, I even wrote an in class essay high off an edible(first time) and aced it. I even went to the gym high a couple times and it wasnt that bad. I was also fine smoking around new people and whatnot. 

Then I got in trouble with my parents, and my highs havent been the same since. I used to be able to zone out to music/movies and just enjoy all of my senses being hightened. Now, it seems like no matter what weed i smoke, who i smoke with, even my closest friends, its like a 2 hour period of anxiety and paranoia. I dont live with my parents, im in college and live in a house with my friends so getting caught isnt an issue. Now adays, the only time i can be high is when im by myself and jacking off. I used to be able to be laugh very easily when high and was just overall fun. Now its like i have no energy, im unable to socialize, i even feel uncomfortable just watching a movie with friends.
I have taken long tolerance breaks and considered giving it up, but those memories of how joyuous it once was give me a sliver of hope that i can once again enjoy this wonderful plant. IF anyone has similar experiences or has been through this, please help me out. Any input is greatly appreciated.

Fuck Fuck SUPER Fuck the assholes who had stolen this from us. Smoking weed.

To be able to write into the emotions themselves as opposed to writing flowing out of the fingertips and into a cold metal machine.

Writing that flows back into my mind and through my soul and into my emotions.

I type Happy and I am Happy.
I type Cry and I can **fucking** cry!

OH MY GOD

I type free and I am free.
I type LOVE and I can love.


And when I read what I wrote, my eyes become the needle playing my emotions.

I read Happy and I am Happy.
I read Cry and I can fucking cry!

To deprive this from others is seriously a not nice thing to do.

There it is. Yo.

Wonder what it will read like tomorrow. Did I make any grammatical errors? If not, I have no idea how.

I knew of Andy Kaufman but I really didn't know much about him and had never watched any of his performances.

Well... Let me tell you, that was like one of the best times of my life.  I felt every little nuance of my strangled emotions and laughter.  Every second of cringe and aww I felt while watching this genius was way... drawn out.  It was awesome.

Because of its subliminally psychedelic effect, cannabis, when pursued as a lifestyle, places a person in intuitive contact with less goal-oriented and less competitive behavior patterns. For these reasons marijuana is unwelcome in the modern office environment, while a drug such as coffee, which reinforces the values of industrial culture, is both welcomed and encouraged. Cannabis use is correctly sensed as heretical and deeply disloyal to the values of male dominance and stratified hierarchy. Legalization of marijuana is thus a complex issue, since it involves legitimating a social factor that might ameliorate or even modify ego-dominant values. There is no doubt that cannabis is trivialized as a commodity and is degraded by the designation ‘recreational drug,’ but there is also no doubt that when used occasionally in a context of ritual and culturally reinforced expectation of a transformation of consciousness, cannabis is capable of nearly the full spectrum of psychedelic effects associated with hallucinogens.	6	6

sorry if this isn't an appropriate sub for this, but I'm looking for recommendations specifically from this community. Figured we all love to listen to music with our buds.

Been searching for some new music lately to relax to. My go-to is usually bands like Tame Impala. Been finding a lot of my music lately on Bandcamp. Guys like [Turquoise Sun](https://turquoisesun.bandcamp.com/) and [Topaz](https://topazzz.bandcamp.com/album/half-awake-ep) (really love Topaz). Trying to find some similar stuff. I do enjoy my share of chillhop/lofi hip-hop now and then, but that's just not what I'm after right now, and a lot of the playlists I find on YouTube are all basically that or stoner rock (which I do enjoy, but I'm just not looking for that right now). 

Here's a more complete list of music for reference.

* Tame Impala
* Washed Out
* Pink Floyd
* Topaz (Can't recommend this dude enough)
* Fever The Ghost

Any recommendations would be much appreciated :)

Barcelona European weed holiday pro's and con's	https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/7ixx28/amsterdam_vs_barcelona_european_weed_holiday_pros/	"Please be aware before we start this is obviously 100% opinion based and both places have lots to do and see, if you get the chance and have the time/money I recommend both at least once.



**Background info:**
I've been to Amsterdam city nine times as of this post and don't have any plans to return for the next few months, I've been 2 times with no consumption and 7 times with LOTS. I went with my parents for my 18th birthday but have been going since age 15. (currently age 19)
I’ve been to Barcelona 2 times, one with consumption and one without, I am going for New Years with my girlfriend and we are both very excited to return for the second time together as a couple!


**Amsterdam:** 


**Pros:**

-Very easy to get from airport to the centre with periodic trains under the airport.

-Weed culture is ingrained in Amsterdam’s very personality.

-You can smoke inside licensed shops and outside if you are respectful. (Technically illegal outside)

-You can walk or cycle the entire city and cars are rare compared to bikes.

-Literally hundreds of coffeeshops to choose from.

-Great (and often trippy) museums and exhibits always on.

-A decent nightlife. (Not fantastic)

-The dutch people are very friendly and tolerant of tourists.

-Cannabis information centres and hemp museums are within walking distance of each other and are very informative. (Cannabis college is my recommendation and has a free vaporiser inside and a weed garden)

-Some AirBnb or similar accommodation will allow you to smoke inside but are generally very expensive for my birthday for two people it was £170 a night for one of these places!

-No sign up fee or membership to enter a coffeeshop and buy weed.

-Great music culture with lots of small and big venues, vinyl shops ect.

-Almost EVERYONE speaks good English.

-Great public transport. (trams)


**Cons:**


-Generally even if you are respectful and kind many coffeeshop workers/owners can be very rude to tourists and offer little help with choices and flavours. (Dependant on shops but I’ve visited many and the majority seem to have a sour apple or two)

-Loud, drunk and sometimes aggressive tourists EVERYWHERE. (Almost 100% of the time this is not the weed smokers but the alcohol drinkers)

-Overpriced food is rampant in the city and it’s very hard to get a good deal without some insider knowledge or a supermarket.

-Lots of ‘fake supermarkets’ that are advertised as a supermarket but all the items inside have no prices and are very expensive. 

-Prostitutes can sometimes be intimidating for first timers to the city if they are not used to this.

-Weed is very overpriced compared to Barcelona (average top shelf bud is 14-16 Euros and mids are 8-10 if you are lucky) and is almost always exactly on the dot, for example buy 1 gram and you get 1.0000 grams (you get what you pay for).

-No alcohol is allowed to be served in coffeeshops due to licensing rules.



**Barcelona:**


**Pros:**


-The weather in general is much more sunny.

-There’s many lovely beaches to visit after you are nicely stoned.

-Plenty of museums with many offering year memberships for repeat visitors. 

-You can cycle most of the city. (not as accessible as Amsterdam)

-Weed in general is MUCH cheaper with the average top shelf being 6-8 EUROS which would not get you anything good in most of Amsterdam.

-Many more outdoor hiking spots. (Holland is a flat country)

-The women that work in the cannabis clubs (in my experience it’s almost entirely women which is the opposite to Amsterdam) are very friendly and helpful.

-When you buy a gram you will often get more than you paid for, recently I got a gram of purple haze for 8 EUROS and the woman casually weighed me 1.6g!!!

-In general the cannabis clubs are more inclined to lend you bongs, pipes and grinders because you are a member and you’re less likely to break it and run away or pocket the grinder.

-Alcohol is sometimes served in cannabis clubs if that’s your thing.

-Cannabis clubs are less crowded.

-More options for concentrates, shatters and moonrocks.

-Less expensive in general.

-Much less rowdy tourists.


**Cons:**


-Less accessible by foot/bike.

-Less good public transport.

-Weed is not legal so walking around with a huge bag of weed in your backpack might draw more attention that in Amsterdam. 

-Less activities geared towards tripping or stoned people.

-Most clubs and bars open in the AM, this is a Spanish thing. (Although this might not be a con for all but for me it was) 

-You must pay a small membership fee to enter the cannabis clubs and provide documents to verify your age. (I paid 30 EUROS and I got a membership for 3 clubs dotted around the city)

-Police are less keen on the cannabis clubs and my 2nd favourite one was shut down by the police with no explanation.

-Cannabis clubs can be quite hard to find as they are often disguised and hidden from plain sight.




I’m sure I’ve missed a lot of stuff but this took quite a long time to write and I hope you enjoy reading it.
If you need any advice about getting memberships or simply where to go just tell me and I’ll be happy to help!
Happy hunting!

I don't understand why I can't just manage to smoke them and that be the only thing I do. That's how I used to be when I started smoking. How did I let my life get so out of hand?	52	25

So I had to find a dealer. I usually buy eighths. They last me a while. But my buddy that I buy from said for 70 instead of 45 I can get a quarter oz. I asked him if he was trying to buy a half and split and he said yeah. I was ok but when I met up with him he said he needs my money now so he can afford it. I figured that makes sense since we're splitting but I was getting fishy vibes. Even more so when he said he was buying from someone else cause his guy was out. Anyways he goes to pick it up and leaves with some friends and comes back about 30 mins later and starts running on about how the guy took his money and drive off and ran over his friends foot which is why he's alone. He sounds really upset and shit claiming he's out 80. He gave me some alcohol instead which I'm not a fan of but it was better than nothing for tonight at least. Not even much though like enough to get tipsy for a couple hours. I wanna believe him since I don't have any one else to buy but fuck if it isn't fishy. He asked last minute if I wanted to split. I should've said no and only been down 45 but he sounded kind of like the guy he was buying from was being hard to deal with. So smoke a fat one for me frients.

Edit: told my father. He was upset. At my ""friend"". In other news I have a dealer now. At the cost of 5$ more a gram"	1	6

Last night I went to sleep sober for the first time in a looooong ass time and up until tonight I haven’t smoked in like 48 hours. 

Tonight I thought I’d use some kief from my grinder to get a lil high, what I usually do is pack my pipe with a tiny bit of AVB or tobacco and then put the kief on top. I have quite a bit of AVB, so I thought I’d smoke a bowl or two of just AVB before actually smoking the kief so I could get rid of some AVB. So yeah that brings us to now, where I’m currently at like a [7] just from two bowls of AVB.

I remember the ~~Paquerat(sp?)~~ Pack Rat Show, which I think was a hodgepodge of early internet culture type stuff (I remember seeing Yatta! years before seeing it on 4chan). ~~I also remember the Skullglow Show, which I think was a talk show (similar in structure to Spaceghost Coast to Coast) hosted by an action figure.~~ Whoops, the man himself, Robb Zipp, has corrected me. It was Scare Glow, and he was a co-host of the same ever-morphing show.

Anyone else remember any of this, or perhaps were even involved in it?

Here I summarize the main points covered by the article (citation for article at the bottom):

* **The endocannabinoid system and the opioidergic system (parts of the brain that interact with** ***Cannabis*** **and opioids, respectively) have known interactions with each other.** They are present in many of the same areas of the brain and alteration of the endocannabinoid system has been shown to change the rewarding properties of opioids. Additionally one study showed an increased endocannabinoid tone in humans that use opioids. Interestingly, these effects are only seen when the endocannabinoid system is activated by a drug and not from within, although more studies are needed to fill gaps in this piece of the mechanism.
* **They have the same primary therapeutic application: both medical Cannabis and the opioids are primarily used to manage chronic pain.** The largest indication for using medical Cannabis is to manage chronic pain. There is evidence that people who use Cannabis reduce their overall opioid prescription use. Though there is limited clinical evidence for Cannabis and pain there is a large body of pre-clinical evidence for antinociception in animal models with the endocannabinoid system.
* **Current opioid use disorder treatments are limited and are not effective for the entire population.** Abstinence-based therapy has a high relapse rate. Methadone can be expensive, difficult to obtain, and has addictive properties itself. Evidence shows the most successful approach to opioid use disorder is combined pharmacotherapy and social supports. Medical Cannabis can be implemented as an additional tool within this model.
* **Cannabis may help get a patient through the initial withdrawal period.** The evidence here contradicts itself. There are studies that show both Cannabis helping and hurting the withdrawal process of opioid use disorder. There is a huge need for clinical data on this piece, but the authors posit that as Cannabis is a schedule I drug, the funding is more limited.
* **Cannabis can be used as a reduction of harm tool in opioid use disorder.** The promising findings listed above should absolutely be investigated, because overall Cannabis use has a lower risk associated with it than the opioids when used chronically. There is a correlation between legal/medical Cannabis and decreased opioid mortality rates in the US that may be due to this reduction of harm gained by an accessibility to Cannabis.
* **Cannabis is not a miracle drug, may have shortcomings, and should be treated with caution and control.** ""Although the literature thoroughly supports the safety and tolerability of cannabis, there is conflicting evidence"" for its use for substance abuse disorders in general. This is because Cannabis itself can be misused and abused. Generally, the risk of developing a Cannabis use disorder is associated with chronic high-THC potency cannabis use. However, it is possible to create a combined cannabis and opioid-antagonist therapy that will help people with opioid use disorder while also minimizing the risk of Cannabis abuse. 

\----------------------------------------

I absolutely believe that Cannabis is a crucial reduction of harm from chronic opioid medications. My dissertation was specifically on developing drugs for the endocannabinoid system that can be effective for opioid use disorder. While I was an *in vitro* scientist whose laboratory skill set never left the theoretical molecular level, all the literature I read pointed towards the same thing: the opioid epidemic is reaching a catastrophic level and a reduction of harm is a huge priority. To say that the risks associated with Cannabis are equal or greater than the risks associated with the opioids would be an outright lie. Therefore, Cannabis - and even the negative abuse of Cannabis - is a reduction of harm from opioid substance abuse disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

In all aspects - from personal relationships/social functionality, personal health and wellness, and ability to contribute to the workforce and/or society productively - chronic Cannabis use is an alternative to complete abstinence that can improve or even restore someone's ability to truly live free of a crippling physical and psychological addiction. While Cannabis has the ability to be abused, the addictive properties of Cannabis are not comparable to the opioids.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to ask ourselves what the purpose of medicine is. Is it to improve the overall quality of life of patients? Or is it to profit? Medical Cannabis needs to be more accessible so that all those who are struggling with opioid substance abuse disorder can have it as an option in their individual treatment plans. I'm not a health professional, but it's my opinion that people should have the choice to pursue a clear reduction of harm therapy in their recovery journey.

i personally think marijuana will become something more like microbreweries or scotch distilleries, where small operations with specialty strains will prosper over megacorporations producing a more generic product.

but you never know. there will definitely also be a market for the ""Budweiser"" of marijuana i.e. the cheapest decent product.

the other issue is once marijuana is legalized, won't many people who smoke regularly grow it at home and possibly just start trading with friends who also grow it? "	2	4

Being 22 years old studying Computer Engineering at a University far from my hometown made me consume larger quantities of cannabis ( due to living alone without having to worry about my parents ). Larger quantity is unique for each person as tolerance varies. Usually I smoke 2-3g per 4 days. I try to keep it as low as I can. University assigned us MASSIVE tasks and projects the last week.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take a break in order to be focused enough to give my 100% to these projects. Today 20:32 just finished the first enormous project ( it was about network security and penetration testing ) and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing. As I am writing this I'm finishing my joint and I feel like super high. Apart from being high,I'm delightful since I finished a sincere task and I can relax with some buds for the rest of the night. People, I send you my positive and happy vibes. Remember always to do tasks and work first , the highness you get after you accomplish something big is really astonishing. Do tolerance breaks often in order to enjoy your buds.

I don't get anxious in other social settings.

We ended up playing soccer stoned as shit with a bunch of 10 year olds, because I was too lazy to walk 25 minutes to my house. Mother comes out to two grown ass men with beards playing soccer with their children high as shit and demanded that we leave or the cops would be called. My friend and agreed and asked for kleenex and the mother got distressed and denied us access. The children got mad at the mother, my friend and I got really hungry and just went to McDonald's and got free kleenex and a big mac trio. 

What did I learn from this?

Don't be an adult and play soccer with children in exchange for kleenex. It may seem fun to do when stoned, but you probably wouldn't do it sober. Or maybe you would, I'm stoned right now so I'll think about it. Or maybe I'll forget lol"	113	34

They checked me in and a staff member asked me to describe my symptoms then have a seat in the waiting area. It wasn't busy but after two hours of waiting I decided to try a different hospital. I told the woman at the front desk I was leaving. A month later I received a bill for $600. After calling to dispute this bill they said that since I told the nurse my symptoms, the charge is legitimate even if I didn't receive any medical services. I've never heard of this before. I was told by a friend that I should wait til my claim goes to collections then dispute it with the collections agency but I am worried it will affect my credit score. Also, when I went to a different hospital, they said I needed surgery immediately. Things couldn have gotten much worse if I had waited longer. I got the surgery and am fine now but I have all kinds of medical bills to pay off now and the $600 charge just seems rediculous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!	196	48

I don't trust these Washington fucks not one bit, but especially behaving like this out of the blue. Just decided one morning to get up and make a grand effort to legalize marijuana, as quick as possible?

Seems to me like they're trying to push this to the finish line expeditiously while it's hype so that it passes before the public gets too skeptical about it.

Which brings me to my next point of skepticism in that just recently, the Patriot Act (which most people already have never heard of) was extended, and with the support of Democrats. Then right after this, Dems come out making a scene about legalizing weed? Cmon man. This is too simple to not understand.

I can't stand the thought of politicians who forwarded, or sat around for, the slander and propagabda against cannabis. And now they all have some opportunity to get behind something to make themselves look like heroes for progess? Nothing about this seems genuine to me!

I smoke cigarettes so naturally I don’t mind tobacco, and spliffs are a great way to conserve some bud and get a nice nicotine buzz with your high. 
But most of the time with friends or at parties, people smoke regular joints. Now I love me a good doobie (can’t be beat imo), but they aren’t the most efficient way to smoke weed. You  can more easily burn weed without getting the maximum benefit, but I had an idea how to remedy this just a little:
-
What if you were to roll just a little bit of tobacco or catnip at torch and roach? 
-
This would allow you not to worry so much about torching the joint, just getting an even light on the joint. If you accidentally burn up some tobacco/catnip in this process, does it really matter? And smoking them isn’t gonna kill you.
Same goes for the roach, you get harsher and hotter hits till you have to choo-choo train your way through. Let’s say you’re already high and decide to call it a day, you just toss the roach wasting up to .1g of bud. If you get harsh hits of tobacco? Who cares? Just toss the roach like an old cigarette. If anything it’ll signify you’re all done.

I feel this technique would be most easy to do in cones. But does anyone have thoughts on this? Or is this already some common practice I don’t know about"	4	4

For almost two years now, weed just does not have the same affect as it used to. I'm well aware that tolerance builds up, and the best way to get it back how it used to be is to take a long break. My breaks now, however, go for two to three months at a time (with plenty of water to flush my system). Then when I buy more, hoping for the best, nothing happens. I feel no difference at all. On a few occasions, it works, but doesn't last as long and is not as strong. I've tried using different pieces, being more specific of what kind of bud I'm looking for (sativa is for me, sour diesel and blue dream for life), keep count of how many hits and how big they are, even gone to dab-pens so that I know what I get every time is exactly the same. A friend of mine (who deals and smokes way more than me) tried to help by cracking out his keef stash he'd been building for years (it was a LOT). Three hits in, he's gone and doing fine, and I'm sober. Another friend gave me edibles (brownie and gummies)... took all of them at once, and nothing. I don't get it. I'm stressed about work, my insomnia has been horrible, stressed about my romantic relationship, my mood-swings (BP2) are becoming more frequent, and I need help.

I decided that my computer would be a good bet since my parents don’t ever touch my computer. The side slides off after unscrewing, so I place it at the bottom of the computer and slide the side back on. I should mention that it is a small ziploc bag with eight sour keys.

My only concern is that maybe it will get hot and melt the gummies thus dankifying the room. My buddy tells me that it will happen for sure, but my computer isn’t on constantly. I use it for gaming at night but nothing so intense as to burn up the insides.

Am I safe to keep them inside the computer? Or is it smart to think up a new spot and relocate?

Edit: I’ve also considered filling a container with water and hiding the bag inside the container?"	1	19

Within two hours, I can hardly walk. I feel drunk at this point, THC has never had this effect on me. I understood why people throw up, why people say edibles mess them up.
I spend the next 8 hours giggling, zoning out, dying. I wake up, STILL feeling the effects. Can’t keep a straight face.

Last time I rolled a blunt was probably when vanilla/grape dutches were the standard. Im not the best roller but I can make do. I can 1-step a cigarello, but to be honest most of my blunt rolling experience is from when the 2-stepping big dutches/games &amp; royal blunts wraps were popular. I've seen some people roll backwoods, and they taste fine, just the process looks a little trickier than what im used to, but I've never personally tried to roll a backwoods.


I dont mind some practice if backwoods or similar is the consensus, but just want some advice from the always non-judgemental r/trees fam. Thanks everyone!


Also wanna note that im in MA which has a ban on flavored tobacco so even if vanilla dutches are still around, they're probably not worth the trip to Rhode Island to get em

I’m really delighted, I really love my mom and so do my siblings, we’ve been really happy with her. At first I didn’t want to only have a mother, I wanted a father figure because I have never had one and I thought she was too young to be my mom (26) so I thought it wouldn’t work. I’m happy that I was wrong because she’s the best mom ever. It’s still kinda weird that we only have a 13 years gap but it doesn’t matter at the end of the day I think.

At first I hated it there because there were rules and chores, I was a stubborn, I hated my sisters because they loved her from the start also I thought she could never love us like her own kids. But then I started to love her, I love my life there and now I never want to leave.

I started writing this on day 1 and have been adding to it. so there may some inconsistent framing around time. 

Last time I did this, I moved to a new state and was starting a new job and the lack of cannabis wasn't much of a thought. it was also 20 years ago and I didn't have access to the amount or quality that I do now and it wasn't during COVID. I was a daily smoker for years. But I also had not built a tolerance like I have now. During covid and just getting my medical card, I was like a kid in a candy store. 

The first day was a little rough mostly because my office/entertainment area is filled with all kinds of THC. Edibles, tinctures, 6 strains of flower (I have a cannador and I love it), and few dab concentrates. I know not having access makes it easier, but I like my stash and want it there when I come back. 

I would have said I didn't sleep that well last night because I felt I kept waking up, but that have been more my pets trying to get attention. My sleep trackers say that I slept longer last night than I normally do. &lt;shrug&gt;

EDIT day 6: Yes, I'm sleeping on average an extra hour a night. I hit snooze on Monday and Tuesday and haven't hit it in I can't remember how long. interesting. Still going to sleep around the same time. I'm no longer waking up before my alarm. 

I felt good this morning (day 1) and got through the work day (I work at home in previously mentioned office) without much thought. Once my time is free, that's when I start to think about it. 

2nd day was better. Day 3 I went out of town and didn't have access, but wasn't an issue. Day 4, I just got home. I'm gonna crash now. Day 5&amp;6 was fine day.

I feel it's smooth sailing from here.(written on day 4) 

Day 6 after work. I felt anxious at the end work. I had a good day at work, but once my work was done I started feeling anxious. Last night I felt great.  I had 2 beers. Tonight because of the anxiousness, I drank more. I'm drunk, but there is 0 chance I'm breaking the T-break. hitting 7 days at 12:30ish ET  


I have bee using exercise (bike riding) to help me through. Oddly enough, I used my bike rides to get high as well. I'd bring my mighty out with me or hit a dab before going or when I get back, but it is also helping me not do it. when I have a craving or feel anxious, a bike ride seems to refocus my energy."	3	0	0.81

The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) leads with “Marihuana” not “cannabis” on their Schedule One list (PDF below):

&gt;Marihuana  (assigned #7360)  Controlled Substances Act, Schedule ‘I’ 
 &gt;Not narcotic        other names = Cannabis, marijuana

PDF warning:
https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf

The DEA’s Diversion Control Division is “dead iversion” perhaps “dead aversion”

Grateful Dead folklore: 

The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the donor.

In fairy tales, a donor is a character that tests the hero (and sometimes other characters as well) and provides magical assistance to the hero when she or he succeeds. 

The fairy godmother is a well-known form of this character. Many other supernatural patrons feature in fairy tales; these include various kinds of animals or the spirit of a dead mother.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_dead_(folklore)

and you already know that…

“Drug offenses” is the biggest prison-stuffer (Dept of Justice link ‘BOP’ = Bureau of Prisons):

https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp

They just put isotonitazene on the CSA-SCH list November 4th 2021, so they are actively working with the list:

https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/04/2021-23848/schedules-of-controlled-substances-placement-of-isotonitazene-in-schedule-i

(there is a phone number on there, so be nice!! Sorry Mr. Boos!)

&gt;Isotonitazene has a pharmacological profile similar to etonitazene (schedule I), fentanyl (schedule II)

Starting with a faint floral light show pattern, but then depicting skeletons and faces and black ripples full of eyes. On top of that, we were both able to open up to each other about difficult personal hurdles and recognise bad patterns, kinda like when on MDMA but milder and without the euphoria.

I'm just wondering what everyone else's experience with getting visuals is? I feel like TV and older stoners lead me to believe plain green gave visuals, not just the uptick in creative imagination. And I've always had this feeling I can't shake that there's something important missing from the high I get... and forgive the paranoia, but I straight up think there is something deliberately wrong with the green most people I know have access to now, from multiple sources - but it's hard to articulate what's wrong or why I have a strong impression it's intentional, and an intense fear that I'll be called crazy or somehow dishonest for asking responsible questions like: ""Is it normal for multiple friends to get devastatingly addicted to weed and become aggressive and suicidal?""

What does weed do to you exactly? Does that differ from what you thought it should do, especially regarding visuals? Do you ever mix with anything, or seek out particular strains for differing effects? What do you think other people collectively think a weed high is supposed to be like?"	1	0	1.0

I take 3-ish day breaks frequently, but I live with a handful of chainsmokers so it's very easy (and fun) to say yes every time a bong ends up in my hands.

I also have two sisters who have smoked regularly for years. All three of us have minor asthma, but mine has definitely gotten better over the years.

I haven't noticed a difference in my lungs since smoking, except sometimes the usual cough after taking a hit. However, my roommates are 21 and have been regularly smoking for 3 years and have some serious smokers coughs.

I've always been conscious and actively-worried about the physical side effects of weed but haven't really felt a difference, but I'm super scared that I'll feel the affects on my lungs many years later and will regret smoking to get through the anxieties of young adulthood.

So, what I'm basically asking is, for those who have smoked for many years, what physical effects have you noticed due to smoking weed? Any lung issues? And those with asthma, has it worsened over time

TL;DR
Newbie smoker worried about effects on lungs and asthma due to daily smoking. No issues yet but scared to feel the effects of years later and asking to see if veteran smokers feel a concrete difference"	1	1	0.67

I used to love it. It’s been over a year or two since I last did and when I would my eyes would feel super wide open. Aside from that, the number one thing deterring me is how my heart feels. I become super aware of how hard and fast it’s beating to the point that it hurts. I’ll call into a cycle of being paranoid cuz it’s beating so fast and I get even more anxious. I’ve tried telling myself cuz it’s only cuz I’m high. But that doesn’t help. Cuz I know getting high can increase risk of heart attack. So how do I help this? What can I do to keep my heart rate low so I can enjoy weed?	3	6	0.8

I just felt in a really good mood, light color distortion and such. Then later that day, when the trip was over (i thought lmao) i hit a spliff with a friend and them tiny hats hit back so much harder. Now i hit a bowl for the first time after that, and while i'm not tripping, the bowl hit me back. Damn. Like a [7] fr. Also much more contemplativa and meditative. Really cool natural interaction.
