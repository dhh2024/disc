Practically speaking, why should the rich bother with helping the poor? The frank, rather crass, answer to this, is that if the rich don't do anything to help the poor, the poor will kill them and take their stuff. It has happened many times in the past, and we are never all that far away from its happening again.

You can easily construe this as a threat, but when you think about it a bit more, it really isn't. It's simply the nature of the bargain that most societies have hit upon. The bargain is: ""Don't be too much of a shithead, and you get to have stuff and live your life how you want."" If someone hoards wealth that they don't need or ever plan to use while people around them suffer from want, that person is a shithead. They aren't keeping their end of the bargain. Whenever there are too many people like them, there will be revolution to shake things up and restore the bargain. "	63.0	0.0	179	False	True	2.0

For whatever reason, there are lots of Nigerians at my school. They're the most sexist bunch of dudes I have ever met (used to have a Nigerian roommate, and he and his friends were always making horribly sexist statements) and they basically did the stereotypical stuff you were talking about up there. I also saw him hold a knife to an Asian kid's throat for ""disrespecting"" him and had to talk him out of beating the kid up multiple times. KC's entire culture seemed to be built on ""flashiness"", on conspicuous consumption, violence, and sexism.

BUT one of my best friends here, Marv, is black, and he isn't like that at all. Two of his roommates are also Nigerian, and they bug the hell out of him, too. So... I guess what I'm getting at is that race does not equal culture. I'm not particularly fond of the Nigerian culture I saw, but that doesn't mean that *all* Nigerians or *all* black folks are part of that culture. For all I know, the Nigerians I have met could all be Igbo, or Yoruba, and that's just what's sticking out in my brain (confirmation bias).

Marvin likes cars, and so does KC. However, while KC puts shiny things on his car and lets it fall to pieces (my parents will get me another one, so it's a'ight), Marvin enjoys working underneath the car-- he changes his own oil and brakes, and his old car was pretty heavily customized under the hood, though you couldn't tell from the outside. KC blasts loud rap music everywhere he goes. Marv likes classical and blues. KC parties almost every night and aggressively hits on girls. Marv prefers to study or go to a movie and the only reason he isn't in a long-term relationship is because he's so shy and quiet.

What I'm getting at is that culture doesn't account for individual preference (some people are just douchebags) and that you're only seeing partial aspects of a culture. Motley Crue, one of my favorite bands, was pretty heavily into sex and drugs too... but they have attained the respectability of age. AC/DC had a lot of songs about fighting and killing, but because they've been around so long, they have become more mainstream and less perceived as in-your-face and aggressive. Also note that normal, quiet, nice people tend to stick out in your brain less than assholes because either A) you just didn't notice them, or B) they didn't make an impression in your brain.

Now, I do think that there are parts of what you're calling ""black culture"" (although I would, conversely, call it ""poverty culture"") that *are* extremely harmful to the community as a whole. However, as a fellow southerner, I have seen the effect of meth on white communities and the effect of smuggling corridors on the border. **Black communities are not the only ones that have problems; all poor communities are suffering right now.** The guy out there listening to rap in a beat-up Caprice and shooting a dude in a tenement over crack isn't that different than the guy listening to Lamb of God in his beat-up F-150 and shooting up the trailer over meth.

If you can't get a job because you're black and uneducated, or you can't get a job because you're white and uneducated, what difference does it make? If your culture is built on violence, white or black (I'm looking at you, so-called 'outlaws' and 'proud rebels'), how does the end outcome differ? It's still an unsustainable model.

Finally, I think that certain political groups have historically utilized white-versus-black (or, where I'm from, white-vs-black-vs-Indian-vs-Hispanic) to create a wedge between **haves** and **have-nots** to sustain their own power structure. Our system, a democracy, means that there is a vote for every person, rich or poor. Well, there are a lot more poor folk out there than rich, so to be able to sustain their policies, certain people have found it politically expedient to exploit racial tension to create a divide in the poorest element of society to prevent it creating a powerful voting block. If you don't believe me, look at the history of Texas. Johnson was from Texas, and Texas was solidly Democratic until Johnson's Civil Rights act went through. Texas has been Republican ever since. Oklahoma, similarly, was once a progressive state. Race was used to drive a wedge into that voting block and break it."	55.0	0.0	753	False	True	0.0

He pointed out how American culture promised so much - glitzy capitalism etc. - and yet they lived lives of destitute poverty. This means that unlike some people in developing countries around the world, African Americans are intimately aware of their own conditions.

I am a British man, and people often hold similar views about black people over here. I think my friends who think like that share the OP's distaste for feeling that they are being racist. 

I think that NewQuisitor has a point about the impact of poverty on behavior. There is a culture of survival of the strongest universally in urban areas of poverty: there is a danger of being perceived weak which informs the development of their personalities.

James Baldwin (an African American intellectual in the 50s, 60s and 70s)   I found had a lot of insightful views about black conditions, and culture and also about how to escape a relationship of hate between whites and blacks. In the South I assume black communities would retain memories of the oppression which haunted them - in some areas they will have known people who were lynched, a practice which stopped in the 20s or were beaten and harassed by the police etc. It is humbling to reflect how recent these events are."	4.0	0.0	228	False	True	0.0

They're laughing at the fat neckbeards to satisfy their upsetting desire to feel superior to something, and using fedoras as just another way to make themselves feel better.  

But, among that, fedoras generally do not look good on a guy wearing a t-shirt and pants.  In fact, it's against its intended purpose and these people (""neckbeards"" who wear fedoras incorrectly to be counter culture), are ruining the name of a fedora.  

So you see these ""fat neckbeards"" wearing a fedora and they're essentially ruining the hat.  Which is why it brings so much ridicule.  If enough people wear it incorrectly in a way that looks bad, people assume that it looks bad and fedora gains a negative connotation.  So Reddit generally ridicules people for tarnishing fedora-style hats while looking terrible in them anyway

Also, those breaches of privacy rarely produce material evidence of the secret--knowledge of the secret is all there is.

Clearly it's going to be used one way or another, the question is simply ""how?""  Especially if the actual information collection is secret, what's to stop them from using that information extrajudicially, or to guide the search for further information?  In the courts, the doctrine of the ""fruit of the poisoned tree"" is used to stop this, but how can that be invoked if you can't prove what information was used or collected?  It's much like previous trials on warrantless surveillance, where the government avoided responsibility for illegal spying on U.S. citizens by basically saying ""well, you can't prove it because we refuse to admit it.""

There are a vast number of uses for information beyond simple trial evidence.  People hide many things that are not legally incriminating but can still be life- or reputation-ending, and a legal prohibition isn't going to stop the use of those for leverage.  As one person pointed out in another thread, in countries where similar surveillance has become the norm it's common for people to be blackmailed with such information by various government agencies, something that certainly circumvents any prohibition on admissibility.

Finally, collecting the information at all is an inherent hazard.  Much of the information is personal and identifying, and depending on the general nature it may include things like credit card numbers or similar information.  In short, it's a hacker's goldmine.  Are you going to argue that the NSA databases are sufficiently secure?  I wouldn't.  There's fairly decent cause to believe that they've been breached at least a couple times domestically, and lord knows what would happen if government-funded hackers from, say, China got ahold of that kind of information.  Even if you genuinely, 100% believe your government would never *ever ever ever ever* do something like that (personally a pretty bad bet to begin with), would you trust a foreign government which was pissed at the U.S. the same way?  Would you really want a hostile party having non-incriminating but sensitive information on basically every single person in your country?

In the end, the only real way to avoid the misuse of such information is to make sure it's never collected in the first place except in individual cases according to due process."	2.0	0.0	385	False	True	2.0

Why? Because soon we would not need eugenics to achieve the goals you propose (with all its downsides, moral dillemas and slippery slopes). Everything eugenics promises we would soon be able to do with genetic engineering / gene therapy (designer babies). And its societally far easier eventually to pass a law that forces parents to submit their unborn kids to mandatory gene therapy to substitute their inferior genes with superior alleles while they are still embryos, than to force them to abort their babies. The former is morally far closer to mandatory vaccination (already a law in many countries) than to eugenics or reproduction control.

So even from an eugenicist's standpoint, I dont think its worth it to push for eugenic programs based on reproduction control in this day and age. Its got too much baggage, and genetic engineering will soon provide far more palatable alternative capable of the same, or even greater genetic benefits.

Well the quickest way to justify your employment is to realize that availability itself has value.  The little two minute conversations, and the peace of mind of having a (presumably) technical safety net are not worthless to other employees, though it feels that way to you.  You're basically ""on call"" while in your chair.

Is this the best possible way of utilizing you?  Probably not, but any organization that grows sufficiently large becomes progressively more inefficient.  We play video games and have perfect understanding of every aspect of the universe, along with godlike powers to influence it.  But obviously this is not how real life works.  Managers frequently supervise projects about which they have no knowledge.  And even if they did at one point work in the field, their knowledge immediately begins to decay the moment they are promoted.  So they can and do get played by their subordinates, just like a mechanic can tell you whatever he wants and without any knowledge, you're helpless to contradict him.  But here's the kicker, in our analogy, it's not even your car.  So when 4th and 5th gears break 6 months later, hey, you just did what the mechanic told you to, right?  On my project, we've had 3 project managers in 2 years.  More important than fixing things is making sure they don't break while you're in charge.  Doing nothing accomplishes that goal very nicely.

 But even when immediate supervisors are informed and invested enough to reform the system, they often don't have the authority to enact the changes.  They need more personnel, or less, or more time for refactoring without any new functionality, etc.  Usually that goes up the chain to someone even more detached and insulated from project success or failure.   The project managers are there because developers can't be trusted with decisions about development, and change control committees are there because project managers can't be trusted with decisions about the project.  A tyrant or fool at any point could be disastrous, so we create oversight to protect us from failure.  But it also prevents success.  So if you really wanted to find a place where everything you do matters and you can accomplish anything as fast as you can physically implement it, go find yourself a tiny startup where hiring you increases the company's population by like 10%.  But keep in mind that as you gain freedom, you lose security, as the very thing that makes indie companies appealing is also what makes them so risky and inconsistent.

I think you can make a good case that he alright with it and that it wasn't a slur in the 1930's when the team was named. Most obviously, that the team was renamed after he was hired and brought several Indian players to play on the team and he kept coaching. Usually you don't rename a team to insult the coach and not have him quit. See http://tombenjey.com/2013/05/06/redskins-named-in-dietzs-honor/

[By far the best paper on the beginnings of the word](http://anthropology.si.edu/goddard/redskin.pdf) makes a compelling case that it's a term that originated with American Indians. (Also, FWIW, American Indian is the preferred term, not Native American.)

Obviously, this is only anecdotal evidence, but ever example I have ever heard of it being used as a slur comes from after WW2. The earliest are usually being in the 60's at the re-education schools that were used to try to eliminate Indian culture and heritage.

There are also some other examples that indicate the word didn't become a slur until after WW2. For example, this NY Times article from 1912 uses in a headline in reference to Jim Thorpe. http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C12FC3B5E13738DDDA10A94DC405B828DF1D3. I find it doubtful the NYT would use a racial slur in a headline like that.

You can even find a reference in this 1975 biography of Thorpe to the ""noblest redskin"" http://books.google.com/books?id=rDV1jOx2P3cC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=kJ2Qm93PSc&amp;dq=jim%20thorpe%20%22noblest%20redskin%22&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20thorpe%20%22noblest%20redskin%22&amp;f=false

The term is clearly supposed to be a compliment. I think the ""noblest"" adjective is quite racist because of it's use in terms like the ""noble savage"", but I don't think you can make a similar argument for redskin.

Not at all, it's just paying off people to stop working, which isn't a sustainable activity.  Plus it encourages people to put themselves into that position, making the number of people you're paying to do nothing increase, likely in a dramatic fashion.

Also, you don't raise efficiency by doing this.  Sure, the people that are still bothering to work likely are better workers, but you're simply moving the average from the working force to the welfare force, and ignoring the cost of that.  You're still paying for the people who aren't producing anything.  Well, the rich, who own the businesses, are paying for them when you take their money.

2) Raising taxes will not fix the deficit, especially if you just give that money to people who aren't working.  Spending less will fix the deficit, but even that will have consequences.  But you can't fix the runaway deficit by pushing harder on one end.  There may be some room for taxes, but you will never catch up with the spending that way.

And your information about Reagan is one-sided, revenues went up during the time those taxes were cut, though theories vary widely as to the exact mechanism that was in place (economics is complicated, and neither you nor I understand it well enough to know for sure).

3) Now you're suggesting that companies will make more money by taking their profits away and giving it to people to spend on their products?  I'm not sure you really appreciate how silly that is.

To me, one thing you said really stuck out for me:

&gt; However, in college, my views changed. I began to realize the system was stacked against some people, that the rich are gatekeepers when it comes to wages and all, and that it's not necessarily peoples' fault for being poor.

2 things here...college is notoriously liberal on both sides - the teachers and the students both trend very heavily (and sometimes fanatically) liberal.  There are reasons for both, that I won't bother going into.  Suffice it to say that the influence at that stage of your life wasn't particularly unbiased, and you should take that into consideration.

Second, whenever someone says something like 'the system was stacked against them' in such a general way, I immediately call foul.  The system isn't perfect, far from it, but it is really *really* the opposite of what you are implying here.  I'd venture to guess that nowhere else in the world, or even in the history of the world, were people put on a more even playing field when it comes to opportunities than what we have today in the US.  There are no caste systems prevalent here, there are plentiful opportunities to improve yourself and your situation, and people are free to find a way to make their lives better.  I'll agree ahead of comments that it is easier for some than others, but no one is prevented from becoming the next Bill Gates because of their birthright or their bank account.  People get ahead, sometimes far ahead, every day in this country, and they're encouraged to do so.

My only fear is that we will become a society where there is no incentive to become better, to create the next big thing or start the next successful company, because the politicians take away the incentive to accomplish it.

Simply having higher taxation provides no new wealth &amp; reduces the value of the dollar (and other measures of wealth) in a nation with high tax rates **when** there are opportunities to move wealth elsewhere. Inflation would do the same thing. Inflation is highly progressive because it impacts one in relationship to their holding of dollars without creating the burden of having to actually file taxes with the added benefit that one cannot lie on their taxes to get out of having their wealth redistributed.

That said, I would caution you against making claims that we were wealthier before the 1980's.

If California tries to raise their taxes, the rich will move to Nevada or Texas. If the US tries to raise taxes, the rich will go to another country with lower taxes. Corporations and the rich also have access to many loopholes like carried interest or hiding money in overseas accounts.

The biggest hurdle to taxing the rich is that the rich and corporations by definition have lots of money and can buy their way to lower taxes by paying off politicians, running endless commercials, and creating a 24/7 news network to broadcast their agenda.

Did the Ottoman Turks ever pay the Byzantines? Did the Mongols pay the hundreds of countries and cities that they invaded? Why can't our government and our society as a whole just let this go, like every other nation in the world did after they conquered a surrounding territory.

Both of those societies practiced slavery, so why shouldn't we? Perhaps societies from centuries ago are not the place to look to for moral guidance.

&gt; Without conquest and military expansion, the world and civilization as a whole would not have expanded as quickly and efficiently as it did, and the cultures of different countries couldn't have mixed to inspire new ideas and methods of technological advancement. Yes you could argue that such a feat is achievable through trade, but the process would be much slower, and the full affects of some cultures may not be completely absorbed or even shared with other cultures.

I can't argue against this point in relations to world history (although I don't neccesarily think you are correct), however in relation to the conquest of the Americas this view doesn't hold water. Native American societies were more often annihilated than absorbed.

&gt; Had Columbus turned back at the first sign of inhabitants, Europe would not have benefitted from crops like potatoes(a crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom), and corn.

Europeans at this time were beginning to engage in trade on a global scale. There is no way that upon hearing of a new continent (or a westward route to the far east) they would have decided to never visit the continent again, even if they had no intention of conquest or colonisation. The Columbian exchange could have happened just as easily without conquest.

&gt; The introduction of the New world as a trading hub also facilitated international trade, not only to the new world, but to places like Java and the Ottoman Empire. Western Europe was transformed from a somewhat economically isolated area, into a trading hub for the entire known world.

The New World would still have been used for trade, Western Europe would still be a trade hub considering the role of Western Europeans as global traders during this time period.

Also, why don't we try flipping the scales. Say that next week an advanced alien civilization discovers Earth. Would you agree that they are justified in conquering and colonising our planet? What about the specifics of the conquest? Are they allowed to encourage the spread of disease in our communities? Enslave us and work us to death? Tear down our cities and burn our books? Are they allowed to force us to resettle away from the fertile areas they have taken for their colonies? If you accept the conquest of the Americas as justified then surely you must accept this justified."	4.0	0.0	484	False	True	0.0

But your understanding of flirting and relationship-building is misguided.

Flirting is an act of communication, not just a sexual game. It is a way of demonstrating interest -- sexual and/or otherwise -- to a potential partner. This has the benefit of allowing the relationship to progress organically rather than trying to make a sudden hard turn into a romantic relationship with someone to whom you have shown no interest. 

&gt;Flirting assesses sexual compatibility, which alone is not sufficient to guarantee long term success, making it not a useful indicator. 

No, sex assesses sexual compatibility. Flirting doesn't tell you anything about what turns a person on. Flirting is opening the door just a little bit. It may give you hints, but that's kind of the point. But it's well-established that sexual compatibility is a big factor in long-term relationship success for most people. 

&gt;The rationale being that when the time comes, I'll turn up the seduction and work it out, but that time only comes during dating, not before.

The problem with this approach is that you're trying to take the relationship from zero to sixty with no warning. Flirting is a way to gradually break down social barriers so the relationship can grow closer. Most people don't respond to a sudden, ""Hey I'm into you!"" Even if they're interested back.

You are trying to manipulate the process of building a relationship rather than participating in the social norm. You're welcome to follow a different set of social norms, but you will have limited success because most people are expecting relationships to develop in a certain way, and in most cases flirting is a part of that.

&gt;My guess is, women look for a spark, and I actively avoid generating it--if there is a flirt opportunity, I consciously turn it down.

Understand: What you are doing is communicating that you are not interested. You are placing yourself firmly in the friend zone.

&gt;Background: I was a child actor, so once I find out my partner's turn ons, I can play out the fantasies and characters she wants. To me, seduction is like acting out a role. And the compromise is if I give her a night of acting, I'll get one in return.

This has nothing to do with a genuine relationship, which is ostensibly what you want. You need to learn how not to act, how to be an authentic human being who responds to other human beings in the moment rather than trying to read and calculate.

You need to learn how to build a romantic relationship because....

&gt;The rationale being that when the time comes, I'll turn up the seduction and work it out,

...it's not just a switch you can turn on. Actors get laid really easily but they have a bad track record for relationship success."	26.0	0.0	487	False	True	0.0

I think any criticism if well placed or in large quantity will hit well.  

&gt; discourage criticism under the banner of ""feminism"" and instead adopt a banner for female gamers  

Thing is, female gamers can be sexist and male feminists can be assertive.  I think we should focus on what points are a contribution to the society we want to build.  Unfortunately for you this includes the assertive points Sarkeesian might make.  Sorry about that.  

&gt; men seem to be perfectly OK with their stereotype, and therefore we should work on women, you instead dismissed the issue out of hand  

I admit a well-based bias here.  Some males are upset about the females expectation  of a sixpack or brave attitude in the same way some females are upset about expectation on large breasts or small waists.  I agree with this.  This is the statement of ""gender equality"" which we agree on.  

A different issue is feminism.  Feminism is more specific than (and can coexist with) gender equality, it focuses on a subset of this which I would describe as ""the component of gender inequality that lessens females or puts them at a disadvantage in an already male dominated society"".  

So yes, Conan the Barbarian might make a slightly fat black guy, or a small shy nonviolent caucasian uncomfortable, and this is a victimization by stereotype and I criticize this too.  But this is another topic.  The two victims of Conan's stereotype will still have the social advantage of being male.  

Feminism focuses on how this influences against women's place in society, that's all.  These two focuses are not mutually exclusive, but you and I can both understand that those specializing in the issue with the highest number of victims have a point worth considering.  

With the rest of your points I agree with.  Ads, publicity campaigns and hollywood stereotypes are much more relevant than gaming ones, but this doesn't mean gaming ones are good, it just means that the priorities might lie elsewhere.  The fact heroin and cocaine are very harmful doesn't make smoking healthy or good, we can oppose them all and people focusing on smoking are not wrong only because there exists a greater harm.  I consider myself a feminist only in that I am aware of what trends are harmful for females, admitting that a female in New York has it better in every aspect than a male in Congo, but this doesn't mean you should get away with segregating that female in new york.

I think the fundamental issue you're encountering is that you don't understand how investigations like this work.

You need first to understand the agencies and players (the cast of characters, if you will):

* The Ferguson Police Department
* The St. Louis County Police Department
* The Office of the Prosecuting Attorney, St. Louis County
* The US Department of Justice
* The Missouri State Highway Patrol

Now, you need to understand how they intersect.

The Ferguson Police Department employed the officer involved in the shooting. As soon as the shooting occurred, they called in the St. Louis County PD, and turned over the shooting investigation to them.

The St. Louis County PD is the lead agency on the SHOOTING investigation. They report their findings to the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney.

The PA's office is the final say for the release of any and all information about the shooting investigation. If they don't approve it for release, it's not released.

The DOJ is conducting a parallel civil rights investigation, and performing about a million interviews. In perhaps the first recorded occasion of this EVER happening, their agents are going door to door.

The MSHP is the lead agency for running the combined unit that's responding to the riots and looting. They have nothing to do with the shooting investigation whatsoever.

Now, as you know, the public is clamoring for the release of the shooting investigation and associated documentation (including the autopsy report). The PA's office has repeatedly refused to release any of this information, and has clearly laid out the circumstances upon which they will release it.

The Ferguson PD, who had no part of this investigative process, and does not control the report or the release of it, literally can't do anything.

The analogy would be that you and my friend Pete are on a street corner. I ask you for some gummy bears, you tell me Pete has them, Pete's dad says I can't have any, and in response I burn your house down.

Now, as to the video and investigation of the strong-arm robbery. This is a case that DOES belong to the Ferguson PD. They investigated it, collected evidence, and then asked the PA's office for what is called exceptional clearance. 

Exceptionally Cleared means that we know who did it, but because of exceptional means (death, usually), there is no reason to continue the investigation or prosecution.

Once the PA's office signs off on the exceptional clearance, the Ferguson PD released the report and evidence to the media, pursuant to the poorly-worded FOIA request from a media member. 

People are upset because they, like you, don't understand why things are done the way they're done.

For more information on why the Ferguson PD officer has not yet been charged, please see this fantastic article from our friends at St. Louis Public Radio:

The introduction of foreign elements, where trust isn't an integral part of the culture, could theoretically sabotage the efficacy of the model.

3. The ""Low Expectations"" critique — maybe we're so damn happy because we don't expect much of life, and therefore real outcomes tend to match or exceed our expectations. Maybe our culture would create ""happiness"" under different circumstances as well, indicating that the model itself isn't what's creating these statistics, but rather some other factor, like culture or even genetics (as suggested by some admittedly fringe theories).

4. The wealth of Scandinavian countries is also the result of the same mechanisms that have created wealth in the rest of Europe, including most prominently exploitative colonialism. While Scandinavian countries were only minor colonial powers (most notably Denmark), they all benefited massively from trade with stronger colonial powers, like The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and to an extent Germany. The Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way, but hasn't necessarily created the wealth in the first place.

I don't particularly agree with all these criticisms, but they're worth considering.

One relevant question, though: Do you think the Nordic Model is *the best possible system* or just *the best we have at the moment*? I think any Swede, Dane and Norwegian would say that they can point to flaws in our individual systems. Someone is always going to be at least a little bit dissatisfied, but allowing yourself to think that ""this is the best we can do"" is harmful, because our societies *do* have real problems as well, even if they're slightly smaller problems than some other nations face.

One specific problem that I'm familiar with, because I'm Danish, is the fact that Danish societal coherence is largely based on *ethnic* and *cultural* homogeneity. This means that even if Denmark is doing great in the globalised economy, it is facing a massive *cultural* struggle, because there is no concept of Danish national identity that doesn't prescribe a very specific ethnic and cultural background. In a globalised world of many ethnicities, this becomes a real problem that manifests itself both in very high levels of xenophobia, but also in perpetual cultural insecurity, which makes it difficult to interact with people from other backgrounds. This is how the idiom of the ""duck pond"" (*andedam*) in Danish has emerged, as a metaphor not just for the country itself but for the slightly self-obsessed and self-important mentality of the Danes.

Compare this with American national identity, which is to a large degree grounded in the Constitution of the United States of America, its rights, freedoms, and institutions, rather than any specific ethnicity or culture [although obviously a distinct American culture has emerged over the last century]. This isn't to downplay racial issues in America, but the point is that Danish minority identities aren't even hyphenated. It's ""The Danes"" and ""The Muslims"", not ""The Danish Muslims""."	398.0	0.0	576	False	True	0.0

&gt; reduces poverty which benefits everyone.

Reduced poverty does indeed benefit everyone but when poverty rates are calculated the same way between advanced economies they are largely indistinguishable from one another, there is a fairly good analysis including some history [here](https://www.chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/economic-science-institute/_files/ifree-papers-and-photos/PriceFishback.pdf).

Largely where the US differs from other advanced economies is that our programs tend to be non-universal other then for old age transfers (which is the reverse of the rest of the world as it is universal where it generally isn't elsewhere), programs like public health are means tested where they are not elsewhere.

&gt; High level of education

The US actually has an identical tertiary enrollment rate to all the Nordic countries.

A fairly persistent problem in the US (its existed since the 80's) and to a lesser extent elsewhere is that even with a rise in education skills acquisition has been relatively flat, while people are entering and graduating from tertiary education at increased rates their marketable skills are not increasing. The problem here is caused by insufficient information being available to those embarking on tertiary education, they don't understand what the future value of their skills will be so make poor choices regarding which skills to acquire.

&gt; highly efficient administration

They are efficient due to their size, states of the same size are similarly efficient.

&gt; effectively invests into the society

You would have a hard time justifying the US doesn't also do so but just in different ways. Public science &amp; healthcare R&amp;D spending in the US is extraordinarily high compared to every other advanced economy (EG - The vast majority, nearly 90%, of worldwide public vaccine research spending is in the US), NiH and NSF actually fund research in the Nordic countries too.

&gt; providing multiple incentives

Which often fail. One of the reasons why Sweden went in a different direction in the 90's is due to their persistently high structural unemployment, having double digit unemployment even in a boom is a significant problem and poses a very significant mobility issue. In many of the countries today they are finding similar problems in education, people are becoming perpetual students obtaining degrees because they can rather then there is actually any value to them doing so.

&gt; angles of growth

Growth in Nordic countries is certainly below potential but more significant globalization creates a great deal of interaction between countries economies such that high growth countries with significant trade will necessarily increase growth in other countries. There is a good paper on the Nordic vs US models from this perspective [here](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/varieties_of_capitalism_april_9_2013.pdf).

&gt; Low level of income inequality

Beyond the moral case its hard to make a case for inequality being bad, its simply not causal with any negative economic outcomes. Poverty &amp; mobility are the issues which actually do impact outcomes but always seem to take a back seat.

&gt; low crime

Check out Northern New England. US national figures are biased by a couple of places (DC particularly) which have very high crime rates.

&gt; good healthcare

Different healthcare then the US, better accessibility but lower quality of care; it largely depends on how you consider healthcare issues.

Beyond political reports we really don't rank healthcare systems of advanced economies, they all have good quality of care and all respond to local lifestyle &amp; political factors. The US is expensive but offers a wider array of treatment options then other countries, there are simply too many points of bias for any ranking to be useful so they are largely considered to be equivalent.

&gt; great education

Agreed, we spend the 2nd highest per child in the world and perform shockingly badly. K-12 is in desperate need of reform.

&gt; But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing

This is does do, nearly half of total world capital is available in the US. Net capital flows in advanced economies is towards to the US rather then away from it. As a good example even the European pharma's perform the majority of their R&amp;D in the US (EG - Most of GSK's R&amp;D is in MA). Capital created in the Nordic countries will typically end up in the UK or US.

&gt; sustainable economic growth.

As a quibble there is no such thing, all non-artificial growth is good for everyone. If we had a magic wand which would add 5% to growth immediate we should wave it, higher wages, reduced prices relative to incomes etc.

A better intermediate model which largely accomplishes what you are likely looking for would be the German system. Their healthcare system is incredible, the works council system is incredible (but currently illegal in the US) and while I don't think we need to legislate it in the same way the shared prosperity principles are really interesting.

Being 19, I only have limited experience, and as far as I know, grown-ups are worse at this than teenagers. 

In my own experience, people will test everyone's confidence all the time. Every time anyone tries anything new, from wearing a shit with an abnormal print on it, to doing feces-related performance-art. People will always try and make fun of you, to see if you are confident in your own choices.

Grown-ups are worse, as far as I know, my mom being a well-educated American woman really annoyed a lot of people. She was trying her best to excel at her job, working overtime and studying besides her job, to get better at it, this didn't sit well with a lot of people. It went so far that even her boss would try and prevent her from improving. She since quit, because of a major bullying problem. At her new job she is one of the most important people in the municipality, yet they still refuse her a full-employment. 

If you think this sounds just like ""people being assholes"", it really is something slightly different. Even the government realizes the problem of shooting down anyone who excels at anything, to the point where public school teachers are teaching kids that you should remember to congratulate people who do stuff well.

I think that if we're going to look for a ""best"" socioeconomic model, we should look for one that's more generally applicable - one that isn't tightly tied to a particular culture and a cohesive, homogeneous national identity.

It turns out that there's a model that fits that description quite well. [Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) looks a lot like the Scandinavian countries on measures of [happiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report), [education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index), [life expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy), [economic mobility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility), and [GDP per capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita), and is [relatively close on income inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality). It's also an aggressively [multicultural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism_in_Canada) nation of [immigrants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada) which specifically [rejects the need for homogeneity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mosaic). Because of this, the Canadian economic, educational, and legal systems aren't built on shared identity and trust, but rather on a sort of consequentialist pragmatism. Canada tends - in general terms, over a multi-decadal time scale - to adopt policies that work and discard ones that don't. In this it contrasts sharply not only with its idealistic southern neighbours, but also with the differently-idealistic political culture of Scandinavia.

So I think you should consider Canada's model as a more generally-applicable candidate."	2.0	0.0	212	False	True	0.0

We already require guilty verdicts beyond reasonable doubt to send people to prison, to stay there for life or be executed. And yet innocent people are constantly ending up there by accident. You can't say torture is OK only if we know for a fact they're guilty because we can never know. Everyone on death row is there because we KNEW they were guilty. Except some aren't. As technology advances and cases are revisited we continually free wrongly imprisoned people.

If torture is only allowed for the TRULY guilty, does that mean that everyone else in the system is only KINDA guilty? It doesn't work like that. Everyone must be judged as being 100% truly guilty to receive a punishment.

is it perhaps true that maybe some things *shouldn't* be changeable? the years between voting, for example? because you yourself said the years between voting could be voted on. and what if when those 4 years are up, the people decide now they only want 2 years between voting? and after that, 1 year? 6 years? a decade? the inconsistency wont stop. and when it comes to monetary legislation, is that a bad thing that we don't get a say? if we did, what would we say? what would 316 million people who have no idea what the first thing about monetary legislation say? do you honestly trust every single person to take the considerable time and effort to receive a proper understanding of the intricacies of monetary legislation, and then cast a well informed and welly thought out vote on it? or do you think no one will, and will instead remain ignorant and clueless, and jump on to whatever is suggested to them by mass hype (which we've established is very inconsistent and sporadic), advertising campaigns, and personal bias? you know, **just like they do now**?

&gt; In my system, people wouldn't have time to pay attention to votes they don't care about. And the corporations would have to launch a campaign for every issue instead of just funding/paying off a few candidates

that still doesn't clear up the issue with the lack of representation. If anything, that's just a tacit admission that a large part of legislation wont be decided by a majority vote, like you desire, but by the whim of a few, independent from the majority of people, like you accuse representative democracy of doing. at least in a rep. democracy, the majority consent to these few having the legislative power, since they voted for them. and i doubt companies will pour so much time and resources into EVERY issue. after all, many issues will be ignored by the majority of people (as has been established) who don't really care about it, and will thus be completely at the whim of minorities already devout to a particular position, one which they aren't likely to change if it differs from what the corporation wants, regardless of any advertising to the contrary. instead, they will pour it into the big, important issues that hold many people's passion and attention, **just like they do now** in our current system. so companies will just ignore the smaller, trivial, unalterable votes and still push for only a few big things, just in your system it will be for the legislation itself instead of a candidate.

&gt;  I think that the low turnouts would tend to be a feature

low turnouts on voting, in a society whose progress and activity is decided solely on voting, is a very bad feature

&gt;  they will probably have their way much quicker than if they have to get a majority of people in congress paying attention to and agreeing on something that most people don't care about...it would be a major task to get congress to pay attention to something like that

but is that necessarily a good thing? what if the minority wants a bad thing? speed isn't the point. ensuring good, agreed upon legislation is the point. even if it is good legislation, like your native american example, it is still unfair for anyone besides the majority of the pouplation to have such power in a majority-wins system. i mean, doesn't the notion of a minority having unfettered decision making power undermine the notion of majority rule, the point of direct democracy and everything you want in your system?

&gt;Lenders won't simply eat this risk, instead they'll raise interest rates and fees to offset this newfound risk, or simply not allow students to borrow money.

The United States government is far and away the largest lender of student loans.  Private market lenders will likely act as you describe, but there's no reason the government has to.  They do money-losing things all the time.  IIRC, something like 3/4 of student loan dollars come from the feds.

Second, student loans used to be bankruptable.  There were some scandals with med students finishing school and promptly filing BK.  

Discretionary authority exists among bankruptcy judges already to refuse discharge of debts entered into when the debtor planned to file, for example.  That authority could be expanded on and guidelines established to look specifically at immediate post-graduation/disnerollment bankruptcies.

Another possible solution would be to require that student loans can only be discharged through Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  On Chapter 13, you have to enter a payment plan and live on a pretty strict budget, with all excess income going to your debts for 3-5 years.

But I think that bringing student loans into a well-established legal institution for dealing with debt is a good idea in the long run, even if some special rules need to be adopted to prevent abuses.  "	13.0	0.0	232	False	True	2.0

If so, would you also agree that we should only ever drink things out of sippy cups or Contigo travel mugs?  

But aside from that, here are some things to consider:

* The wide base of a wine glass makes more of a difference than you'd think.  Objects tip over once their centre of gravity is no longer directly above part of the base.  This angle is pretty much the same as many other glasses.  Obviously mugs are more stable, but aside from that there isn't that much difference.  [Here's what I mean](http://imgur.com/a/49p26) - the angle from this point to the edge of the base is equal to the angle you'd need to tip the glass before it fell over.

* I have successfully cleaned thousands of wine glasses and never had a single problem with breakage. 
* Because the top lip of the glass curves inwards, spills from the liquid sloshing around is less likely.  
* The thin glass of a wine glass makes it lighter and easier to carry around for long periods of time, which is good for times when one is socializing at cocktail parties and whatnot.
* Wine glasses can be held at the top of the stem without using the entire hand.  Again, good for social events where one might be holding a plate of food, shaking someone's hand, and accepting a business card all at the same time.
* Wine glasses look elegant.
* The curvature of the glass is more conducive to sipping, and makes it easier to savour the wine.  This allows for a fuller appreciation of the wine's flavours and allows the aromas to collect right under your nose.  This sipping motion also makes moderation easier."	10.0	0.0	311	False	True	0.0

What he means by that statement is that ideas do not exist in a void. For example, take this comment. You are reading the words I've typed into a comment on this post in the change my view section of the larger reddit website. Presumably you are reading it in a web browser on some type on internet enabled electronic device. Each step of the process modifies how you perceive the content and imposes additional meaning on my message. 

If you took this discussion and transplanted it to another website, your perception of it would be altered based on how you perceive the website. For McLuhan it was more than simply the physical form the content takes. The publisher matters, the author matters, the typeface matters, the supporting art matters.

If this thread was on 4chan, how would you evaluate it? What if it was in the online edition of the Wall Street Journal? How about Vox, The Daily Mail, or Yahoo News? Each of these sources color our perception of the content and that is what McLuhan means by the ""medium is the message"".

With that in mind I have to take issue with each of your statements.

&gt; Reading print media makes us more educated, as opposed to the digital media we revel in today.

To apply McLuhan's lense to this situation you would have to be more specific. If two people read the same article, one digitally and the other in print, neither would be more educated than the other. They would have different perceptions of the significance of what they've read but both would have the same information.

&gt; Playing violent video games and watching violent films makes us more violent.

For every study saying that statement is true, there is an equal and opposite study saying it's false. The fact is when you zoom out, humans have become less violent as a whole.

&gt; Watching television makes us less social.

It makes it easier to be anti-social but watching television does not require us to be less social. Many times discussing television gives people who would not have otherwise interacted a common ground they can build relationships on. Social groups also form around television and can be a great way for people who otherwise find it difficult to meet people to socialize.

Furthermore, calves are slaughtered for veal at 18-20 weeks of age, when their weight is about 200 to 230 kilos (450 to 500 lbs). If we take the ratio of body weight to yield weight to be the same, that's about 90 kilos (195 lbs).

&gt; there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other

&gt; I do think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing

You stated that their deaths are essentially the same, and that you find the suffering of animals unethical. Using the numbers above, around 2.5 calves must be slaughtered to provide the same amount of meat as a single fully grown cow. Therefore, to provide the same amount of meat, it is about two and a half times as unethical to slaughter calves, on the basis of their deaths.

&gt; Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world.

I'll take on your argument here though. I've been meaning to look into this more in depth anyway.

So I disagree with you that (1) does not matter. The only way for me to say that it is worse to kill a baby cow than an adult cow is to say that there are degrees of badness in killing animals, and that requires me to be able to say that it can be bad to kill an animal, otherwise I could only say that it is not bad to kill animals, and there could be no degree of immorality in that scenario. And I think you must admit that there are degrees of such, as my neighbor's pet dog is clearly much happier than a calf in a veal crate, and you have said that happiness and suffering does matter in animals. The question is then, does the calf suffer more than your average beef cow?

Now while I think you under-estimate the cow's ability to feel pain, I don't think I need to press this point so much as the difference between a veal calf's reality and a standard beef cow's. Beef cows do spend time outside. Here's an [EPA article](http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/beefphases.html) on the subject. However, the outside they spend time in often does not have grass, and is only a feedlot. During winter they can be confined inside, and also confined a few months before slaughter to help fatten them up. They are most often dehorned as well, without anesthetic. However, veal calves not only experience all this, (94% of dairy calves are dehorned, while about 17% of those calves are given anesthetic. [Page 109](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_ir_CalfHealth.pdf). There's no debate that dehorning causes pain.) but must do so *while being starved and confined in a crate for the entirety of their life.* So I think we can say that veal calves suffer at least twice as much as your average beef cow.

Duration of suffering matters too though. So how long is that miserable calf's existence? The MSPCA says veal calves suffer [for about 18 weeks](http://www.mspca.org/programs/animal-protection-legislation/animal-welfare/farm-animal-welfare/factory-farming/cows/veal-calves-on-a-factory-farm.html), or 4.5 months before slaughter, and since the age of veal calves is such a contentious issue, pretty much all sources have the same number. I couldn't find any official data on beef cows, (or steers), but scouring around forums gives me about 18 months for commercially raised, non-grass fed beef. ([1](http://www.homesteadingtoday.com/livestock-forums/cattle/235359-age-slaughter-steer.html),[2](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/beef-farming/page-7),[3](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/feeding-cattle.html)).

So the numbers add up quite nicely, 18/4.5 = 4, meaning steers suffer for 4 times as long as veal calves before slaughter. So the suffering of 1 veal calf is 1 unit, and a steer is 4 units. However, (and there is official USDA data on this, thank god), we get about [880 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/BD7FAEF0-CFC8-3E27-A0EB-67C04E8FB488) of edible meat per beef cow, and only about [175 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/4D51FF2B-04BC-3312-8D46-ED424F7C2D01) per veal calf. 880/175 = ~5, meaning per lb of meat you eat, you cause a 5x longer duration of suffering for veal calves. do the math and we have 5 units of suffering per lb of veal eaten, and 4 units per lb of beef. This is purely on a basis of duration, not intensity, of suffering... even though as I've argued above, we have good reason to believe that veal calves suffer more. So you would have to actually argue not only that veal calves don't suffer more, but that they actually *suffer less*, in order to justify the view that eating veal is no worse than eating beef.

On top of that, every purchase of veal covers a negative expense of the dairy industry. If we stopped paying for veal, not only would the dairy industry lose its profits, but it would actually suffer, as it would still be producing calves, simply not selling them. Whereas if we were to stop buying burgers, the beef industry would stop raising cattle, and would lose profits, but not actually go into debt.

And finally, there's a great practical reason to consider veal worse than beef, once again, *even if the suffering is the same.* Imagine I give you the opportunity to live in two societies. One in which it is considered just as bad to kill an adult as it is a baby, and one in which it is considered worse to kill a baby than an adult. I think it's clear that a society that considers cruelty to adults not as bad as cruelty to children would be a better society, for indirect reasons such as the need to protect children more, and the moral innocence of children, and by saying that there's nothing worse in killing a baby for food than there is in killing an adult, you're supporting a worse society, however rational your view may seem at surface.

All things considered, I think there's very good reason to find killing baby cows for food more immoral than killing adult cows, even though both are clearly immoral."	16.0	0.0	835	False	True	0.0

The dog was domesticated somewhere between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago while man existed as a hunter gatherer, by comparison the cow, sheep, and pig was domesticated around 8,000 years ago and are tied with man's development of agriculture. So we have had a relationship with dogs for at least twice as long as any of the animals we use as a food source. This also shows that we never intended them as a livestock animal since we literally had not developed that concept at the time.


15,000 years ago man and wolves filled much the same niche and had many similarities, both traveled in nomadic packs hunting much the same animals, even our social structures are remarkably similar. It has been theorized that the domestication of wolves was not some thing we actively did but rather a gradual symbiosis. Wolves fed on our scraps and wolves less aggressive to us thrived while more aggressive ones failed. Wolves following our tribes served as a deterrent to larger predators and a free alarm system notifying us of any approaching threat. Eventually we began to work together to bring down prey. Wolves became dogs and we welcomed them into our huts and our families.

 At no point is there evidence of us using them directly as a food source except when no other sources were available. In fact meat eaters like dogs are terrible animals to use as direct food animals, every time you move up the food chain a step the amount of meat for resources required to create it diminishes dramatically. Essentially it takes a given amount of energy to grow grass which comes from the sun, a pig eating that grass can only convert a small portion of that total energy into meat, and a dog eating that pig can only convert a even smaller portion of the energy from that meat into its own meat. Carnivores are just not designed to put on weight like herbivores. For this reason actual farming of dogs is horribly inefficient and completely uneconomical. This  is why so many of the dogs for this festival are kidnapped instead of farmed, it's the only truly viable way to provide that much meat. What is the purpose of growing perfectly edible meat to feed to dogs which will produce exponentially less meat than you originally fed them for a product (dog meat) that from everything I've heard is not exponentially better.

 Since dogs make for terrible livestock instead we bred them to depend on us emotionally and to see us as members of their pack. Dogs have several abilities which uniquely augment our own such as speed, loyalty, intelligence, sharper senses, and hunting ability. Dogs and humans are the only animals that use visual cues to communicate, it certainly was not inherent in them before domestication and is not in any other domesticated animal showing that we viewed them as closer to equals to be communicated with than livestock to be slaughtered. We used these dogs to help us survive in a very harsh world by aiding us in hunting and protection. Dogs literally put food on our table and watched over us while we slept for thousands of years. In recent years dogs have been much less critical to our success as a species but still provide many valuable functions. In a very real sense our species and theirs are for no better word ""married"" we have developed an bond, depended on, and provided for each other in a symbiotic relationship that goes far deeper than any other domesticated animal for tens of thousands of years. 


TL:DR
Essentially Dogs were never intended to be livestock like pigs and cows. They would be horribly inefficient if we used them that way due to their carnivore nature, which means if a ready supply of pets to be stolen did not exist it's likely this festival would also not exist for lack of supply.  A tradition of eating dog can only ever thrive on the immorality of stealing dogs or incredibly uneconomical waste of resources farming them. We also have a deep and inherent debt to them for protecting, feeding, and loving us for far longer than recorded human history. All of these things are unique to dogs and show why eating dog is not the same as eating pig, but rather a betrayal of all that they have done for us over the last 15-30 thousand years.

And this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name ""Montegue-Capulet"" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.

Of course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).

In summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating.

The single-last-name-of-father system likely feels most correct to you because it (a) is most familiar and (b) gives you the most benefits while asking the fewest concessions. First, you know that you have an ingrained and biased preference about names: you prefer your wife and children take your name, but would feel uncomfortable or disappointed by the opposite. This is not a topic on which you are neutral and simply trying to find the easiest universal system.

As a measure of clarity – who is related to whom – hyphenating provides *more* information. The single-last-name system obscures familial relationships in comparison.

As a measure of legal identity – how many people share your name – hyphenating makes each name more distinct. 

I too work in an industry where I deal with thousands of names and families. The single last name system does not allow me to know “who is related to who” at anything better than an educated guess. I know dozens of families who share last names but no close relation. I know dozens of blended families. I know dozens of guardians who don’t share names with children, and committed couples who are not married. I also know siblings who get mistaken for spouses, and spouses who have been mistaken for siblings. Helping strangers make assumptions based on a single last name seems like the weakest possible defense. 

As a matter of personal identity – the right of a couple to determine family identity and choose names that are appropriate, representative, and meaningful – having a range of possibilities means couples can make a decision about how they understand their family construction. Group labeling and identity are incredibly strong sociological forces. 

As a measure of ease – spelling, length – that consideration does not exist in any other naming context, and it becomes absurd to try to impose the ease standard universally. If your wife had a much shorter last name than you, would it be inconsiderate to give your own name to your children? Is it unnecessarily complicated to give children a first name with more than one syllable? Is it unacceptable to name your child after your French mother if the name may be difficult for American businesses? 

Maybe more to he point, though, the difference in ease between the most complex and most simple names I have *ever* written has been minor - a dozen letters, a double-check on spelling, a confirmation. Literally a difference of a few seconds. 

While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

I do see nods to individual choice in your post, but only if you never have to interact with a world where people choose differently than you. 

Women should not have to take their husband’s name, but you only want to marry a woman who will. Men should have the option to take their wife’s name, but you'll never consider it. Children can have either parent's name, as long as yours have *only* their father's. Gay couples need ways to build family identity, but only if you don't have to see a hyphenated name.

You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. 

Also, as a side-note, it is a pretty well-documented phenomenon that people are less likely to change a position after taking a public stance. You begin by saying you have “had a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names.” If you have expressed “joking” superiority or derision towards people who do not like the same names you like, then you may feel compelled to justify that you were just smarter all along, rather than arbitrarily judgmental or dickish.

If people did not tip and servers had to earn their living from only wages, food prices would increase to compensate the additional cost required to sustain the servers.  In addition to this, not tipping is typically frowned upon because the stiff is disregarding the server's humanity.

Eliminating the tip would not save money for anyone in the long run because restaurants will simply up the price of their food. Imagine a scenario in which one had to pay $10 + at least 20% tips, thus raising the price to $12. If tipping ceased, the restaurant would simply raise the initial price of the food to $12. The consumer still has to pay the same amount. However, under the tip system, servers can try to provide better service because they have an incentive for doing so. Tipping helps both the consumer and the server, and as such, it is more preferrable to tip than provide a base wage.

The server is paid a base wage of +/- $2/hour to ensure that they walk home with at least something. It's a protection of their income stability, much like how many salespeople of supermarkets like Walmart are paid much lower than what the skill demands because salespeople make commission. The base wage for a server is not meant to sustain the server. It is only meant to be used as a backup if income from tips is too low. Servers actually earn their money from providing and enhancing a good service by taking away plates and bringing food to the customer. Keep in mind that when consumers pay the price tag for the meal, they are paying only for the cook's labor and the cost of the ingredients. Tips are not factored in because they provide an incentive for servers to give giving a better service. While you may argue that cooks should be tipped too under this logic because then cooks have an incentive to cook better, the action is simply unrealistic to implement because a cook spends most of his or her time optimizing efficiency in the kitchen. To have to deal with tips is to immediately handicap the maximum achievement the cooks can accomplish.

People who serve are doing so to sustain their families. They try to provide the best service because they need something from you: money. A person who does not tip goves everyone else around him or her that he or she is rich, but chooses to spend cheaply anyway. It's a rude gesture, especially when someone else (the server) is expending a reasonable effort to provide the consumer with a better environment surrounding a meal. Tipping shows some respect to the server, which is arguably more important than saving $2 here and there. It's common knowledge that people didn't pay for the service up front and that stiffing the server results in making the server's life harder to live."	1.0	0.0	497	False	True	0.0

I would say most servers are happy with this, however. Due to the still-pretty-low minimum wage in the U.S., most servers you come across will actually be opposed to abolishing tipped wages. Even with the criminally low tipped wage of $2.13/hr, a server's tips will, on average, still be much, much higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr

Servers will be more than happy to take the $2/hr wage because it will actually average out to something more like $15-$20 an hour thanks to the tipping culture that has been established here.

If the federal minimum wage was a livable wage and tipping wages were abolished, I'd say there would be a good chance of eventually moving away from tipping culture.


Until this is the case, however, all you're doing by not tipping at least 10% is taking away the wages of the server who is taking care of you, as income taxes and such often take away 100% of the hourly wage of these employees, if you spend an hour in a restaurant and don't leave a tip, chances are the server had to pay out of his own pocket in order to provide you their service, and that's a pretty shitty feeling."	3.0	0.0	257	False	True	2.0

**I. This method is not effective**

I think the most convincing argument in favor of the BLM protesters is that it worked. Sanders was forced/convinced to release a more comprehensive platform on racial violence in this country due to the vast amount of flack he has been given by BLM, both recently and at netroots. 

Secondly, you say

&gt;It succeeds when the minds of the general populace are changed at a high rate toward the verbalized cause. Through the witnessing of such actions and protests, suddenly the people turn their gaze toward those in power, who feel the stare of everyone looking at them, oppressing them with genuine and widespread mistrust of their stances. The people display a collective ""what are you going to do about it now?"" and the power of those at the top is actually threatened by the people who support them from below.

But I think we are already at that point. Most people recognize that there is a systemic problem in the way policing works that makes excessive force more likely to occur and to go without punishment, and most people also recognize that police violence is disproportionately focused on people of color, specifically black bodies.

What we are lacking is concrete policy proposals by those in power to alleviate the distress of the population, and that is what the BLM protesters accomplished.

**II. This method is targeting the wrong people**

I think you are wrong to say Sander's supporters are pro-BLM. The huge backlash on reddit has shown, not only to this event but also to the shooting yesterday in Ferguson, judging by top comments in large/default subs such as /r/news, has been overwhelmingly anti-black, and anti-BLM. You may say this was because of the specific tactic, but more often then not the criticism was leveled at the movement itself with this incident being the trigger for the anger, not the cause.

Secondly, Bernie Sanders has come to represent the new ""champion of liberalism/ progressivism"" in America, and as such needs to be held to a high standard. His comments at netroots and his whole platform of worker solidarity are seen by many to push racial issues under the rug of income inequality or the fight against ""capitalism."" To many, this is not seen as an adequate response, and because of these tactics, Bernie has clarified his views and updated his platform.

The biggest obstacle for Sanders to win a nomination is outreach to minorities, a demographic with which he currently polls very poorly with (I think in large part due to the attitude of his supporters). These incidents and his response have shown to help both sides, appeasing BLM and helping hammer out a better platform on police violence.

**III. These are not mutually exclusive**

Finally, your view states that they did not take certain avenues of action into consideration, however, there is no reason you cannot do both as one does not sacrifice the other.

You take early retirement and your husband picks up extra shifts to make up for the loss of income and your treatment expenses.

Tomorrow when he comes home you don't recognize him.  You're having a moment, it will pass, he knows you'll be fine shortly.


You, fearing a burglar, push him down the stairs.  You kill your doting husband.

&gt; A lot of technology can be used for both good and bad, that's not really unique to this, and we still aren't trying to stop a lot of other technological development. We just try to stop people from using it that way. 

You're wrong here. There are many technologies that people do fight against regardless of its beneficial potential simply because they think it would be bad. One such technology is stem cell research. I believe it's been hindered for decades because of fear of what might be. I mean, are you paying attention to the society we live in? it's not even hard to think of examples of technologies that are suppressed (regardless of their capability to do good) solely for monetary reasons.

Whoops, you're right. One brand of wheat bread had 2 grams added per two slices, the brand of potato bread had 5 grams per roll. That's a whopping 8 and 20 calories, respectively.

I'm not sure why you think there's so much sugar in everything, though. An average day for me, I consume half a teaspoon of sugar between all sources. If people are subsisting on soda and sweets, of course sugar would contribute to their poor health. That's not a result of ""sugar being in everything"", it's a result of poor decision making skills. You can't make stupidity illegal.

As for canned and processed foods, their sodium contents should be the issue, not their sugar contents. Sugar contributes to spoilage, so it would be foolish to sugar up canned goods. All of the canned goods in my cupboard contain 3 or less grams of sugar.

As for soda and juice, if those are your main beverages, you've got more to worry about than just the sugar content. The acidity of those will kill your teeth faster than any sugar content. The phosphoric acid, in large doses, will throw off your body's calcium absorption. Juices, pure or not, have way, way more sugars than any soda, and fructose is more harmful to your health than soda. 

I'm really, really struggling to find your point at all. We need to remove sugar from junk food? Why? That's the point of junk food. If people are stupid enough to live on horrible food, then they deserve their misfortune. The only solution is education. 

In essence, the only valid point you've struck is that there's too much sugar in soda. Soda manufacturers have already put out sodas with no sugar, reduced sugar, and sugar alternatives from natural sources such as stevia. Market pressures work way better than any proposed legislation, your point was defeated before it begun. Every other source of sugary-ness comes from dessert and snack foods, and those should never be counted as a ""daily food.""

It just simply falls flat on its face no matter what angle I look at it from. Soda isn't a daily food. Snack cakes aren't a daily food. Sweet breads aren't a daily food. If sugar is ""scary"" to you because it's addictive and has health effects, all carbohydrates share this same quality. If you think there's more of it and in more sources than ever, I'm seeing neither an increase in quantity nor an increase in sources. Sugar is no more harmful than anything else you eat, why exactly are you railing against it?"	2.0	0.0	438	False	True	12.0

As below:

&gt; Conservatism in its most basic form is just wanting things to stay the way things are. [...] Conversely, I don't think it's true that progressives want change for change's sake, but at least embrace change when they see a problem with the current system.

Most conservatives accept change is inevitable, but feel that it should be managed to protect the existing positive aspects of society. Indeed this is outlined thoroughly in the writings of the British politician Edmund Burke, who is often cited as the father of Anglocentric conservatism. 

Progressives may not usually want change for its own sake, but they're often more willing to risk existing strengths in pursuit their goals. Partly this is because progressives often see existing structures as the cause of problems, without acknowledging their positives. For instance, many progressives would point to capitalism as the cause of inequality (a fair point) but would not acknowledge capitalism is superb at generating wealth (in the sense of products and services).

To take your next point:

&gt; This to me seems like they [conservatives] are not very willing to even consider new ideas even if they may be better than the current system/ tradition which is essentially just narrow-mindedness. Traditions are held as sacred and are therefore not compared fairly and rationally to new alternatives. 

At the far end of conservatism you have the view that society is very fragile, and that institutions built up over centuries can be shattered in a short space of time. This is why conservatives have taboos around criticising traditions, though they may not articulate it as such.

To some degree it's arguable the progressive/conservative spectrum is defined by one characteristic: risk appetite. Progressives tend to be willing to gamble to improve society, conservatives tend not to be.

PS. If you're interested in this I recommend looking up Thomas Sowell, an American economist who has written widely on conservatism compared to progressivism, especially in *A Conflict of Visions*. 

*I've used ""progressives"" throughout this, but to my mind the proper counterpoint would be ""radicals"", even allowing that one can have conservative radicals (reactionaries)."	27.0	0.0	381	False	True	0.0

* [It takes a ridiculous amount of capital and time to build a nuclear power plant.](https://www.oecd-nea.org/news/press-kits/economics-FAQ.html) It takes five to seven years to build a plant - aside from zoning concerns and planning, and can run costs of five to six billion dollars before they're finished and you can start to get anything approaching a return on investment - which means that the taxpayers would have to make a long-term investment themselves, because businesses aren't even interested with the normal capitalistic incentives.
* Fissile material is unfortunately a negative point in a world involving [terror attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiological_weapon). It's a decidedly low risk, but it's a big point against public opinion, and it can obviously be catastrophic in case of an issue. Similarly, safety is a concern in the event of natural disasters (Such as Fukushima).
* It requires a tremendous amount of water to use nuclear power generation. Fresh water is protected, Coastal places (Like Fukushima) run the risk of waves/tsunamis and similar difficulties.
* [We still don't know what to do with the end result radioactive material.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository#Earthquakes) Keeping it on-site is a temporary solution, but isn't viable for long-term goals.
* It's centralized. Coming back to the terrorism angle, it works too heavily against us in the way that it would allow a small break to have a wide impact. This also goes back to uranium/plutonium concerns. Fluoride salts are an option, but then it goes back to the water issues. From an economic angle, decentralization (Assuming we can manage appropriate storage) is cheaper to maintain and manage, and reduces loss due to transportation.
* No one wants a Nuclear plant anywhere near them, but solar and wind are much more acceptable to public opinion.

France, in particular, has a very nuclear-driven energy program, whose [details you can read about here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France). Their water use is severe, and generation is limited during heat waves because of the temperature restrictions on the water of the inland plants. In desert environments, it's pretty unfeasible.  In areas that grow warm (particularly near rivers), it's impractical.  And the use of the water in this method can have significant problems with agriculture (Imagine justifying this level of fresh water use in California, for instance).

Some nuclear is okay, mass nuclear will probably not be a viable option for years - we would need significantly better material science, or build locations.

Solar and wind are far more viable long-term solutions than mass nuclear. Nuclear is better than fossil fuels, but we still don't have portable storage for things like transportation (Since oil is so energy dense).  If we have enough battery capability for viable electric cars and diesel trucks, then we have enough for home energy generation and storage, and we might as well go backyard solar/wind anyways."	10.0	0.0	476	False	True	0.0

Beyond the obvious physical reaction of fear at being startled, a well-executed jump scare adds to the tension of a movie overall by chipping away at your ability to trust scenes that seem safe. In the wake of a good jump scare, you're likely to be more vigilant, which makes you more invested, because that's how fear works in real life. Something startles you out of the blue, and suddenly every shadow that kind of resembles it requires a second look just in case.

1. Realisation of danger.

1. Presentation of danger.

Lets work on number 1. A movie that starts out as a comedy, but gets less funny, and turns into a drama, and finally, it is revealed, after several incredibly dark scenes that it's been about a cannibal all along. An astute watcher would see the small signs that the makers left, and realise the danger to the characters. This tensions, that you know of the danger and they do not generates the horror.

The Silence of the Lambs did this incredibly effectively, showing that Hannibal is the most dangerous character, not Buffalo Bill.

Number two is different. There needs to be no long build up, rather you can simply show that ""there is danger here"". It can be a subtle reveal or a jump scare. Paranormal Activity is a brilliant example. You have a house, which is not a dangerous thing. Unlike an unknown prisoner, there is almost no way for the house to be dangerous.

Paranormal Activity uses the long sequences of little action to entrench this idea, then hits you with the jump scares, presenting that there is something that both the characters and the audience do not know, and it is dangerous.

Movies that rely on presentation of danger work best when the audience accepts that they only know as much as the characters, instead of having the privilege of being able to work out the danger before the characters encounter it.

Imagine waking up and realising you have been surrounded by lions all night.

Imagine a lion jumping out of a bush at you.

Stephen King said “[There are] three types of terror: The Gross-out: the sight of a severed head tumbling down a flight of stairs, it's when the lights go out and something green and slimy splatters against your arm. **The Horror:** the unnatural, spiders the size of bears, the dead waking up and walking around, **it's when the lights go out and something with claws grabs you by the arm**. And the last and worse one: Terror, when you come home and notice everything you own had been taken away and replaced by an exact substitute. It's when the lights go out and you feel something behind you, you hear it, you feel its breath against your ear, but when you turn around, there's nothing there...”

According to King, jump scares are part of what defines horror as opposed to other kinds of fear. You may not like them, and films that use them too heavily may not be any good, but according to King, they still count as Horror. "	38.0	0.0	187	False	True	0.0

She did not ""support"" the war in Iraq. She voted for the Iraq war authorization measure that Bush asked for, because he said that he war authorization would be the leverage he needed with the UN and Saddam Hussein. On the floor of the Senate, while explaining her vote, she said, ""A vote for [this resolution] is **not a vote to rush to war**; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our President and we say to him, use these powers wisely and as a last resort."" Bush was supposed to allow UN inspectors to finish their work and report, but he didn't. War was not used as a last resort but as a first and only resort, plunging the country into a decade-long ground war he had no ability to run. 

&gt;Against universal health care

That depends on what ""universal health care"" means. She is and has always been in support of every American having health care. [She was an important figure in the creation of CHIP](http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-sanders-claim/). She wants to expand the ACA, CHIP, and Medicaid programs. And she still supports a public option for health care -- she just intent on fighting for it at the state level. It says so on her website: ""As she did in her 2008 campaign health plan, and consistently since then, Hillary supports a “public option” to reduce costs and broaden the choices of insurance coverage for every American. To make immediate progress toward that goal, Hillary will work with interested governors, using current flexibility under the Affordable Care Act, to empower states to establish a public option choice.""

&gt;For the 2001 Bankruptcy Bill/Against the same 2005 Bankruptcy Bill

Yeah, that wasn't great. Can't say I agree with her on that one. But the difference between her two stances isn't a flip-flop -- according to her, she voted for the 2001 bill (which did not become law) because she had engineered certain compromises with Republicans on the structure of the bill. She voted for it, but was happy when it didn't pass the House. Because that's how politics works in the real world -- you have to compromise sometimes and vote for things you don't like in order to make sure an even worse thing doesn't pass.

In 2005, the ""same"" bill wasn't the same. The bill had rewritten, her concerns in 2001 weren't a factor any longer, so she opposed it.

Things he didn't mention or complain about in the video:

 * Feminism
 * The all-female cast (he skimmed on this when saying that people were referring to the movie as ""the female ghostbusters,"" but that was just to make a point that Hollywood likes to milk popular franchises with remakes)
 * Political correctness

Things he did criticize in the video:

 * Based on the trailer, the jokes are lame
 * The effects are lame
 * It's not consistent with the lore of the original movie
 * It doesn't use the original characters in any way
 * It's a lazy remake
 * It piggybacks off the original by not at least modifying the name, which means anytime anyone searches ""ghostbusters,"" both movies come up

You can agree or disagree with his criticisms, evaluation of the movie, or decision not to watch or review it. But I certainly don't see the case that his dislike of the movie is motivated by misogyny or even dislike of feminism.

A few years back I was at a hospital that saw a ton of celebrities, and one particular 20 something A list female celebrity (you definitely know her) happened to be in the hospital, in the psych ward. The press got wind of this. I was at a party talking to a guy who happened to be some kind of  photographer or journalist or something. We eventually started talking about that celeb and I mentioned that yea, I had seen her in the hospital. He offered me about $40k on the spot if I could get him pictures of her in the psych ward.*

The idea of a physician taking pics of a celeb in the hospital to give to the press, for $40k, is laughable. My earning potential is about $250k to $400k yearly, depending on how much I want to work. Over 30-50 year career that's maybe $10m in earnings, ignoring the enjoyment I get from my job. If I got caught taking pictures of an A list celeb to give to the press, I could easily lose my license, which would mean I would lose all that future earnings and enjoyment.

If you wanted me to take such a risk, you'd have to pay me at least on the order of several million dollars to make it worthwhile. You'd be paying me to take the risk, not for the quality of the job. 

Similarly, the Jackal was presumably a reputable professional who could find steady work doing less high profile hits. If some random undercover cop was getting offers of $200k, presumably a guy like the Jackal could do a couple hits a year in that range. His lifetime earning potential is probably in the range of $10m to $100m. Doing a high profile hit puts those earnings at risk, and on top of that puts his life and liberty at risk. Think about the international manhunt that would ensue after the assassination of a presidential candidate.   You'd probably have to offer him some tens of millions to make such a job worth the risk.

**tldr: You're paying a premium to make the risk worthwhile, not for the quality of the job.**

Does that mean there are zero genetic differences between ""races?"" Well, there are always genetic differences between demographic groups. There just aren't that many, and the likelihood they can have such a large magnitude in effect on IQ seems remote. 

Second, why would rice farming be so much more difficult than tribalism? A random tribesman from the Amazon rain forest will know hundreds of plants on sight, their use as food or medicine, the animals that like to feed on them or use them for shelter, the behavior and use of the *animals*, and so on. The farmer isn't stupid- he will, of course, know in great detail the process of farming rice, raising *his* animals, the weather and the best time to plant crops, local political conditions, and so on. Farming isn't easy. But why would you assume being a hunter-gatherer is any easier? Surely intelligence is an adaptive trait in both circumstances?

(By the way, lots of Africans were farmers too. So it's not even the case that there's a huge divide between Africans and the rest of the world in how they lived.)

The first thing to accept is that you're making a generalization. That's fine. There can be some conversational merit in generalizations. The problem is, I don't even agree with the generalization. I'd like to put forward one of my own, which I think is much more accurate. 

Having said that, it's still a generalization, and doesn't apply to everyone. 

I think the first factor women are looking for is not wealth, but being a good provider. Women want to feel safe. They want to feel like they will be provided for, and their children will be provided for. And yes, wealth can represent that, and appeal to those instincts in women. But if a man shows he's capable of providing for her and her children, I don't think wealth is the critical factor in most cases. 

I think there are other factors which can be important. The ability to make a woman laugh. The ability to sing, or play guitar. Being desirable to other women can instinctually make a woman attracted to a man. Being an exceptional athlete. Being mysterious. Frankly, being aesthetically pleasing is extraordinarily important.  

None of these have anything to do with wealth. 

Which isn't to say that some women equate wealth with desirability. That's certainly the case. I just don't believe it's the vast majority as you do. All things being equal, sure, more money means more financial security, but if a man is able to provide for his family without great wealth, that's going to be enough in the vast majority of cases.

But given that it will be a long time before the full details come out, here is the best defense that I have heard - that is at least consistent with (if not slightly supported by) public reports on the matter.

Comey was between a rock and a hard place regarding the initial letter. There was a large enough (or committed enough) cadre of FBI agents angry about the initial decision not to indict that this new development (described only in the abstract) would (likely) be leaked during the election, making the FBI look bad and raising the issue as a speculative unsubstantiated October surprise. So: suppose the leak happens. If Comey followed DOJ policy, he could have clamped down on his agents very hard to minimize the possibility of a leak and stall/not answer - which would lead to attacks on the FBI and complaints from within. Bad for FBI/Public confused/Hearings after election drag out the issue (for FBI/Comey).

Suppose the leak doesn't happen: Then you get angry agents and you WILL get congressional hearings after the fact - that would make the FBI look bad and Comey doesn't want that.

In the case of (DOJ policy-violating) disclosure, the FBI itself just has to live with the political consequences, but isn't dragged into the ""corruption"" or ""rigged"" worries anywhere near as much as they would be in the other cases. Comey and the FBI take less political heat compared to not disclosing, in the long run, despite the disclosure being a stupid STUPID thing to do.

So, while he went against DOJ policy, it wasn't against the letter of the law, he knows that firing him would shift the story away from the mess that lead to this situation (and would be bigger political news than as an indictment - pun intended - against Comey as a leader), and if he isn't fired he must (implicitly at least) have the trust and support of the president.

So, on point 1, the situation within the FBI made particular knowledge moot - it was simply about managing the leak/anger situation. On point 2, he didn't violate any particular law, just advice (as a side note, the DOJ, if they wanted to, presumably could have stopped this and didn't... so it was either within the law or they are also culpable). And on point 3, that's true, but it only would be a firable offense if 3 alone is sufficient to warrant firing, and that seems too strong.

I don't like this, I think Comey ought to resign, and that this was so dumb dumb dumb, but it still might be dumber to fire Comey until this is entirely sorted out, given the mess at the FBI (so... like 2018).

Oh, and why I think this description is at least consistent with reality is Spencer Ackerman in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump?CMP=share_btn_tw)

It would *look* awfully partisan if Obama fired Comey right now. It would seem like he was trying to help Hillary win the election and it would also look like there was some sort of cover up taking place. While it may not be true, it would look that way and it may provide Trump's supporters and disgruntled Republicans something to rally around. In the interest of not getting Trump elected I think Comey should stay on until some time after the election. 

Now I do think that there's a slightly sympathetic case to be made when it comes to Comey's recent actions. There were reports that some people in the FBI were planning to leak information that made it look like there was something on Weiner's computer(s) that made Hillary look bad. I think that Comey, by writing a completely vacuous letter to Congress, successfully reduced the damage that may have occurred if some low-level leaks made it seem like there was something there. Had there been a leak he could not have said that there was nothing there since it would require an investigation to prove it and it would have made him look bad if something came out of it in the future. His letter had its own drawbacks and seems to have affected Hillary's position but think of what could have happened and it doesn't look as bad.

But the Republican Congress is probably the larger setback, given that Obama has pretty much already done what little is possible through executive action. Yet giving up is literally the worst thing to do for a number of reasons:

Firstly: Every. Tonne. Counts. Certainly the 3 to 4 degrees Celsius track that we appear to be on at the moment (with present national commitments) is worse than 1.5 to 2 degrees that the Paris Agreement ""committed"" to, but it's a damn sight better than 7 to 9 degrees under a more lax approach or the 9 to 11 degrees under a 'burn it all' scenario that would likely bring civilisation-ending consequences. 

Secondly, there are many city and state governments that are taking more robust action. This number can and must go up,  and local lobbying can make a substantial difference here. Even with strong action at the federal level the commitment of state and local actors would be required, so it's more than possible for them to go it alone. 

Thirdly, it would take more than American intransigence to blow up the Paris Agreement. There's plenty of countries on board and already talimg stronger action than the USA. One could even make the argument that China is taking stronger action, in terms of emissions intensity reductions (which measure CO2 emissions against economic growth). As mentioned elsewhere, the USA is hardly a world leader on climate change so a Republican victory is not really a global setback. 

So (like with the rest of the Trump platform) there's still plenty worth fighting for, writing letters, donating and protesting for, and making incentives with your own wallet for. "	2.0	0.0	288	False	True	0.0

There's not enough financial/market incentive for steel producers, mines, or most primary and secondary goods producers, to significantly reduce their carbon footprint if it increases the cost of production.  

Carbon taxes attempt to alter market forces to tip scales in favor of greener practices and alternatives.  First it gives companies, products and services that use fewer fossil fuels a leg up against dirtier alternatives.  So let's say a carbon tax makes concrete and steel more expensive, while bamboo and pine are unaffected, which may tip the scales to use greener products in certain situations that used to favor dirtier products.  

Second, it provides a greater financial incentive for companies to innovate and retrofit their factories to be cleaner.  What translates to better environmental outcomes doesn't necessarily translate to good marketing, and vice versa.  A Steel mill switches to passive intercooling, hotspot welding, and yransphonic drifting and a half dozen other small changes that all cost money, but put together add up to significant carbon reductions. These are expensive to implement, so It's really hard to make these investments worthwhile on a commodity product.  Carbon taxes put all industries and factories at the same disadvantage, so they all have to implement changes to their processes, or pay higher taxes."	6.0	0.0	301	False	True	0.0

In particular, there's a very tight balance concerning gun control in the U.S. and for those obsessed with our second amendment.

We also have a third variable, which is Mexico.

A good deal of the reason we don't squeeze for more gun control, is because when you make something illegal or harder to obtain, people seek less legal channels to get what they want. In the case of guns, this is very bad. An illegal gun is not in a registry and accounted for, and is directly a byproduct of harsher gun laws. Normally this would be relatively enforceable but our proximity to Mexico creates problems for us. Since Mexico has a lot of gang and cartel problems they finance their activities selling illegal hardware that is very accessible for American citizens. 

The reason Germany probably doesn't have this issue, is because the surrounding nations probably have less of a financial discrepancy between them. Yes they might not be perfectly the same, but the wealth ratio might be closer to 1:1 than Mexico and the United States which is more like 10:1. This makes it very good for Mexican lawbreakers because selling just a few guns to American buyers gets them a lot of purchasing power in Mexico.

You live in the woods pretty far from any sort of law enforcement and a bear breaks into your house and starts rummaging through your kitchen.  If you don't have a gun, you have pretty much no options in this situation besides hoping the bear doesn't come after you, but with a gun the result is [a dead bear](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grizzly-bear-shot-dead-inside-kimberley-home-1.3185310).

&gt;If a criminal really wants to kill you, usually you won't even have a chance to defend yourself, as sad as it sounds. I mean if the criminal wanted your death, he would just shoot you in case of a gun or just cut open your throat from behind. He could even just take a big stone and smash it into your head. Of course there are also those who will ""bully"" (?) you and only than kill you, but if I'm correctly informed, it's relatively seldom.

The sort of scenario most people picture where they would be dealing with a human usually does not have the good guy with the gun as the primary target.  A common scenario that is brought up are a house break in where the people breaking in are seeking to steal valuables and be gone before being noticed but the [homeowner getting the drop on them](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/cleared_of_criminal_wrongdoing.html) either because they don't know he is home/awake or just because he knows the way around his own house better than them.

&gt;If I got the fact wrong, that people want guns for self-defence, than why are people worrying about ""the bad guys"" having all the guns?

This is where it gets a bit confusing.  Yes, self defense is a commonly listed reason for gun ownership and the people that have this as their primary reason tend to be the loudest, but that is far from the only reason for owning guns.  A much more common reason is people wanting to own guns simply because they intend to use them for hunting or the sport of target shooting.  Each of those on their own are major hobbies in the US that millions of people partake in to some extent.  These people want ease of access to their guns because in is a major part of their culture and leisure time.  In some cases (such as on farms), having guns can be pretty crucial to preventing damage to crops and livestock and in some cases they are used for slaughtering livestock.  Even if you completely take away a self defense scenario from the argument, there would still be many people pretty firm in their stance that guns should be legal.  In my case, I do not ever expect to use a gun in self defense, but I own three guns because target shooting is a major hobby of mine."	2.0	0.0	498	False	True	0.0

Healthcare was extended into remote villages for the first time in Russian history. Diseases like typhus, endemic in the countryside, were virtually eliminated. Illiteracy was eradicated, and living standards rose drastically. 


The Soviet population under Stalin Government wasn't slaves. The workers ran their own newspapers, had the power to elect their own factory managers, and had guaranteed vacation time, privileges unknown in the economically depressed Western world at the time. The Communist government, and Stalin, enjoyed mass support among the population. In about fifteen years, illiterate peasants living in borderline medieval conditions with a 50% infant mortality rate (the majority of the Zarist Russia population) saw a great quantity of their sons and daughters, becoming scientists, doctors, or engineers.

Today, Stalin remains popular in the former USSR. A recent poll put him as the third greatest Russian in history.

You're telling me what you believe, but you're not telling me why.

Well yeah, we're discussing a subjective concept in how you analyze art. If you think authorial intent is important more power to you.

My position comes from a consideration of what is important to me as part of analysis. I find art analysis to me much more enriching and engaging when forcing the text to stand on it's own.

&gt; Here's a counterexample to your assertion that you have no control over the message once it's out there: sometimes, when I'm watching TV, I can't understand what a character is saying due to sound effects or unclear enunciation. There have even been a few times when I've misunderstood what was said badly enough that I actually took the opposite meaning from what was intended (ex: they said ""did"" but I heard ""didn't""). Would you argue that my interpretation of the dialogue is just as valid as the ""correct"" version?

The message was impacted by the sound, and this impacted the audience. Had you not bothered to look up what the original line was you might never had known, yet you would have formed an opinion.

That said, I don't think mishearing a line is the same thing as misinterpreting it. You say that the death of the author does come into play in literature, right? But would you consider a typo in the edition you're reading to be a misinterpretation or not?

&gt; In my opinion, a misinterpretation like that is wrong, and it can be corrected by consulting official scripts/transcripts released by the production team. I argue that this is the same as if I were to consult the stage directions in these scripts because I couldn't tell what emotion an actor was trying to portray, or the meaning of some gesture that was made.

There's something about your steadfast adherence to intent when it comes to plays that's been amusing me for a while now, because you keep bringing up stage directions from the script.

Plays aren't *intended* to be read, they are intended to be watched. You're not supposed to sit there and read along with the cast.

The script informs the performance, it isn't some kind of ultimate authority on the play. If, for example, an actor changes a line for a specific audience (like by making a local reference) that changes how the audience might react to it. Are you arguing that in this case the audience should not pay attention to the performance or something?"	2.0	0.0	435	False	True	10.0

2) They are not weighed the same and I am not sure why you think they would be. Sports achievements are weighed at a high priority by the sports faculty at the University when they are determining who to try and recruit and offer their allotments of scholarships to. But the physics or English departments do not really give any weight to those activities for who they try and recruit and give their scholarships to. So far as general admittance is concerned they simply want you to be active in some kind of activity other than pure academics so as to show that you are capable of functioning outside of just academia.  

Edit: Also universities give a lot of scholarships for music, acting, art, and every other subject that they teach. Every department gets budgets for them to use for scholarships, in addition to the general academic scholarships that the University gives out separate from departments, and there are also a lot of private scholarships funded by alumni and fundraising.

I couldn't care less what sex or race the lead in a film has, as long as it's good. However, it's clear by the reviews that many people do care. 

I think for a lot of women specifically, the movie represents their struggle to be viewed as equals in the entertainment industry. We have been pumping out super hero movies by the truck load, and they consistently tell the same stories and showcase strong male leads with females always being assigned a supporting role. 

WW may follow the general formula for it's plot and action, but it's the behind the scenes progress that really have people lauding it so heavily. Just like how Pine and Gadot learn to view one another as equal partners, females want to be viewed as equals in the movie industry. Is WW woman a fantastic film that should make you cry due to how powerful it is? Definitely not, but it broke convention regarding it's director and lead (and unlike Ghost Busters, it actually performed very well). People love this film not just because of it's casting and direction, but because it represents female lead productions finally being viewed as equal to the current standard of film-making. 

As a result, the director now has more political capital to produce more big budget films, and whether or not WW is good when viewed in a vacuum, it sold enough tickets to show the industry that people are craving more female lead and directed projects. So the industry will stop viewing female lead films as being such a gamble. The ultimate goal being that we stop viewing films as being ""normal"" or ""female lead"" and instead just as films."	38.0	0.0	290	False	True	2.0

It's not so much about plot, but about character development.  Several characters evolve over the trilogy, but each film also has its mini character arcs. 

FOTR - It's all about Frodo wrestling with the shitty reality of having to be the Ring Bearer even though he'd rather live in peace and obscurity: ""I wish none of this had happened.""  So Gandalf says, ""So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide.  All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.""

Thematically and for Frodo's character, FOTR is about accepting a major responsibility and sacrificing your personal desires for a greater good.  In the end, that also means sacrificing friendships (the Fellowship).  Sam sticks around because Frodo also learns he can't do everything by himself.

TTT - This one is about hope, and the dangers of losing it during tough times.  This is the darkest part of the trilogy because everything is turning against the heroes.  Some would argue Aragorn is the ""main"" character of TTT because he has the most screen time.  But I would argue his arc doesn't change much in this one (we'll get to him later).  Here are the characters who best represent the theme of TTT, in my opinion:

* Theoden - He's lost hope not just in his country, but in himself.  In the end, he realizes that victory is still possible.

* Legolas/Elrond - They've lost hope in Men (to use Tolkien's word and capitalization scheme).  They think they're weak, which leads to Legolas' conflict with Aragorn.  But then they make up and Elrond sends the Elves come to help Men and stand against evil together.  

* Sam - He has no hope in Gollum to begin with, while Frodo does.  Over the course of the film, and somewhat begrudgingly, Sam eventually wants to establish an understanding with Gollum.  Sam talks about the film's main themes in a great monologue in Osgiliath.  He realizes he's being a dick and it's hurting the Mission, so he extends the olive branch to Gollum.  Little does he know, Gollum is going to totally sell them out.  But Sam's arc was still completed.

* Faramir - He's an extension of Boromir in that he's the personification of ""Man"" - greedy, wants the easy way out, etc.  He's lost hope in himself too, if he ever had any.  The Ring is his way of rising above his shitty station in life.  But he realizes that he needs to trust Frodo and have faith in the Mission.  He rights Boromir's wrongs.

In the end, all the characters lose hope and then gain it back again, even if it's only a little bit or if there's still danger ahead.

And ROTK is about a whole bunch of these characters coming to the end of their arcs.  This film is about how underdogs can be heroes too.  Again I see a few ""main"" ones at the forefront:

* Aragorn - We get teased about his returning to the throne and all that, but that's never a real possibility until Elrond shows up and offers him Anduril.  Aragorn is such a badass that he doesn't seem like an underdog, but in the context of the story he very much is.  He leads Men on a suicide mission and eventually becomes King.  He never had faith in himself, but everyone else did.  Eventually, he believes in himself too (except a troll nearly kills him which was fucking lame).

* Merry/Pippin/Eowyn - These guys get shit on for most of the movie but each prove to be big heroes.  We've already seen Legolas/Gimli prove themselves so that's just fun.  But watching these characters come into their own is really satisfying.  You don't need to have seen the previous two versions to understand and empathize with them - especially Eowyn and Merry.  

I'm missing a whole bunch of stuff.  But I think the films stand on their own as 

* (1) I get by with a little help from my friends
* (2) Never give up hope; and
* (3) ""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future""

The firing of Priebus and Spicer is being seen as a huge blow to the 'GOP establishment' in the Trump administration. (Priebus is personal friends with Paul Ryan, and is a bridge to House members)

This is highly problematic for a few reasons:

-The GOP establishment, while maybe not the greatest statesmen in history, are an important counterweight to the... how do you say... nativist wing of the GOP, within the Trump administration. Granted the GOP administration is not the only counter weight, there are I would argue two others, the generals, and Jared/Ivanka. Now, I think most people (including you, I gather from your post) would like to see as many checks on the Bannon wing as possible, these two both have major issues. Trump's reliance on generals is a huge breach of the norms of civil/military relations, and with Jared/Ivanka you have problems with charges of nepotism. So my basic thesis is that both of these important checks on the ethnic nationalists in the administration are somewhat precarious, if the heat against the number of generals, or nepotism increase, we could see these groups sidelined. So a president would stregthen the GOP establishment, which while unexciting for a progressive, is much better than the Bannon wing. 

-Better foreign relations, no twitter diplomacy

-Much lower chance of winning re-election. People who say Trump will never win re-election need to look at base rates, a large majority of presidents of run for a second term win, however Pence seems to lack the political ability and support from the Trump base necessary to win 2020. 

-May encourage bipartisanship in the legislative. Most people, I think, would agree that the legislative works best when parties work together, compare GOP legislative under Clinton, to Debt ceiling incident under Obama. Right now, working with the Trump administration is a poisoned chalice for democrats, they'd get flayed in the media for any 'pro trump' voting, even if the bill had nothing to do with trump (see the thing on 538 that tries to measure which senators are more pro trump than expected). If the GOP manage to distance themselves from Trump, then the legislature can finally start to work again. 

-My last, and I think the biggest point: It will be a fundamental discrediting of Trump style politics. The accusation of any candidate being 'Trump-like' will be a death knell for their political viability, if Trump is vilified like Nixon was after Watergate. The GOP will lose 2020, as discussed above, and they will have to have a serious rethink of the direction their party has been going. 

Or Trump either wins, or comes sufficiently close to winning in 2020 (remember base rates), and it appears as though appealing to nativist tribalism is still a viable (or, worse *the viable*) political strategy for the GOP."	29.0	0.0	480	False	True	0.0

I think your view of ""anti-SJWs"" gets locked into a very specific (and possibly stereotypical) view of people who critique social justice movements. 

To find the value of people who criticize social justice warriors, let's try to find a rough historical approximation. This is an oversimplification, but when feminism flourished in the 1970s, it was largely dominated by well-educated, middle class white women. Intellectuals such as bell hooks would challenge a number of their assertions and the implicit assumptions that many of them made. For example, early feminists might say they wanted the same rights as a man, but they didn't mean a black man or a native American man. Through these efforts, the movement changed and evolved to widen its scope to race, class, etc. (I'm speaking very broadly here, so take this with a lot of salt). 

But I'm trying to lead to this question: would these types of critics fall into the category of ""anti-SJW"" or ""SJW""? Can they really be the former, if they were later absorbed by the movement they critiqued? And can they really be the latter, if they were such outspoken critiques in the first place? I think one of the biggest flaws of your post is looking at SJWs and anti-SJWs as two separate groups in total opposition and completely set in their ways.

* Right and pleasant
* Right but unpleasant
* Wrong but pleasant
* Wrong and unpleasant

Even if you disagree on what is right or wrong on the spectrum of left or right, civility is a whole separate dimension. You don't become pleasant just by being right and by the same token you aren't unpleasant by default if you're wrong. 

I would postulate that being a SJW or Anti-SJW is a separate item from being a decent human being. Sure, individuals are often whipped into a frenzy and become rabid for a cause, but being indoctrinated into an ideology does not perpetuate individuals to become assholes. 

Basically, reverse your thinking. People aren't assholes because they are SJW/Anti-SJW. People that are assholes get labeled SJW/Anti-SJW. Normal people are just left or right leaning individuals with different ways of thinking."	8.0	0.0	201	False	True	0.0

The SJW’s are mostly representative of a parent figure (a parent to society) though some consume the very thing they claim to be against (video games/movies feat sexism/violence).  They’re representing positions that are mostly moral and societal based.  Essentially, they know what’s best/worst for us (in simplistic terms). So, if we look at the SJW’s role as the parent, then through that same lens, the Anti-SJW’s represent the kids of those parents.  The Anti-SJW’s are roles represented mostly of consumers. One could argue that because SJW’s have swayed companies/people in the past, that a voice is needed to represent the other side of the coin.  There’s more that can be said to describe the Anti’s including the SJW’s but I think the point’s been made. So, It’s because of these differences that I believe it’s unfair to consider them both the same.  	4.0	0.0	151	False	True	0.0

So a pig would prefer that I not stab it, rather than I stab it. He argues that if you have the proviso, then you derive rights for animals from a utilitarian perspective. What is wrong with that argument? It seems like you just take animals not having rights as some axiom. Where do rights come from?

If there is more space, why build up or down, when you can build sideways? That, plus the fact that the automobile was developed alongside several American cities, means they were designed to be more car accessible and less public transportation. 

&gt; People here have to get around by car, and as a result are fatter and live shorter lives than the average European. Our unhealthiness contributes to our under-productivity.

It’s not that simple. You have to figure in the choices America made regarding a social safety net, and the effects of wealth inequality in America. Japan for example, has much lower productivity per hour, but has a better average public health. And it can’t be because of driving vs. not driving, because most people in Japan use trains, cars, or non-walking/biking forms of transportation to commute. You are leaving out the factor of diet, which somewhat relates again to the geography. It’s hard to have healthy fish dishes for example, when you are far from a large body of water.

This is the last one of your comments that struck me, and where I’m going to disagree the most. The reason why the average European city has more history, is because they’ve existed for hundreds of years longer. By the time America started getting settled, Europe was steeped in history. You can’t artificially add history into a city, and I think comparing a city with a 400 year history, and one with a 100 year history, is a bit of an exercise in futility.

I find this comment curious. I suspect we're both basing our perspectives on anecdotal evidence (I know I am), but I haven't found your statement to be true at all in my own experience. As someone who has lived in multiple states and many very different cities, I've been surprised by how easy it is to find historical/cultural places even in tiny towns. I used to live in a town of 8,000 - a poor, blue collar, struggling community - there were historical markers and monuments all over town. We're talking dozens of monuments that I just stumbled upon in a town you could drive all the way through in &lt;2 min, and they were mostly unrelated to war/battles at all. The bigger cities I've lived in have had even more historical and cultural attractions. When I lived in the South, yes, there were plenty of Confederate monuments, etc., but those were FAR from dominant. My point is that - as it's currently presented - it sounds like you might be indulging in some confirmation bias when you compare European cities to US cities. How are you concluding that US cities have so few monuments? Are you making an educated guess based on what you remember seeing or are you actively looking for all the historical places in any given city? I imagine it also depends on where you live and travel.

There's something called the agent-principal problem. As long as the agent knows things that the principal doesn't then there's no way to ensure that the agent is really acting in the best interests of the principal how the principal would define it.

Just having positive values and wanting to benefit humankind doesn't mean that they will be doing things in a way that's acceptable to us. For example, the AI might decide that removing someone from the house might be beneficial to humanity as a whole because of some unexpressed genetic predisposition to violence. You know, something that looks really bad but we should just trust it even though we're sacrificing one innocent person for the greater good. Or, it might just be a bug that develops in the code and that sacrifice and suffering is really unnecessary. We, as average persons, can't tell the difference between those two cases.

As it stand, we are operating on a premise that permits some crime to prevent unjust punishments on the innocent that's only partially successful. The AI might err on the other side, taking the line that preventative punishment is acceptable or even a positive good. I, personally, don't want to be in that world. But, if the benevolent and (mostly) positive AIs decide otherwise then would it even be possible to accommodate me or would I have to be removed? Consistency and predictable results are essential to a properly functioning legal system. I have to know that something is illegal in order to avoid it and if something is illegal but unenforced then I have to know that as well. If I do something and the legal response is not at all what I expect then we have a problem. The preventative function of punishment isn't working, or the arbitrary enforcement has signaled me bad information or whatever. Very often pursuing two strategies spoils both.

But, on a deeper level, this looks like a ""enlightened despotism"" argument. That if you have an enlightened and just ruler who has literally all the power and authority and no one can get in the way then that's the best government. As long as the ruler is perfect and infallible and just then I guess the argument works... but it doesn't work in practice for a variety of reasons. One of the big ones is that people rip those systems apart even if they are right but don't communicate how and why they are right in a way that the average person buys. But the big reason I'm against those systems and will be forever is that it requires perfection. We will never have perfection. An infinite number of AI generations won't get us to perfection, and what is ""right"" will be constantly changing. At best, we'll have an AI that's chasing an ever-shifting mix of needs and values that overshoots one way before correcting the other way. At worst, the AI screws up (probably because a person screwed up) and we're stuck in a regular old despotic political system.

I prefer separated powers. The sort of thing that requires compromise and an acknowledgement that those involved aren't perfect and are representing different acceptable paths forward. The more power reserved for the individual to make the decision that's right for them the better. This often isn't what's best for humanity, but we can get pretty close by manipulating it through taxation and regulation."	5.0	0.0	575	False	True	2.0

My male friends don't do any of that. That is more specific to each persons social setting.

-----------------------------------------------------

I don't know if annoying is the right word here. An annoyance is more of an inconvenience some of your problems with men seem to be more than an annoyance. Some of do seem to be annoyances and I will focus on them.

&gt;Furthermore, as I said I have male friends, but it's only with my female friends I feel comfortable talking about more personal issues.

This really depends on the friendship but many guys value friendships as escapes from problems rather than direct support. Guy friends are less likely to talk about personal issues and more likely to provide a means of escape from those issues. I may be a stereotypical guy but most of the time male friendship helps me a lot more than female friendship. Most problems I can solve myself and all I need is to release pressure, hanging out with guy friends helps me do this more than support offered by female friends. 

Despite this being more common among guys doesn't mean guys cannot or will not provide support and let you talk about personal issues. 

&gt; Plus when with the guys it can get annoying as I'm not out as trans and they can tease me in a friendly way for being effeminate using the gay slur. I know it's not meant to be hurtful, but I really disagree with using gay or anything similar as an insult even a teasing insult or whatever.

This is something you should talk to them about. I don't know your situation or age but that is generally unacceptable to men. 


&gt;It can also get annoying as they talk about women sexually...a lot, with the girls they do talk about guys, but talk about relationships, relationship issues etc. Stereotypical I know, but this is my experience.

This is more of a preference when it comes to annoyance. My friends and I don't talk about women sexually a lot, but I don't think I could stand constant talk about their relationship troubles. That is not something I want our general topics of conversation to be about. 

I think maturity comes into play here again, again I don't know how old you and your friends are, but constant sexual talk about women is more of a teens early 20's kind of talk. It also hints at sexist behavior.

  


&gt; It can also be annoying as they are in general a lot more crude, rude and well laddish 

I think this is fair but again more personal taste. "	12.0	0.0	470	False	True	0.0

Idling consumes a [negligible amount of fuel](https://energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-861-february-23-2015-idle-fuel-consumption-selected-gasoline-and-diesel-vehicles). If you drive a large sedan, you are looking at about .4 gallons per hour. Assuming that you spend 5 minutes idling per trip, so 10 minutes per day, that means you ""waste"" a gallon of gas every 15 work days. Assuming $2.50 a gallon and 250 work days per year (50 weeks, 5 days per), that $41.67 per year idling.

Point 2: 

Turned off cars don't have heat, A/C, or radio. Creature comforts are worth a certain amount of money, and $42 per year seems like a good price.

Point 3:

Its not safe. A turned off car can't move. If there is an emergency vehicle or an accident or something that you need to respond to quickly, you can't. You are effectively leaving an inoperable vehicle in the middle of the road.

Point 5:

If you wanted to say that 'race' is a social construct descriptor, you'd have to say what term is used to refer to the biological traits that we typically think of as defining 'race'.  If you don't have this second term to break down the difference between biology and personality/history, then the term 'race' continues to cover both and is therefore not purely a construct.

That said, people often use 'culture' in the way you are trying to use race (see: 'culturally jewish'), and use 'race' to refer to biological traits in the way we use 'sex'.

So, while you're correct that we theoretically *could* disassociate the biological and social aspects of the word 'race' into two different terms, one of them being purely a social construct, the fact is that the word 'race' is not currently defined this way, and if we *did* use two words to dissociate these concepts, it's more likely that 'race' would refer to the biological traits and we'd use some other word for the social construct concept."	50.0	0.0	212	False	True	0.0

Not quite.  Gender is not divorced from the circumstances of ones birth, nor from ones biology.  People's gender and sex are correlated but it's not 1 to 1 (this is setting aside other cultural conceptions of third genders) because there are many other factors involved.

&gt;Why, then, should race be different than gender? If race carries with it ""shared experience"" and ""lived experience"", etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that, I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance, overbearing &amp; strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 
&gt;
&gt;But, if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender, then why can't someone identify as a different race?

The main reason that this is considered so taboo is that changing ones race can sometimes be seen as dismissing or ignoring the shared cultural struggles of a racial group. Rachel Dolezal wasn't considered offensive because she ""identified as black"", it was that she was changing what is generally considered an immutable characteristic linked to cultural experiences, many if which are negative. 

To put it simply, I bet there were a lot of black (or mixed race) people during slavery or the Jim crow era that wished they could identify as white, but they didn't have that luxury.  Even today black people in America face all kinds of adversity.  Rachel Dolezal minimized that kind of suffering by essentially joining a group without paying the price, for lack of a good way to phrase it. 

If there are people who ""identify"" as a different race, I would have to look more into the issue before forming a stronger opinion about how they should be regarded because I'm not totally sure what Kinds of factors would cause that.  But if it does turn out that being ""trans racial"" is a thing, and there is some kind of ""race dysphoria"", then I'd be totally for finding effective ways to help them, even if it means ""transitioning"".  At the moment, though, there is no evidence that that's the case, so it just looks like somebody is minimizing the struggle of black people by deciding what race they want to be. 

**edit:** Many people have replied to this comment by essentially saying that I'm claiming black people have it worse than women and that's why I think being ""trans-racial"" is worse.  To clarify, I do not think either is worse. The nature of oppression experienced by black people is rooted in a specific history. Not just a history of oppression, but a specific, traceable history, which is why I think it is different than the oppression experienced by women in general (you could make an argument that certain groups of women have specific, traceable oppression, though). My point here wasn't to try and convince everybody that one is worse than the other, just that there is a difference between how oppression relates to racial identity and how it relates to gender identity, and that that difference is likely a part of what causes such distinct reactions. It has nothing to do with something being socially constructed or not, as in the OP."	210.0	0.0	570	False	True	0.0

Social constructionism is one of these areas. So is race.

Gender is not really a social construct. Yes, there are *elements* of gender that are social constructs, but it a complicated topic. Let's start with what it isn't. I keep seeing this meme about ""sex"" being biological and ""gender"" being psychological and social, as if those things are mutually exclusive. People confuse ""biological"", ""physiological"", and confuse ""genetic"" and ""unchangeable"", and confuse ""psychological"" and ""social construct"". Both your physiology and psychology are largely biological, are mostly genetic, and much of society and culture is an emergent property of our biological tendencies. And our biology, psychology, personalities, and behaviours include portions that are from the environment around us, even moment by moment, and that environment includes social environment, which is in large part fed by our biological tendencies. To try to decouple these as being independent is madness, and ""social construct"" does not mean ""arbitrary"" or ""infinitely maleable"".

Let's take a specific example: women wearing lipstick. Clearly we have no genes for lipstick. Clearly lipstick is a social construct. It didn't come from nature and we didn't evolve with it, right? Sure. Yes. But if we removed all traces of lipstick, of ever wearing lipstick, eliminated it from our memories, and started societies over from an amnesiatic state, we'd reinvent lipstick, it would be women wearing it, and it would tend to be shades of red.

Why? Because of *why* we invented lipstick in the first place. It's because red lipstick on women's lips triggers an innate response in men that women want. Why? Because male mammals (especially primates) evolved an attraction and arousal response to seeing engorged red lips on females and we human males still have that instinctual response. OK, it's the wrong lips, but our arousal mechanism isn't a cognitive decision. It is a simple trigger.

It's like chocolate cake. We didn't evolve with cake. We invented it (a social construct) because it fed an innate response that we did evolve for sweet tastes, because high sugar/calories were rare and valuable in nature. When quick and easy calories were scarce for us, it improved our survivability and reproductive success. In an era where we have an abundance of quick and easy calories, that same innate response is bad for our health. We don't *decide* to want to eat it; it just tastes really good to do us and most people have cravings for high sugar foods (i.e., a ""sweet tooth"").

Lipstick feeds a similar desire. Men innately respond to women with red, pouty lips. Women innately (statistically) want to attract men as mates/partners and so do the things that attract them. Some of this is also innate (via sexual selection), and some of it is pattern recognition of what works (memetic/cultural evolution).

Women don't have the same innate attraction triggers. They don't tend to be aroused by red, engorged lips on men because males don't have body parts that this would arouse. This is why a new society would tend to re-invent lipstick, why women would wear it, and why it would tend to be shades of red.

(There are plenty of exceptions, but they aren't *statistically* significant and tend to come from other properties of humans. E.g., women wearing other shades like blue or dark black are exhibiting counter-culture and most men would not see them as attractive as wearing red lipstick. Some men wear lipstick in some rituals or activities, but again it's not regular, not the same cause, and not statistically significant in comparison. Also, it's not necessarily just red, but body tone shades that appear like blood has engorged the lips, which can vary by skin tone. 

Now, everything I just described about lipstick could be factually incorrect. I have no intention of presenting a scientific case for as this isn't a post about lipstick. Rather, I've used this case as an example of how genes, biology, psychology, and social behaviour interact with each other.

Wearing red lipstick very much a part of the female gender behaviour. It is a social *behaviour* that is rooted in our biology, rooted in sexual selection between males and females, and is a stable behaviour. It is associated with a female biological sex, corresponding to having vaginal lips, and corresponding to males being attracted to it. Just because there are a subset of exceptions to this does not change that because genes aren't like programs that dictate an exact response; they are more like subroutines that interact with other subroutines that are aggregated, usually aligned with each other, but not always for a variety of reasons.

Race is different. Biologically speaking, race comes from groups of humans that evolved in separate geographic locations for long enough to show some physical (and possibly psychological) differences. 

A ""perfect"" division of people into races could hypothetically happen if they all only reproduced within the same isolated groups for long enough. If you were to plot the statistical distribution of their features it would look like a series of mountain peaks with valleys below -- all of one race in one distribution associated with the geographic location and ancestry -- and few individuals or none with features between two ""races"". (The ""valley"" between the peaks.)

It isn't necessary for them to be completely isolate though, as long as the gene flow was a small enough percentage of the group they would still evolve statistical differences. The more they interbred, the more those peaks would become lower, the width of the distribution ""hill"" would widen, and those valleys would raise, creating ""undulating hills"" of distributions of traits.

Since global travel started growing, we see more and more of that, but we do still see a lot of homoegenous regions and subcultures in multicultural societies that mate only with others of their same ""kind"". That keeps the hills from flattening out completely, but they will tend toward continual erosion into one large, flat, mixed race eventually.

None of that is social construction so far.

We also have genetic tendencies though. One is ingroup/outgroup tribalism. We don't have genes for racism, nationalism, or similar group separations; what we have is a genetic tendency toward identifying which ""tribe"" we belong to and who belongs to other ""tribes"". We do this for mathematical reasons of our history. There is safety and value in numbers vs being a lone individual, particularly in certain environments as far as food, mating, and predators. In times of scarcity, if there are too many people fighting over too little resources, there's value in ganging up -- two people taking the food of one person and splitting it is better than both going hungry. But only to a point. Too big a group means fighting again for the resources. There is a maximum size for the group based on available resources. That leaves some people as rejected out of the group. Their best interests are to form another group to fight back against those taking things from them. Gang war, basically. Chimpanzees do this, as do humans.

You can trigger ingroup/outgroup tribalist behaviour very easily by identifying people into groups and putting those groups in conflict, e.g., using eye colour from [Jane Elliott's classroom experiment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201012/in-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds), random assignment to groups as in the [Robbers Cave Experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html), or any random thing: favorite sports team, city, country, language, political leanings, Android vs iOS, Coke vs Pepsi, etc. This has been repeated thousands of times and is well modeled, such as by [Realistic Conflict Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory). You see it triggered all the time with even simple insults like ""black criminality"" or ""white privilege"", which includes both tribe identifiers (skin colour) and a conflict between groups by throwing insults aimed at all people of that skin colour. That creates hatred immediately out of nowhere.

What does that have to do with race? Well, physical features are an obvious grouping that people can easily define ""tribes"" based on, combined with familiarity and relatedness, so people tend to congregate more, and live around, people of their own race. That's why you get ""Little Italy"" and ""Chinatown"" areas of cities. 

And, *culture* tends to be of similar nature of geographic location. Ergo there is a tight correlation between race, ethnicity, and culture. But there is no particular reason for them to go hand in hand. An Asian child brought up in a mostly black neighbourhood will tend toward the local culture, and vice versa. Culture is what we grow up around, not about race or ethnicity. There is no ""white culture"" or ""black culture"" or ""Asian culture"". There is, however, culture from regions and neighbourhoods that tend to be statistically more one race than another because of our groupish tendencies, not inherently due to race.

So these are different causes, and different from gender. Most of it is biological but huge social factors that combine a bunch of our innate tendencies, and the creation of correlations that we tend to recognize as patterns and associate together. So sometimes people mean physical features when they say ""race"", and sometimes they mean cultural features, the latter being correlative and less accurate. The former is not a social construct per se, the latter sort of is. And, the boundaries between races are fuzzy and getting fuzzier.

These are complex topics that too many people try to oversimplify.

The frustrating truth is that every ""social construct"" is unique and some may have a closer correlation with natural circumstance than others. I think this dilemma stems from a false equivalence between these two concepts that have critically essential nuances that differentiate them.

I've always thought of ""gender"" as a set of behavioral characteristics that, for the most part, correlate with natal sex. There *is* a biological basis for this association, and that is brain structure. We, humans, know that there are structural differences between male and female brains that, for the most part, correlate with natal sex. Sorry for the repetitive sentences, but my point is that your behavioral characteristics and your thoughts are all a result of something very physical, your brain. Gender Identity Disorder occurs when the structure of one's brain more resembles that of the opposite sex than natal sex: it is a medically recognized condition with a secure method of treatment; plenty of research is available via Google. Based on this, it seems reasonable to say that gender is the ""sex of the brain,"" which is capable of being opposite from the genetic trait of sex, albeit a rare occurrence. By this definition, a ""social construct"" is not even necessary to explain the concept of gender and the occurrence of transgender people.

Many people are conflating actual transgenderism with different personality disorders and what I'll call ""special snowflake-ism,"" which seems to be exclusive to people who grew up in the digital age. Many people tend to hyperfocus on the single trait of gender, resulting in people claiming to be Nth gender; they are mistakenly associating their unique personality traits with their gender.

It is also important to remember that gender dysphoria is not exclusive to transgenderism, which is why there are, and should be, many hoops for those claiming to be transgender to jump through before making any serious decisions. It's not as simple as saying, ""I'm the other gender now!"" There is an institutional ""skepticism,"" so to speak, to keep it from being that simple.

The issue of ""transracialism"" is not comparable because there is no ""race of the mind"" to come into conflict with the genetic characteristic of race; or, at least, this has no scientific basis. The concept of a ""race of the mind"" seems to coincide more with the cultural experience of growing up as a part of a certain race. Of course, its silly to pretend you are a part of a culture that you are not, regardless of skin color. As far as I'm aware, and do correct me if I am wrong, it would be impossible to discern skin color from observing a brain scan, unless you were to make an assumption based on common mental conditions within a demographic, but that's ultimately beside the point.

It seems to me that ""transracialism"" is nothing more than another attempt by people with weak self-identities to find a new, exciting label for themselves. Unfortunately, this type of culture-hijacking and self-diagnosis behavior gets conflated with genuine transgenderism, which is a studied and well understood medical condition.

In short, nuance nuance nuance.

As an aside, why are we always hyper-focusing on arbitrary physical traits? Who cares? We are all humans, meant to be individual and real to ourselves, not our genetic traits. We should not be so obsessed with these characteristics that we forget to see the humanity in others *and* ourselves."	5.0	0.0	589	False	True	0.0

Barack Obama was born in 1961 into a world where racism was baked into law and custom.

Just googled a bit, and I saw that infidelity primary definition is different in french and english. In english, it's quite simple, it's having sex with someone who is not your husband / wife / regular partner. In french, it's the ""Lack of respect for a given commitment"". 

&gt; It would be better if this was discussed with openness instead of men or women going behind their partners backs

Given my definition, only the ""behind their back"" is a case of infidelity, as in the 1st case, you can do whatever you want in your relationship as long as both partners agree on it.

Anyway, that was for in introducting a bit what I understand of the word ""infidelity"". As for the reasons why these are seen as really bad, I think that's because : 

* It break trust.

A couple is ""normally"" based on honnesty and discussions to take the better decisions and compromise for a good life together. When cheating, you're telling your partner ""Ok, but when something is not good for me, I'll do whatever I want behind your back and not talk to you"". This is quite a heavy blow on the other partner for its expectations toward the relationship future.

* It make the cheated partner take sexual risks he wasn't aware of.

When you have sex, there is always a risk of STD, that you can control if you are in a exclusive relationship, but can't if one have extra conjugal relationship. Even with protections, you can catch something, and you're putting your partner at risk without telling him/her, what is pretty jerkish toward someone you're engaged and supposed to love.

* Social stigmata

Finally, most communities are seeing infidelity as a stigmata. Sometimes, it can be even worse for the one that has been cheated on, that for the cheater. Cheating on your partner put him/her in a position where he/she can suffer for a big social stigmata, and you did that only for your carnal pleasure. Once more, pretty jerkish move."	1.0	0.0	358	False	True	0.0

 * Distancing characters from comic books. Comics have a reputation of being complicated to buy into - you have to track down old stories to get the full continuity, fans tend not to be very casual, plots are complex and span weeks, etc. The new movies are designed so that even if you've never heard of a franchise you can watch any of them and you're usually fine. Breaking from the comic-book aesthetics is a way to signal this to potential audiences.

 * Live action action scenes inherently look better to most. While you can achieve better expressiveness, extravagance and precision with animation, there's something more appealing in live action, because you can more easily place yourself in the building that's being destroyed or on the street being flooded with lava.

 * Many modern superhero films attempt (to varying degrees of success) to make their characters human. I think this is also done to widen the appeal of the characters to people who'd rather view superpowers as a metaphor, or who are more interested in a human story. This is obviously easier to do when people are live shot.

I generally agree with you that by shifting to animated superhero films, studios could focus more of their time and money on story, character and aesthetics, and we'd end up with a potentially better result, but I think this has many drawbacks for the non-comic-literate general public, and that's why they don't choose this path."	17.0	0.0	269	False	True	0.0

Is this how folks have *actually dealt with allegations*? Or is this just something you're afraid of?

I would urge you to reflect on a few things: Did Louis CK respond to a few rumors? Did Harvey Weinstein get ousted from his position after one or two allegations, or did it take more than that? Did Al Franken step down after one story, or several corroborating stories? Did Roy Moore drop out after one story, did anyone in his party call him out after the single story?
&gt;Part of the problem is that many of these people are being fired 1-2 days after allegations come out

Really? I haven't seen *anything* of the kind. I have seen slow, almost deadly-slow action taken after several allegations come out. From your OP:
&gt;this seems like a scary path to go down.

Frankly, I'm not seeing this, and I haven't seen any rational analysis that would support this. I don't even think we can say with certainty that the spate of recent allegations-and-repercussions are anything but a media trend. I wish we could. I believe that *if* we could, we could also begin to talk about some of what you're pointing to here: what kind of accountability we want to see; what kinds of allegations should be taken most seriously; how best to corroborate allegations like this. But right now, most of what's coming out is serial harassers who have gone ~~unnoticed~~ unnaccountable *for years or decades*.

Institutions are fairly resilient against change. They have permitted (or encouraged) sexual harassment within their structures *for decades*. There is no reason to believe that the current attention focused on the issue will change this state of affairs in the slightest. That is, I think your fears here are misplaced, and/or mis-timed. *If* national attention remains focused on this stuff, *if* we can institute some lasting changes to the ways we have encouraged and permitted this shit, *then* we can talk about how best to deal with the stuff.

I've put a lot of thought into the distinction between subjective and objective, and I hope I can convince you that musical quality is an entirely subjective experience.

**Is quality a measure of the producer's skill?**

You say: 

&gt;Music quality can be determined roughly by the question ""If I were to sit down with an instrument (guitar,piano,midi keyboard, DAW, etc.) for 30 minutes, would I be able to make this song?""

This seems to suggest that you would measure quality of music based on the difficulty of producing that music. I'll bet that a brief consideration of your favorite music will put that idea to rest. I don't have the technical experience to produce most of the mixes and distinct timbres that I hear in hip hop music, and yet I love Bach's Prelude #1 from The Well Tempered Clavier, incredibly simple though it may be. I value that first prelude (and other ultra-simple pieces like The Merry Peasant, Clapping Music, or many two-part inventions) over half the grand orchestral works I hear, even though the orchestral works took orders of magnitude more effort to produce.

**Is quality a measure of innovation?**

You say:

&gt;How much of this song is just a copy of some melodic ideas that someone else already explored before? How much is just copy paste from standard western music theoretical frameworks?

This suggests a different standard: that musical quality should be measured by how unique the piece is, and how much it diverges from past frameworks. This, of course, means throwing out Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc, each of whom were firmly steeped in the musical traditions of their past (and even saw themselves this way. Mozart, for example, saw his music as merely an attempt to slightly improve on Haydn.) This would also mean that *avant-garde* music would very obviously always be the best quality, no contest. I don't think most listeners would back up that point of view.

**Is quality a measure of planning?**

You say:

&gt;Could I improvise this song? Or better yet, did the person basically improvise this song? 

This suggests a third standard: that the quality of music is determined by how well-planned the performance is. Again, I think a brief review of music would show this to be false. Expert jazz improvisations seem to be much more moving, exciting, interesting, and passionate than a lot of boring-but-well-planned string quartets. 

**Wrap-up: What is subjective?**

Altogether, let me suggest to you that scrambling between different objective standards is a dead giveaway of subjectivity. Yes, you're right that there a ""Can be an objective nature"" to music quality, but with such vague language, this observation could be applied to absolutely any subjective measurement. There ""can be an objective nature"" to the question of which ice cream is tastiest. There ""can be an objective nature"" to which Gilligan's Island character is 'the best'. But by any reasonable split of what is  'subjective' and what is 'objective', these things are best classified as subjective. And so is musical quality.

I'm guessing you are more of a loner than a social person. If so, this would account for why you see such differences between people who prefer to be alone and people who are more group-oriented. The idea of in-group heterogeneity says that people believe their own groups consist of people with varied characteristics who are not all that similar to each other. Here, you aren't talking about being a member of a group. But if you identify as more of a loner, then you likely fall victim to this bias when thinking about other loners.

Since this latter one is better defined and more widely known than the detailed ideas in the field of psychology, I'll use it to illustrate. 

MBTI says that people can be characterized on 4 axes (text copied from the MB website). 

There's a lot of controversy about the usefulness of these *specific* four axes... but the point remains that people are different in more ways than liking to be alone or not. 

&gt;Favorite world: Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world? This is called Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I).

This is basically the axis that you focus on in your view. Yes, some people are energized by being in groups, while other people prefer to rest by themselves. 

But it's important to note that this is an *axis* not a binary. You can be in the middle, and in fact, most people are not at the extremes of this axis, but prefer some alone time and some time with people, with only the *amounts* varying. 

But there are other personality type axes that you can recognize if you really look at people and try to understand them: 

&gt;Information: Do you prefer to focus on the basic information you take in or do you prefer to interpret and add meaning? This is called Sensing (S) or Intuition (N).

Surely you have met some people who are ""just the facts Ma'am"" types, vs. people that don't care that much about facts but like to go on intuition. An example would be scientific people vs. some kinds of religious people, for example. These are huge differences in world view and personality. 


&gt;Decisions: When making decisions, do you prefer to first look at logic and consistency or first look at the people and special circumstances? This is called Thinking (T) or Feeling (F).

Again, I'm sure that you've found that some people are more interested in logic, and that some other people are more interested in feelings. Stereotypically, this is a divide between men and women, but of course both sexes have these focii to different degrees even if there might be a cultural reason for a statistical difference. 

&gt;Structure: In dealing with the outside world, do you prefer to get things decided or do you prefer to stay open to new information and options? This is called Judging (J) or Perceiving (P).

Again, surely you've seen that some people like to plan things out, and other people like to be spur of the moment... and that this is true both for loners and in-group types. 

Often, in groups, such people will take charge, and organize the group activity, for example... 

Ultimate, look at all the differences between people, not just introversion. Don't get hung up on whether this particular framework is ""correct"". Think about it more generally.

For example: if you think that men and women are different, then this pretty much refutes your idea that ""in group"" people are ""all the same""... unless you think that all groups are solely male or female, but I'm sure you can find many counterexamples. 

Or take another example: intelligence. Surely you don't think that everyone is the same degree of being smart... and that's a pretty big difference between people. I can assure you that not all smart people are loners.

I'm very glad to hear that your book searching skills are up to shape. I wish that I could say that the students I work with on a daily basis are there. 

It is very common for me to encounter students who have not searched for a book since elementary school, if at all. The catalog is a fairly complex instrument. I would think that a call number is not, but I've helped about a dozen students so far this week who thought that a call number should be read from right to left or from the middle outward. They were lost in the stacks as a result. Once they get the books, the work has just begun. I have to introduce them to the table of contents and the index. Although most students know what a table of contents is, a subject index is often a new concept.

These students are, I should emphasize, not stupid. They're just not familiar with these tools.

For most students that I work with, their first instinct is to go to Google. The job of us librarians is to make searching the catalog and subscription databases (where they can find periodicals and full-text ebooks) as straightforward as possible. A professor requiring a certain number of books, both print and electronic, and periodical articles from the databases, helps us teach students how to use these tools. Otherwise, most will go straight to Google and never learn how much information is not available on the World Wide Web.

It's possible that some of your classmates are not as ready for book searching as you are. They may need this opportunity to learn. Hopefully your library print collection provides better sources than drug policy texts from 1993."	152.0	0.0	335	False	True	0.0

Did a bit of reading on the issue just now, and two points arose immediately in my mind:

First, the issue is being litigated.  California law does prohibit being fired for political discrimination, and political discrimination is being invoked in the lawsuit, alongside racial and gender discrimination against white men (snort).  The lawsuit is going to hinge on the factual matter of whether or not the employee was actually fired for his politics, his race, or his gender, or whether Google fired him for more legitimate and legally acceptable reasons.  In any case, the letter of the law in California still holds that firing someone for their political affiliations would be illegal.

Secondly, there is an interesting crossfire of issues going on in this case.  If the political affiliation being discriminated against is one which itself is accused of being discriminatory, what happens then?  This is what Google is going to argue: they fired an employee who himself was circulating memos that were discriminatory in nature.  If discrimination is a part of someone’s political creed, does discrimination against that political creed become acceptable?  And if so, how far do we need to go down somebody’s political rabbit-hole to determine whether they are actually discriminatory?  Hypothetically, you could have some weird Neo-Nazi who says, “I’m not discriminatory, I think all races should be included in my ideal political structure; it’s just that they should all be subsumed under the control of the master race for their own good, but I still believe that they have rights that should be protected and that they should not be completely discriminated out of the picture” – would this wacky viewpoint contain discriminatory elements that would justify an employer firing them?  How far would we have to indulge their views to reach that conclusion?  (Note: definitely not saying that I have any answers, I just think the questions are very interesting)

And since most religions with a tri-omni god believe in an eternal afterlife, then any pain felt in our finite lives is dwarfed if it is necessary to avoid infinite negative consequences.

The obvious rebuttal is that inflicting temporary pain for greater good is only a necessity for a parent because that parent is not omnipotent. If a parent could make their kid grow up strong eating only things they loved, they probably would. If a parent could wipe out infectious disease, or make a child's tastebuds love veggies, they probably would.

So here we get into a definition of omnipotence. It can't be the ability to do anything we can state, because that would include things like creating a square with three sides, logical contradictions. If our bar for omnipotence included that ability, then omnipotence would be an illogical quality and we wouldn't need a problem of evil to challenge it.

So taking as our bar logical possibility, could there be a logical necessity, unseen by us within the vastness and complexity of the universe which makes eternal happiness impossible without temporary suffering on earth? I'm not asking if such a thing is likely, or if you believe that such a thing exists. Since we're overall talking about whether the idea of an omnibenevolent and omniscient god is POSSIBLE, then we only need to agree that such a logical necessity could POSSIBLY exist. Unless you know of a reason that it can't, it follows that the tri-omni god could be constrained by such a logical necessity and that the current world is the least amount of suffering such a god could logically allow to achieve a much greater payoff for humans.

Personally, I don't believe in such a necessity or such a god, but there is no reason they couldn't possibly exist. They're just incredibly unlikely from the available evidence."	2.0	0.0	423	False	True	0.0

If there are certain things that are required for the sake of pleasure, in every possible configuration of the universe, then a being could still be able to do anything that’s logically possible...and yet face real restrictions in being able to help.

Scott Alexander popularized what might be the best counterargument to make, in both his blog SlateStarCodex and his web serial Unsong.  He says that if god’s goal is to create as much happiness as possible, then he ought to create every universe that contains happiness, where the happiness is enough to make the pain worthwhile.  So, if there’s a possible universe where people can get tortured, but also most people throughout all of history can be deeply happy to a large degree, then the people of that universe deserve the chance to exist.  Kind of like a cosmic Omelas argument.

Not to say this isn’t controversial: in reality, I actually agree with you, for reasons I can clarify below if you like.  But it does make sense that an omnibenevolent god might, by virtue of knowing everything, be in a situation where it needs to create a world with some suffering in order to allow for the existence of even more joy.

But despite that, parents keep giving their kids gifts on Christmas, because their ignorance of reality allows them to feel some joy.

Parents do this year after year, and it exemplifies in part the motivation an omnipotent God may feel when prescribing ignorance for the human race.

1) We are working off of presumptions that we have no proof of for the sake of this whole conversation — “God” is omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, omniscient. 

2) We are working off of unspoken presumptions that out of all possible choices, numbered to infinity, we are stuck to one god for all the known and unknown that exists. 

What if it exists that there are gods who make gods?Then, out of all their power and knowledge, they made everything that the beings in their systems are ever capable of touching, seeing, or even able to contemplate? What if our assumed god is limited in comparison to the scope of what other gods can do in ways beyond our human comprehension?

This is a rabbit hole that has no answer. 

For us to even have conversations, it’s a basic need for our human minds to make and run off of assumptions. These assumptions that we talk about come from men of religions who have thought about this before and written about it. 

I personally believe there is a creator. The reason why has to do with the balance found naturally everywhere. The laws of physics that we know thus far that suggest for anything to function in our “realm”, balance is needed. Balanced is achieved through creating a range on a spectrum. (Maybe the range is decided on by the creator)

Balance is needed for human emotion. It’s needed in order for us to know how we are feeling. Thus, a spectrum of human emotion is needed. If we only ever know one place on the spectrum between happiness and sadness, we wouldn’t even know what happiness or sadness is. We have to experience all of it to know it. We can’t even have this conversation of “why did god create suffering” without the whole spectrum of human emotion already being in place. I have to have been sad to know when I’m happy. I have to have been happy to know when I’m sad. Depression doesn’t torture a person because they’re only at the lowest point of sadness in their life. It’s torture because in at least one point of their life, they learned what happiness was and currently don’t know how to get back to it. 

Suffering is needed. Range of spectrum is needed.  We’re all dead in one way or another without it. 

This is why I really don’t believe in a heaven or a hell. If there is an afterlife, I feel there must still be the full spectrum. Being happy all the time seems boring. Being sad or tortured in the same exact way for eternity seems boring. There’s no point. A spectrum was created and a balance was struck in all aspects of what we know as humans. We have swings from one end to another, but it’s needed to know where we are currently. "	1.0	0.0	490	False	True	8.0

If you’re accused of something with any political potential this could provide a bias for the judge. Not saying the judge is likely to throw you in jail when he absolutely believes you innocent, but he now has a bias that could turn him against you. Example: you’re in a drunken fight antagonized by the other guy. He files criminal charges the next day and you do not. It is an election year and the judge is ‘tough on crime.’ Witness testimonies, includinng your own, are unreliable in this case. 	19.0	0.0	104	False	True	0.0

Let me start with ""if I'm guilty but the evidence was illegally obtained, but if I'm actually not guilty, why should I take a chance with a jury?""  Illegally obtained evidence is actually a point toward juries in my opinion.  If there was illegally obtained evidence your attorney will likely make a motion to suppress before the trial.  Motions are heard without a jury with only a judge.  If you're having a bench (judge) trial, the judge will consider the legality of the evidence and then simply exclude it from his consideration.  If you're having a jury trial, the judge will exclude the information pretrial and the jury will never hear it.  We like to pretend judges can simply not consider what they hear, but they're people and I don't always trust them.  If the case has a lot of legal issues that can be resolved pretrial, I would lean toward jury.  

Juries also tend to be more prejudiced than judges do.  That can be really bad if you're a black man in a rural white community, but it can also be good if you're a white man in that same jurisdiction and the chief witness against you is a black man.  More common is if the chief witness is currently incarcerated and will come in to testify in a jail uniform and the defendant is also in jail.  The judge will know you're both in jail, but the jury won't.  The jury will see a witness in peels but a defendant in court appropriate attire.  Juries being bad can be good with the right circumstances.  

The vast majority of the jury trials I set however are for people who I think are innocent....or at least the people I don't think there is enough evidence to convict.  Setting a jury forces a prosecutor's hand.  Juries are a LOT of work.  Setting a case for jury often gets better offers, and often a straight up dismissal.  Setting it for jury is sometimes like a game of chicken, and if you're willing to go to trial the best bet for getting it dropped without the risk of a trial is to risk the jury and hope the other side is too lazy or too scared to take the case to trial.  

Basically, choosing jury or judge is not so simple as actually innocent or not.  There are a lot of things to consider, and while bench trials ARE often better, there are situations where a jury may be more likely to get you the result you want.  Guilty or innocent, you should never firmly make the decision as to judge or jury without consulting your attorney.  "	601.0	0.0	470	False	True	0.0

As a follow up, would you be okay living anywhere in the country? One thing to consider is that after you earn the degree, if you choose to be a professor like you mentioned above, jobs are highly competitive in academia; the institution chooses you instead of vice versa. There are many more PhD candidates than there are jobs as professors for many reasons now more than ever. Researching the job outlook would be a good idea. If you’re willing to live anywhere, single, and willing to take the risk that you might not land a job in academia, then PhD might work out. 
One risk of obtaining the PhD is the word “overqualified.” If you don’t get a job right away in academia, many employers will turn you away simply for the fact that you have an advanced degree and they don’t want to pay you more. Even if you tell them you’ll settle for a lower salary, they fear that you will leave them later on in pursuit of something like ... a job in academia. 
The above reasoning is what convinced me not to pursue it. I wasn’t necessarily willing to live anywhere, I wasn’t willing to take the risk of not landing a job in academia, and I didn’t want to hear “overqualified” especially given the fact that I already heard it after I earned my masters degree. 
I worked for a recruiting company for several years, and many employers told us to essentially toss any applications that had advanced degrees listed for the reason above. They valued skills and experience over degrees 
Here’s something to consider instead: go for a masters degree. 
Reasons: 
1. Two years is less time to commit. If you hate it, then it’s a short time.
2. You can have time to research and see if you enjoy it. I bet you would, given your self-description. You can learn research skills via writing a thesis and get yourself published. 
3. You can most definitely get a job in academia. Sure, you likely won’t be working for a place like MIT, but a masters degree can mean everything at a community college: tenure, department chair, or even just teaching. You would have the chance to be more picky on geographical location, and still do everything in academia. No, comm colleges aren’t as prestigious as universities. But you could use the community college to really make an impact in your field through teaching AND having an institution to help fund research and conferences. "	1.0	0.0	438	False	True	4.0

The body of your post only seeks to establish the immorality of birth, but you are missing the arguments that would establish the relevance of this immorality.


That being said I would agree with you that having children is not a basic human right, and that seeking to contol that is a violation of your rights. Strictly speaking rights are more philosophical not practical. Functionally they are more or less the same though. People also do not have the right to breath, however any thing you do to prevent someone from breathing would be a violation of their rights. 


As to the morality of having kids, that comes up in CMV a lot and I would encourage you to search old posts. 
To address your anology specifically, 

&gt; We can take this principle and apply it to human babies. By having a child, you are creating a conscious entity; you've taken control of its life.

I don't think I follow this part. The goal of most parebts is to have their child become and independent adult, not to live a life of slavery only to then by killed the parent. If you only seek to use your kid for personal gain then kill it, I think everyone would agree that your being immoral. Would you feel it is immoral to make AI with the intent that they grow and learn then eventually take control of their life and find success and happiness.


&gt; Every new human life also means new suffering. We find that inflicting suffering upon someone is immoral, and even allowing someone to suffer is widely considered immoral. 

We generally accept that it can be moral to cause suffering or allow them to happen at certain time. For instance when the suffering will bring about something good. An example would be a coach. Their job is basically to make their team suffer so that they can get better and win games. if all suffering ass immoral then coaches would be Hitler.

(For the following, I will assume both that there are no practical impediments to your prohibition and that it would be accepted as legal by the relevant parties. FWIW, I'm an atheist.)

At heart, religion is a set of non-empirical statements. ""God exists"", ""After you die, you will go to heaven"", ""Jesus rose from the dead"", ""If someone strikes you on the cheek, do not retaliate, instead, let them strike the other cheek,"" etc. are all religious statements that cannot be verified as true. In claiming that we should prohibit children from being taught religion, the axiom of your action appears to be, ""We should not teach children that statements which have not been verified to be true are true."" This sounds perfectly defensible. Until you remember the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem).

In brief, the problem is that *no ought-statements, whether secular or religious, can be verified to be true*. I can empirically say that, ""Shooting someone in the head will kill them."" I cannot empirically say that, ""Shooting someone in the head is wrong unless they are putting you in mortal danger.""

Feeling compulsions and/or being somewhat obsessed about something does not, by itself allow for a diagnosis of the condition.  Only a significant amount of distress, impairment and/or loss of functionality, when diagnosed by a trained professional (psychiatrist), represents actual OCD.  I'm afraid your example is trivial and fails to meet the definition in the DSM.  While the man feels 'uncomfortable', or 'small anxiety' is is able to to continue the activity, continue interacting with his friend, and is not compelled to complete a ritualistic behaviour.

To explain the source of displeasure created by the expression ""I'm OCD about ____"", those of us with diagnosed with OCD have often endured years worth of time lost to irrational compulsions in response to obsessive thought patterns we are unable control (without treatment).

That cuts both ways.

You can’t say “we know from the evidence” when the evidence is witness testimony, and then claim that witness testimony is unreliable. The primary source of the officer’s version is what he said (and was never properly questioned about), which is also witness testimony.

&gt;the compilation of other forms of evidence, most of which do seem to corroborate his account.

*Many* of which corroborate *parts* of his account.

To wit: the witness who said that he *did* see the victim moving slowly towards the shooter, but with his hands held at chest-height and away from his body in what the witness described as communicating “see, you got me, I’m hurt”.

It corroborates some of Wilson’s account, but contradicts big parts of it.

&gt;Well of course. Maybe he was really just some racist Neo-Nazi scumbag who only joined the force to unjustifiably kill back people, and lied his ass off at every turn. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

It’s odd that you felt the need to jump from “his story might not be accurate and he has an incentive to have a story that justifies his actions” straight to “well it doesn’t seem like his entire career was a sham, so...”

If I can speculate just a bit, it seems like you’re uncomfortable directly addressing the possibility that the shooter (while not a snidely whiplash kind of villain) didn’t have a good reason for the shooting, and altered events to be able to keep his job, livelihood, and reputation. 

Instead your response here amounts to “oh, sure, it could be something completely ridiculous, but it doesn’t seem like this ridiculous scenario I made up, so that’s it.”

&gt;But if you have, say, 10 witnesses, Wilson's account, forensic evidence, autopsy evidence, and DOJ findings that all pretty much agree on what happened and on the other side you have 2 witnesses who hate the cops and keep offering wildly different accounts of how Wilson is a cold-blooded murderer, I'm going to tend to agree with the former group.

And if that was how the evidence stacked up, you’d be justified.

But the DOJ didn’t find that the shooting was justified or that Wilson was telling the truth, only that it would be difficult to prove in court.

“Difficult to prove him guilty” and “actually didn’t do it” aren’t the same thing. And that’s even as someone who worked as a public defender for a spell.

More than two witnesses (including a number who were credible) corroborated the account that the victim had been shot while surrendering and/or while posing no immediate threat to the shooter. And of those witnesses who unambiguously supported the shooter, some indicated that they felt pressured to support him due to to his position as a police officer.

I don’t know from where you read that the DOJ investigation cleared Wilson. It didn’t.

&gt;I can't. I'm not Wilson. I don't know. IIRC he said it was because he was quite shaken up after the incident and wasn't thinking clearly

So he might have tampered with evidence, but only accidentally?

I don’t mean to be glib, but I can only hope that if I shoot someone my “shaken up” reaction is to destroy evidence and circumvent chain of custody in such a way as makes it more difficult to find evidence about the shooting. That’s just damned good luck.

&gt;Maybe he washed his hands as part of some malicious coverup for a race-based murder. Maybe he was in a heavy state of shock, saw his hands, and thought ""oh, blood, I should wash that off."" I don't know. But what's that saying about not attributing to malice what can be blamed on incompetence? 

You keep going back to “either it was a race-based murder or it’s fine”. Why would the only way for the cop’s actions to be suspect be if he began with the intent to shoot a black suspect? As opposed to that implicit biases influenced his decisionmaking subconsciously, and then the system which is skewed heavily towards police officers protected him?

&gt;Could you do an ELI5 summary on the latter bits? And I hope you don't begrudge a layperson from holding an opinion about this stuff.

I can give it a go. And, no, I wouldn’t begrudge laypeople from having an opinion. Though I would caution a bit more restraint in how strident a lay opinion should be.

So, let’s talk grand juries!

Typicallt, a prosecutor in front of a grand jury presents their best possible case for indictment. There’s no right for the accused to give testimony, no right for the accused to have witnesses who support their defense, and no right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.

So, in essence, the case presented to the grand jury is in almost every case: what if you took every prosecution witness at face value, heard do no other testimony, and saw only the evidence that supports the prosecution’s case?

One of the huge complaints about the grand jury system is that a thing meant to protect against unjust prosecution ends up being a rubber stamp for indictment.

Which makes it downright *odd* that in this case the prosecutor presented not only a whole lot of evidence against indictment, but impeached (it’s a term of art, basically “questioned the reliability of”) his own witnesses. 

In particular, he both allowed the accused (who has no right, remember, to give evidence at *all*) to give his side of the story, he didn’t question the accused at all. Which is weird, since that would imply to the jury that there’s nothing to question in the shooter’s own statement.

And, perhaps worse, he allowed the accused’s unquestioned account of the events to be the first thing the jury hears. This gets more into trial practice theory, but there’s a lot of research into concepts around how juries interpret facts. Once you give them a narrative, they will typically treat that as the frame through which they view all of the evidence. It’s very difficult to actually move a jury away from a settled script.

So if the first thing they hear is the version of events from the accused, and no part of it is questioned..."	9.0	0.0	1046	False	True	2.0

Well most dog and cat owners don't get one in their lifetime and call it done. It's arguably beneficial that they live so long as you can train them longer and build a better connection. If people don't want the parrot after a while there are human and inhumane ways to get rid of them.

Pride is not a recruitment festival or educational movement.  Pride is not about catering to other people. Pride is a celebration of freedom.

That's... kind of the point. It's pride in one's self in the face of adversity. 

Every once in a while a thread comes up about 'being proud to be white' and the consensus is 'Why? What have white people fought through, what big challenge have they tackled?' Pride makes sense only in the face of those challenges. 

So being who you are and turning it up to 11, and then having people come and protest or bring on the adversity, is the very point of Pride. "	17.0	1.0	97	False	True	2.0

While I agree that high heels are a sexist expectation in some parts of society (e.g. certain jobs), you don't generally hear about families where the husband won't let the wife leave the house without wearing high heels.

Some examples of forced niqab use:

* [Her husband is forcing her to wear niqaab and she wants advice](https://islamqa.info/en/20910)
* ['Hell' for wife forced to wear a niqab by husband](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/341449/Hell-for-wife-forced-to-wear-a-niqab-by-husband)

It covers up the most expressive part of her body – her face – and hinders her ability to show emotion. A huge amount of communication is done through nonverbal cues, but a woman wearing a niqab isn't able to convey these cues and therefore her ability to participate in public life is limited. Imagine listening to a presentation at a meeting at work - who do you think would be the more compelling speaker, someone whose face and hands are free to be expressive and interesting, or someone who is muffled by a sheet and a veil and whose face you can't see? Almost certainly the former, which gives a tremendous advantage to men in a society where women are expected to wear the niqab. 

Additionally, the niqab forces anonymity on a woman. It steals a woman's individuality, dehumanizes her, and turns her into a faceless figure. When you look at her, you don't see a person - you see a dark ghost with eyes peeking through a slit. This stands in contrast to men, who just look like human beings. All women wearing a niqab look more or less the same, with the result that they can easily all be treated the same and lumped into one single faceless and insignificant category by men. 

A niqab is also a constant reminder that, in the view of the oppressive societies that expect them to be worn, women and men must be kept fundamentally apart. The niqab is a barrier between the woman who wears it and the outside world. Men, however, don't need such a barrier because they FORM the outside world. The outside world is a place for men, and women who enter it must hide themselves to avoid disrupting or tempting the men to whom it belongs. I would argue that nearly all women who choose to wear the niqab are doing so because they've absorbed this oppressive ideology, so the fact that they technically choose to wear it doesn't mean it's not oppressive. (Others wear it because they're in a place where they will face harrassment, shaming, and physical danger if they don't.)

Heels, on the other hand, don't hinder a woman's ability to interact in public, either socially or professionally. They don't separate her from the outside world and they don't set her apart as some ""other"" who must be kept hidden. Like neckties for men, heels for women are a gender-specific part of professional or formal clothing. (And [heels have historically been worn by men](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21151350); they weren't invented to damage women's backs.) 

You mention throughout this thread that you worked at a place where women were required to wear heels. That's sexist, because as you point out that forces a health risk on women. But it's nowhere near as fundamentally oppressive as the niqab, because the heels aren't designed to limit how effectively a woman can participate in a public/professional sphere, or to force her into faceless anonymity. A woman in heels is able to take part in a board meeting just as easily as if she weren't wearing heels (and heels actually sometimes lend an air of power or professionalism). But a woman in a niqab isn't able to show visible reactions or facial expressions, and is wearing clothing that makes her seem less significant and less present than men whose faces are bare; and the niqab also serves as a constant reminder to everyone in the room that she's a woman and that women are in a fundamentally different social class and category from men.

The physical damage from heels occurs over the long term and isn't visible to or desired by employers who require heels (many probably aren't even aware that this damage occurs, or don't think their employees walk enough to develop this damage). Like I said earlier, that's absolutely sexist and I would either sue my employer or quit in protest if they started requiring heels. But heels at work don't prevent a woman from participating equally in society, nor do they dehumanize her and turn her into a faceless figure, so they're not ""oppressive"" in the same way as a niqab."	1.0	0.0	714	False	True	0.0

The President briefly talked about punishing women for abortion &amp; when everyone rightly freaked out, he recanted. But I think his remarks showed his inner thought process. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html). 

In addition, Republican representatives have often called for the punishment of women, in addition to their doctors, for abortion. 

An ID rep. called for their execution, but then similarly walked it back. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/3/bob-nonini-idaho-gop-candidate-suggests-punishment/)

Another ID rep. tried to introduce legislation that would charge women for 1st degree murder just last year [&lt;Source&gt;](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx).

A number of OH representatives have introduced a bill that, while currently under revision, would currently criminally punish women &amp; doctors with the same crime [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-HB-565).

I would posit that the politicians who say that they would not punish a women for an abortion, but only punish their doctor, are playing a politically expedient game. It is the reason they ""accidentally"" tell the truth &amp; then have to walk it back. The party's actions as a whole in other avenues of this question seem to show that they would change their hand if the political wind blew differently, or if they had more power. 

Indeed, since Planned Parenthood v. Casey sets the state's right to ban abortion at ""viability of the fetus,"" and due to advancements in medical science, viability is therefore a moving target that is always waxing backward (from 24 weeks at the start of the millennia to around 20 weeks now). Because of this women are being prosecuted as we speak [&lt;Source&gt;](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indiana-has-now-charged-two-asian-american-women-feticide-n332761) &amp; that is likely to continue &amp; increase. 

Furthermore, pro-life individuals often frame the argument as one of a binary choice between if a fetus is a ""human life"" or not (ignoring the spectrum of viability in Planned Parenthood v. Casey). This is almost always to focus the argument in such a way to quantify ""abortion as murder."" The logical conclusion to that construction of thought is that murderers should be punished. This is a shocking, but logically consistent framework for those self-identifying as ""pro-life"" &amp; is likely the reason why their representatives do what they do &amp; will likely punish women &amp; feel justified in doing so. 

Finally, before 1973 laws banning abortion almost always had provisions for the punishment of the women for their abortions. [&lt;Source&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#History). Women were not ""protected"" by anti-abortion laws, they were pursued by the state for violating these laws. If the supreme court were to invalidate their own previous abortion rulings, chiefly Roe v. Wade &amp; Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the status quo ante would prevail &amp; abortion would be illegal, in admittedly various forms, in 38 of 50 states immediately [&lt;Source&gt;](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx).

I could actually go on, but to say that those who self-identify as pro-life don't want to punish women is to admit that you simply don't fully understand the history of the topic in which you speak. "	3.0	0.0	485	False	True	1.0

Individual channels would need to charge quite a bit, maybe $3-5 each (ESPN charges $6 now).

Each channel would want to maximize its revenue, so it's going to price right around your willingness to pay.  Right now you're subsidizing someone watching HGTV, but they're subsidizing you watching comedy central. 

Inevitably, you'd stop getting channels you barely watch, but maybe you would occasionally.   You wouldn't discover new shows or channels.  A bunch of niche networks that don't cater to wealthy folks would die off.  

Think of it like a restaurant.  Right now it's a buffet.  You pay one price and get all the food you want.  You can gorge and try every kind of food you want.  When it's a la carte, you get one thing you're happy with, but you miss out on trying a lot of stuff, and you (may) agonize over getting more (eg I wants some greens, but is a side of spinach really worth $8?).

If an album tells a story or has a deeper meaning, than I agree with you. But if an album is simply a person's outlet or their own personal expression, then I see nothing wrong with using their image on the cover.

We'll use the Phil Collins album *Face Value* as an example. The album is simply about his personal life and his own thoughts and feelings. He's presenting his feelings at ""face value"". I believe the cover fits that. It's his face, because *his* expression of *his* emotions in musical form. The cover being in black and white represents that his ideas are presented in black and white. He's not trying to color anything up, or try and dress up his ideas to make it more presentable. He wants to express himself as straightforward as he can.

Another example is Selena Gomez's album *Revival*. The cover is simply her, naked, in black and white. The album is meant to be a ""naked"" or ""stripped down"" version of her feelings. I'll admit while it's not overly creative and the idea for the cover can be considered overused, it still fits the entire point of the album, and fits it well. The same can be said for the Phil Collins album. 

I think an album cover is less about being creative and more about being representative of an album. Doing both of course speaks volumes about the artist(s), but if an album is a simplistic expression of the artist, then why can't the cover reflect that? "	3.0	0.0	279	False	True	2.0

&gt;I am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of ""we must respect all cultures"". 

This actually reflects a popular misunderstanding of the concept of cultural relativism as it was devised.

Cultural relativism was a philosophy developed by the anthropologist Franz Boas in the early 20th century to guide cultural anthropologists in studying, describing, and analyzing other cultures. It actually has nothing to say about ""respecting all cultures.""

It was pushback to earlier anthropologists' approaches, in which non-Western cultures-- and cultural practices / beliefs / norms / values-- were typically described in direct contrast to Western cultural norms and ideas. And usually they were depicted as somehow lacking.

Boas proposed a cultural relativistic view. Not that other cultures' practices ""should be respected,"" but that in describing and writing about a culture, those practices should be viewed from *within* the cultural and historical context in which they developed and exist, rather than holding them to the moral / ethical standards of another culture.

That's all.

In fact, most cultural anthropologists today readily acknowledge that there are practices in *every* culture that are maladaptive, dysfunctional, and harmful. One of the things anthropologists do is work to understand the social processes and history of those practices, because if you don't know how and why a ""bad"" practice develops (the context-- the part that cultural relativism is really useful for), it's very difficult to actually develop a solution. Today, many anthropologists are actively engaged in working with community members to develop effective and constructive solutions that can be implemented within communities to address those practices (e.g, FGM). These solutions include (among other things) social engagement and education.

**tl;dr:** The people who actually adhere to ""cultural relativism"" don't hold the view that you're attributing to them. I don't know whether this changes your mind or not, but hopefully maybe it better explains what the term actually means. (**source: I am a professional anthropologist**)"	68.0	0.0	342	False	True	0.0

Which means we'd need at least 13 just for my one class, and that's assuming 40 students per week and no extra hrs. So once we add those in 15-20 therapists per class.

so I hardly think my defense of it is ""punching strawmen."" Your claim is blatantly false. People touch algebra on a weekly if not daily basis. If you weren't being willfully misleading, it's ignorant or indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of what algebra is. Any and all of which suggest we need to spend more time teaching algebra, not less so we can send our children to therapists who absolutely don't teach cooking, family planning, or financial planning anyway. The mental health ramifications of not being able to take care of yourself can't be staved off in advance, but children don't really suffer from not being able to cook and financially plan until they're responsible for it. So not in elementary school, but in college maybe? After college? The best thing we can do is when they're children is not give them some kind of advance therapy but actually teach them how to do those things, which 1) doesn't happen in therapy at all, and 2) has academic fundamentals underlying it which you think ""most people don't touch""

And I would treat my children's teacher and my children's therapists very differently. Someone responsible for teaching my kid algebra forms a very different relationship with them than someone resolving my child's mental illness, potentially diagnosing them, expecting them to be deeply emotionally vulnerable, etc. Find the most ardent supporter of widespread therapy and even they'll be adamant that the therapeutic relationship depends a lot on the personality/methods of the therapist in a way that teaching algebra does not.

First of all, 'good review' != 'higher wages'. Giving a good review is absolutely easier than replacing an employee. It costs nothing, other than 10 minutes of the manager's time.

Even in the event that giving a good review necessarily leads to a raise, it's not like we're talking about doubling someone's salary. Say you have to give them a 10% raise.  I think you're underestimating how easy it is to hire decent people. Of course it will vary depending on the complexity of the job, but it seems very conservative to say that it would easily take a month or more to hire someone new *and* train them to the point that they were as productive as the previous (good) employee - particularly when you factor in the fact that some percentage of new employees will be terrible. Ok, so that's a month or more of lost productivity. That will cost the company at least the 10% pay raise that they didn't want to give, since 1 month is about 10% of a year and the value that the employee generates for the company is definitionally greater than their salary (otherwise the company wouldn't hire for the position)."	1.0	0.0	228	False	True	0.0

Part of it is that you're eating a distinct portion on a regular schedule, so your body becomes more accustomed to a standard amount of food. Cooking a meal from a recipe yields a precise amount of food, while snacking is perpetual until you choose to stop or until you run out, increasing the odds that you overeat. This is also true of eating while distracted by work, television, or some other activity - those who focus on their meals eat less. [Research supports this.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/distracted-eating-may-add-to-weight-gain-201303296037)

Now, looking at what you do eat;

&gt;frankfurthers, dry sausage, raw salted herring or make a hamburger

Herring aside, eating exclusively red meat for your protein is not good for your heart. [Burgers and hot dogs are some of the worst offenders.](https://www.webmd.com/g00/food-recipes/features/the-truth-about-red-meat?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&amp;i10c.dv=20) Herring is better, but eating it salted is just a direct injection of sodium. Fish and poultry can be prepared in low-sodium, high-protein ways. 

&gt;all peppers, tomatos, oranges, cucumbers, pineapples and grapes 

Bell peppers and cucumbers are good vegetables, but they're so high in water content that you've got to eat a lot for nutritional value. Oranges, pineapples, and grapes aren't unhealthy *per se*, but they're high in sugar, and if they're a large portion of your diet this can be a problem. You're missing leafy greens and root vegetables, where the healthy fiber and vitamins really lie. 

Ultimately, you're right that it all turns to shit when we eat it - but you'd stand to benefit by diversifying your food intake, and establishing some regularity. That regularity does not have to be 3 cooked meals a day, but it *does* have to (1) maintain food diversity (2) meet daily caloric and nutritional needs, and (3) maintain portion control. Snacking as you please, or ""grazing"" as I like to call it, is a poor method to meet these 3 goals.

In virtually every context, if that researcher was working for a private company, she would have assigned her rights in the IP to the company.  This isn't an outrageous concept.  When an employee produces something on behalf of the company, on company time, and using company resources, it's not a stretch to see why the company sees this as something it should own.

If I bury a million dollars somewhere such that only I know where it is, it's pretty safely mine. On the IP side, if I am the only person that knows the recipe for Coke or KFC, then it's also mine. Aside from that, private property is based on what you can defend, or convince others to defend on your behalf.

We can layer in growing ideas of private ownership. We can say that people can own land. We can say people can own factories. We can say that people can own businesses. We can say that people can own arbitrary concepts of value like cash, bonds, derivatives, etc. We can say people can own patents. We can say people own entertainment content. But the further you get down this path, the weirder things get. 

For example, who owns [this embarrassing photo of Beyonce](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/2/5/14514466/beyonce-super-bowl-halftime-how-photos-lmao-never-forget) from the Super Bowl? Does Beyonce? Does the NFL? What about the photographer? How about the people who created memes online of it? What about the people that took those memes and put them on for-profit Instagram pages? Does it belong to the general public?

At a base level, the entire concept of ownership is meaningless. After humanity goes extinct, my property is no longer mine. In 100 years, my property is no longer mine. That means that property only exists temporarily. And the real basis for property is whether I have special access or am willing to use violence to enforce it. Then when we create a society/government, it's really just us coming to an agreement on how to maximize the benefit for all people.

Patents exist because we want to incentivize individuals to invent things. That improves society. But today, patents are used to find ways to block other companies from competing. It's more-cost effective to extend the patent on a drug than to invent a new one. Disney used a lot of characters (e.g., Aladin, Rapunzel) in the public domain without paying the estates of the people who created them (e.g., the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen.) Meanwhile, they fiercely guard their trademarks (e.g., Mickey Mouse) even though they are almost a century old.

Most people are willing to abide by laws that protect content creators, but they aren't willing to do so for people who aren't actively generating any new value. People were happy to praise billionaires when they were creating far more value than they took for society, but are unhappy when they feel that the wealthy are taking more than they are returning.

Jonas Salk took public money to invent the polio vaccine, and then made the patent available to the public. As such, Americans have been willing to fund research without getting a direct profit because they believe that the drugs alone are worth it. Now that the research has become much more valuable, but the public isn't getting the value they expect out of it, they want to see a greater return. Namely, they want a direct return on investment. A cure for a deadly disease is worth funding no strings attached. But if public funding is going to be used to fund profitable baldness treatments, the public wants some of that money back. 

Ultimately, even if you start with the premise that property rights are invaluable, we are layering in providing extra government funding to certain people, not just protecting existing rights. At that point, the public can structure that extra service however they want.

Ultimately, you have the right to do whatever you want. But if you want me to help you, you have to be willing to do it my way. And I'm going to find the balance that grows the overall pie the most while still giving me a large slice. "	0.0	0.0	637	False	True	0.0

Instead of dividing up Germany into nice manageable puppets and getting rid of east Germany all together they made them a fee independent state, only took away a tiny sliver of land (that had been polish majority anyway) and asked them to pay for the land they wrecked.

In my opinion Versailles was far to lenient. A unified Germany was far to powerful, think of how many lives could have been saved if they where split up into four or five more manageable chunks.

&gt;and there was no other option than for Germany to start invading or suffer from severe consequences such as economic collapse, overpopulation, and continuing to be bullied by the Allies.

What? Germany wasn't over populated by any measure and their economy was the largest in mainland Europe when they started invading stuff.

And what do you mean bullied by the allies? Ask the Indians or any of the other colonies, they knew what being bullied was like. If Germany was being bullied by the allies they would never have gotten the chance to build an army. Saying Germany had any idea what being bullied was like is the peak of a first world problem.

&gt;The only way out of this situation was to create infrastructure geared towards war, which would enable a lot of jobs to be created and for Germany to annex areas such as the Sedetenland and Rhineland which were important strategic areas, as well as reuniting scattered Germans.

The fact that Germany had enough resources to fight world war two showed they did have options. The resources that went into making so much as a single panzer could have fed a family for more than a year. The metal in the Tirpitz alone could have built enough factories to employ hundreds of thousands of people."	45.0	0.0	448	False	True	0.0

""The strategy of world conquest of the Soviet Union springs from the premise that it is not yet strong enough to risk war with the United States but must build up its domestic war potential and bring new strategic areas, resources, and peoples under its control before attacking us. In preparation for attack on the United States, it is, therefore, consolidating its hold on the 130,000,000 Europeans it has dominated since 1939; striving to seize France and Italy by action of its fifth columns; pressing on Greece, Turkey, and Iran; and—using the Chinese Communists as its instruments-attempting by war to conquer China. Communist conquest of China would lead rapidly to Communist victory in Indochina, which is the extension of south China; and Communist control of Indochina would almost inevitably be followed by Communist subjugation of Thailand and the Malay Peninsula.""

So France and Germany had a history of trading harsh penalties for losing a war against the other.

And you know what?  The French dug in and paid their indemnity off in a couple of years, even though people worried it would cripple France for a generation.

So why did the Germany economy tank under Versailles?   Because the Germans horribly mismanaged their own economy.  They paid for the war entirely with debt, anticipating they would pay it off with the vast riches that would come with winning.  When that didn’t turn out so well, they started printing even more money to pay for reparations, rather than, you know, tapping into their relatively unscathed economic might.  When they eventually failed to make a payment, France responded by occupying the Ruhr.  The German government responded by calling a general strike and then print the even *more* cash to support the strikers.  So it was German choices about responding to the treaty rather than the treaty itself that was drove the hyperinflation of the ‘20s.

All of which was more or less under control by the end of the decade.  Then, *bang!*, Great Depression!   Which had some roots in the war but wasn’t caused by the treaty.   

Of course, Germany still had reparations due, and the western powers recognized paying them would be a problem.  So what did they do?  Suspended payments [in 1931](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Moratorium) and then cancelled them all together [in 1932.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_Conference_of_1932)

So by the time Hitler is rising to power in 1933, Germany isn’t paying anything.  In the end, they only paid 1/8 of what they owed under the treaty.   

The Germans weren’t bitter about Versailles because it was so harsh, they were bitter they lost the war.  The war was all in France, so the average German experienced no particular immediate consequence during it.  They had beaten the Russians and almost beaten the western powers during their last great offensive.  And then it all falls apart within months and the whole country collapses.  

So who is to blame for that?   Well, certainly not themselves, everything had been going great!    It must have been those [damn politicians and their devious Jewish masters,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) and those evil vindictive foreign powers and their unreasonable treaty."	16.0	0.0	407	False	True	0.0

The first world war started as a response to British empire spreading across the globe. After the WW1, nations fucked over Germany. Que WW2.

But what was before. Why were British so imperialistic. Well they were in brutal conflict over the church with Spain. (inquisitions), and was nearly destroyed, if not for the doctrine of strong navy. That naturally evolved into expansion and then trade.

Okay, so why did the Inquisitions happened. Why did the parts of Catholic church rebelled and split?

Because Catholic church was affraid of loosing power, in spite of the blossoming spanish trade (from which nobilities prospered). Most nobles, and powerful people just happened to be Jewish. Que the hunt for the wicked.

If someone says, ""All the jobs are going to illegals,"" you know they don't mean illegal dumpers or illegal sellers, they mean illegal immigrants. While from a technical standpoint all of those examples should be equivalent, when it comes to how we actually use the language, they're not used the same way. 'Illegal immigrant' is the one that's morphing in a way that makes us flag it and say hey, be careful with that. And the reason we need to be careful with it is that throughout history, the first step to genocide/oppression/ethnic cleansing has been to declare certain people's existence illegal. It's not a far jump from ""this person's existence here is illegal"" to ""it's okay to do horrible things to this person."" We need to recognize that all people, regardless of how they got here, have human rights, and labelling people illegal is often the first step to infringing upon those rights.

The term 'undocumented' points to the fact that immigrating illegally is a crime because of the system in place, not because it's inherently wrong. Some things are inherently wrong: theft, murder, assault, abuse, rape. Other things are wrong only because we've decided we want society to work a different way: jaywalking, speeding, tax evasion, forgery. These things are crimes, and may be immoral in certain situations (some of them even in all situations) but they're different from the previous category because they don't infringe directly on the rights of others, but rather go against systems we've created and agreed upon as a society. Tax evasion is wrong because it's unfair to benefit from everyone else's contributions without contributing yourself, but if we had a different way of funding the government then tax evasion wouldn't even be a thing that existed to be wrong.

Similarly, entering the country illegally isn't inherently wrong, it's just a violation of the system we've put in place. Calling someone 'undocumented' emphasizes the fact that what they did is come into the country without telling the government. That places the emphasis on the system and the avoidance of it, which thereby invites us to examine that system. Do we think it's a good system? Do we believe the person's actions were immoral given that the system exists? Is there some other action we believe they should've taken instead? Even if the answer to all those questions is yes, it's still worth asking them. It's worth recognizing that the crime of an undocumented immigrant is an avoidance of the system, not an assault on another person's rights."	3.0	0.0	441	False	True	0.0

One of the most common fouls that you see at the levels I officiate is a foul to stop a break, this is to say the defending team are backtracking with a numerical disadvantage and rather than risk tackling and straight up losing the ball, they will play for a foul to stop play and allow players to get back into position. At the speed the game is generally played, players are generally keener to stop play than to allow play to continue, in these situations it is rare to play advantage. It’s not bad to play for fouls, however, I would argue that if there was a total clock stoppage it would encourage players to take more time to reset the game and if this happened it could encourage a team to make more fouls to slow down the pace of the game or change momentum- this could become an element of the way players play the game, but I don’t think it would improve the game, if anything it would be detrimental to the quality of the game and the viewers experience.

To be honest I can’t claim to be aware of all the ins and outs of your sport but from what you say it does seem similar, though the time limit is not applied in the same way. Basketball is an interesting example in terms of getting the ball back into play, the ball is often out of reach of the player, it could be in a stand and as we don’t tend to use a multi ball system at most levels it’s not always practical to impose a time limit. The system generally used is discretionary, that is, did the ball make it back onto the field of play within a timely manner, if it did then there is no time added on, if the ball remains in the stands or players are kicking it away then time will be added on. The ball going out of play is expected in the game, I suppose you could allow the clock to run arbitrarily for 10 seconds before stopping it.

Playing advantage is a key part of the game, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph and I think in a response to an earlier comment, timing of an advantage is discretionary. For the referee on the field, or a fourth official- when they are available, to time all stoppages is not necessarily that easy. From refereeing yourself you’ll know that your job as a referee is not just to watch where the play is happening at that point, to keep the pace of play up or to stop infractions on the field, there are so many different jobs involved. I wear a timer on my wrist in all games, it’s pretty simple and I take a look when I make a stoppage and I take a look when the play resumes, I make mental note of that time and generally an off field referee will also keep a note of stoppages, as I said, the period of time for a stoppage varies depending on the situation, so imposing time limits would be difficult. If the clock were to totally stop when the ball was declared dead by the referee and there was a way around stopping the clock in an advantage situation then I would recommend shortening each half.

Also, not all matches can be played with a huge number of officials, it’s the most widely played sport in the world and there isn’t always enough money in the game to have official time keepers at every game. There are also more grey areas in the sport than most others, introduction of VAR, which seems as though it will happen in at least the upper echelons of the game mean that play could be called back, this means that external timekeepers have to track the moment a foul was made, and this means that a device has to simply be created whereby the clock is stopped NOT by the moment a referee blows their whistle which communicates with the timer in the auditorium and the timer on the referees person. It’s not impossible, but logistically this isn’t easy to impose at all levels of the game in all countries."	2.0	0.0	742	False	True	2.0

For example, many remixes are done so as rap remixes or techno/ dance remixes. The intention isn’t for people to go “hey this one is way better than the original, I am going to listen to this version instead”, but the intention is for that good song and tune to be reconditioned for a different environment such as a night club, as a more appropriate basis for dance routines, or simply to attract people to the song who didn’t like the original style. I would even argue that by doing so it can really only ever be a good thing as the original still exists in its entirety, and is fully accessible to anyone who wants to only listen to the original. By the remix existing and appealing to a wider audience, it only ever broadens the appeal of the song and inherently makes it better in the process.

So, obviously, these remixes offer better sound quality since they are not limited by the old hardware of retro games, but I think there's more to it than that. Many of these remixes bring a new style to the song that people, like myself, may enjoy more (especially the Latin feel to Basilisk run). 

I would also like to bring up the musical concept of theme and variation. ""Remixing"" isn't really a new concept.

From the web site developer's perspective, introducing a new ""reference implementation"" isn't particularly helpful.   You're still looking at the same ecosystem of web browsers (or maybe the same ecosystem plus one.)  I still occasionally look at stuff using lynx.  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29 )   Is this ""reference implementation"" supposed to convince me to stop doing that?   Alternatively, web developers who feel like they can dictate which browsers their clients use, are already doing that.   Tracking cross-compatability in some systematic fashion would be a mess.

For the web browser developer the situation is much the same.  The ecosystem of web site developers is just as if not more uncontrolled than the system of web browsers, and there are legacy websites with propriety and browser-specific implementations.  So you could build a ""reference implementation compatible"" browser, but that doesn't guarantee that it will work well with existing web sites.

In addition to the effects of simple entropy, the web is full of people trying to play the ""embrace, extend, and extinguish"" game.  As long as businesses have incentives to play that kind of game and there's no compelling reason for people to move away from legacy systems the ecosystem will continue to be fractured.   There are benefits to be had from a regulated web, but to make that happen you would need a whole lot more than a non-profit with a reference implementation.  It would require some kind of system involving certification and enforcement authority."	4.0	0.0	259	False	True	2.0

If you're saying that learning about historical facts, which is mostly memorization, doesn't do much to advance a student's critical thinking then sure. But understanding one's historical context offers plenty of educational value. Understanding how things played out in the past teaches a lot about how and why things are the way they are in the present. You seem to only value critical thinking but was that ever the purpose of high school history classes? I don't think so. There isn't much critical thinking involved in learning basic facts like the alphabet, or grammar, or the multiplication table right? And that's fine. Likewise I think history - at least at the highschool level - can be seen similarly as a survey of the necessary base set of historical facts to learn that makes one culturally literate.

If you want to become a historian then yes there's lots of critical analysis of texts and arguments for what the actual historical facts are but people can devote their entire lives to analyzing a single event. To think there's enough time in high school to go through that exercise that while also building a baseline of knowledge of historical facts is unrealistic. I wouldn't be against adding a semester on ""how we decide on historical facts"" outlining the methods that academic historians use but I also understand that they have a very limited amount of time to cover a whole lot of ground.

Again, I'm not as well versed in literature but I imagine the situations are similar with lots of ground to cover and not very much time to cover the more advanced and more critical thinking heavy aspects of literature.

I think the solution that would address the core of the very warranted concerns that you raised is to add a mandatory philosophy class in high schools. Every student should at the very least learn formal logic and the classical arguments. I don't think the solution is to cast aspersions on history classes or literature classes because they don't meet an ideal that is supposed to be addressed by a philosophy class."	153.0	0.0	369	False	True	0.0

But, what I think is important about the way History tends to be taught currently is that it contextualizes a lot of things that people learn in later high school and college, and it sort of creates a shared framework for everyone to at least have a minimum level of understanding, if that makes sense. Like, providing a rough, chronological timeline with basically memorizing dates, and briefly talking about how the events relate to each other creates a sort of metaphorical framework on a metaphorical canvas, for people to fill in at their own pace l, whether it be through higher education, or independent research, social and cultural events, etc. That said, I do agree that it's not the best at teaching kids to critically think, but I'm not sure (not a teacher or admin) that that's the point?

As for literature, I think it's something similar. I think it's more about showing kids what well constructed syntax looks like in a fun way, as well as fostering creativity, and shaping peoples writing and reading skills. I dont think the opinion that they dont exactly foster critical thinking is wrong, tbh, but again, i don't necessarily think that's the point. Kindergarten through HS is designed to make successful people. It's designed to give people the tools they'll need to succeed in life. I'd argue that most math and science teaches critical thinking, as well as sports, and foreign languages, and even some history and English classes. I dont think critical thinking is the goal of any specific class unless its stated as such. I think that's what exercises are for. The classes themselves should be more focused on making sure that everyone at least has an option to access the tools for success. 

And seeing as how most developed countries have literacy rates of around at least 90%, and most people know about past major world events and probably also the ones that are significant to their own country, I'd say that the purpose is being served. Does that make sense? 

TL;DR- I agree with you, but I dont know if that's actually the point. I also dont know if it's not, but those are just my thoughts."	7.0	0.0	389	False	True	0.0

I will start by saying that there is a lot wrong with the educational system. I am finishing up my masters in social studies education (I’ll be mainly focusing on history in my argument since that is my background) and have some experience teaching both middle and high school history classes. I will be the first to agree with some of your points; history has a horrible reputation (deservedly so in some cases) for its focus on memorization and there a TON of terrible teachers that do not focus on critical thinking. However, your and my issue with education is solely with how it is being taught, not with what is being taught (i.e. pedagogy). I do want to say that my views of education might be considered “radical” from mainstream educators, however, I believe that mainstream education is not reaching many of our students, especially our students of color. For example, MN (the state I live and plan on teaching in) has the highest academic achievement gap between white students and students of color. While my views are probably not mainstream, there are many educators who will agree with me and the points I make. Anyway, back to your argument. 

Your argument is that because of the focus on memorization, history and literature offer little or educational benefit and little opportunity to develop critical thinking. The focus on memorization isn’t unique to history or literature; in math you need to memorize basic multiplication and equations, in science you need to memorize basic principals. However, history often gets assessed through multiple choice questions where you need to memorize facts, dates, events, and people. Pablo Freire describes this as the “banking” model of education where students are “containers” that educators “deposit” information into, only to have students regurgitate that information verbatim on tests. This is not a good pedagogy. It forces students to be passive in their learning and encourages memorization of facts instead of critical analysis. Unfortunately, high level history classes, especially AP Histories, favor this model because they are teaching for the test.

Freire offers another approach to teaching. He argues that a teacher should instead collectivize learning and structure the classroom as a learning community. In this scenario, the students are made the center of the classroom and are actively shaping and guiding their learning while the teacher de-centers themselves form the center of the classroom, serving more as a guide that provides structure and support for the class instead of being that “all knowing individual” that is there to dispense knowledge into students. In this classroom, students are active participants in creating knowledge and have a say in their own learning (I am summarizing the points of Freire’s book *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* so I somewhat simplifying his view). 

This model requires the use of inquiry to work; i.e. students are given a problem or issue and must use their skills to find answers and solutions. History is a great space to do inquiry based research and projects. A simple question like “Why was the the I-94 highway in Minneapolis built where it was?” or “Why is there a group called Black Lives Matter?” provide opportunity to learn about the past and make modern connections to the future. 

Furthermore, history need to focus on teaching skills, not content. I would argue that learning anything that can be googled is a waste of time in the classroom. History should focus on teaching reading, writing, and speaking skills. To start, since the academic gap between white students and students of color is with reading and writing and speaking, that should be a point of emphasis in class. Next, these skills are required to do well in a history class (reading primary sources, writing about those sources, talking about those sources), so students need these skills just to do well in the class. Lastly, these skills translate over to other subjects as every academic subject, most jobs and careers, and everyday life will require some reading, writing, and speaking.

Students should then be assessed on these skills over time. Their reading, writing, and speaking skills should be monitored over the year to see how they have improved and note areas of strength and areas that need growth. Multiple choice tests do not adequately assess these skills. Instead, assessments must be more open and accessible. Things like Socratic seminars can be used to assess speaking and Document based essays (students are given 5-10 primary sources and must create a short paper with a thesis based on the documents) for reading and writing, etc. Additionally, project based assessments allow for critical analysis to develop and be assessed as well.

The content we use to teach these skills is also equally important. It is hard to develop the skill critical analysis if the content you look at isn’t critical of history. Content cannot focus on the whitewashed and Eurocentric version of history that is often taught. We must bring in counter-narratives and opposing viewpoints to critically examine history. For example, what did African-American, Latinx, and Native American people think about the Declaration of Independence. How did the Great Depression impact already marginalized groups? We need to incorporate stories or resistance and triumph of people of color and those who have been historically disenfranchised into our content. The MN Social Studies State Standards are broad enough that incorporating these stories into the classroom is fairly easy.

To summarize; History (and all of social studies) has as much educational value as STEM subjects when taught using good pedagogy (I would argue memorization is not good pedagogy)."	4.0	0.0	951	False	True	0.0

* in math, you are learning to develop logical problem-solving by means of symbolic representation
* in the sciences, you learn how to get and understand data and how to interpret what lies behind what your senses are telling you
* in the humanities, you learn how communication and texts work, both written and oral.

Take your own post, for example. You have clearly set out a goal and identified a problem, defined some caveats and criteria. Your text is clear, well structured and intelligible. You write about an abstract topic with an appropriately abstract vocabulary. You also display some awareness about your own fallible judgment, otherwise you wouldn't post here in the first place - you are aware that there is a 'space of reasons', a broad spectrum of opinions, arguments and reasons in which you have situated yourself.

A ten year old kid could not have written a text like that. A person that never went to school would usually not be able to write a text like this. *Somewhere* down the road you have acquired the cognitive and intellectual skills required to make such an argument. I do not know anything about your upbringing, but usually people learn this in school. Usually not in the science classes, although they might figure in somewhere as well to a smaller degree. You learn to write such a complicated and abstract text in your literature and history classes. Even though you (and I) do not understand the details of the process at stake, going through all your humanity classes has *somehow* given you these cognitive abilities that ten-year old you did not yet have.

Do you *need* literature and history? Probably not; you could probably acquire the same skills through, say, politics, social studies, philosophy, learning latin, etc. Anywhere you comprehensively deal with texts and communication in a broader sense.

So there are further, additional benefits to be gained from each humanity. Let me briefly check the advantages of learning about literature. You can probably fill in the gaps for history by yourself.

By learning about literature you also learn something about the topics of literature. The big advantage of literature over the other arts is that it can deal with the inner perspective of someone, their experience, their thoughts and feelings, their values, etc., while other arts (movies, opera, paintings etc.) are more constraint to the outer perspective, which captures only actions and appearances. (The other arts sometimes mix in some techniques of literature to deal with this problem, but that is a different topic.)

By learning something about literature, you develop *a mental map of culture* that allows you to navigate through the nexus of human history, society, morality, and the problems of 'heart and soul', if you will call them that. Shakespeare and Joyce are great examples. No matter how boring that might have been to you, you still get an impression of *what it is like to be someone* *else* at another time. Their problems might not be your problems, but by understanding that difference you also learn something about yourself, since you are better able to situate yourself in a broader context. By learning about these selected texts, even if you do not enjoy reading them, you construct a mental map that still allows you to navigate our current culture better than someone who is not acquainted with it or who simply hasn't gone to school. There are many aspects to this, for example which discourses you (can) perceive or participate in, how much empathy you have for someone who is in different shoes, how you evaluate and organize your own value system.

Is this what I wrote above all just fancypants artsy-fartsy bullshit that has no measure, no application or method of being verifiable? Let me tell you this: When in the 1920s in Germany the Nazis came to power, it mostly wasn't the STEM-people who saw what was coming or who spoke out against the Nazis. It was rather the writers, the historians, the theologians, the journalists etc. who were able to read the signs of the time and who spoke out against Hitler. The engineers and the scientists, they went along with Hitler, to a much higher degree at least than the people with a background in the humanities."	12.0	0.0	740	False	True	0.0

Your premise is basically that bad curriculums are bad. Any quality teacher would agree that just rote memorization of facts and reading literature without real analysis doesn't teach much.

So what I'll say to try and change your view is that your view rather than taking on the classes should be taking on the education system as a whole. Our education system is largely still structured around farmers' kids learning during the off season to give them something to do. It's not individual and it's not really preparing people for anything. It's not the classes fault, it's the states that have testing on rote memorization rather than analysis or critical thinking.

A US History course can have plenty of important things to learn. Why did the country turn against alcohol enough to make an amendment to ban it then change their minds? In what ways did slavery get perpetuated even after it was ""outlawed."" What set of circumstances REALLY led to the US joining WWI and WWII beyond just single events. What did those single events spark?

A general literature course can teach you plenty too. You called out Shakespeare as not helpful to learn. But what is the implication of gender in Twelfth Night? Who is meant to be the antagonist in Merchant of Venice? What's the difference between the idealization of love and the reality of love in Romeo and Juliet?

You get my point. There's nothing wrong with these courses, but teachers have to make sure their students follow the curriculums as given. Take it up with the system not the teachers and their classes."	123.0	0.0	290	False	True	0.0

I work with and go to school with (returning college student) recent HS grads. There are two main reasons I think they should be reading probably 2x the amount of literature they currently read. The first is that reading is a skill you don't really perfect until your late teens and your vocabulary improves markedly into your 20s. The more reading you do the more you are exposed to unique words and the more efficient you become. The second is that it is really hard to teach reading comprehension if you are not pushing people to read things that are just that much further out of their comfort zone. You can almost always spot a well-read individual, they listen well, they write well, they can be more empathetic, they understand subtext and connotation well, they have broad cultural understanding, and they are good conversationalists.

What is the point of a high school chemistry class? To give everyone a base level understanding about how the stuff that makes up our world works, and lay the groundwork for those students who want to go on further. Is there ""value"" in all students learning how to work through stoichiometry problems? Probably not, as 99% of people will never use it again, but it's part of the base knowledge for people who WILL go on in the field. And, if nothing else, it adds some level of understanding about why chemistry is the way it is.

What's the point of a high school history class? Same deal, only more people will be directly affected by what they learn. Establish a baseline of knowledge, set up the building blocks for people who want to delve deeper, and give an understanding of why history is the way it is.

It's that last part that I want to focus on. Why is history the way it is? Well, because of the history that came before it. In your OP, you said 

&gt; I acknowledge the value of basic history lessons in understanding society, culture, and history that still affects us today. I am arguing that there is little to no value in all students having to learn of details like specific battles of the Civil War, or the politics of the early 1800s.

Name a piece of history covered in high school that hasn't seen its effects propagate to the modern day. I'll wait.

It's those details that make history understandable. Imagine trying to teach programming without bothering to teach about the difference between ints and doubles or how IF AND and OR work, instead just jumping directly into functions. Ignore the rest, that's just details, you can learn more about them in college if you want. It wouldn't work. And history is no different.

The Battle of Gettysburg was July 1-3 1863. Why then? How does it fit in to the larger narrative? It's no coincidence that the largest Confederate push northward happened the spring and summer after Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation (January 1 1863). Suddenly it was explicitly a nation opposed to slavery fighting rebels who approved of slavery - the Confederacy suddenly saw their support from England trickle and stop. They were running out of options, couldn't keep up with Union manufacturing, and needed to push hard to win. When it happened is an important part of the narrative.

The politics of the early 1800s aren't important today? Don't make me laugh. We're literally having the same arguments today that the Federalists and Anti-Federalists were having in the late 1790s to early 1800s. Should we have a big government or a small government? What is and isn't the government allowed to do and pay for - and even if they're allowed to, do we want them to? The exact issues were different, sure, but the argument over a national bank in the 1790s is fundamentally the same as our current argument over national healthcare. What were the arguments made back then? How valid were they? How valid are they today? 

We need to know where we came from. Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it, and all that jazz. And there's really no way to even start to look at how we got to where we are without some level of digging through the weeds and the details of history. Otherwise we end up in a world where fully half of Americans think the Civil War wasn't mainly about slavery.

It may be possible to go with a more generalized view of history in some areas, but there are a lot where the details are important for everyone to know. For example Reconstruction shouldn't be glossed over, as many of the policies set in place during that era led directly to Jim Crow laws and the current systemic racial inequalities we see today. Sure, we *could* just say ""And then we helped the South rebuild after the civil war, but it wasn't really equal for everyone""..... But does that really teach anything? In order for it to have value, the details are necessary."	2.0	0.0	751	False	True	0.0

Right now, streaming is operating under an oligopolistic competition. There are a few companies offering streaming services, all priced fairly similarly, and they compete through things such product differentiation - i.e. Netflix has these shows, Hulu has these different shows, and Prime Video has these other different shows. If a few streaming services dropped out, then there would be one or two services left, who would either find a common middle ground for pricing (likely well above what we pay for each service now), or engage in a price war until one closes down and the other can charge whatever it would like. Conversely, if you add more streaming services, production companies would see how beneficial it would be to not exclusively contract with one service, and begin offering their shows and movies to more services, thus solving the issue you have with streaming right now. 


This is a basic economic concept. Oligopolies work very well for things such as cell phones, and cars. Physical objects where there is tangible benefit from one over the other. They don't work as well for services such as cable, internet/cellular, and now streaming. These would all be much better as perfectly competitive markets, with relatively little product differentiation. The issue with how it applies to streaming is that streaming is resource heavy - you can't just open a streaming company on the dime. It takes a lot of server resources to do well. And that's the primary issue. There are very high barriers to entry for the streaming market. So while us as consumers would benefit a great deal from having 10 or 15 more reliable options, it doesn't seem plausible for the time being."	1.0	0.0	290	False	True	0.0

How would you prevent parents from expressing / discussing something that they believe deeply in with their children? Especially when they believe that their belief is a net positive in their lives, why would they want to exclude their children from that?

I don't disagree that religion can be problematic. I'm lifelong atheist myself, and my family never attended church or was otherwise religious. But that should be a personal choice for parents to make. Should parents also be banned from allowing their children to play video games, watch movies, or listen to certain kinds of music?

Should they be banned / prevented from discussing Cartesian philosophy with their children?

Religion, whether you agree with it or not, is part of many peoples' world views. You can't pick and choose which ideas parents are allowed to pass along to their kids. 

If you want to talk about banning harmful acts in the name of religion, fine. That's a different story.

But you can't prevent parents from talking to their children about, and even involving their children in, things that are not objectively harmful and potentially (at least in the parents' eyes) beneficial.

If you believe that you can legitimately do that, then the real question is, do you believe that the state should take children away to raise them according to a set standard? And then the question becomes-- who sets that standard?"	8.0	0.0	250	False	True	0.0

&gt;In what way is public ownership of the means of production compatible with capitalism?

By having the prices of goods, and the survival of companies dependent on a free market? Who owns the company doesn't matter as long as the market is free to work like it is supposed to.


&gt;It would be harder for companies to be successful if they are forced to be owned by their workers. 

Do you have any proof that this is true, or is it just a feeling you have?

I mean kinda, but not really? Restructuring companies obviously isn't easy, but it also should not cause them to collapse and lose all of their jobs. If it does then the anti-trust shit failed hard because instead of 2 possible choices you still go back to 1.

&gt;&gt;Why is this a bad thing

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well it is a big step toward worker ownership of companies, which is a major component of socialism.

Corporations, as they currently exist, are not a natural result of the invisible hand. They are not simply a byproduct of capitalism. A business does not become a corporation until the government issues a corporate charter. This allows an organization to act independently as a legal person. 

It also shields investors from liability exceeding their initial investment for anything done with their money. This is known as limited liability. 

There are trade offs for this limited liability though. First and foremost is a corporate income tax. In addition to this there are corporate regulations that must be followed. 

If the government were to determine that 40% worker control of leadership of a corporation as a condition of incorporation would be beneficial to society or the economy or whatever, then I dont really see the problem there. If such a prospect were too onerous, said organization is perfectly welcome to forego the benefits of limited liability. 

&gt;I think that it is a misinformed position. Generally when you break up companies, it is because they have acquired too much of their competition. That is not entirely the case with technology companies. Facebook, for example, isn't the most popular social media site because it has acquired all of its competition, but because it is simply the most popular. Same with Google. It hasn't acquired all the other search engines, it's just the most used and quite frankly, the best. How do you even break these companies up? And if you did, how would that affect the massive number of jobs these companies offer?

[List of acquisitions and mergers by facebook](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook). 76 of them. Including instagram and whatsapp. 

And google is no longer simply a search engine. It hasnt been for ages. In fact, since 2015, google has just been a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Which also owns... just so many things. There is a reason they named it alphabet. Google (alphabet) isnt simply a search engine any more than Amazon is a simple textbook retailer

Consider a uniformly conservative, Christian, western society or social group.  Will you see women parading around half-naked?  Highly discouraged.  One-night stands?  Nope, or at least not much.  No arranged marriages, but generally early marriages where it is both people's first sexual partner.  Divorce?  Highly discouraged.  Drinking?  Some Christian variations prohibit it, too.  Paying any attention to the social justice stuff?  Nope.

A good example, from what little I've observed, would be the mostly LDS (Mormon, but apparently they don't want to be called that any more) communities in Utah.  As far as I know you'll find very little in the way of drinking, sexual liberality, etc there—I think their major university, Brigham Young, even prohibits such things in its rules.

And, in such communities in modern western democracies at least (e.g. LDS in the US), they typically achieve all of this without executing or imprisoning people over it.  Ostracization is just as effective and causes a lot less damage.  Those LDS I've met in person have been excellent models of socially-conservative citizens who achieve everything you want to achieve, but without violence.

And you may be correct that such practices can enhance social cohesion.  In fact, that's precisely the difference between conservative and liberal moral values: conservatives emphasize social cohesion, whereas liberals emphasize individual autonomy (see Jonathan Haidt's book *The Righteous Mind*).

So what you're arguing for isn't Islam, it's social conservatism.  You might be better served looking to a variety of conservative societies in the west."	3.0	0.0	266	False	True	0.0

Do you really think that the majority of the women in those countries have a real choice in the matter? Where if they wanted a divorce they could actually get one? 

Firs consider whether the women in some of the countries you are looking up to even have the right to travel outside without being escorted by a male relative. Let alone making it to a court house to file a motion for divorce. 

Secondly consider, even if a women was able to make it to a courthouse and file the papers, would her husband let that be? Or will the husband be mad, and beat his wife and hold her hostage at home for the foreseeable future until she rethinks the divorce. If he doesn't outright kill her in a honor killing.

Sexual assault is even more complex.

&gt;According to that Wikipedia page, none of the top 10 countries (per capita) are Muslim.

Studies have been done on this and rape statistics are higher in a lot of western countries because people are much more likely to report that they were raped in western countries, and a lot more things are legally considered rape in western countries (spousal rape, for example) which are not even legally considered rape in Muslim nations.  Women in Muslim countries rarely report that they were raped when they were, because women are frequently literally murdered for having been raped.  And even when a woman does come forward to report a rape, in many Muslim countries, a woman cannot give legal testimony, so unless there was a male witness who will testify (women are not usually raped around impartial male witnesses), it's legally not considered to have happened.  Obviously this will produce MUCH lower official rape statistics than the actual number of rapes happening.  More detailed studies have found that there are high rates of rape - the vast majority of them just don't end up legally recognized as rape."	3.0	0.0	237	False	True	6.0

Again, I personally didn't find anything about it jarring or confusing when I was playing for the first time.  

&gt; I wasn't referring to the actual audio diaries, I was referring to how interactions between Jack and other characters is done entirely by the other person speaking through a system with a picture of them in the bottom right corner. And as I previously mentioned, the Tennenbaum interaction when you wake up is a good example. My point was that there was no face to face interaction.

Well yeah, that's for two reasons.  They're talking to YOU, the PLAYER. ""Interactions"" aren't going to happen, because in an interaction *you can choose what to do*.  In a video game, you can't... at best you can choose one of four complete sentences.  The game is partly ABOUT this lack of choice.

 And, it helped them avoid focusing on close-ups of the character models, so they didn't have to waste resources on lip sync or attractive faces.

&gt; Well what kind of game is that? Not about characters? Really?

Yes, really.  Why are you acting like this is weird?  Plenty of narratives are driven by themes and not characters (one author, who went so far as to devote pages to screeds about the way she thought society should go, comes to mind especially easily right now).

&gt; I think you're over-complicating it. It's a simple plot twist: You thought you were free, but you're actually not. It's interesting at first, but like I said, there's no character development and nothing changes.

What about the entire premise of the game, where a guy whose name is almost an anagram of Ayn Rand establishes Galt's Gulch at the bottom of the ocean, and everything goes to hell because there wasn't a government regulating the stuff they were doing down there?  I'm not sure you're on solid ground if you think there isn't a whole lot going on about freedom, choice, and agency, both in video games and in politics.  They sure spend a helluva lot of time talking about it.



&gt; For a game that is praised for it's supposed moral choices, the fact that its only moral choice is a black-and-white-kill-or-not-kill choice is inexcusable.

It's not praised for its moral choices, it's praised for its *thematic examination of morality vis-a-vis freedom*.  ALL video game morality is simplistic... there's a literal formula calculating how good or evil you are!  That's what this game is trying to EXPOSE... all that ""freedom"" in those other games is an illusion.

Even the most morally complex and interesting games (like KOTOR2 or Planescape: Torment) have absolutely 0 things interesting about the character's ability to choose morality.  They just have good writing when the characters DISCUSS morality."	7.0	0.0	501	False	True	2.0

That simply isn’t true.  The conditions in Gaza exist in large part because Israel has imposed a blockade on it.   They may or may not be *justified* in imposing the blockade, but that wasn’t OP’s original arguement.    Ending the blockade would immediately improve conditions in Gaza.   The impact that would have on Israeli security is a separate question.

Hamas’ poor economic policy may also be terrible and would also leave Gaza poor, but its hard to test that premise under the shadow of the blockade’s effect on the economy.

Edit: Clarifying on rereading—OP *is* arguing that the blockade is justified for security reasons, but he doesn’t really expand on that premise, just accepts the argument.  His title and first paragraph still put most of the concrete blame on Hamas for the material conditions, though.

Edit2: Further reflection on how to stage it more clearly. OP basic idea is that Israel is not the “primary” cause of the humanitarian situation.   It really depends on what is meant by “primary.”   The causal chain basically goes:

Hamas seizes power—&gt;Israel faces a security threat from Hamas—&gt;Israel imposes a blockade with the dual goals of minimizing the threat and pushing Hamas out of power—&gt;the blockade results in humanitarian crisis

They just don’t like to talk about the second goal, because starving people out to force them to change their government isn’t really a legitimate policy tool.

If the goal was purely to ensure security, there are options for that like screening incoming shipments for weapons, finding ways to monitor the end use of supplies, etc.   Now, maybe Hamas rejects those, but then it becomes easier to argue that this is all Hamas’s fault and not just a punitive strategy."	3.0	0.0	131	False	True	2.0

All reviews serve a purpose just as all news sources serve a purpose, regardless of bias. Together, they build a collective picture of an experience. 

Do I trust the NYT critic of cold sesame noodles more than I trust the Yelp reviewer who thinks it tastes like Skippy peanut butter? Maybe. Do I trust my friend’s opinion of a movie more than the Academy that feels in service to an agenda? Maybe. But together, all these reviews help paint a picture. I actually think individual consumer reviews have a greater sense of bias within them. Additionally, consumer reviews often lack the experience to tell a full story. An “expert” from IGN on a video game comes from someone that plays a ton of games and recognizes the variety within them. A review from my friend Trent comes from someone who likes puzzle games, so I end up playing Uncharted and Tomb Raider for weeks. 

Regardless of information source or purpose, solely trusting a single source of truth is madness. Look for biases. Find supplemental sources. Lean into sources you trust. But use the collective information you have readily available, even the “experts.”"	4.0	0.0	220	False	True	0.0

* Or they reveal little details about the show you may have missed (most of the AV Club reviews are like this).

God also can't want things, otherwise God is limited and not God insofar as God is supposed to be perfect or complete in any sense which theological accounts presuppose or explicitly assert. Wanting is tied to lacking. 

It seems like you're dealing with some exoteric watered down Christianity that's been oversimplified and reduced into absurdities. Complete waste of time. Some Christians understood what I said, others did not. You want to focus on the ones who understood, because they're the ones articulate enough to explain their positions reasonably as opposed to reciting scripture at you and/or just appealing to faith or revelation or whatever. 

I am not a Christian but I think if you want to deal with the matters of freedom and God, you shouldn't be concerned with summations of material that are mostly aimed at the unphilosophical general public and need to look into Aquinas, Augustine, or Kant - or comparable philosophers or secondary works on these sorts of philosophers. And I say that not as an Aquinian, Augustinian, or Kantian either - their work on these matters is valuable however even if they aren't the ""end of the story"" so to speak. 

Right now you're likely just dealing with several degrees of seperation from the works that inspired these kinds of watered down summaries, and you won't get anywhere in understanding why people relate freedom to God or why they think there is free will by doing that.

I am not so much aiming to change your title view here, but just saying you are looking completely in the wrong places if you want to understand ""Christian perspective"" or ""God"" or ""free will"" or their relation."	12.0	0.0	302	False	True	0.0

It's like a kid asking a parent why they don't just quit their job if they're unhappy. The logic seems flawless but it's a nuanced and complex situation that requires a much deeper understanding of desire, money, capitalism, love, taxes, life in general, etc. So while it's a fair point to ask ""why wouldn't God just do ___?"" you have to at least acknowledge that it's coming from a place of extremely little knowledge of an infinitely complex issue. 

Secondly, if all God wanted were entities to worship him endlessly and without resistance, he would have never needed to create humans, or the universe even. Angels fill the role much better than humans ever could. Granted they don't fit the role perfectly as they did have a chance to disobey, but they were given one chance instead of endless chances like humans.

So we can assume that humans were created with a different purpose in mind than being programmed robots that sing his praises day in and day out. Most theologically savy people would tell you he created us to love him and love others. Love by definition is a choice, so at the very root of the why we were created revolves around choosing to love or hate. Having a choice creates a true relationship, one that actually means something and isn't a Furby repeating how much it loves you. 

Lastly, determinism is a big part of certain Christian theologies. Predestination is the term that's used more frequently. This creates a whole new argument about whether it's fair or just for God to determine your life choices for you, but God and determinism don't conflict as much as a lot of people assume."	9.0	0.0	307	False	True	0.0

I don't think minimum wage is significant enough to do with losing the manufacturing industry. In the US minimum wage barely increased yet manufacturing jobs decreased dramatically. I don't think it's significant enough to pin it on increasing minimum wage. I think the lower cost of living and labor force outside of the US will lure the jobs away regardless.

Your workers will need $7/hr to be able to sell their labor. If you pay them $4/hr, they can't afford food, utility, etc and they will cease to exist so there will be a ""natural"" cost of living minimum wage even if we have no federal mandated minimum wage. Comparing this barrier, if you go to Thailand or Malaysia for manufacturing, they can live like kings with just $1/hr. There is no way US labor force \*can\* be competitive when the cost of living is just that much higher.

There is no ownership of any individuals, so it isn't slavery. The servitude isn't truly involuntary, since membership in the community that imposes these laws is voluntary.

If you wish to speak colloquially rather than literally, then this argument quickly becomes a meaningless one. Every single guarantee that any legal system offers us has got conditions attached. For example, throwing someone in prison for any reason breaks the conditions imposed in the Bill of Rights, yet we do not say that Americans have no rights.

America's democracy was founded on raging debates, name-calling, smears, and sabotaging of opposing ideas, and we’ve withstood almost 240 years of push and pull without completely unraveling the thread that binds us as a society. I wish we could have heated debates without the nastiness of trolls, doxxers and general ugliness found on Twitter/Facebook/Reddit, but the ‘high road’ progressives have taken for the past couple of generations have lost out to modern media, especially in the echo chambers of cable news and bespoke content on social media. This is where push comes to shove.

Everyone now has a microphone and platform to broadcast from, and our conversations have turned from heated arguments over traditional things like taxation and healthcare to systemic crises like equality, civil/social rights, and science denial. Marches, protests and published opinions are much less effective than they were, and now encourage flame wars and shout-downs from the opposition. It’s fair to call out and shame anyone attempting to drag us back into Jim Crow or endanger the whole of society for small inconveniences at a personal level. I love seeing someone being shamed after throwing a tantrum in a Target over their mask display, coughing on folks who observe social distancing or calling cops on a bird-watcher for the crime of being Black. If outing these folks creates a ripple effect where their employer decides actions don’t match their values and people lose their jobs, well, too bad. These would be the same folks who call for strong, hard justice coming down on people breaking our laws or tenets of their faith. It makes me queasy to see families and (especially) kids dragged into this. and I don’t have an answer for that.

For decades we all shared the same sources for information — courtesy of airwaves licensed by our government, and required to provide news in a neutral way in exchange — and as result, we were debating from a common starting point. That no longer exists and we have to find better ways to come back to the middle and resolve our differences. Until then though, this deeply liberal, middle-aged, and privileged white guy will celebrate anyone who turns weapons so effectively, brilliantly used by the extreme right against them.

His people will be very clear with him if he has any doubts. Trump may leave threatening legal action, he may leave pouting and crying, but it is highly unlikely force is required to remove him.


* If he tried to delay the election on some COVID19 nonsense, and the electors could not be seated in time, he would still stop being President on January 20th at noon, we would have President Pelosi, should she still be speaker of the house.

And his people have already probably told him that.

* If he wins, we will hear this same argument in four years, that Trump wants to stay in office, and that will not happen. I would go so far as to say constitutional changes cannot happen in today’s divided political environment, getting enough votes is currently impossible. Getting enough states to agree is currently impossible.

China and Russia just extended or removed their term limits for example, in rubber stamp near unanimous votes. With the USA that wouldn’t happen. If republicans tried it between 2020 and 2024 (if Trump won) democrats would throw the biggest tantrum in history and there would be mass riots. If democrats tried it while a democrat were in office republicans would throw the same tantrum, and there would be mass riots.

There would be no near unanimous vote, it would be the ugliest political fight in our lives and it would fail.  No matter who tried or how much of government they controlled."	70.0	0.0	473	False	True	0.0

But to modify your view here:

&gt;CMV: The ""root"" of the US healthcare crisis could simply be the food we eat.

I'd say that the ""root"" is deeper, and has more to do with economics, which strongly impact people's choices about what they eat.

In particular, relative to many other advanced countries, the U.S. *massively* subsidizes sugar. A candy bar in many Western European countries will cost you 2-3x what it does in the U.S., and that is majorly down to U.S. sugar subsidies.

Beyond sugar:

""Writing in the 2004 *Annual Review of Nutrition*, James Tillotson, a professor of food policy and international business at Tufts University, argues that U.S public policy encourages obesity at the expense of sound nutritional practices. “You have a whole régime here that’s worked to increase agricultural efficiency,” Tillotson says. And what U.S. farmers are most efficient at producing, he says, are just a few highly subsidized crops—wheat, soybeans, and especially corn.

Support for these few crops, critics say, has compelled farmers to ignore other crops such as fruits, vegetables, and other grains. The market is flooded with products made from the highly subsidized crops, including sweeteners in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fats in the form of hydrogenated fats made from soybeans, and feed for cattle and pigs. This flood, in turn, drives down the prices of fattening fare such as prepackaged snacks, ready-to-eat meals, fast food, corn-fed beef and pork, and soft drinks. Worse yet, some scientists say, paltry support for foods other than these staples increases the contrast between prices of fat-laden, oversweetened foods and those of healthier alternatives, offering poor folks little choice but to stock their pantries with less nutritious foods."" \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247588/)\]

You're not away from the hormone riddled existence of teen years, this impetus lasts on into mid 20s, indeed there is a great deal more sexual learning and experimenting going on in college than high-school. Its not bad to still be a virgin, but having no sexual experience at all is worth taking note of and working on. That being said, a lot of what you said reveals that you know nothing about it and are making all sorts of assumptions. 'If I found a partner as an adult, why would I want to have sex with her?' Trust me when you're in that scenario you will *not* have to ask that question.

Furthermore, it sounds like you're hinting that you're lacking sexual desire, or feel like you won't be able to perform. Stop watching porn, it totally fucks your sexual programming up and will absolutely drain you of sexual drive, leading one to question why women and sex are even appealing to everyone else, because your brain isn't sending you horny hormones since it thinks you just got laid the previous however-many-nights you've wacked off. Maybe you're not watching any porn but just in case, don't, because it causes the very problem you're afraid of.

You're too far removed from the scenario of sexual interaction to have a clear view on it, and I'm betting your shame/fear about being an adult virgin is getting to your head, both of them. I just got through a very short, very intense interaction with what was a brand new acquaintance. She threw herself at me, no feeling involved, and was probably trying to manipulate me for her own reasons, but I could smell it and guarded against it while trying to enjoy her graciousness. I've had the same thoughts you've put here before, and felt like I might be slipping away from my hormones, from my virility as a man. She proved me wrong given how many boners I got from mere touching and kissing, and the fire it lit in me I had forgotten existed. I didn't even like her and actively knew she was trying to dominate me, which was fun to allow her to think, but that would usually cancel out sexual attraction for me. I don't like evil people, I don't like sex being manipulative. Still, my hormones had me ready to bat. I guarantee if you find someone you actually love and find attractive, you won't have a hard time finding yourself. Stop thinking about it so much and go live life. You're a virgin at 18, you have some catching up to do. Go mess around with some people and try not to hurt anyone and watch your feelings but don't be surprised if they get hurt anyway.

&gt;So whores want a man whos been with dozens of women before them?

Careful. You're sounding very much like an incel with that one. It might shock you, but the number of people someone's been with isn't a huge factor for a lot of people. A lot of the focus and perceived judgment on ""virginity"" is perpetuated by virgins and teenagers who are finding another way to antagonize their peers.

Firstly, the ""study"" had users rate an individual's attractiveness and then tracked their message sending. Despite rating men as less attractive than a standard bell curve, women sent an expected number of messages. Assuming that means women think men are unappealing or that women have too high standards is kind of ridiculous. 

A) maybe a dating website *isn't* a normal bell curve of attractiveness. 

B) maybe women are conditioned to be less comfortable opening admitting sexual attraction to strangers, particularly in a potentially sexual situation. 

C) maybe women dont base their level of attraction solely on physical attraction to a photograph so they wouldn't rate people as very attractive without getting to know them. 

D)or maybe the physical things women do find attractive are harder to convey in a photo than the physical things men find attractive. 

E)maybe men on Ok cupid, on average, put less effort into their photos than women did. 

F)maybe a dating website from a time when dting websites were less ubiquitous is just a bad, self selected group of subjects. 

G)maybe there were other factors that affected women's ratings more than men - like maybe they were unconsciously taking things like clothing, props, backgrounds, or even usernames into account in their ratings. 

H) maybe women rate men as below average attraction more often because they view themselves as below their level of attraction also. If my siblings are super smart, I might think of myself as relatively dumb. And if I think (rightfully) you're about as smart as i am, wouldn't I probably rate you as below average intelligence too? The issue there isn't your intelligence or even my perception of it, its that my whole baseline is shifted - my idea of intelligence isn't a standard bell curve.  

But most importantly, the ""research"" found that men disproportionately messaged the women they rated as most attractive while the women messaged a much broader range of people. 2/3 of men only messaged the top 1/3 of women, but women's messages almost exactly mirrored their attractiveness rating - ie, *they may have rated men as being less physically attractive but were* **far** *more likely to give them a chance and try to get to know them.*

No one wants to own something if they're not sure they will be able to sell it right away if the norm is that they are always able to sell it immediately. If the status-quo shifted such that there were an expectation of lower liquidity then the steady-state investment would surely remain roughly equivalent - lower liquidity wouldn't reduce peoples desire to earn capital gains. Is there another factor to this I'm not understanding? 

So you are acknowledging that there would be a shift from one status quo to another and that expectation of liquidity is currently of value. Do you not then see that shifting from scenario A where you have liquidity which you find valuable, to scenario B where you have less of said liquidity, would lead prices to move lower?

&gt; Surely this risk mitigation could be achieved through more traditional insurance models without being significantly disruptive. The effect should be the same but would limited to hedging the risk for the people who produce the commodities. Letting others who have no stake in the market hedge against it is like letting random people take out an insurance policy against me crashing my car. 

It's interesting that you bring up insurance, because insurance companies also use derivatives extensively to hedge. You should look into reinsurance companies and how they hedge the exposure they take on from retail insurers. It can get pretty esoteric, hedging disaster insurance like floods or fires with things like weather derivatives (which yes actually exist). These types of derivatives are also used in agriculture to hedge for things like crop yield fluctuations as well. Letting people who have no stake in the market take on risks associated with said market is a fundamental element of insurance.

&gt; I'll need to think more on this. 

Ok, but it's fundamentally no different from any other type of hedging."	3.0	0.0	336	False	True	2.0

If you're part of the 'out group', I think a fascist society would be as bad if not worse (scratch that, definately worse) than a communist society. 
Also, the metric of 'worse' is incredibly subjective. I recently had a long discussion with someone who grew up in East Germany, and they said that although there were some things they found 'bizarre' and wrong (the Stasi, state surveillance, etc), they considered their childhood a happy one. On a much more extreme note, I think people living under Nazism would report similar experiences - afterall, if your society tells you something is right and moral, I guess you start to believe it. In fact, I have a book somewhere which has the first hand accounts and experiences of children living in WW2 (the interviews were conducted in the early 2000s), and I remember reading it being surprised to find how many children living in Nazi Germany, blissfully unaware of the genocide and extreme anti-Semitic violence happening under their noses, reported enjoying their childhoods (although they of course now know that that enjoyment was shrouded in darkness and war crimes). I'll try and find the book and put some of the testimonies in it in the comments.

However where i would disagree with you is on two points: a) whether or not the kind of regime they would choose would really be definitively a ""fascist"" one, and b) whether or not fascism or communism presents more danger to a society  


For my first point, i would argue that in all intents and purposes, ""fascism"" as a political ideology is all but dead.  the people who genuinely agitate for it are hyper-marginal, and more often its used as a political epithet against people deemed to be authoritarian than an actual descriptive tool with any connection with the fascism of interwar europe.  for example, politicians like Marine le Pen, Donald Trump and Matteo Salvini, three people often called ""fascists"" today, I'd say have both different ideologies, and are nevertheless much more in the middle than genuine fascists were.  All three I'd argue are better called ""national conservatives"", who are basically pro-capitalism and pro-status quo, but want less immigrants, more sovereignty over their affairs, and are less committed to traditional allies (but still generally committed).  Le Pen is more anti-laissez faire than the other two are, and someone like Jair Bolsonaro, another person I'd include in this category, is more socially conservative.  But I'd still say they're not fascists; they're basically a kind of conservative.   


Now, if those with power were to be seriously threatened again, there could be a resurgence of fascism, or something similar.  My guess would be it would be the kinds of societies they would create would be the same, but the actual ideology itself would be  a lot different, just because of how much fascism is despised today.  But who knows.  


  


For my second point, I'd say that genuine fascism, real fascism, is far more dangerous than Communism.  By ""Communism"", i'm assuming you are and I will be referring to Marxist Leninist states that followed the Soviet model.  Those states, while repressive and tolerant of mass starvation for economic goals, did not advocate for the enslavement or extermination of huge swathes of Earth's population through conquest.  The Soviets did not embark on the most cataclysmic war the world has ever seen in order to slaughter ""subhumans"".  Communist aggression was typically defensive in nature; Stalinist ideology spoke of the need to build ""socialism in one country"" while the world proletariat inevitably rose up against capitalism elsewhere, which would be aided by the Soviets.  Therefore, what aggression they and the Chinese undertook was generally taking territory in their immediate vicinity to PREVENT a greater war, not cause one.  The Soviets and Chinese invaded Finland, Vietnam, the Baltic states, etc. when they were all but positive that a greater war would not break out, and that they would not have to conquer huge amounts of land, and when they felt threatened by another power.  Fascism by its very nature encourages conquest, especially Nazism.  With conquest comes an enormous new population to exploit, and the fascists were eager to do so.  The Nazis went even further, and outright wanted to kill most of the population in its occupied territories to pave the way for German settlement in those areas.  That's what the Generalplan Ost planned for.    


Fascism sought to re-establish earlier forms of European imperialism onto other countries in Europe for nationalistic purposes; European imperialism in Africa, the British settler colonies, all of those would be reborn by fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and took to new levels and heights with as much of the surrounding peoples they could conquer.    


Lastly, I'd say that Communism's fall was so devastating to some countries just because of the way the transition was handled.  Compare the transition to capitalism in Russia to the transition in China; Russia's was called ""shock therapy"", and was coordinated by western free-marketeer economists who wanted to test their theories further like they did in Chile in the previous decades.  It was a disaster; Russia saw a catastrophic decrease in economic output and quality of life that it has taken decades to recover from.  China, on the other hand, took a very gradualist approach and introduced reforms slowly, to the point where now China is in competition with the US to be the world's biggest economy.  Reforming society post-Communism isn't always a disaster like it was in many of the post-Communist states."	6.0	0.0	768	False	True	0.0

Before the USSR, the Russian Empire was technically a constitutional monarchy but the czar had absolute power. Of course the transition to capitalist democracy following the fall of the USSR would be challenging in comparison to the transition from Nazi germany to post-war democracy. Germany was fascist for  less than a decade, so most Germans had lived in a democracy already. Compare that to the USSR, where no one in all of Russian history had lived in a democracy before. 

To really compare how fascist and communist countries return to a democracy, you’d need to look at 2 countries which had similar government systems beforehand and were communist/fascist for about the same amount of time. I don’t know of any two countries like that off the top of my head, which makes sense since communism and fascism arise from different types of societal issues. I think it’s really difficult to make any accurate comparison between the two."	1.0	0.0	191	False	True	0.0

**It is possible to objectify  people in ways other than sexual.**

(before getting into this I just want to clarify the topic of objectivation is a lot more complicated than most people make it out to be, people freak out about the idea which means that the word comes with a lot of negative connotations, the reason I mention this is because I am not using this word as an attack against you but rather because the use of the term is needed to deconstruct your feelings about women so you can understand them better.) anyway back to the main point

**It is possible to objectify people in ways other than sexual.**

you are using women as a metric to evaluate your sense of self-worth.  This doesn't feel like objectivation to you because it isn't sexual as illustrated by your statement here.

&gt;while I actually really want to have a loving and caring relationship with a girl. I value cuddling more than sex, to put it plainly. In fact, I don’t really care about sex that much

Regardless it is still objectivation , instead of being on object of sex you are thinking about women in terms of them being a tool to measure your value.  We can see this in a number of ways. One, the very fact that you identify as an incel, the fact that you are particular focused on virginity, the use of words that are intrinsically about ranking people according to sexual status.

&gt;they don’t want to talk to me, because women see anyone who isn’t chad or a clown as subhuman  
&gt;  
&gt;Yay, so I can get women when they are old, ugly, and used up? That makes me soooo happy :/  
&gt;  
&gt;I want my first time to also be her first time, and for us both to be teenagers

all of these things are about framing relationships as a metric by which to rank yourself not about the relationship itself.

So why is this a problem? well like I said it's still a from of objectivation which means that instead focusing on actual specific people and actual relationships you are focused on an imaginary relationship with a people you don't know but have projected a personality onto.

By your own admission you haven't talked to these women, and your reasoning for wanting to be with them isn't based on anything personal about them or even based on what the actual real world relationship would be, you just like the idea of them validating you as a partner in some way.  Ask yourself this if you asked one of these women out and they said yes what would happen next? do you actually have something specific you want to do with them?  My guess is not really, and the reason for that is because your desire to be with them isn't personal.  Your not looking at your options and evaluating which women would best connect with you personally your imposing onto women ideas about which one would best validate you if they choose to date you.  Things like are they hot? are they socially valued by my peers?  In this way you treat them as objects, imagined versions of themselves.(notice how none of these things are actually descriptions of their personalities.)  In short you have convinced yourself that your attraction to them is personal and then vilify them as being shallow, in reality your approach is just as shallow.

To clarify being attracted to people in this way doesn't make you bad, everyone does it.  The problem you are having is that you pretend that you don't do it, which makes you resentful towards others and will prevent you from interacting and getting to know women personally because the personality you project onto them stops you from realizing who little you know about them in reality.

&amp;#x200B;

a quick fix for this is to stop thinking about interacting with people as a way to win them over but rather as a way to see if the 2 of you are compatible, this works with romantic and plutonic relationships.  Doing this will make you interaction revolve around what you actually have in common and how compatible you are instead a vaguely defined game of social interaction that can be won and lost, which is both un productive andtypically very awkward."	15.0	0.0	759	False	True	0.0

Assuming you're referring to your own attitude toward women, the solution is simple: become the type of person whose mindset would not make them hate you.

As many people have said in this thread, the best way for you to change your view is to first work on yourself. Through therapy, through building on your confidence and not hating yourself, and eventually through making friends of both genders. You need to stop assuming you know things. I don't know how many times you've been rejected but it's clear that those instances had a large negative effect on your confidence and defined your worldview, even if it was just a few times.

Would you say you are *afraid* to bring it up to your family? You mention that it would be annoying (point 3) but I'm curious if you think they would be mad. You note that you don't feel oppressed, but what would your family do if they found out you had sex with men?

&gt;I don't consider this a core part of my identity and so don't feel any desire to do so.

Honestly, that's all the more reason to do it. That is to say, if you are surrounded by people who mention their sexuality casually instead of dramatically, it seems reasonable to assume that you'd take sexuality less seriously or see it as less unusual. It's the same reason why cisgender allies list their pronouns: because if everyone lists their preferred pronouns, it's less cumbersome for trans people to do it. If you see your sexuality as a casual part of your identity, then saying so might help people see sexuality as a casual thing. It shows you don't need to be hyper-intense about your sexuality in order to be ""not straight"".

&gt;If I did come out, it would require explanation of all of the above.

Why, exactly? Couldn't you just say ""I'm bisexual""? Your argument is that people don't need to know things, but you seem adamant that if you told your family about being bisexual you would *have* to add the fact that you only like having sex with men and don't like kissing them or falling in love with them or anything like that. It basically sounds like you're afraid of what they'll think about you."	5.0	0.0	286	False	True	0.0

You seem to be defining ""very religious"" from your own perspective versus that of an atheist, which is going to be difficult. Why? Because each individual will have their own definition of ""very religious"" and they'll define it according to their own personal scale. For example, as an agonistic atheist myself, if you had to ask me to define some sort of ""how religious are you"" scale, I'd do so in the following way:

* **Not Religious**: a person who does not believe in any religion.
* **Kind of Religious**: A person who unconvincingly follows a religion because it might be all they've really known and are part of the community, and may or may not really believe in what the religion says.
* **Religious**: Believes in a religion and willingly participates in religious activities.
* **Very Religious**: Believes in a religion and willingly participates in public religious activities as well as private practicing (strict about praying; abides by dietary restrictions; does not waiver in faith; etc.).
* **Extremist Religious**: Believes so much in a religion that it completely consumes them and leads to irrational tendencies.

This isn't going to be perfect because it's off the top of my head, but you get the point. To me, you would probably be classified as ""Very Religious"" because it's something that you consider in every aspect of your life: you chant, you dress the part, you give offerings, you think about it when you make decisions... The diet thing isn't really a disqualifier for me in this scenario because you check off so many boxes and every religion is open to interpretation by the individual to the point at which they'll disagree on some major and minor points. Even if that may not be the case, it's almost always the case that individuals will pick and choose the aspects of the religion they follow, often out of personal convenience or due to some other reason.

Now, take your perspective as a religious individual as part of a community of other religious individuals. You're going to have your own scale because you're exposed to, and can recognize, other individuals who may be obviously more devout than yourself. Your atheist friend might not be capable of recognizing the nuances within that group. This is a common pattern when you don't understand, or haven't been exposed to, something. For example, if I were to watch a chess match, I might not be able to tell who's better between two players because I'm unfamiliar with high level chess, whereas someone experienced would be able to follow and criticize. To me, both players may be really good chess players, but that might not be true to the experienced chess player because the scales are different."	1.0	0.0	471	False	True	0.0

&gt;I also celebrate Hindu festivals at the temple,and, and spend time thinking about what I am grateful for, I don't eat beef and I have traditional clothes to wear during rituals.

Each of these things on its own would be something that would qualify you as very religious to me.  The fact that you do all of them puts you very firmly into the ""very religious"" camp.

However, this just gets into the vagueness of the term ""very religious"".  It's a spectrum of varying degrees of religiousness.  Where we draw the line between ""somewhat religious"" and ""very religious"" is arbitrary.  To someone who isn't religious at all, anything more than a token participation in religion might feel ""very religious"".  However, someone who is following every tenet of their religion might view that same level of just more than token involvement to be not religious at all.

For perspective, I was raised Reform Jewish and I left the religion.  I consider the Modern Orthodox sect of Judaism to be extremely religious to the point that calling them ""very religious"" is an understatement.  However, I'm also active on /r/ex-jew and have had a lot of conversations with people with other backgrounds on that sub.  For some of the people there, switching to Modern Orthodox represents a drop in how religious they are.  As a result, there are groups that I consider ""very religious"" that they consider ""not religious"".  It's a matter of perspective.

Thinking about it that way, I'm sure there are people who wouldn't call you religious at all.  But it would also be fair for someone who is less religious than you to call you very religious."	2.0	0.0	325	False	True	0.0

I don't see sufficient evidence to believe an analyst can accurately predict the future price. If he/she has such a predictive power, he/she should've quitted the job and made money by his/herself.

There is a few issues there.

* Just because they don't *know* the future price doesn't mean they can't be slightly better than the market at predicting it.  Even slightly better than market can make it worth listening to.
* Making a slightly better than market return doesn't necessarily mean you'll make more money doing that as your main job.  For example, Jim Cramer makes $5 million/year salary.  Even if his full estimated $100 million net worth was invested into stocks, he would have to beat the market by a full 5% in order to top what he gets paid as an analyst.  Even then it is still riskier and may just not be as enjoyable for him.
* Sell-side equity research influences the market, so even if it really was no better than throwing darts, its a factor that could influence the price so belongs in your research just like anything else that can influence company price.

&gt; Some people may argue that we can accumulate knowledge reading sell-side equity research. However, could you generate superior return above index by knowing more? I don't think so because what you learned is already known by other rich investors who would have more significant influence on market prices.

This isn't even about the past, really.  It is what it is.  We can clean it up but cleaning up after the fact isn't a good as preventing the mess in the first place.  

So can *consumers* stop producers from producing in a messy fashion?  No.  At best they can not reward producers who make huge messes, but the mess is there at that point. 

The only entities who can prevent producers from making messes are producers.  They'll only do it if we use the tool of government to create the guidelines and regulations and other guardrails that will lead them to least messy production choices. 

After the fact is too late, and it's the only lever consumers have.  Before a mess is made is the perfect time, and that's something voters and their elected representatives can do."	20.0	0.0	216	False	True	3.0

That is true, but that would only apply if firing the taser wasn't the right call to be made at that moment.

The charm of basketball is constant back and forth scoring, where soccer is the opposite where a single goal could win the game. The charm baseball and football is that they are turn-based sports in a sense, while soccer is free flowing. The charm of hockey is that it is a super fast game dialed up to 11 the whole time, while soccer is a more patient and energy efficient game (hockey is a sprinter, soccer is a marathoner).

What I am trying to say is that the endurance elements of soccer, where you only have a handful of subs, is part of what makes soccer soccer. That is why extra time soccer is so interesting. You can see that the players are absolutely gassed, and yet they keep on pushing. Yes, you could have unlimited subs, but then soccer would simply turn into hockey on grass. Yes, the offense could be more explosive and then there would be a lot more goals, but then it would become basketball played with your feet.

So yes, substitution would improve certain components of soccer, but perhaps that would change soccer to a point where it becomes something else. To me, this sound like making the hurdles shorter to allow sprinters to run faster. If the shot put were lighter, you could throw it further. If long jumpers could jump off a springboard, they could jump further. If target shooters could use a computer programed rig, they would shoot more accurately. All these things would make their respective sports ""better,"" but they would change it to the point where the spirit of the sport is no longer the same. I believe that making soccer faster and more intense would ruin the spirit of soccer in a similar fashion."	4.0	0.0	304	False	True	0.0

Limited substitutions means the effects of injuries, fatigue, players being cautious on a yellow card, or just failed choices that aren't changeable are further reduced, and that benefits the team that has more resources.

Having unlimited substitutions would make squad depth that much more important, and that only benefits those who can afford the costs.

It would vastly reduce the efficacy of cards. Often players take yellows to prevent a promising attack, or they use ""rotational fouling"" where no one player fouls an opponent enough to get a yellow/red for persistent foul play. Unlimited subs would mean you could bring players on for the sole purpose of committing fouls, disrupting the game, and killing attacks.

My other concern is that substitutions take time and are already used to disrupt the flow of a game. Having unlimited subs would slow the game right down. You could always go for roll on/roll off subs but that would involve an overhaul to the way subs are made and require extra refereeing (could make things difficult at lower levels). It would certainly add delays though, as if a coach wants to put out five defensive players for a set piece or corner, that's five on that need to take up positions. Same for attacking plays from corners or long throws. The one thing football doesn't need is people wasting more time.

I also think there's something to be said in favour of limitations. It means that the way the game is initially approached matters much more. How a team sets up for a game isn't a trivial decision. Formations are more rigid as wholesale changes can't be made, and we get to see strategies and tactics play out over 90 minutes rather than be in a state of flux in which the system constantly changes. I also think the level of organisation required in football systems wouldn't lend itself to chopping and changing so much anyway (I suppose that might be a plus to your side as teams wouldn't actually utilise their subs too often). Personally, I don't want to see a constantly shifting game, I want to see whether a team's tactics work over 90 minutes."	3.0	0.0	384	False	True	2.0

Instead, I'd like to try and take a shot at this belief:

&gt;I don't think white fragility is racism

First lets get the definition of white fragility clear because a lot of things have been proposed in these comments. In a nutshell, white fragility typically refers to the **discomfort that many white people feel when discussing racial issues, possibly accompanied by defensiveness.** It's not just ""saying anything non-affirming about race"" or ""disagreeing with a person of color,"" as I read in a few comments here. Let's look at a few examples:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Person A: ""Hey your remarks earlier were racially insensitive to our coworker.""  
Person B: ""Oh no it's ok I'm not racist. I went to a march last year.""

Person B is exhibiting fragility because they are attempting to absolve themself of wrongdoing, while ignoring the real harm they may have caused. They are taking a defensive stance rather than listening to feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Person A: ""Black lives matter""  
Person B: ""No, all lives matter""

The ""all lives matter"" retort to the BLM movement is indeed an example of white fragility. Person B is misinterpreting the BLM slogan as an attack against themself, ignoring that the slogan is a rather a statement about the widespread disregard for the well being of people of color.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Person A: ""Something needs to be done about police brutality against minorities.""  
Person B: ""Not all people are racist, it's just a few bad apples.""

Person B is exhibiting fragility by excusing individual actions, thereby distancing themself from the harm being caused even though that wasn't what was being discussed. They are therefore ignoring the systematic racism that perpetuated those individual actions.

&amp;#x200B;

White fragility tends to deflect the conversation away from the problem of *institutional* racism and focuses on denying *individual* racism, which is problematic because in order to combat institutional racism, we must be aware of its existence and our inevitable part in it.

In summary, white fragility doesn't mean you specifically hold racist beliefs. White fragility is considered racist because it perpetuates systematic racism."	29.0	0.0	376	False	True	0.0

For others, the idea is foolish. This is along the lines of those, like Musk, who view space colonization as a way to escape a dying Earth. The obvious question is ""if we can create a civilization on a barren moon, then why wouldn't we just do that but on the barren Earth."" A variation of this is also just the criticism that we are spending resources on moving off of Earth instead of fixing it. Or the fear that this is just a way for rich people to escape the problems they've helped create. 

Finally, the reason to care about the environment in space is actually really about conserving it for future generations. If we can't survive in space sustainably, then all we are doing is making it that much harder for people in the future. If we are relying on mining or using up natural resources then eventually those will dry up and future generations will be forced to travel even further or work harder or solve these problems.

Or throw it into the sun if we're worried it'll hit a space marmot in 90,000 years.

That's...not how orbits work.

If you just throw something in a random direction, it will be in approximately the orbit you were, and it will pass through (roughly) the same place relative to the body it's orbiting repeatedly. The more we do that, the more we increase the probability of colliding with something near the bodies we visit frequently.

If you actually want to make it not a problem, you need to throw it out of the solar system, which takes a *lot* of energy. It's easier the further out you are, but even if you're near Jupiter's orbit, you still need to throw things at about 5 km/s to get them to leave the solar system.

Throwing it into the sun is actually even *harder*. To throw things out of the solar system you need to increase their velocity by about 40% of your current velocity around the sun....to throw them *into* the sun you need to decrease their velocity by more than half of its current velocity around the sun. And increasing and decreasing velocities are equally difficult in space.

In short ""throw it into the sun"" and ""chuck it into space so that we'll never need to worry about it"" are both *much* more expensive than more traditional waste management."	415.0	0.0	259	False	True	2.0

For instance, the client might not have fully informed the contractor.

However, legal challenges/changes in the law make the government unable to get the land by the time the contract says. Getting rid of the contract now would be inefficient, far more inefficient than waiting for the legal issues to be resolved. Additionally, events outside of the control of both parties could slow things down or spike the cost without it being an inefficient action. Natural disasters, international conflicts, or supply chain disruption could all be problems without any inefficiencies.

That’s not to say inefficiency doesn’t exist. Humans aren’t perfect, and every project will have some limit to how efficient it can be. There are also real examples of incompetence or corruption slowing construction. Whether these are the root cause of the widespread slowdown you are concerned about, however, isn’t clear.

Finally, it is also possible that this apparent inefficiency is simply a function of our current world. It is possible that all major projects that you are concerned with are operating at their peak efficiency, and any efforts to clamp down on the hypothetical corruption or incompetence would lead to even more cost overruns.

As it stands, the United States does not have a problem with getting *necessary* infrastructure.

* [94% of Americans have access to *both* high speed land broadband and 4G mobile broadband] (https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/fourteenth-broadband-deployment-report).
* We spend well over $300 billion annually across federal, state, and local infrastructure appropriations in the United States, and the focus on infrastructure has resulted in [a drop in ""poor"" ratings for bridges] (https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-highway-bridges) and [improved road conditions] (https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-roadways-functional-system).

The one thing that isn't addressed in these is so-called ""sustainable development,"" which is not understood as infrastructure in normal conversation.  Even still, the number of social programs specifically targeting poverty and disadvantaged populations is rising overall.

Poor estimation methods can factor into it, but that's not really the heart of the problem.  I'll try to explain because I do this for a living.

When you're quoting a large multi-year project that's going to cost millions or billions of dollars you get some requirements that you use to generate the quote.  Those requirements vary in level of detail.  Where there isn't enough detail you make assumptions and estimate.

One of the ways that you get into cost overruns is that your assumptions were wrong.  It happens, and it can often mean the project costs a lot more than was planned.

But there's another place that you get into even bigger cost overruns most of the time.  See when you estimate the cost/effort needed to do something you can do that estimate in lots of different ways.  You can assume everything goes right the first time around and make your estimate based on that.  Or you can assume lots of things will go wrong and make your estimate based on that.  Now obviously the estimate assuming that everything goes right will be much cheaper than the estimate where everything goes wrong, so when you have multiple companies competing to win a project like this, it's common for companies who quote more aggressively to win the bid.  But in reality, things *always* go wrong.  The companies who quote aggressively know that.  And they also know that when those things go wrong, they'll pass the cost on to the customer.  And that's the biggest reason you get these cost overruns, because the original planned cost was never realistic in the first place."	2.0	0.0	299	False	True	4.0

If we are regularly breaching such meticulously calculated estimates, either our estimation system is wrong, or we have some serious problem making us inefficient at building infrastructure.

I think you are underestimating the difficulty of properly estimate such complex and long term ventures with so many moving parts.  Most people cannot even predict the amount of time it would take to fully clean their house and garage and expect experts to be able to accurately predict the time and expense of years long projects including hundreds or thousands of people and often needing to navigate different locale communities and special interest groups and etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the natural answer people come up with is ""they are trained to do that"".  Ok, what training teaches you to do that?  How does that training perform IRL?  Do you know the first bit about that training?  And if you're not well informed on what would allegedly allow them to accurately plan all of this then what makes you so sure it's inefficient?   

Not to mention that even if they had the best of training with an impossible 100% success rate with correct information...who says they're being correct information or indeed even have all the information.  Every project has a significant amount of missing information that impacts completion dates and costs that is not known before the project starts.  Like any project started before COVID lol would be one of the easiest to understand examples right now.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Planning long range is already incredibly difficult even with simple things.  I think you're simply underestimating the difficulty.  Though if you wanted to lower the difficulty and costs of such planning then lowering the rights of your people and their wages achieves that pretty well.  Less rights = less variables from worker availability to special interest groups to local groups to etc.  And ofc less wages not only = less money overall but less variability in the overall cost outcome."	2.0	0.0	347	False	True	4.0

In the case of China, the cracks have begun to show:

* China’s second-largest builders, Evergrande Group, has $300 billion in bad loans — that is about 2% of the total tax-revenues of China; nothing about the loans are particular to Evergrande
* Housing prices have dropped 30% this year, which may cause the GDP to drop by 10%.  This is worse than any drop in US GDP during the Great Depression.
* Homeowners have called mortgage strikes in at least 300 cities.  This has forced regional banks into insolvency.  
* After flatly refusing to pay off on deposit insurance, the Chinese government has claimed it will pay off some depositors of insolvent banks.  It is not clear this is enough to prevent collapse of the banking system.
* The government has promised war with Taiwan over the Pelosi visit: either it will deliver, resulting in the utter destruction of the PRC, or it will back off, causing the government to look weak.

Will the PRC survive to see the Year of the Water Rabbit, six months from now?  _Maybe_.

But everything is very, very bad and there is no appetite for reform anywhere in the CCP.  Xi seems to be doubling down on bad policy in every sector. 

The 20th National Congress is coming up later this year.  Xi will probably try to get himself elected “Chairman” or even “Leader”, titles that have not been used since Mao.

Let's scale this down to answer.

Why do you invest time into having to get an education as a youth?

Many children rather than school and examinations would rather hedonistically just play around rather than have to provide for family like is the case in many 3rd world countries. We do so anyways because we recognize that schooling is necessary in order to both improve the child's quality of life in the future as well as for the child's own ability to survive in their future. Even if they are unhappy for a brief period, it is worth it for the next 30-60 years.

You can't just play around and be illiterate all your childhood and then decide when you're 30 years old that you want to be able to be able to support yourself since you lack the cultivation of prerequisite skills from education. Your 'extremely happy for a short period of time' decision has now affected your ability to be 'moderately happy' for the remainder of your life.

Now with respect to sustainability, if we consider our society to be an adolescent, why would we not invest in not just the next generation - but the current generation.  Concepts such as sustainability are not just an investment into hundreds and thousands of years into the future... they're concepts that affect us decades from now which is not far off.

For example we've only been able to not starve to death as a species at the current population levels [thanks to technological developments 100 years ago into ammonia production](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1918/summary/)

The truth is that part of what makes a human brain act so human is the constraints and affordances of the materials that it is made of. And the process by which a brain is made does not make the same kinds of stark divisions between code and hardware (which are, after all, an abstraction mainly for us, as humans, to think about complex machines). That lack of clear division makes the idea of hardware/software difficult in humans, and--as a practical matter--in (other) machines.

2. Is this just the Turing test?

That is to say, does simulation to a high degree of precision result in no practical differences regardless of the system simulating it? If so, it seems to me to be a question of a different sort, though it continues to be a discussion. (See, for example, Searle's Chinese Room.)

3. A difference that makes a difference?

Two humans can think and behave in quite different ways. Presumably you are not asking for the intelligence to behave or act identically to a single given human.

So that leaves the question not of difference, but how much, and whether it is a difference that makes a difference... to something. What is the meaningful outcome of this lack of difference? Is this a question because we would want it reflected in the language we use? In the rights granted to the entity? In the restrictions and responsibilities put on it?

In other words: there is bound to be a difference between a given artificial human mind and a human mind. Even with the assumption that we could make an instantaneous physical copy of an individual human's mind, there is every reason to believe that the two minds would diverge rapidly. So the question is how much difference is enough to matter, and that means specifying an outcome that such difference might affect."	2.0	0.0	321	False	True	0.0

Your op wants indistinguishable  ai.  So the actions are by definition the same. How we take in data, that is another difference, if that counts for you because computers will be taking in different data and with much different sensors than humans.  How we process data is definitely different if we are dealing with different input data.  How we think and how we experience should be different than computers given our significant differences.  For example, we experience senses like sight and hearing in two different ways.  Why would a computer experience them like us? Perhaps they see in the way we would call hearing.  Perhaps they experience all senses with sight.  Perhaps they sense in some totally different way we have no intuition for.

and you could make those conditional statements longer to remember what the user had said previous.  billions and billions and trillions and trillions of condition statements.  

with enough conditionals I would eventually replicate human behavior sufficiently well.  But probably this thing would not be conscious and certainly it would be different then a human.

But we don't actually know what causes humans to be conscious.  We know our decision making is powered not by a bunch of conditional statements but rather by a neural network.  But we don't know why an neural network would give rise to the type of consciousness experienced by humans.  we don't even know if a neural network gives rise to consciousness.

like our basic AI with countless pre-programmed conditions, a neural network based IA might also lack consciousness.  Since we don't know what causes consciousness we cannot say with confidence.

We already have neural networks, they are just simple.  It looks like the most powerful computer in the world simulates about 80k neurons and an ant brain has 250k.  So the words biggest computer is about 1/3rd as smart and an ant.  I think at that scope we would say with confidence that while an ant might have consciousness our super computer certainly does not.  But again its not clear if non-humans are conscious or if our primitive neural networks are, because we don't really understand what consciousness is.

besides the complex problem of conscious there is a much simpler difference between artificial and natural intelligence.  All natural life wants to continue to be alive.  All life strives to survive.  but we would have no reason to give our AI this desire.  There is no reason why we'd want our AI to be concerned with its survival in the world.  of course we see this in current AI.  An AI that plays chess or generates artistic pictures does not care if you delete it.   Our AI is unlikely to have any survival instinct.  Rather it will just get trained to perform whatever task we are concerned with.  Tesla's want to avoid car crashes, but they don't try to avoid being deleted.

I’ve even thought about posting a CMV about it but I know I’m correct. 

More seriously, I think you should re-evaluate the ceiling of a monogamous relationship. The ceiling is a life changing partner. Someone who will do everything for you, even at their own expense. Someone who will be there until your last breath. Someone who will literally die for you. Thinking about it strictly analytically and without any sappy emotion - that is an extremely powerful asset to have. 

Really the only other way to get that is immediate family, but if your brothers and sisters find partners like this, then they will be this person for their partner, not you. And you’re likely to outlive your parents. So without a monogamous dedicated relationship, you likely out of luck. 

You might disagree and say you can find such a person, but apply this simple test as a shorthand proxy for closeness - how many people share finances with a non-spouse? Or if you were hospitalized, how many non-spouses would spend literally every night in the hospital room with you? There are many ways to frame this point, but a monogamous partner can (remember we are talking ceiling here) can be a special, unique, and life changing thing"	1.0	0.0	225	False	True	2.0

Due to how general the phrase “mass shooting” is, it’s become easier and easier to - intentionally or unintentionally - convince people living in the nicest of suburbs that even they can’t step outside or they will absolutely be shot (when the likelihood is like &lt;.05% or something, numbers may be a little off).

A mass shooting is simply about the number of people. 

I don't get how you think spree killings, which are very rare, btw, would have any effect on perceptions. 

&gt;However, presenting to the public that we have a lot of mass shootings while omitting that fact that the majority of them stem from situations that most citizens wouldn’t even understand (gang violence, etc.) - in which the victims were (unfortunately) often involved - instills extra fear and even confusion into their hearts, and even fuels the flames of division we’re already very much experiencing today.

There are like two mass shootings a day in the US. That's an insane number, and despite FOX's desperation to push the narrative that they're mostly gang related, that's not true.

They are often domestic/familial, which doesn't mean people won't be harmed -- especially in states with lax gun laws (the more strict the gun laws, the less gun violence, and the less strict, the more gun violence).

This is a very bold claim.

&gt;They simply believe in whatever their parents believe. If you're a theist reading this, ask yourself whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents were Islamic?

This is not mutually exclusive with your initial, bold claim. 

My primary argument is against your initial, bold claim. It is bold because it is implicitly an accusation of bad faith. I was raised in an evangelical fundamentalist household. Until I was ~14 (honestly I can't pinpoint when I started questioning but by the time I was a young adult I was not religious) I fully believed Hell was real, God smote the evil, and the righteous will prosper.

*Let me just call out that there is simply no reason for a person to do some of the things believers do unless they are true believers.* In evangelicalism this is well above 50% of people (we're pushing 80% at least). One thing you don't state but what I strongly believe (and you may very well agree with) is that people project their beliefs onto god as a way of insulating their beliefs from self-reflection and finding similarly-minded people. It's this insulation that prevents them from realizing they are projecting in the first place. It also allows them to avoid cognitive dissonance while maintaining genuine, contradictory beliefs in some cases. 

As a ancillary argument I want to state that there is a high probability that someone inherits the beliefs of their parents. It's not 100% though! It's not even close.

https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/11/17/are-religious-convictions-heritable/#:~:text=Religiosity%20is%20moderately%20heritable%E2%80%9425,Lewis%20and%20Bates%2C%202013).

I've seen studies where the heritability is as high as 65%. The source above states 25-45% which is much weaker.

So the answer to your question of whether you'd still follow your current religion if your parents followed a different religion is at best *probably* but also very likely not.

My first argument should dispel this idea that religious people generally do not believe what they say they believe."	10.0	0.0	341	False	True	0.0

Roads do, however, move people around. Consider adding a third lane to a two lane highway. In a few years congestion will return to the roughly the level it was prior to the road expansion, however that road will now be carrying approximately 50% more people. Those will be people going to work, to see friends, to recreation, etc. Increased traffic represents an increase in the number of people getting from where they are to where they want to be.

In essentially all US cities (with the exception of maybe NYC) the road network is the most important means of civilian transportation. Land use patterns have developed which reflect the capacity of the built road network (this is what creates the induced demand), so severely restricting the capacity of that network without providing an alternative would be a disaster for mobility in urban areas.

A policy of this sort would have worked had it been in place from the beginning, with city development occurring in response to a more limited road network. American cities would have undoubtably had better public transit and walkability. However, this is an instance where you can't unbreak the egg: American cities have developed with their road networks, and those road networks now represent an essential component of how those cities function. I support road diet programs, but the process has to be gradual to allow public transportation and development patterns to evolve to reflect the changing transportation paradigm. An immediate change as you are proposing wouldn't just be a rough transition, it would render cities completely inoperable."	11.0	0.0	279	False	True	0.0

If a team of 10 people now works twice as fast with the help of AI, and the company just pays them a bit more instead of hiring a new team, jobs are being replaced by AI but no one is fired, that would be really hard to figure out  
If I hire someone with a different skillset or for a different purpose than I would have without AI tools, it may not show in a headcount report as someone being replaced by AI  
Basically, there's a long gap between ""person does a job without AI"" and ""AI does job without person"", and your solution ignores the middle area of AI as tools, AI as assistant, AI as speedup, etc. 
2. What is substantively different about doing this compared to taxing companies that replaced workers with computers? Or factory line workers with robots? Or do you believe those companies should have been treated the same way as you now propose for AI?
3. What about algorithms like recommendation algorithms, that never had a human analog? Should Facebook be taxed because it doesn't use human raters to in-real-time curate your feed?

2. For the sake of argument, let's call cars with the throttling hardware ""modified"", and the cars without ""organic"". There will be no way to tell, on the highway, which cars are organic and which aren't. Sure, you *say* there will be a hefty punishment for removing the safety feature, but tell me even one traffic law that gets punished every time someone breaks it. I see expired plates all over the highway, and those are incredibly easy to spot. The only way we'd spot organic cars is by the same methods we already use to catch speeding vehicles.

Google Maps still gets it wrong very often, and look at the resources they have at their disposal. You trust the government to maintain all of that consistently? They can't even fix potholes.

4. A speeding ticket is not considered a serious crime. In several states (if not all of them, I obviously haven't lived everywhere) you can take a defensive driving class to get out of them as long as you're not doing it excessively.

An echo chamber is **not** simply a community. It is not merely a community that censors intolerant views, or moderates conversations to keep things on-topic. 

Echo chambers have at least two distinct, key features. 

One of those is a pattern of manipulating members into increasing closeness by methodically discrediting all outside sources. This sort of ""You can't trust anyone but us, because everyone else is lying"" approach looks and feels very cultish. This 'us versus the world' framing is key feature of an echo chamber. This is above-and-beyond the typical sense of a community. 

The other key feature of an echo chamber is the sequencing of having ideas, gathering evidence, and discussion. A typical approach towards new ideas is for an individual to be exposed to and/or gather information, form an opinion or explanation, and then seek to have that opinion challenged by others through logical analysis and/or additional information. In an echo chamber, the opinion comes *first*, and then others provide information that supports the opinion and excludes and discredits anything that challenges it. 

To illustrate these features, imagine the following claim being made in a given community:

""I see a lot of crime and homelessness in my city. I think it's because people are lazy bums, and a lot of them are minorities.""

How would our imaginary community act? 

Would this community *agree* with this assertion, and follow that agreement with pre-emptive criticism of conflicting evidence? ""Oh yeah, and the city government just loves to waste taxpayer money on stupid projects like giving junkies free needles and making the cops be more sensitive instead of kicking those freeloaders off the sidewalk!""

Or does this imaginary community challenge some aspect of the view? ""Well, the police blotter and crime statistics actually show we're at a 5 year low on a lot of those things. Maybe you're just noticing it more, or maybe it's because people have been pushed out of where they used to camp and you're seeing them in your neighborhood for the first time...""

>Forming one's perspective on how to view the world and how the world should work is a process that requires exposure to various ideas and constant willingness to hear out other perspectives.

The problem I have with this claim is that there's no exception for ideas that are factually incorrect and/or objectively false. There's no distinction made between other perspectives that are grounded in reality and distorted perspectives formed by rhetoric over reason. 

You see this a lot with folks who like to talk about ""the marketplace of ideas"", too. Yes, there's a marketplace for ideas, but the market has repeatedly, definitively rejected some ideas, and pretending like we should keep allowing those ideas to re-circulate with the same standing and legitimacy as new ideas is absurd."	5.0	0.0	495	False	True	0.0

That's why I specified *overtly* and mentioned personal attacks.

I think your definition of echo chamber is simply far too broad. Most communities, even ones which have limited censorship rules in place, have a diverse community of individuals with varying world views. For example the exclusion of racist people doesn't mean all non-racist people remaining will agree on everything, especially if the community in question is based around something very different like economics, video games, or whatever else.

The only time banning racists would create an echo chamber is in the context of a community who's primary engagement is the discussion of racism. In this context all members would constantly be exposed to anti-racist views which reinforce their beliefs. 

However, in the context of a community based around discussing economics, banning racist people has very little effect on the dialogue. It isn't necessary to have racist opinions expressed in that context in order to avoid constant exposure to one set of ideas/ideals. The remaining members who aren't racist will never (or rarely) share those views and will still disagree about many other things related to economics."	3.0	0.0	191	False	True	4.0

Furthermore, even though there is a clear distinction between communities that foster respect and those that promote harmful beliefs, it might not be accurate or fair to classify one as inherently ""harmless.""  
  
Firstly, the term ""echo chamber"" often carries negative connotations, suggesting that members of such a community are uncritically repeating the same views without considering alternative perspectives. However, communities that support marginalized groups often do not blindly echo the same ideas. Instead, they aim to provide safe spaces for people who may face discrimination, harassment, or misunderstanding in other areas of their lives. Such communities often actively encourage open dialogue and understanding, rather than merely echoing the same points.  
  
Secondly, even communities that create a civil environment can have unintended consequences. For instance, they might inadvertently exclude individuals who hold different views but are willing to engage in respectful conversation and learn. This can lead to a lack of diversity in thought and even isolate the community from broader societal discourse, which is not entirely harmless.  
  
Thirdly, while it's important to create communities that prioritize the mental health of their members, these communities should also strive to educate and enlighten others about the issues they focus on. If they turn into echo chambers that do not engage with outside perspectives, they may lose opportunities to raise awareness and foster understanding among a broader audience.  
  
Lastly, the dichotomy between 'harmless' and 'harmful' echo chambers can be misleading. Any community that discourages critical thinking, open dialogue, and exposure to diverse perspectives can potentially lead to an insular mindset, even if its intentions are noble."	3.0	0.0	297	False	True	0.0

While civil war is often cloaked in ideology, it actually occurs for economic reasons. In the American Civil War, the country was split very clearly along geographical lines. When the addition of new free states outnumbered the addition of slave states, the southern slave states feared the free states would outlaw slavery, which would radically transform the entire economy of the south, and heavily shift the balance of economic and political power in the country. As a result, the southern slave states revolted.

There is nothing really akin to this in the modern U.S. The geographical divide is far less clear-cut, and more along rural/urban geographical lines.

Wokeness and identity politics are just flavor-of-the-day squabbles that everyone forgets about immediately. Everyone will forget about Jason Aldean and Bud Light by next Monday.

I live in a state where urban changes to corn fields in less than mile. And while I hate to stereotype and say that it turns into ""Trump Country"" it would mean ignoring all of the flags and billboards announcing it as such. I can't help but to think of it as a bandwagon thing. Lots of people show public support and repeat the things they hear to simply not be ostracized by their community. Im not naive enough to think that none of them believe it but hear enough of it at the local bar and people start saying the same things to not stick out. It gets hard to gauge how many people actually believe it but not everyone who says those things would actually fight for it.

>I don't think voting metrics on their own serve as a concrete example of political leanings, as I am well aware of the tendancy to refuse to vote because of a lack of faith in the candidates most in line with ideology.

There will always be a certain amount of people that don't vote because of lack of faith but those same people also wouldn't fight hard for their opinions either. The point I was trying to make is that they don't view people with opposing views as harshly as someone who voted specifically so the ""other side"" doesn't win. That type of mindset is necessary to actually start a civil war.

>The part I am most interested in further discussing is about the government dealing with radical's militarization. Would Jan 6th not be evidence enough of the potential problem with relying on the government to step in?

I actually don't think that Jan 6th was a big deal all things considered. Was it bad? Yes but aside from the loss of life it was relatively harmless and that harmlessness it what allows the GOP to be neutral enough to look like they condone it. The problem that the GOP is facing is that Trump has essentially created a large rift in the party. They can not secure elections without at least some of the Trump vote and that's what's keeping the GOP from speaking out against it. Most of the people who did speak out against it didn't win their elections. However, none of them have intervened against the FBI investigating or sentencing the participants. The GOP's silent condoning of it only goes far enough to maintain their voting base. 

The real concern is paramilitary groups that have been silently growing. They're actively seek disenfranchised young white men and radicalizing them and providing them with military training. Some of these groups are already on FBI watch lists which is both reassuring and scary because that means the government is taking them seriously. I think if any of them acted in a meaningful way the GOP would be forced to make a choice, either they continue to stay silent and risk losing their more moderate base or speak out against it and lose the support of the radicals that they don't actually want to admit they need.

>I acknowledge that racial tensions have always been a problem, and my perception is a real factor in my position. It just seems to be exacerbated by white supremacists being far more comfortable with being open about theirs.

I still think it's a matter of perception. Once you know the signs it's just way easier to pick out. Maybe some of the subtly is gone but the amount of racists haven't grown."	1.0	0.0	625	False	True	2.0

I'd suggest that there are two things you need to achieve to win an election. The first is to persuade as much of the electorate as possible that they should vote for you over the other guy. This is the more obvious problem, and you've correctly identified it. If a party narrows its support too much, it simply can't build a coalition with the numbers needed to win. If we assume a bell curve, or even an even distribution of public political opinion, there are theoretically almost always more potential votes in a moderate position.

However, there is a second aspect of electoral strategy that's easier to overlook. A party also needs to persuade voters that they should vote for it, rather than not bothering. In liberal democracies without compulsory voting, a substantial portion of the electorate don't vote. Some are just ignorant and apathetic about politics. But many will vote sometimes, but not always. And they matter. 

The reality is that most Democrats and Republics couldn't realistically seize more than a modest share of Republican and Democrat voters without alienating their usual supporters. Most of those won't switch parties, but they might stay home on election day. What this means is that the available electorate to any particular party is smaller than it appears. If, maybe, 15% of voters would consider switching parties during a normal election, mobilising the 40% of the electorate who notionally favour you really matters."	1.0	0.0	251	False	True	0.0

Bonus points if you can back this up with some kind of statistical data, but a purely logical argument could also be convincing.

Let's look at the real world, then. In the USA, the democrats had basically unbroken control of the house of representatives (and almost as much control of the senate) for like 70 years. Didn't matter who the president was, what party was in power. It was just a truism that the democrats controlled the house and senate. During that time, they were the labour party, and that helped them keep that solid control, because they had the unions

In the 80s, the democrats got stomped by Reagan. As a response, the new leadership in the 90s sprinted to the right, because they believed that's what they had to do. Reagan had been crushing unions, and instead of reinforcing that position that had kept them in power for most of the century, the democrats abandoned all positions of workers rights and became ""Reagan democrats."" Reagan won, so that was the smart move. Staying with the unions and workers, which the older Dems wanted to do, was just being too ideologically pure. It was virtue signalling


Ever since that flip, the democrats have been out of control of the house and senate both for the majority of terms, to the point where someone like Trump could even make a very easy and obvious political play by saying he gives any sort of fuck about workers. The unions are all gone. The democrats can never get that back. They 100% fucked themselves over to do the ""smart"" move of tacking to the right, permanently, because anything less would have been purity testing. And they have been losing ever since (See also: the labour party)"	1.0	0.0	320	False	True	0.0

If you are trying to win an election against an incumbent in one of these districts you have to appeal to the base because they make up a huge percent of who is voting.

&#x200B;

In short its not just R vs D but also R vs R and D vs D and ideological purity can help a politician primary their opponent.

&#x200B;

For the biggest election, the presidential election, you have to keep in mind that winning is not the only goal, you also have issue candidates who use the platform of presidential debates and election hype to sway the public's opinion. For examples look at Bernie and Yang, Bernie had Medicare for all and Yang had UBI.

&#x200B;

They both succeeded in their elections because they increased the popularity of their issue. This doesn't push people out of the party either because, in a presidential election, after the primary the people who lost endorse the winner anyway. Even back in 2016 with Hillary Clinton who was hated by the left only about 10% of the people who voted for the ""ideologically pure"" candidate Bernie Sanders switched to voting for Trump in the general.

The statement ""It is illogical to not believe in Free Will"" implies that there is a logical inconsistency or some logical leap that must be made in order to come to the conclusion that Free Will does not exist.

The argument stated, however, establishes a tertiary value judgement of ""being right"", delineates a specific definition for it, and states that ""being right' is a desirable quality only within this definition.

By your stated argument ""being right"" does not mean that a belief accurately describes the state of the universe at large.

Instead, the stated argument begs the question and presupposes that in order for a person to be right, ""free will"" must first exist.

According to your argumnent, without the existence of free will, even if a person's description of the universe is free of logical contradiction or fully accurate in describing the universe, because they did not ""freely"" make the choice to believe it, it is not valuable.

This is an argument, but not one for the stated subject line.  In other words, it does not argue that Hard Determinism or Compatibilism is illogical.  Instead it argues the following:

- ""Making a choice"" requires free will.
- ""Making the right choice"" therefore requires free will.
- ""Making the right choice"" within this narrow definition that requires free will, is an inherently valuable thing.
- A description with no logical contradictions, that accurately describes the universe, if made without free will is not a choice and therefore is not valuable.
- Thus, within the parameters defined in this premise, ""making the choice to believe in free will"" is the only opinion that has value (value as defined within the premise itself).

Again, there's an argument to be had there, but it isn't whether or not ""There is no free will"" is a logical statement, for which you provide no arguments against.

Instead, the stated subject line should be something along the lines of ""Whether or not free will exists, it is more personally beneficial to live with the belief that it does because if you are right, then that's good, and if not, who cares because nothing matters.""

In order to argue that Hard Determinism or Compatibilisim is *illogical*, you must provide a logical contradiction/argument against it."	1.0	0.0	401	False	True	0.0

Is AI-assistance enriching your interaction? Or replacing your need for figuring out how to convey your thoughts on your own? Is it a tool, Or is it a crutch? Is it a brace, or is it a mask?


A lot of your examples seem to be about confronting social anxiety with AI assistance. Do you maybe think that there is a possibility that you are actually not confronting anything by using AI assistance? But instead have found a way to put off having to deal with it?


Again, do not want to attack. This is coming from a genuine place that I think sort of illuminates what I see as a counter-point. Do we actually improve when we have something that takes out the difficult parts? Is removing the difficulty enriching? 


Sometimes I make an ass of myself. I take a stance, or articulate a point and im just…wrong. It could literally be happening right now. Sometimes im even right but I just went about it the wrong way and sort of fuck it up.

The base of the party (neocon GOP and old social security + social conservatism people) historically are dying off to age or are very suspicious of Trump or are moderate dems these days. 

They are still there - they are just being pulled along much like Bernie has pulled along some democrats (not to the same extent). If you look at the polls Trump has like 50% locked up and the other 50% is split amongst 7 people. The real issue is nobody in the GOP agrees on next steps.

Some want to moderate and become ""more appealing"" which usually means sacrificing values 
Some feel that the GOP has done nothing but ""moderate"" since Reagan and it has resulted in 2 Mediocre presidents and a long march to economic and social leftist
Some want to rejuvenate historical America (at least the ideal of the 50s or 80s) and think somebody like Trump can do it
Some simply want no change to anything in society and basically believe America is working just fine
Some really want the government to be radically reduced and turn more into a pre 1930s government.

But I feel we need to clamp down on illegal immigration, and Trump supported that while
Clinton and Biden didn’t. We see places like
NYC seeing the results of relaxed immigration policies. 

I also support a more isolationist government on the world stage. Trump was more of an isolationist.  Especially coming after Bush who got us into two wars (one made sense the other not so much) and Obama who pushed for more troops and deaths in Afghanistan and expanded drone strikes. 

Trumps views on abortion are more conservative than mine but closer than Clinton or Biden.  He wanted to end the republican platform of a complete ban. He also didn’t support jail or prison for women who get abortions. And since the overturning of Roe v Wade he doesn’t support a National ban. 

While I don’t agree with his stance on Trans rights.  I do understand why many people feel uncomfortable.  For many being trans seems to be their primary personality trait, rather than just what they are.  And a lot of people don’t like being forced to say their name followed by he/him or whatever.  They may be fine with someone who is trans, but don’t want it to be, in their opinion, forced on them. Also there is a lot of confusion on what gender affirming care is for minors.

Trump signed a law ending the gag orders on Pharmacists that prevented them from sharing money-saving information.

Trump signed an executive order \[in 2020\] that forces all healthcare providers to disclose the cost of their services so that Americans can comparison shop and know how much less providers charge insurance companies. When signing that bill he said no American should be blindsided by bills for medical services they never agreed to in advance. Hospitals will now be required to post their standard charges for services, which include the discounted price a hospital is willing to accept.

Trump signed 3 bills to benefit Native people. One gives compensation to the Spokane tribe for loss of their lands in the mid-1900's, one funds Native language programs, and the third gives federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Montana.

has it not occurred to you that being numb, crying, being scared and embarrassed, that these are ways of processing what occurred? Not all rape is identical. Honestly I'd say the main reason rape victims have a hard time processing is a lack of sex education from a young age means plenty of children might be raped before they even know what sex is, worsening the inherent trauma of The Talk. And the entire rest of adolescence really, once you know that you've done the thing everyone talks about wanting to do and if you talk about it, you're pitied. Not to mention how people love to fantasize about violently hurting rapists, so if your rapist was a family member or friend, someone you don't necessarily want torn apart, you have every incentive to just never tell anyone and try to diminish what happened even to yourself

Capitalism, Fascism and Communism were the main ones, but there were also significant anarchist, syndicalist, georgeist parties movements and states. Fast forward a hundred years, and if an anti-capitalist party can get enough votes for a single seat in parliament, that's unusual. Vocally anti-capitalist states have almost entirely capitalist economies. Vocally anti-democratic states scramble to make hold fake elections, because not even Putin, Xi or Kim can of legitimate authority that isn't a democratic mandate.

People constantly talk about the fact that nobody has a unified voice, and that the only way people understand the news now is through the lens of a political channel.

But this story is both inaccurate and simplified to uselessness. 

A country can coerce another into a political dissolution through espionage, sabotage through espionage, economic pressure, military threat. The life of the Soviet Union was influenced by a vast amount of external and internal factors. The external threats, being the US, would strain and influence internal problems, including the illegal dissolution of the USSR with an enthusiastic ally to Yeltzin. 

Now it is true that to get to the point where Yeltzin is able to dissolve the union unilaterally and illegally was caused by stagnation, but the implication of this is always used as a failure communism, as the ""End of history"" suggests, and that is simply not true.

The dissolution was a overwhelming unpopular decision that brought with it demonstrations to reinstate the union, suppressed both by foreign allies and by Yeltzin. The dissatisfaction with leadership and downward turn to stagnation really started with Khrushchev's change from a ideologically communist motivated system built by Stalin to a ""reformed"" command economy devoid of Communist ideology and dialectical materialist understanding of the world. 

Khrushchev wanted to compete head to head with the west, militarily and economically, where such a thing was not viable, combined with changes in how the economy worked lead to a stagnation where the USSR relied more and more on the west. This culminated with reforms by Gorbachev introducing private businesses and the entirety of Perastroika, which did not help the declining quality of life.

 During this time people were very unhappy with the communist party. It had lost its ideology at the core of leadership and was an administrative husk of its former self. In demonstrations, those who had lived under the communist government of Stalin wanted a return to the good times and growth in living conditions brought by him and his ideological leadership, not a turn to capitalism, as Yeltzin had done by taking advantage of the party's weakness, as some wanted to see any change. 

So when Yeltzin took power, he took this as his chance to reintroduce capitalism and illegally dissolve the union. It wasn't a collapse, as more of a murder caused by weakness in ideology of the party, leading to mismanagement and stagnation."	1.0	0.0	395	False	True	2.0

These are realities that you can't just ignore. Sure you can advocate for another candidate, but at this point it's almost impossible to build up another candidate in time for the election.

So it's in both parties interests to sideline internal conflicts to focus on keeping the opposition back.

In the Republicans case it's the sheer influence Trump has because of both his rhetoric, popularity, and the years the party has spent courting the far right end of their base.

It's not.  We the voters vote in the primaries to decide who runs. The DNC and RNC sometimes do things to put their hands on the scale but overall they don't apply so much pressure that a very popular candidate wouldn't win.

It's very, very rare that if the incumbent president runs in the primary that they lose.  Which means that baring some extreme upset, Biden will be the nominee if he continues to want to run.  Part of this is because no good candidate would want to challenge their parties incumbent.  This is largely because generally whether they win or lose, it damages their party's chance of winning in the general election.

Trump's base is insanely loyal.  It's questionable whether he can win enough independents while not losing non-MAGA to the extreme republican voters to actually beat Biden in the general election but it will be extremely hard for anyone else to win the primary election. 

The DNC or the RNC COULD change the rules to state that either candidate isn't allowed to run.  However the blowback, especially if the RNC did so, would be insane and likely cripple their chances of winning.  If the party leaders dictated who could be the nominee or even who can't be the nominee they'd be dealing with a lot of political problems.

Lacking a commmon language and culture, an American saying you’re “Italian”, “Spanish”, “Korean”, etc is shorthand for a shared American subculture - the type of food you ate growing up, the holidays you celebrated, the likely quirks and features of your parents and aunts and uncles. 

TL;DR Americans mean no offense to Europeans when they call themselves X. They’re searching for shared cultural experience with other Americans. And since America is such a huge country, many people here don’t travel internationally often. And when we do, we often put our foot in our mouths.

My direct lineage left Ireland around 1730 and I've never stepped foot on the land. If I were raised in Italy, I would probably say I'm Italian and not mention Irish at all. But my family still celebrates our heritage in small ways here and there, especially around St Patricks, and probably in ways that actual Irish people would think is stupid. We make corned beef and colcannon, and someone puts small toys or candies or dollars in canbage leaves and hides them in a tree for kids to climb and find.

> On the topic of vanity, bodybuilder physiques don't even look attractive or aesthetically pleasing

I respect this view, and I think you may be thinking of open bodybuilding— the mass monsters in thongs. Nowadays there are other divisions that fit certain looks. For example, the Classic Physique division is arguably the most popular division with the current Mr. Olympia in the division, Chris Bumstead, having a larger following than many A-list celebrities. The Classic Physique look is more ""attainable"" and replicates the golden era aesthetic (think Arnold Schwarzenegger) that not only popularized the sport in the 60s but also has much greater mass appeal.

> What I think is stupid about it is why do people think that this is worth it.

The same reason why people think any sport is worth it: to reach the extremes of what humans are capable of. Elite bodybuilders are just like any other athlete, whether it's a sprinter, swimmer, tennis player, etc. They each have a rigorous and disciplined training, eating, sleeping, and pharmaceutical routine. The only difference is what it is within the human body that they are pushing.

Also, for some, bodybuilding is an art. Don't get me wrong, it oftentimes *is* meatheads vainly posing, but for others there is a creative and artistic aspect. It's like you're treating your own body like a slab of marble and sculpting it to an aesthetically presentable form. Regardless of what you find attractive, it's not a beauty pageant, nor is it a muscle arms race; judges look for a fine balance of proportion, shape, symmetry, and detail. No two physiques look the same even if they do the same workouts, eat the same foods, take the same drugs, and these differences allow bodybuilders to sculpt their physiques in their unique ways.

There's also an extremely creative and skillful aspect of posing. It's much more difficult than just flexing your muscles— many people including myself will say a posing session is more tiring than a workout. There is skill and practice in twisting, contorting, and tensing certain parts of your body in the right positions and angles that simultaneously *highlight* your strengths and *hide* your weaknesses. Individual routines also highlight unique styles; Kai Greene incorporated elements of hip hop and dance in his posing. In the way I described above, sounds a little like gymnastics, figure skating, or diving, huh?

>  I'm really just trying to understand the mindset of a bodybuilder, or at least understand what the appeal is.

Bodybuilding appeals to me mainly because, out of any of my life pursuits, it has provided the most profound sense of ""enjoying the process"" rather than ""the destination."" Muscle gain and fat loss are physiological processes that inherently occur over time, no matter how gifted you are. What I do with my training, sleep, or diet in an hour, day, or even a week won't do anything; it's the accrual of these hours, days, and weeks of training, eating, and sleeping over several years that allow for meaningful change. For better or for worse, there is never a single climactic moment in time in the sport, because the destiny of one's competitive pursuits were determined in the preparation behind the scenes."	5.0	0.0	542	False	True	0.0
