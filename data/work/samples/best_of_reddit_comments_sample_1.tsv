We lived in the suburbs and pretty much let her roam around and go wherever she wanted.  Anyways, she got hit by a car one day, and when I found her by the side of the road, her leg was literally broken in half and the bottom half of her leg was only attached by the skin, whoever hit her just took off.  So the vet recommends amputating her leg, which we did.  A couple weeks, maybe two months later she's back to normal, and she lived another 8 or 9 years after that.

When my dog was a puppy, he was passed out on his back with a full spread eagle going on, his junk totally just hanging out in the wind.  I put my head close, took a sniff and said ""wow, it smells kind of weird. . . do you think something is wrong?"" and when my gf stuck her face in to smell, I push her face straight into his crotch.

I had a girlfriend in college that was very adamant about me NOT tossing condoms into the toilet after sex.  So to appease Ms. Crazy I would toss them in the trash bin instead.

Well one day I'm walking my dog at night and she's hunched over trying to take a shit.  Well I'm there checking my text messages and I notice that she's taking a while and is stressing a bit more than usual.  I'm in a dimly lit area but I look down and notice that there's a white tip of something coming out of her butt.  I'm thoroughly confused.  I thought she might have a tapeworm.  A bit more of it comes out and I decide to grab a leaf off the ground and pull on the worm to help her.  She freaked out, ran in the opposite direction and the worm stretched out like a rubber band and snapped back at me.  At this very moment a girl that lives in the building next to mine turns the corner.  

What she sees is me holding a shit covered condom with shit speckles all over my white shirt and my dog cowering about 10 feet away.  "	256	0

While visiting my cousin there, my uncle bought a plastic frog with a motion detector in its mouth that made a ribbit noise every time someone walked by. Then he put it out on the lawn and scattered some bread crusts in front of it. Soon, mongeese appeared to steal the bread crusts, but every time they tried to snatch one, the frog would croak at them and they'd spaz out and run off. They just kept coming back, though. It was awesome.	28	0

We mostly brought him because it was impossible to cut his nails (he fights you... a lot) but they would also wash him and give him a haircut (which he didn't mind quite as much but still wasn't a fan of). 

Trying to give the groomers an easier time of it, we gave the dog a sedative (prescribed by the vet) about an hour before we brought him over. Well either it was his adrenaline going or we gave it to him with too much food but it did nothing to him while he was there. This also happened to be the only time we ever got him shaved (we thought he'd appreciate it for the summer).

Anyways, the sedatives didn't kick in until we brought him home. So our newly completely ridiculous looking dog stumbled around the backyard for a while before sleeping it off. We soon after decided that the groomer seem to be far too much of a traumatic experience on him so we just let him get scruffy.

He would instinctively leap for the ball and catch it in his mouth, and the second the scent hit him (usually within a second of catching it) he would freak and jump the other direction.

The biggest  difference being that the dogs we ""own"" are bred in such a way as to temper their instincts and in many cases make them fairly dumb. This means that we have to care for them or train then to avoid the streets and things of that nature."	6	0

There are thousands of murders a year in the US, yet that doesn't make it okay to murder people. Common doesn't make it right.  I highly suggest you refrain from adopting animals if you cannot properly take care of them."	12	0

When I worked for Her Majesty, we had an officer who used to let his dog run around camp;  being juvenile we cornered it in the platoon commanders office and while one of us fed it treats, the other two coloured in its white patches (Brown and white dog) with lumicolour markers.

We then released the now brown, pink and yellow dog to skip happily round camp.

Of course we were reprimanded and had to wash said animal but it was comical.

Is it abusive to let your kids drive a car?  Car accidents are the leading cause of teenage deaths, but plenty of parents let their kids drive.

The more freedom you allow your pets, the more likely they will get hurt.  Is it abusive to have an outdoor cat?  I have an indoor cat, and she often looks longingly at the birds outside, but she won't get eaten by a coyote like what happened to my fiancé's cat.  

I think that it's really up to the pet owner, or parent, how much freedom you'll allow the dependents under your care with the recognition that such freedom could get them hurt.  "	6	0

We've got a fenced back yard (That doesn't really matter, she can standing jump over the fence but makes the choice not to do so.) After her younger years, I trained her to pee outside. (Never have had to raise my voice, or swat her nose, or anything. She's very smart.) 

The murderous gleam in her eye was totally a joke, she is the biggest love you could have. Very protective of the family though (I have a 3 year old daughter, and a 6 year old son) and very tender. 

Wolf-Hybrid's are incredibly intelligent, loyal, and they are wonderful for being on the trails and camping with. If you bond, and remain in an alpha position (Usually just being the one who controls the food supply is enough, some wolf-hybrids require a bit more, dominate tone, stances, play, etc.) 

I have never **ever** worried about my safety with her, or my children's safety. I would not have her otherwise, my first and foremost responsibility is my children. The first time I met her, I knew the kind of family member she was going to be. I just want to reiterate the fact that she is genuinely not vicious or murderous, it was just an elaboration on her destruction of my daughters pool floaty that I tied to her. (If I, or anyone in my family were made of plastic inflated material that chased her around. I'm sure we'd be in danger though.)    [Leira and I](http://imgur.com/xBjJu.jpg)"	9	0

Who picks up her crap off the sidewalk or in a park/field where kids play?  What about the people who are absolutely terrified of dogs?  It isn't fair to them to be scared or stressed because there's a loose dog in the area.  They don't know if your dog is friendly or aggressive when it's running towards them.

Road users put other road users in danger as well, and everything you let a dog do outside of a cage is to some degree dangerous.  I'd prefer for my animals to be less restricted and hope for the best, and in my case, the worst thing that has ever happened to any of my animals is an amputated leg.  I think dogs are probably a little more road aware than a four year old, and if you have research that suggests otherwise, I'd love to see it.

No.  But, by all means, assume things that you feel make your point more valid.  We didn't even have the pit at this point.

&gt; Did you actually see another dog in the act of killing your rabbits?  

Me?  No.  My brother?  Yes.  Well, in all honesty, I don't think he actually saw the dog killing it, he just say the dog with dead rabbit in its mouth, but we all felt it was a pretty safe assumption to make.

&gt; If yes then why did you allow the killing to continue?  

It only happened once as far as I can remember, and it wasn't that big of a deal because a dog killing a rabbit isn't any different from a cat killing a mouse, as far as I'm concerned at least."	-4	0

Just like some people have strong reactions to certain types of food, dogs seem the same. I've known quite a few dogs that have eaten large amounts of chocolate (halloween candy left out, etc) and suffered no ill affects. This doesn't mean one should start giving their dogs chocolate or anything else, but it is something to keep in mind.	2	0

After my college graduation last December, I was moving my stuff back home and we were trying to beat the huge snowstorm they were calling for.  We figured if we made it to the interstate we'd be home free. We did make it to the interstate, however we very much underestimated the snowstorm and about 20 miles down the road we came to a complete stop.  A trucker beside us let us know that he heard nobody was moving until the next morning and he was correct.

And since I was moving my stuff back my dog was with me, and she was not going to be too happy about sitting in the car all night.  So to help pass the time and hopefully get her to take a nap soon, me and my girlfriend decided to walk her. I used my belt as a leash (her leash was buried somewhere in my stuff...) and walked her a couple of times in the middle of the interstate.  

For food I let her borrow some of the chips I brought from my old place and she didn't mind the melted snow as water.   

We also received some weird looks.  I guess looking out your car window while on the interstate and seeing a dog taking a dump right beside you isn't very common...

However, onions actually break down the blood cells (red ones I believe) and there is no way to save them once it is happening. I am sure it takes more than a sliver of onion, but it isn't pounds of it before it does damage so we don't take the chance. grapes and raisins are cool if you know your dog isnt going to choke, but PLEASE don't give your dog onions. 

Garlic has the same ability to do damage to blood cells, however garlic is expelled from the body. So, fido has to eat lots of it to do damage (depending on size of course). Onions do not ""clear out"" but actually add up. So if you give your dog a little everyday it could kill it next week."	3	0

This gave me a series of angry stories that my friends refer to collectively as the goat rant. 

One of the chores was to walk the goats back to the barn every night. The first problem was leashing; they had little collars and everything, but every week or so someone would steal the leash. We would resort to tying power cords (the black ones that come with every computer) around their necks and knotting those. The second problem was convincing them to walk. Goats are very stubborn and very lazy, especially after getting fed all day. They fought back every step way to the barn. One time one of them took off and dragged the boss's daughter down the sidewalk. It was a major pain in the ass at closing time every night, when we had the least patience. 

My greatest triumph in goat-herding was the realization that two goats will fit in a shopping cart, and that it was downhill to the barn. Wheeling goats with gravity assist was such a welcome change from dragging them that the expression on the goats' faces was merely gravy. Also, the cart may or may not have been under my control the whole way down the hill.

My parents have 5 cats.  None of them went nuts when that area was scratched.  They do enjoy being scratched there, but they don't obsessively lick when scratched there.  


They got their 5th cat who ended up being more of an outdoor cat.  He brought in fleas.  Now 3 out of 5 of the cats do the crazy licking reaction whenever that area is scratched and it is fully from flea bites since they can not reach that part on their own."	5	0

Might not just be the scent.  All citrus skin contains a terpene called limonene, which is often purified and is used as a natural degreaser (""orange oil"", anyone?).  The effect of this on one's mouth (and perhaps nose) can be pretty potent and unappealing to some.  Your dog's highly sensitive sense of smell may have been going haywire when, every time you peeled/cut the citrus, the oils got released into the air.

Edit: limonene is also flammable.  This can easily be demonstrated with any fresh citrus peel; simply squeeze the colored skin next to a candle or match, and the little liquid spurts will catch fire.

We taught her the word ""sex"", so we say ""want sex?"" and 9 times out of 10 she'll go rape the cat.  It's a great party trick.

Oh yeah, and the best part is that if the cat doesn't run away, she'll hump it to orgasm (or until her eyes go all buggy and she stops humping and starts heavy breathing, whatever that means).

EDIT: The dog is smaller than the cat, so this isn't some dog-brutalizing-the-cat thing.  If the cat wasn't so lazy (or maybe he enjoys it?) it could just run away or beat up the dog.

It actually is a little ridiculous to assume what my neighbors think based on what a small non-random sample of people on the internet think.

I thought you could clearly understand that, but whether you do or not, apparently you'd rather be an ignorant douche.  That's always fun.

Joy's 8 and Mac's 3 currently, so Mac was a bit of a hellion when we adopted him at the age of 1 1/2. Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/phUxb.jpg), Mac's the smooth hair, Joy's the long hair.

I thought I had him fairly well trained by the time I was taking him off his leash to chase a ball as he always came back to me when I called. Joy was more interested in running circles around him, herding like he's a sheep. One day I had him off leash and went to leash him for the walk home. I had just picked up the ball and was moving to put the leash on him when he took right off. I followed him as quick as I could (which is fairly slow compared to a border), and found him at our elderly neighbour's house sitting in the back of their car. He loves going for rides, and our neighbours have taken him for a ride every once in a while so we think he heard the doors of our neighbour's car open and close and he thought it was time to go for a car ride."	3	0

People don't want random dogs wandering into their yards and coming up to their kids. And you were shocked by the person that just left your dog there after they hit it. What were they supposed to do? Take YOUR dog to the vet? How are they supposed to know whose dog it is? You want them to walk up to an injured pit bull?

He started going nuts and since ducks make a mess I decided to let him out so he could chase them away. The ducks noticed him immediately, but instead of flying away they just stood up and stared at this strange creature running at full tilt in their direction. Then at the very last second the male flew away while the female just hopped off into the water below. It had been raining all day so the decking was wet, and four month old puppies don't even have a basic grasp of physics. The look of terror and confusion that he had as he slid off the end of the dock was adorable.	6	0

Out of four dogs over twenty years, one was hit by a car.  That's actually a pretty good safety record as far as I'm concerned, even if you disagree, I'd rather have my dogs be free to do as they please once in a while, as long as it doesn't bother anyone else, which it doesn't.  

It's not that I don't understand people point of view, but, I believe it depends on the area you live in, and this flat out condemnation that anyone letting an animal run around in the wild is irresponsible is patently stupid.  Letting a dog run around in Flatbush Brooklyn would be a little different from a substantially more suburban/rural area, and even more different in a suburban/rural area where this is pretty common, and even more so in an area where everyone knows each others animals.  And most of the time my dogs don't wander into other yards.  

&gt; And you were shocked by the person that just left your dog there after they hit it. What were they supposed to do? Take YOUR dog to the vet? How are they supposed to know whose dog it is? You want them to walk up to an injured pit bull?

I was living with her at the time, and I was never a fan of cats (I am now, although I love dogs). She grew on me when she would hide under my bed and claw at my feet when I got into bed, but then I'd wake up with her curled up next to my head and paw my face with no claws when I laid in bed with her.

Anyways, I used to play with the cat a fair bit, and thought it was the funniest thing when I put a big wool sock over the cat's head. She immediately started to quickly move backwards, didn't even try to paw it off, just ran around backwards, along walls and stuff.

I took it off after a minute or so, aaaand she tried to put her head back in. It was our little game from then on. She used to chase her tail all the time too. She wore a little harness and sometimes I'd tie a looooong shoelace to it and she would proceed to spazz out when she realized something was following her. I miss that cat."	9	0

He even stopped growing, hardly ever moved around, seemed drugged, it was so weird.  We finally got the connection.  Had to separate them as she'd go for all new growth.

I've trained Leira to snaps, she is good off - leash as long as I'm close. It has taken a lot of trail running, hiking, and general exercise for her to get this good off leash. I started with her young, and do at least a once a day walk into the woods.

Leira doesn't bark, she howls, chirps and whines. It's strange, I've had dogs my whole life but when suddenly she breaks out into an ear blasting howl behind my chair it scares the hell out of me. If she is ready for her walk, she'll climb on top of me in my office chair and howl in my face... It is a great way to get my attention.

Main article: American Pit Bull Terrier
 
American Pit Bull TerrierThe American Pit Bull Terrier is the product of interbreeding between terriers and a breed of bulldogs to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog.[4] These dogs were initially bred in England, Ireland, and Scotland, and arrived in the United States with immigrants from these countries. In the United States, these dogs were used as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, to drive livestock, and as family companions;[4] however, some were selectively bred for their fighting prowess,[citation needed] and **starting in the early 20th century, they began to replace the bull terrier as the ""dog of choice"" for dog fighting in the United States.[5][6]**

Breed-specific legislation simply doesn't address the problem, because it's impossible to identify a dog's true breed without either verified breeding records or DNA tests.  Plenty of dogs that ""look like a Pit"" are not, and plenty of dogs that are half or more Pit don't look a thing like the stereotype.  Furthermore, as with children, it is by and large how the dog is raised that determines the behavior.

I know plenty of very sweet Pits who were raised by knowledgeable, caring, and sane individuals.  It's the Michael Vick types that ruin it for the Staffordshire-type terriers."	1	0

You add all the eggs you can.  Like, a whole pack for all I care.

Don't do any pussy hairdresser shit like separate out the egg yolks.  Cholesterol and fat are good for you.  They keep your mind sharp and help defeat communism.

Add as much butter as you dare.  Bonus points for salted butter.  Margarine will cause large, evil men to spontaneously exit a hidden door next to your refrigerator and beat the living crap out of you before being mean to your puppy.

Add a boatload of pepper.  Pepper protects you from herpes, plague, and Republicans.  It also helps mask the taste of rancid meat, which is why it was so popular in the Middle Ages.  That said, these are not the Middle Ages (had they had scrambled eggs this awesome, they would have gone straight to 88mph and done galactic grit laps around the invading alien armada scheduled to wipe out New Jersey in the year 2590 AD.) 

Add salt.  Just lots of it.  Salt is to Michael Bloomberg what crosses are to vampires.  It is thus a Good Thing (tm).  Bonus points if you can find some super-expensive fleur de sel or something that will similarly cause your girlfriend to kick your ass when she comes home for dumping what's basically massively overpriced salt skimmings, you know, the crusty layer that pelicans crap on at the salt flats near the beach, into your scrambled eggs.  

You should forgive her, though - she's a woman and she either cannot understand the manly awesomeness of your scrambled eggs, or her panties will spontaneously dissipate at the first taste of your scrambled eggs.  If you're a woman, disregard the above, use whatever the hell salt you want, you have boobies and are thus okay in my book.  It'll be almost as epic as the time I used a whole can of my girlfriend's frou-frou lemon-infused olive oil to make spaghetti.  It was great spaghetti, except that she bitched me out for using a $25 can of olive oil for noodles.  I mean, give me a fucking break, who charges $25 for a can of olive oil unless it's lovingly hand-crafted by blind Tibetank child monks from slabs of plutonium and whoopass?  Anyway, it was in a can, and only cheap oil comes in a can.  

Add a bunch of milk.  Milk comes from cows, and cows are hilarious.  Did you know that in Cambodia, you can blow up cows with an RPG for $100?  I like animals, and I would never do that, but you have to admit, in an abstract way, it's pretty damn funny, exploding cows.  

Then, take a fork and beat the shit out of it.  Beat it as if it were your boss.  Beat it like a red-headed stepchild.  Touch my monkey, TOUCH IT, THEN BEAT IT SOME MORE.  

Now, and here's the key, put some more butter in the pan.  Make it hot.  Hotter, bitch.  Hotter than the hinges of hell.  And brown that fucker.  Break it up, and this requires practice, into large chunks, each of which is nice and manly brown, like the sizzling skin of a topless Saint Tropez beach bunny.    

Consume.  But wear an old pair of underpants, because you will soil them from the sheer orgasmic goodness that you have just created.

Damn, I should write recipe books.  Julia Child ain't had nothing on me.

Yes indeed. It was more of a general remark for people who do pay for gas and electricity. I hardly ever miss having a microwave.

Not saying it's big deal doing the washing but it's convenient just to use one cup, rather than pot and cup. Plus you don't lose any hot chocolate residue from the pot down the drain if you use the microwave. Granted you'll still have residue on the cup, but not as much had there been a pot and a cup. 	2	0

This is why you can pop in something frozen and have it come out half frozen and half molten. everything else gets heated by the heat radiating from the water (stirring helps this). if you cook all the water out of foods, they usually get rubbery, but with certain foods such as eggs, that's the point, at least partially (everything can be overcooked :P )

First, you want to specify extra large A eggs.  Brown, w/ omega 3's if possible.  3x per person.

Then, in the bowl you've cracked those eggs into, you add **HEAVY CREAM** because milk is for people that don't know any better, and little babies that only get tit from their mama.

Salt and pepper, yes, go forth and do it up, verily.

But you forgot the **CHEESE.**

All of the best egg dishes in the world have CHEESE in them.  This is the rule.  You want the right amount, because too much fried cheese can hurt you very badly.

For each person (3 large eggs), you add an inch and a half of your standard-ish block of cheese: say it's 2"" by 3"", you cut off an inch and a half of that shit and you grate or slice or shred or shale it. Add 3/4 of this cheese right into the raw egg and toss it on the grill.

Then, you whip the ever living fuck out of the eggs.  You covered that.  I like the touch-my-monkey bit.  Spot on, spot on.

Then you toss it all on the well-buttered griddle (seriously, go heavy on the butter, it does defeat communism).  Splash that shit around and don't let it cook into a sheet; you want it all scrambled, not folded and dry.

YOU MUST THEN ADD **ROSEMARY**.  Rosemary will make your eggs pop out of your fucking skull the way alien babies pop out of bitches' stomachs.  But instead of nuking from orbit, you will want to (and will, give it time) simply ejaculate all over the walls of your kitchen.  I'm talking projectile cumming, not the typical 6""-3', ""oh my hair"" stuff, but the 10-ft+ ""OH YOU BROKE THE WINDOW"" kind of cum.

Then you sprinkle on the rest of that cheese after you've been slopping those eggs around, and when there's no runny egg and the boss stage of cheese has just started to melt, you yoink that shit off and put it on a plate and eat it.

Stand back: remember the ejaculation.  These are the best eggs.

Protip: use extra sharp aged cheddar.  Wegmans, basically the supermarket jesus christ would endorse if he were into high quality foods at great vaues, will sell you a frills aged extra sharp cheddar for under $3.

If after checking the sub-reddits people suggest and you still don't feel like you can talk to someone you might check into a therapist that deals with trans or sexual identity, they might be able to help you sort your feelings out.

As far as a relationship, I wouldn't worry about what you are genetically and find someone you find attractive and connect with and can trust. Don't worry about what you ""technically"" are and what gender they are, if you both connect and eventually love each other, who cares. I would explore those ""best friend"" feelings you have had before.

Remember, don't let labels and society tell you what you are and how you should act. If you want to be a woman that is genetically a male that likes women, than go for it.

Be who you want and own it! Best wishes for the future!"	3	0

If so, this would leave you in a situation where hormone supplements would be required to maintain healthy bone density. 

Were these hormone supplements provided to you? If so, wouldn't the fact that you need to take a pill every day (or an injection every week) be a bit of a clue as to your medical situation?

I'm having trouble understanding exactly how this could have been kept hidden from you while still providing the hormones you'd need to maintain your health. The only scenario I can think of that would allow this to remain hidden from you is if they were not giving you any hormone supplements, which seems like outright abuse - the human body needs hormones (either estrogen or testosterone will work) to maintain it's health, and neglecting to provide hormones for someone whose body can't produce their own seems like it must be malpractice.

As far as sage advice:  I don't really have any.  If nothing else you have somewhat of a blank slate to start over.  You say you were never really attracted to guys, maybe you should start by deciding who *you* want to be, male or female and which sex you wish to pursue since it seems at this point you have been lied to or had that decided for you for the last 34 years.

I don't at all think you will die alone; not, if you don't want to. 

They say love is blind, but I never agreed with that. I think that people are blind, and love allows us to see the person beyond the flesh, the soul behind the eyes, the passionate in the fingers, the love in our hearts. So don't despair. We can't control what the world does to us, but we can control how we react and feel about it. In the Shawshank Redemption, Andy talks about music as something that they can't take from you. The world can lock you up, impose unfairness upon you, beat you, accuse you, judge you, but they can't take what's inside. Nothing the world can do can steal your hope or love or desires or passions, if you don't let it. 

You're not abnormal, quite the opposite, you seem to be a painfully normal person who has found themselves at a very difficult crossroads. Neither is your life abnormal, perhaps you may feel so in it's details, but our pains are relative. Your struggle with identity is not so vastly different than the struggles of many other people; who am I, why am I here, what is my purpose, why was I made this way instead of that, what do I do, where do I go now? In that respect, no one can tell you the answer. I guess the best thing to do is surround yourself with people who are supportive of you and your struggle, and rid yourself of the negative ones who (perhaps not intentionally) would seek to undermine your endeavor.

So, best of luck on your journey through life. I'm confident in the fact that you will someday find the answers you seek and a life that gives you joy. I suppose that it won't come as fast as you would like (as good things never seem to do) but it will.  

**EDIT:** I'm overwhelmed! I apologize, I've been away for a few days and just logged in.

Obviously a sexual relationship with you would be different from the norm. But that's sort of the case for everyone. Most people have *something* about them that makes sex/relationships with them ""different,"" and it's not a bad thing. 

But even if this difference *did* have a strictly negative effect, when attraction or love is already in place, which will generally develop independent of whatever your difference is, people will often be happy to deal with it, even if that includes sacrifices.

The film is Hedwig and the Angry Inch. It's an odd film, but stick with it. Almost everyone I've introduced to it has fallen in love with it. It isn't about someone in your position, rather its about an East Germany boy (pre the fall of the wall) who is persuaded by a lover to have a sex change so they can cross to the west. The op fails, the lover leaves him (now her) and she has to come to terms with being who she is. As I say, I'm not trying to suggest a parallel between you and Hedwig, but the film, in the end, is about the complexity of sex, gender and sexuality and, in the end, the power in accepting yourself for yourself, labels be dammed.

There are other people out there like you who were assigned a gender at birth. 

You also need to remember that whatever gender you feel is right for you, that is your gender. There are a few medical conditions that can result in a woman having XY chromosomes. If you are happy living as a woman, carry on doing it. 

It also sounds like your sexuality (which is not the same as your gender) might be something that you are questioning - you can stay living as a woman and have relationships with other women if that is what makes you happy.

Understandably you have a lot of questions and difficult thoughts. It might be worth seeing if you can get some counselling to help you through this time. 

You can have a normal life! Lots of people have unusual genital configurations. If a sexual relationship is what you are after you *can* find someone to be with. If sex does nothing at all for you though, you don't have to have a sexual relationship, by any means. Some people have asexual relationships :)

Be kind to yourself, you've got a lot to think about. Drop me a PM if you want someone to talk to about this stuff. I know more than most people about disorders of sexual differentiation but I'm by no means an expert. I am in contact with one though - and I might be able to find out from her who is best for you to talk to in the USA. Can't promise anything though. "	10	0

Some of the conditions you can search for are called androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, and Swyer syndrome.

I do not know if it was the same birth defect, I don't believe so, since she had genitalia and no colostomy - I'm reasonably sure she was born hermaphroditic, but just like you, her parents had to choose and chose female. Genetic testing wasn't yet available in the 70's. This person was also somewhat slow, mentally, which is probably how she isn't still quite aware.

I knew as a child, friends with her younger sister, who was apparently well aware of the situation. She told us she was born as ""both"" but they (her parents) chose a girl. It wasn't something the family really mentioned or talked about, and to that same extent they never made fun or scarred her over it either.

However, she is an adult now, over 35. She is married and she and her spouse were trying to conceive. I'm not 100% on their mental capabilities or states because this person, it turns out, just like you, is genetically male. She has never had a period, much less the proper plumbing, but doesn't seem aware of how a gets to z in the childbearing department. 

She has no idea why she hasn't gotten pregnant, apparently hasn't seen a doctor to find out why, and her family *will not* tell her the truth."	4	0

I have a friend who (infuriatingly) reminds me when I am upset with someone that the person I am upset with is my best teacher. 

So when I face difficulty I can look at it as a stumbling block or stepping stone, right? I can't understand exactly what you're going through but I can understand feeling lost. I can understand feeling alone and hopeless.

Think Helen Keller. I'm not comparing the two of you necessarily but I remind myself that not only did Helen Keller, a blind, deaf mute, learn to speak and read but she became a sage of sorts. She had to find her peace within. Easier said than done right? Of course. But the fact that it can be done is reassuring to me. Because even though it may be hard there IS a solution. Now I see I have a choice.
I sincerely am not trying to downplay your feelings at all. I have only found a measure of peace in my life through dispelling some concepts about how I should be. 

Your value doesn't come from your body. Your value doesn't come from your identity. *You* have value. Intrinsically. Value that no one can take away from. 

I can suppose that you had some fear in posting this but did so anyhow because you also felt safe. The feeling of security may have come from the anonymity afforded by reddit and the internet. A part of you was unafraid because it had reasonable assurance that it couldn't be harmed. What if you took that feeling into the real world? What if you were convinced that you had value no matter what and that no one else could determine that for you? That's healthy self-esteem. That's pretty attractive stuff if you ask me.

Read Helen Keller. Read Anthony De Mello. Perhaps you can abandon any notion you might have that there's something *wrong* with you.

*Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.* **~Helen Keller**

*""Why is everyone here so happy except me?""*

*""Because they have learned to see goodness and beauty everywhere,"" said the Master.*

I think you might gain more insight by reading up on the medical construction of sex.  I highly recommend Anne Fausto-Sterling's book *Sexing the Body,* especially the chapters on ""Of Gender and Genitals: The Use and Abuse of the Modern Intersexual"" and ""Should There Be Only Two Sexes?""  I know reading won't give you a sudden ""ah-ha"" moment that will alleviate all of the pain and confusion that you're feeling, but you may gain a perspective that will help you as you work through all of this.  As someone else mentioned, looking at information from the Intersex Society of North America might help you get a handle on the medical side of things.  Even babies born with their bladders inside their bodies are sometimes surgically altered at birth to ""fix"" perceived problems of sex assignment.

You might also look into asexual communities.  I have friends who identify as asexual; some are interested in romantic partnerships but not sexual contact.  Of course, if you want sexual contact, nevermind, but I want you to know that the inability to do penetrative sex acts isn't a deal-breaker for everyone.

Also, you say that you don't have equipment for sexy time to be pleasurable.  It seems to me that you're working with a very narrow definition of sexy time, one that is orgasm based and heteronormative.  Would you consider rethinking what sexy time entails?  I'm active in bdsm, for example, and in my set sexy times can involve lots of things other than genital contact - or with a purposeful lack of orgasm, even.  I wish you could see yourself as a sexual being, too, if you want to--enjoying massage, different kinds of touch, wrestling, and yeah, if you want, some bdsm kinds of play. :)  

I don't think you need to pick a sex identity, a gender identity, and a sexual orientation all at once right now.  I'm glad you're not pressing yourself to do that.  Please take the time to explore all your options, which may be wider than they appear, and please know that while yes, you will find that some people will shut you out because of these difficulties, others - like many in this subreddit - are happy to see you as a person first, with all of your problems and possibilities.  *hugs*"	93	0

Gender (and/or Sex) should have absolutely no bearing on who you feel attracted to. Sure, most men are attracted to women and most women are attracted to men but plenty of people are attracted to both and plenty are attracted to those of the same sex.

Veeks makes a great point that it doesn't matter what your biology is, GenderEqualsOther is free to love anyone they want. So what if their bloodwork says male, if they identify as female then they're female. That doesn't affect if they love men or women.

GenderEqualsOther just be happy with your life. Nothing has to change if you don't want it to. Terms like gay and straight don't work for everyone and ultimately, the only person who can tell you who and what you are is yourself. "	70	0

* As someone with no genitalia, do you still have a sex drive?

* I'm guessing (only fact goin on was your ex was one) you maybe a Christian, if so how did you rationalize this with God growing up, and how did other followers of Christ treat you?

[and now for a light hearted question]

I don't fit on the gender binary. Physically, I am female. But I have never related to females. They seem foreign to me. I mostly have related to guys in my life time, but there were things that separate me from that gender construct as well. So I've settled on thinking that I am ""somewhere in between"". I have male like characteristics, as well as female like characteristics, mentally. But much of this is based on the sociocultural perception of gender, and the fact that I don't really follow the strict gender rules of either gender in my society.

I would say that I am more comfortable around males most of the time, and feel my personality aligns with males more than females. I never seemed to quite bond or understand the females in my life. It was like I just wasn't connecting to them like I did with guys. For a long time, I thought I might be trans (for a while, I did want to be a boy, but I realized mostly it came from hating being a female, and the ways I was treated as a female). Eventually, I decided that I liked my female body and wanted to be a mother, but that I would be ok feeling as though my gender wasn't totally aligned with other women.

My fiance is biologically male, but I would consider him to fall under ""neither"". He does not identify particularly with male or female gender roles. He never adhered to the male stereotypes, and never desired to. 

Here is a silly example: Often, he is the one who snuggles in to my shoulder- a typical ""female position"". In our house, I am the one who kills spiders and unclogs drains (a typical ""male role""). But we switch off- sometimes there's a bug I don't like and he kills it. Sometimes I snuggle in to him because I feel more feminine and just want to be coddled. But it fluctuates- not only physically, but in my head. Somedays I feel ""more male"" and some days are ""more female"". That is what fluid means.

It's not really an easy thing to describe, now that I'm trying to do it. He doesn't feel fluctuations in his gender, he feels like he is always ""just himself"". Whereas for me, I can tell when there is a ""feminine"" part of my personality being expressed, versus ""male""- and especially when I feel male because my body tends to feel weird and 'wrong', and I feel bad that I don't have a penis like all my friends. :/

Sex and gender identity are complex, fluid, deeply personal issues. You're not alone just because your particular circumstances are so rare.

OP's specific condition is rare, but it's not that uncommon for surgeons to reassign sex at birth, without the affected person ever knowing more than that something doesn't feel right. And in addition to the asexual community, check out the intersex community. There may not be one place where you fit in perfectly, but there are plenty of safe places to look for empathy and support.	6	0

My life experience has been different from yours, but there are two things that I am very familiar with: identity crisis and depression. What I can tell you is that these difficulties are always accompanied by opportunity. Remember that it is not your genes or your body that determine who you are. You can be the person you want to be. I'd say that you should be true to yourself and the world be damned. Whether you choose to identify as male or female your only guide should be your own thoughts and emotions. Love and sex are two very separate human experiences and you can find someone to love you for everything you are. Hardship builds character, and you will find the strength within yourself to become the person you want to be. Times of crisis are times for renewal. I'm not going to tell you that it's going to be easy. But if you are true to yourself you can build a beautiful life for yourself. I am 32 yearls old, and rebuilding my life from scratch. I went through a lot over the past five years but now I find myself a happier, fuller person than ever before. It gets better. Once you know who and what you want to be, you set your goals straight and start working for those goals, life suddenly lights up. A blood test may tell you something about yourself you did not know. But does that change the person you are? Your boyfriend is very naive and infantile to think the way he does. The world is full of shitheads who will judge and avoid; pay no mind to these people. They are scared and confused by everything because theirs is a small and limited world. Hard as it may be, show them the compassion that they do not show us. That aside, there are millions, I guarantee, millions of people out there who will love you and fall in love with you for the person you are. Best of luck to you!	1	0

Also lots of people have sexless relationships and are cool with that. there is so much you can do to please eachother without that. - also im bi and my gf's strapon pleases me more than the real penises i enjoy, so there is that very good option if you are ever feeling adventurous.

As for the cum in the face comment - Oh, I wish I could give you a big hug!  I hope that with this new information you have, you can figure out a way to feel less broken on the inside, cum on your face or not.  Someone mentioned strap-on play, which may make you feel more powerful and less used during sexual encounters, whether with men or with women (and straight men can enjoy a girl with a strap-on; I'm trying not to assume anything your gender expression or sexual orientation in my comments).  I think that you also might feel less broken on the inside even with cum on your face if you felt that your partner treasured you - valued you, wanted to touch you, wanted you to experience pleasure, etc. - and that they did things for you just as you do things for them, to make them feel good.  I hope you've had that in the past, and I hope that you have that in the future.  "	65	0

You may not want to think you've got an illness as such or view this as a personal tragedy, but it's sure a lot of stuff to deal with. I promise you if you can find a copy of her show or if she does some of it in these articles, it's worth the listen.

I can see why so many people are recommending LGBT groups, but I see that as not that different than your ex breaking up with you because of his gay issues. After all, you were raised as a straight person, and you seemed to have dismissed your ""gay"" feelings for your girlfriends, you could have also been raised to not condone that lifestyle. But in the end you were more naturally attracted to women which makes you straight. You were a forced transexual. But that still makes you a transexsual. I dont recommend you talk to a transexual as they deal with stigmatation of the apparent 'choice'. I would think that one of their therapist, or someone who deals with identity issues. You seem to be ok with not being able to have sex, that will make things easier for you in whatever you end up wanting to** be**(not identified as). Think of it this way, If you are more comfortable with being a woman, you have already been raised that way and understand what its like to be one.

But that's not how it works - not even for people born with their organs inside their bodies. 

It's a gradual, analog progression with all sorts of twists and turns. 

We all start as women, and then through the release of chemicals controlled by our genes we move away from being women attracted to men and become men attracted to women. But each part is separate - who you are attracted to and who you identify as are two independent variables, each of which is controlled by different chemistry which may or may not work right. 

So while it's unfortunate that you had to wait until now to find out, it's ok. You can make it through this - it just takes time. 

And don't be afraid to ask for help, or to ask to speak with a professional. Your own human mind can be difficult to navigate, so getting external help is good idea.

Life is change. The notion of dying alone.. take that shit out of your mind. That is the one rule in life, everything changes. NOTHING stays the same.

Secondly, like Tyrion from Game of Thrones, embracing your lack of normality is what will make you strong. Embrace it and noone can ever use it against you. It will become your strength. It sounded like you want to be normal. Take that out of your head also. You are not normal. That is the reality. Normal is boring as fuck anyway. Fuck that. You are a unique beautiful individual. Fuck normal.

Finally, this may be hard to realise at times of stress like this, but you were born into an amazing time in human existence. Most futurologists believe that we will have fully functioning avatar bodies (like real life video games) by the 2040's. Also, maybe this time of change is the perfect time in your life to start exploring completely new interests that will shape your new identity? There is a whole world out there of amazing things that you haven't explored yet! From Ancient Aliens to hiking mountains to Shakespere to Skyrim to Lynyrd Skynyrd! QUANTUM MECHANICS, MATHEMATICS, GOING INTO SPACE, THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE!!! ITS ALL THERE!!!! LIFE IS FIERY WITH ITS BEAUTY!!

Right now, you have the unique opportunity to change literally everything about your life. The question is, how will you respond to this amazing opportunity?"	2	0

Find those communities; start with LBGT support groups. Your pool of potential love interests will be smaller than the majority's, but you can absolutely find a place where you belong.

I found out I was really female at 22 when I started to grow breasts after an interminably delayed male puberty. Turns out I'm genetically XX, but due to a transposition of the SRY gene or something (it's been 10 years and I barely remember the technical details) I grew normal looking male genitalia. I also experienced something of a mental breakdown as I tried to come to terms with this, as well as seeing a shocking new insight into my conflicted feelings (and big ol' birthing hips) that was much overdue. I live as a woman now, though I haven't gone as far as any surgery to mess around with 'down there'. It makes for some very awkward conversations when dating, and some assholes feel it's a reason to get violent, but there are a lot of wonderful people out there who will understand, or even if they don't understand, will still accept you. I'd recommend moving somewhere that is less dangerous for people like us, Seattle, Portland, San Fran, New York. 

Most of all, if you feel like this was a great revelation and put everything in place in your life, don't be afraid of embracing it and presenting yourself as male. You'll have an awkward in-between state, though probably a bit better going from girl to boy. Do what makes you happy, it's really the only we can do in this world."	41	0

Add in the colostomy and the random leaks that made my social life a living hell, and that made everything worse. Most of the sage advice I was given by others in the church just made shit worse. The calls to ignore the mean spirited comments from other kids went in one ear and out the other. I was suspended from school on several occasions for how I reacted to situations. (One time, this kid Lester was being mean about the smell after I bent the wrong way and made my wafer leak, so I shot him in the face with a crossbow I made out of Legos and rubber bands and a wooden skewer stick I stole from the kitchen, epic shot. Missed his eye by like 1cm. Totally worth the 2 week suspension and ass whoopin I got from my dad.)

I think your situation is so unique, so unprecedented that it's hard (maybe impossible) to assimilate some previously-defined lifestyle.  You may be too far outside the box to get back in before the sun collapses.  My humble suggestion: start trying to build a new box (forgive the expression).  It promises to be no simple task, and you have my deepest sympathies.

One thing that's becoming readily apparent to me is that we, as a people, are learning faster than ever.  Just the amount of public outrage at any injustice is a powerful, albeit sometimes subtle, indication of this. As such, it is my belief/hope that you will be able to find people who can be happy with you the person, not you the well-categorized life-fixture.  it's hard to find, but it's out there.

Where do you live? What are your options?  Gay and/or artistic communities (San Fran, parts of Brooklyn, Provincetown, etc) will be welcoming across the board, and you may find women (or whatever) that can provide you companionship, rather than mere acquaintances... especially if your tongue still works. ;p Maybe you can even learn how to ""get your rocks off,"" wherever/whatever your ""rocks"" may be.  But one way or the other, you have to be open to the possibility of changing location.

That is, I guess, the ultimate takeaway from my rant here: openness.  you now have to approach the world with the same openness that you hope to receive, unconditionally, and with constant vigilance.  you must approach your own mind and body with the same openness.  But most importantly, you have to forgive yourself when you ultimately get it wrong.  You are forging a new path, and as long as you AVOID PATHS OF SELF-DESTRUCTION, no one is in a position to tell you that you are doing it wrong.  

tl;dr YTMND. you choose the music.  you set the pace.  it's scary but you are now free to explore and develop yourself into whatever you need to be. It's just going to take time, patience, and forgiveness (directed inward and outward). EDIT: smoke weed in the in-between times.  it helps.  :)

For years I felt extremely alone and unneeded and under-appreciated by those in my life. This coupled with an extremely crappy home life (verbally, and sometimes physically, abusive parent). But about half a year ago I met the most amazing person in the world, and with her help and patience I feel like there is once again hope in my life. I, like you, felt there was no way someone like me deserved someone like that, but I can tell you that if I can find someone as great as her, then you will definitely find someone as well. There are beautiful people in this world. Just remember that and you will get through this.	1	0

Just because you grew up as a woman but just found out you were male doesn't mean you can't continue to live a semi-normal life..you can be a woman and be attracted to other women. It sounds like you grew up in the south, maybe the education of this stuff isn't great out there but you feel in your heart what gender you are, you don't have to follow what some doctor says. You can be attracted to women, be anatomically male, and still live as a woman.  	1	0

I am a guy, and I have had my first real girlfriend for 8 months. It's been great, we're in love, we were both virgins at the beginning and we have made love to eachother.

Here's the thing: I suck at sex. We've had actual P in V sex only twice and both times I came instantly upon entry. She's fine and supportive, but to me it's extremely embarrassing. So here's what I do, I've found ways to make her go crazy through means other than using my Penis. I've gotten extremely good at fingering, and also I'm pretty good at eating her out. You said you've never really loved a guy before, but feel like you truly have loved some girls you were friends with. While I am not gay and have no advice on how to help with whether or not you want to recognize yourself as female or male, I will tell you, from experience, that you can have a relationship with a girl and please her if you have enough dedicated to learn what to do and how to do it. And I'm sorry you feel like you're never getting anything from sex, sometimes it feels like that for me too. But then I learned its kind of a trade off type thing, where I please her by fingering her, and while I'm doing that I suck on her boobs, maybe hump her leg for a bit, which she's ok with, and that and watching her moan, can make me cum. Also, I love the passion. I'll keep my head up by her, kiss her, hold her with my arm thats not down fingering her. In my opinion, I've only down things for sexual feeling when I used to masturbate, with my girlfriend it's making love, and its different and its better. You gotta find out what pleases her, maybe even ask her ""does that feel good?"" see what she says. And then see if you can find anything that pleases you. You say that sexy time was never enjoyable for you, well maybe thats because your not attracted to guys, it sounds like your attracted to some girls, but never knew it. If you're interested, try and start a meaningful relationship with a girl, and when you feel you know her well enough open up and let her know about you. Also, I just want to say that you are so much better off with out your ex. You sound so open-minded, what with being willing to have sexy time but only for him. And then you find out life-changing news, and what does he do? He gets out and he runs away. Fuck him, you're better off without him even if you're upset about the breakup right now, its better off this way. I really don't have much for dating advice, sorry, as I said I have my first girlfriend right now. 

I never thought I'd have a sex life like the one I have right now. But you gotta learn your weaknesses and your strengths as a person, and as a couple. Just don't assume that this is the end because you are actually male, or that you will never get anything from sex just because you haven't gotten anything from it before. Be open and ready to try new things, try and find a partner that is also open and ready to try new things, and you never know what will happen."	-6	0

Gender (and/or Sex) should have absolutely no bearing on who you feel attracted to. Sure, most men are attracted to women and most women are attracted to men but plenty of people are attracted to both and plenty are attracted to those of the same sex.


It even goes further than that since some people are only attracted to a subset of the gender, i.e. to some girls but not other girls. In other words, nothing matters but how you feel and anyone who tries to stop you from living that way without a good reason should be removed. 

Note that this is an important and somewhat simplifying realization, but it leads to some pretty tough conclusions and actions. After all, there is a reason why people turn to authorities to be told how to feel. It's easier to be told how to feel than actually feeling the way you do -- you have a much simpler justification. ""He said so, argue with him, not me"" is much easier than ""Because I am that way, and if you don't like it, deal with it"". "	13	0

Your life has NOT been a lie.  I'm guessing that's the most difficult part to accept.  If you weren't suspicious or full of conflicting feelings while growing up, I'd say you fared well in your upbringing.

*You, personality-wise, are the same person you've always been.*

Moving forward will probably feel a little strange at first, especially since you seem to feel ""right"" about dating women now.  And from your other comment, the good news is ""no more cum in your face"".

Changing your appearance might seem odd, so I'm sure you'll spend the most amount of time analyzing what to do *stylistically*.  Should you keep a girlish haircut?  Or maybe go full-blown male in hairstyle, clothes, etc.?

I guess it would be very easy to get upset about the past, but since you've stated several times that you ""were going through the motions"", I think there is a opportunity to feel excited about the future.  A future where your romantic life begins to feel rewarding!

Is that the information they got from the blood test? The results of that may help you base your decision.

Since it sounds like it would be a while until you can afford the surgery, why not try 'living as a male' for a while and see if it feels comfortable and right. It would feel strange at first having lived as a woman for all this time but the more that you could put behind you temporarily and start fresh the more you might get out of the experiment.

These are suggestions that just occurred as a lay person, I'm not any kind of professional, so it might help you to talk to someone who has experience in helping people with gender identity issues.

Whatever happens, it's not going to happen over night. The only thing I can suggest is just try to deal with anger and frustration so you can put it behind you and explore yourself.

Don't spend too much time worrying about your ex. Sounds like you're better off without him.

What you need to do firstly is decide what is making you upset and sort that out first.

Maybe your mother not telling you or the boyfriend issue , how do you feel about them , then decide on a plan of attack and attack each of those issues one at a time, don't go around trying to solve all the issues you think of in one go, just take your time attacking each issue based on its merits.

I am sure you will sort this out, i am sure there will be a lot of questions you still have for the doctor or surgeon. It is up to you to sort those questions out in your mind and decide if they really are that important right now while you deal with all of this.

I am sure that there are many people in your life that love you and will do whatever they can to help you , even if it is just to sit and talk it over so you can accept it more easily.

In the future speaking to the doctor and asking what can be done will help you decide what to do. If you want to be identified as a male then so be it go for that with all your might, but don't let some stupid freaks on here tell you how you should feel or what you should do, nobody knows you as well as you do and nobody knows what you want at the moment including you i suspect.

Although this is obviously a very hard time and you are obviously going to go through much harder times in the future i am sure you will make it, just don't let the people on reddit that take pleasure in demeaning you get to you, they are more freakish than you could ever be."	0	0

At least you have a reason for being confused, a medical reason. 

My suggestion for dealing with this, is (if you have the support network), take some time off, and go camping. Grab a tent and head out somewhere wild and alone and do some serious thinking. 

It will let you screen out all the ""noise"" of day to day life, and really just figure our what you really want from things. 

Be sure to give a time when you are due back, so people can come looking if needs be. 

I have a question though, apart from the genital snafu, I am assuming you look somewhat, feminine ? 

Is this due to HRT?

I don't agree with the anti-gay sentiment but that is big news for him too. As a straight male, finding out he's been with a male the whole time is not easy news.

You can't just biologically choose your gender and expect a significant other to roll with it. 

To OP. Stay brave. There are people out there more accepting and you will find someone to be happy with. You say your ex left you but if you've never truly 'loved' a male, the relationship wouldn't have worked out anyways. 

Goodluck to you! It's a major hurdle but you'll pass it."	2	0

As it turns out, a lot of people aren't born with the ""equipment"" they ""should"" have, or want later. A good dose of body dysmorphia would not be unexpected in your case. There's no need to rush into a decision about what set of equipment you want - in this day and age, even if you already had your own set, you could get it changed - so if you still feel like a female, you can define yourself that way. Are you sexually attracted to women? You might be a lesbian. You don't have to have a penis just because you would have had one if birth had happened without any hiccups. Take as much time as you need to figure out who you want to be, who you are, and THEN you can go for it. "	1	0

At around 20 she had decided not to do any gender-assigning surgery, as she had heard that often afterwards all or most sexual sensitivity down there was lost. She had no outer genitals whatsoever, was as smooth as Barbie, but she did have sexual sensitivity (I don't remember if she could really come but she did enjoy rubbing), for which she was very glad. 

Of course in your situation they couldn't leave it as it was, but do you think that perhaps somewhere inside you are the remnants of clitoris/penis head tissue? And that perhaps instead of reconstructing the insides of a vagina that tissue could somehow be brought closer to the surface? So that you perhaps may not become fully female down there (or male for that matter), but you can at least have fun with what you do have? 

Whatever the future holds for you, I wish you all the best."	1	0

&gt; But much of this is based on the sociocultural perception of gender

That hits the nail right on the head. Let me give an example.

1. Society decides that aggression is a male-like trait

2. Person A is a female who is very aggressive

There are two conclusions from this:

1. Person A is (mentally) a male

2. There is no such thing as ""male-like"" characteristics

Why do we jump to the first conclusion? The second one makes so much more sense.

&gt; I am more comfortable around males most of the time, and feel my personality aligns with males more than females. I never seemed to quite bond or understand the females in my life. 

My girlfriend is the same way, I still don't see how this would make her gender ""male.""

&gt; He never adhered to the male stereotypes, and never desired to.

*Stereotypes.* That's exactly what they are. Nothing more, nothing less. Just because he likes dolls doesn't make him any less *male* than me.

&gt; he feels like he is always ""just himself""

That doesn't make him ""neither."" That just makes him a male that doesn't give a damn about social constructs (good for him)

&gt; I feel bad that I don't have a penis like all my friends

Penis envy doesn't make you male. 

---------------------------------------

I fail to see how what you described is more than a rejection of ""gender roles."" It doesn't explain how either you or your fiance are ""both genders,"" ""neither,"" ""fluid,"" or whatever other new-age terminology people will come up with.

2) A Colostomy kinda sucks. It's not uncomfortable at all. 99% of the time you don't realize that there's a plastic bag taped onto your stomach that is slowly filling with feces. After a while, the maintenance and care of it becomes second nature (as does carrying air freshener in your purse, and a spare bag, and tape). The area isn't really that sensitive, unless you go too long in changing it. The area under the wafer gets red and irritated, and then when you reapply the wafer with alcohol based adhesive... oh sweet god it can be blindingly painful. The trick it to change it BEFORE the skin breaks down. Diet has a lot to do with it. Anything containing citric acid should be avoided if the wafer isn't perfect at the time, or it will MELT you. 

3) High School... well, lets just say kids are cruel. I talked about this a bit in another response. It's easy to say ""just ignore them"", but in a world where high school social standing is the only thing you know, it's almost impossible to take any reasonable advice. By High school I was much calmer than elementary, so I didn't go all Lego Ninja on anyone, but I did trip one kid in to a thorn bush on the nature trail for being a dick once. 

4) Was I comfortable as a girl? I guess. My primary concern was ""Oh my god I don't have a vagina, how will I ever get a boyfriend"". It's confusing and a bit surreal, to finally realize that there was biology behind my emotions. "	3	0

I'm a little bi, had a few threesomes, but consider myself to be a heterosexual woman. Heck I still am very tomboyish. I love trucks, and camping, and fishing, hiking and rock climbing. I own one dress and no skirts. I have no high heels. I still love legos and play many ""guy games"". I never wear makeup unless it is a very formal event, and keep my hair pretty short so it's easier to deal with.

None of this makes me a man, or even manly or manish or even dyke ish(except maybe the slight bi-ness).

But I understand the confusion. Every since I was a little I wanted to be a boy, but not to the point that I am unhappy as a woman. You can even experiment if you choose too. I'm not sure how you are as far as breasts but if they are fairly small you can bind them down and go out an try to be a man. See if it fits. See if you like flirting with women, or find an open minded woman and go to town on her, buy a strap on, not that that will help but it might be fun.Or keep being a woman. Go out, meet some people, be a lesbian or hetero or bi.

But don't base your decision off who you think you were, instead do some thinking and find out who you are now. What makes you happy? Do you feel comfortable being a woman and dating men, or do you want to date women? Are you against being a lesbian? Does being a man feel good? Right? Or too weird? Heck you don't even really have to decide. There are people who are biologically men who live as women but never plan on getting surgery and the other way around. Maybe you are just what you are without having a real gender. Find people you like, fall in love with whatever gender you like, and be happy."	1	0

We've since learned that this often isn't the case, that *sometimes* the kid identifies as female in the end, but a lot of the time those kids grow up feeling like their parents picked *wrong*.

And, from the sounds of it, the emotional scale is more intense when you talk of the female friends you've been attracted to than when you talk of you're ex-boyfriend, so the emotional spark when you're cuddling or just chilling doing anything or nothing might be amplified from what you're generally used to, like finally going out and buying $$$$ surround sound after listening to a portable cassette player your whole life because the cassettes are socially acceptable.

I wish you the best of luck. I'm the same age as you, and I can't imagine having to deal with that.

I'm glad that people here are being very supportive. I never had to deal with any real gender identity issues. I've always been a self-identifying male. Although, I did struggle with sexuality for a time. That was difficult, so I can only imagine what you're going through is hellish.

They may have been very different experiences, but I think there may be a common way to deal with them. I spent time testing my attractions to girls, and then to guys. Then I tested if I liked both. I used the internet and the real world. It wasn't a short experiment. It went on for the better part of a year. In the end, I discovered that I was really only attracted to guys, with **very** occasional attractions to girls. I decided I didn't want to label myself, and I kind of just did my own thing.

I recommend that you do the same. See what gender you feel comfortable in. You've been female all your life, but maybe being male would feel more natural, or vice versa. You could feel comfortable as both, and switch whenever you feel like. You could be a female most of the time, and then decide to be a male for a day. You can choose one or the other, or you can choose both. And if you choose both, it doesn't have to be 50/50. You don't have to label yourself at all.

In the mean time, you're going to be pretty confused. There are quite of few lgbt subs here that are very welcoming to absolutely everyone. My two main ones are /r/ainbow, and /r/gaymers. There's also /r/transgamers, but I don't think they're very active. That's of course assuming you have any interest in video games at all. There are countless other subs you could use. /r/lgbt is pretty controversial. /r/ainbow was founded as a place for people who didn't feel comfortable there. /r/asktransgender could be helpful towards you, or /r/transgender. There's also /r/transpositive, /r/mypartneristrans, and /r/trans. There are probably others, but this is what I know of.

Just know that you are not alone in this, and that you can find people online and irl who will help you and care for you. I'm here if you want to talk. Good luck :)"	13	0

One of the boys' procedures went wrong and his penis ""fell off in chunks."" At the time there weren't any reconstruction options, so the parents took the doctor's advice and had his testicles removed and raised him as a woman.

The article explains his story a little better than I do so I'll let you finish it if you'd like. It falls into what you were saying, though, that gender is often more nature than nurture.

The term sex, the way in which you are using it in this context, means your biological and physiological set of parts.  What you come into the world with is not your choice, but your genetic make-up.  Gender is socially constructed and can affect someone's perceived identity of themselves, but when it comes to sexuality, when you eventually throw all social influence out the window, who you want to have sex with and who you want to love will become clear.  Sometimes, true sexual identity is much more simple for some but not others. 	2	0

Also in some parts of the world homosexuals are executed. 

Many people who are heterosexual have gay sexual relations by choice. In fact a recent study showed 3 out of 5 women are willing to have sex with another woman. The men results are lower however that is partially due to our extreme lacking in our understanding of human sexuality and perpetuated fear in our society. Consider this an awesome blessing.

What do you look like physically? Does your crotch just look smooth like a dolls?(i apologize for the poor wording)

~~You identified as a woman, so do you have boobs?~~(found answer in thread)


~~If you don't, or do but they are artificial how did you feel when they didn't come in as an adolescent?~~

How does attraction work for you? Do you find both genders attractive?

Have you ever experiences an orgasm? They are all in the mind, so it should be possible. Perhaps you could find a therapist who could help you learn to experience them.


How do people react when they learn you don't have genitals? And can they tell by looking at you that you are different?

My grandpa has a bag because there is something wrong with his bladder, i assume you do as well. With surgery, can they give you an urethra/anus to use instead?

I wish you luck in figuring yourself out, i know it is difficult for those without such a strange situation, so i can only imagine its worse for you. 

My only advice if you are looking for any is society has expectation for people, and as much sense as they may make to you remember they are all arbitrary. You have many options for yourself, and more freedom than us. If you every get reconstructive surgery(and i assure you in the comming decades we will be able to construct fully functional genitals indistinguishable from natural ones) you don't have to pick one or the other. If you wish you can pick both, and though it may be difficult, i assure you there are people who will not be put off by your choice. 

I can personally attest that though abstract compared to my regular option, i would not be opposed to dating, or even marrying, somebody with no genitals, both male and female genitals, or just one or the other. So if i exist surely others do as well.

&gt;My girlfriend is the same way, I still don't see how this would make her gender ""male.""

It's not so much that being comfortable around dudes makes me male, but rather, that hanging out with them, I feel more similar to them in some way than I do to females. Again, not an easy thing to try to explain. I can only try to do so through stories and examples, and then I'll point some things out at the end: 

1. After hitting puberty, masturbation happened for me very naturally. Though I grew up in Catholic school (i.e. Hell) masturbation was *never ever* mentioned, so I never had any problem with it, and it was great! When I got to high school, I asked other girls about it, and it was ""super weird"" etc. But guys thought it was normal and fine. So I ended up hanging out with guys, because I was somehow ""more on par"" with them. The girls I knew weren't interested in talking about gross body parts, learning martial arts, or fighting (intensely) for a remote. I felt very separate from them because I was labelled as ""not a normal girl."" 

2. In middle school, I was bullied and beaten up fairly frequently. From Pre-k to 8th grade, I was with the same group of people. A class of 90% females, with only a few guys. The females were the biggest aggressors- they would tell people not to talk to me, they'd lift up my skirt and laugh at me, or make fun of me because I didn't have boobs. i realized early on that it was a lot easier to be a boy than a girl. Boys generally were taken more seriously, and girls were put down. I found out in 7th grade that many of the female bullies were abused at home in some fashion. But because of this treatment, I started to hate being a girl. The guys I talked to were neutral, kind, if a bit awkward. I made up a male name for myself, and for a long time, dressed like a boy. 

3. In high school, another weird thing happened. Though I was no longer bullied at school, I was still bullied at home- my by step-father (a male!) It was to the point where I feared walking home every day. To deal with this, my brain created another personality that eventually would come out and deal with my dad for me. That personality was male- the embodiment of both anger and logic. Later on because of different abuse from a partner, a female personality emerged out of the emotion fear- a child who acted about 5 years old most of the time.

So, I've analyzed these a lot, and I've come to the following conclusions:

1. My behavior in story 1 was a product of gender expectations. Girls are expected to see masturbation as ""icky"" but since I had no preconceptions, it just happened naturally, as with many boys. It was this that brought me closer to males, and farther from females. I also related to the males I was around because they were honest, and very calm, unlike many men in my life.

2. I wanted to be male in middle school because I attributed my poor treatment to being female (which continued for a while, really. It sort of sucks to be a woman much of the time). I hated being treated like an object. Again, a fault of culture, not necessarily gender.

3. My personalities have always interested me. When I would switch over to the male (named Three) I would feel physically different. Like the blueprints for my body were wrong. I hate looking in the mirror if I switch over, I feel like I have the wrong 'parts', etc. I think Three ended up being male because anger/aggression/logic are ""male"" emotions. Rabbit (the child) was female because fear/weakness are culturally ""female"" emotions.

The only thing that stuck with me was my ""blueprints"" changing. I think that that is the best way I could conceive of what transgendered people feel. Not only is the ""mental gender"" wrong, but your body image of ""what you are supposed to be"" is biologically off. When I am Three, I feel like I have a penis, and he is very turned off by my vagina. He knows he's not a real person, but he has his own body image that is separate from mine (as the child does as well.)

Otherwise, I agree with you that it is 99% cultural perception and expectation. I am fluid only because I go back and forth between gender roles created by society. My fiance is ""neither"" because he just doesn't care. Haha.

Hopefully this was stimulating!"	3	0

It looks remarkably female, the camel toe shape, the flaps of skin that should be a labia, a little mound that looks like a clitoris that is actually a lie and does nothing.. the only thing missing are the holes down there. Pubic hair grows normally too. Yes, I have boobs. 

Attraction.. I don't know. I think I'm attracted to everyone? I always chalked it up to being friendly. Like I said in some other posts, I don't really know how to quantify my attractions to others. I absolutely appreciate the female figure, buy guys are sexy in a different way, like, the way that involves penises. I dunno. I grew up LOOKING for a man, because it was the thing to do. So clearly, any emotions I felt were the right kind, right? I'm not sure what I'm trying to say.. I'm still confused and not sure myself. 

Orgasm? That would be awesome, I think. I dunno what I could do to cause one, but I'm sure it would be borderline spiritual to feel one for the first time. My friend Jake once told me that the best part about not being able to HAVE an orgasm is that I didn't know what I was missing. Which is either a fucked up thing to say, or a sage realization. I still can't decide. 

I have a plastic apparatus that allows me to pee fairly normally, even tho the seal leaves something to be desired. As for the poop part, that's out of my reach. I have no muscle tissue there to form a sphincter, and even if I did I wouldn't have the requisite nerves to be continent. 

My Dad? Which one? My biological dad embodies Scumbag Steve in every way. He split when I was born and didn't have a twig and berries. My mom remarried when I was 6, and he has been very supportive, if a bit aloof.

Hopefully I can find someone with the same willingness to overlook physical shortcomings that you have. Thank you. "	30	0

Gender isn't real.

Sex is (usually) easy to define. Physical and biological traits. For you, it'd be a little bit more difficult (but only a little, as the doctors quickly pointed out), but that's not the point of this little bit of sharing.

Gender, on the other hand, is more ephemeral. We can list out what gender *isn't* (it isn't sex, physical differences, chromosomes, fertility, neurology, or biology), but it's more difficult to pin down what it *is*. We have guidelines, vague suggestions, etc, and most of those ""guidelines"" end up sounding like sexism if you list them out. Wears skirts. Wears makeup. Prefers bright colored clothing, whatever.

Except that the farther away you go in either time or space, the more differences in how various sexes behave start to appear. Men in Japan wearing heavy makeup. Men in Scotland wearing skirts (they call them kilts, but they're functionally the same). Pink was an entirely normal and socially accepted color to dress boys in 100 years ago in America. 

Note that phrase ""socially accepted"". Really, what defines ""gender"" for us is what society *tells us* is acceptable for various sexes to be doing. Which means that gender is only that which represents the socially acceptable form of sexism our culture currently operates under.

Gender also has no real bearing on reality. For example, Buck Angel is a famous porn star who identifies as male, but has not (and will not) undergo the cosmetic surgery to give him a penis, as he's entirely comfortable in what would normally be considered a 'woman's' body. Gender also doesn't determine your sexual orientation, or ultimately any other 'real' thing. There are plenty of cisgender women who don't wear makeup, and plenty of cisgender men who like to dress up in skirts and pretty outfits. 

Ultimately, gender seems pretty pointless. Either you're comfortable with &lt;your body/your identity/your orientation/your clothes/your lifestyle&gt; or you're not.

I don't know if this is in any way helpful, or if it's just me spouting stuff that has no importance in your life whatsoever, but I thought it might be helpful.

----

Finally, I'd just like to say I'm sorry your mother fucked up like that. I'm sure she did so because she thought it would be 'best', and with no malicious intent. Very few people fuck up people's lives on purpose. "	3	0

It way simpler if you phrase the question differently: do you feel like your current gender?

People who are transgender have a feeling that something is off for most of their lives. It's often described as being in the wrong body, feeling like they're putting on an act, not fully recognizing what they see in the mirror, and various other things. If you've never experienced it, it's near impossible to imagine (including for myself), but if it is something you're going through you know it's there, you just don't always know what it means or how to express it.

&gt;I don't ""feel"" like a guy, I just feel like me.

I would think suddenly learning that you are supposed to bat for the other team would be doubly difficult if this is the case. 
However, you have been given the opportunity now, to choose. You can't win and you can't lose. If I were you, I would take the advice of others and get involved with the LGBT crowd and get comfortable with and try the other side so you can choose well. Or not - and be happy with both or either."	1	0

My ""girlfriend"" (let's just say genderfriend since it's not actually that way.. genderfriend since boyfriend/girlfriend is just friend + the gender in front of it) was born as a female but later realized that ""she"" (I'll go and use the genderneutral pronouns, if you don't mind) was not actually a girl but rather feeling not belonging to any of the two common genders, thus genderqueer. 
What I learned from nem as a person is quite interesting.
First of all, I didn't know that up until a week into our relationship and the first thing that came to my mind was ""So, what?"". It did of course matter to me since I loved nem and ne is one, if not the most important factor in my life and everything I can learn about nem is something that interest me but outside of that, I don't care. There was no ""OMFG my whole world was a lie"", no ""I can't deal with this"" and no ""OMFG I SIGNED UP FOR A GIRLFRIEND NOT FOR...THIS"" 
Nothing changed for me. The person I loved was and is still the person I love. 
What I'm trying to say is : Who you are is not determined by your gender. You can be a decent person as a girl and you can be a decent person as a boy. You can give love regardless of your gender and you deserve to receive it just as much. In my opinion, gender matters too much for people. There's certain things you're required to do as either boy or girl, things like ""Don't do that, it's unladylike"" and ""Don't cry, you're a man"" come to my mind, at least that's what people tell us. I don't think that way. To put it bluntly, genders are overrated. People aren't acting the way they do because of their gender, they do because they were possibly raised in a way that fits the typical gender-role. 
In the end, it's a thing that you have to decide. Does it matter to you, or doesn't it? Do you want to change yourself to the point where you resemble a male or not? Or do you keep everything as it is and say ""I'm still myself because I'm not defined by my gender""? I'm not going to force you to do either, you have to choose what you're comfortable with. 
I know, it's not going to be easy and from this post I can safely assume you also know that. Society doesn't like people who drop out of the usual ""Male-female"" scheme. If you end up walking a path like that, you might just end up in the same spot my genderfriend is in now - born in a female body, living without a gender but being afraid of telling anybody because they might be disgusted or simply not understanding. 
Ne already had a few mental breakdown because at some point in nir life, people called nem ""It"", not ""he"" or ""she"". It's never easy. 

The end of this is just a positive message that I'd like to send out to you.
Do what you're comfortable with. That's just all I can say to you. Don't let yourself get held back by those who want to tell you how to live. How is somebody who isn't influenced by your actions at all supposed to tell you to live like a boy because you were born one, how can he make this choice for you without having his happiness rely on the choice like it might be the case for you? 
If you feel like being a girl, then do it. You have been doing that for 34 years now, it's likely to be easier for you. Don't let anybody tell you what to be, because while it might be a big thing for others, don't let it be one for you. You stay the same person regardless of your gender. 
On the other side, don't let me push you into being a girl with my slightly biased comment now. 
Your gender isn't determining how much love you're allowed to receive. 
You're worth just as much as anybody else.  
Think of it like this : Don't be a man or a woman, be yourself. And then following that, decide your gender. Because you have a choice. 

If there's any problems with this, I'd always be willing to talk about it - it's the first time I've talked about it like this, it might be unorganized and English is indeed not my first language. "	1	0

There's a whole lot of women who could say that. We usually call them ""lesbians"". Maybe that's what you are, too.

There's a lot more to an intimate relationship than just penetrating, or being penetrated. You can still kiss, still snuggle, still be fondled. You said in another post that due to hormones you have a relatively feminine shape. Given that, it's probably easiest for you to stick with presenting yourself to the world as a woman.

I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you, but I don't think you should despair.  There are tons of great people out there, and I think there's at least a little bit of greatness in everyone.  Your main struggle is going to be against ignorance.  My eyes have been opened up about transgender people over time mostly starting with a sex &amp; society class and continuing with personal stories and people I meet.  It's something that's hard to understand for most people because like you said you 1/400,000 and in fact as you said probably more rare than that.  Needless to say it's easy for a person to go through life without ever meeting someone like you, and even out of those who do meet a person like you, most of them won't ever have a clue about it.

I don't think you want to be in a relationship with a christian anti-gay person anyway, but I'm a little biased because I don't buy into religion myself.  Of course the anti-gay part is just ignorance and/or bigotry.  But anyway, I think even the people of this forum have to admit that sex isn't the end all be all thing in life.  Love doesn't require sex, and love is infinitely more meaningful.  I don't know what you'll choose to do with regards to your gender, your genitals or your sex life, but whatever you choose I hope it makes you happy.  I don't see you as a woman or a man, but as a *human being*.  I don't know if that's the ""right"" way to view genders or the biological sex of a person, but I do know now that those concepts are not binary.  What is certain though is that you're a human being, and I love human beings!  I'm going to stop rambling now and just say I wish the best for you, and I love though you're a stranger.

&gt; I just want to know if anyone else has some sage advice on how a person like myself can move on from something like this.

Move on? There's nothing to move from (except the douchebag 'boyfriend', but it's good he did the breaking-up, because now you're free to think about important things like what you want out of this situation). Not to deny the pain it may have caused, nevertheless the whole story is pretty unique and interesting! While many of us worry about banal existence, meanwhile you've been thrown into an adventure at the young age of 34. Here would be my advice, as requested:

-1-

The most important piece of advice I will give is this: look up unorthodox ways that others have achieved orgasm. Paraplegics and quadriplegics can orgasm. Some people can orgasm from unusual things - not necessarily direct stimulation (or maybe stimulation of other specific, or maybe non-specific, body parts). Maybe you can too, especially with training. 

Some people can even achieve orgasm just by fantasizing using careful techniques (though I'm not sure if it's *purely* mental). There are some videos, but you might have more luck with something physical.

You may not be able to orgasm, maybe you just aren't wired that way, so don't feel down if you try and you can't. I at least realize that it's very normal for women and even men to have trouble achieving orgasm. After you decide where the most convenient locations might be to fixate on (e.g. if you want a relationship with a female, perhaps orally... if you want a relationship with a guy, maybe that too... maybe slow tickle torture of your feet (which are near nerve pathways to the penis) but that might be physically inconvenient... maybe caressing the nose or ears). Maybe something sensitive done over and over will drive you wild, maybe something forceful of vibrationy, everyone's different. Maybe looking at the neuroscientific [sensory humunculus](http://tmww.blogspot.com/2011/05/homunculus-of-touch.html) might give you some ideas... or maybe that's irrelevant.

Also there's nothing wrong with things which the normal popular might consider 'queer', nomatter what an old book of random middle-eastern prescriptions (which may or may not have some divine elements in it) says. Regardless, you're in a special situation. You can do as you please!

-2-

People who are biologically male can get very horny if they do not masturbate. I don't know how horny you get, but it can be an interesting clue. The phrase we're looking at would be libido, or being turned-on. Hormones might definitely play a role, so definitely get those checked out and maybe start seeing doctors who have experience in this area. There are also drugs which increase libido. Maybe if you increase that, you'll naturally find an outlet with a partner who lets you.

-3-

You might consider looking at porn. Perhaps finding out which porn turns you on the most (try imagining yourself as one character to contextualize the experience). If you start to get annoyed or feel depressed, maybe try erotic literature. Maybe neither of these are good ideas for you since they might be a bit alien.

But probably the best thing is a partner willing to give you some first-hand experience see what turns you on, since port or erotic literature usually assumes some baggage which you might not have, and that might be priming yourself for something 'normal' when you really want to be priming yourself for something 'extranormal'.

At the very least, you should not be afraid of porn for 'moral' reasons (much like the 'moral' reasons your ex-boyfriend used to dump you). Viewing porn harms no one.

One thing you could do now is decide what gender you'd want that is feasible with modern medicine, and reflects who you are on the inside. Now is the best time to think about it. You may already be sure you wish to continue identifying as female. Maybe you want to identify as male. Maybe you want to identify as intersex... perhaps neuter if you don't comprehend human sexual behavior or perhaps androgynous if you have both male and female tendencies. -- Ignore how you are externally, think about how you behave. Keep in mind that there are effeminate straight and gay men, and masculine straight and lesbian women, and other combinations. You may have already made up your mind, but now is as good a time as any to figure out if this changes who you think you are... (or maybe you don't care! Great. Maybe what you identify as a question that does not even apply to you or which maybe you'll figure out in due time.)

-5-

Also, beware of using this as an excuse to not be able to do your job. It's entirely reasonable to need some time off, but deep down nothing has changed, you were the competent person you were who had the skills to land that previous job, and you're the exact same person now, just with opened horizons. You will be crippling yourself if you start to blame things on a new piece of information you didn't even care about before. Don't focus on the past, just the future.

HPV vaccine to protect you from throat cancer. Start now, since it takes requires waiting many months between boosters.

-7-

Get involved with local LGBT resources and groups.

When in the sack, make the joke ""unlike other people you've slept with, *my* asscrack is always clean"".

I'm a straight cismale. I shave everything because I don't like body hair and might generally be considered effeminate (I wear women's jeans and own at least one women's leather jacket because I'm slender and like the styles better). Yeah, I like computers and whatnot (and thanks to the hilarity of Top Gear UK, slowly getting interested in cars). However, I don't like sports and generally resent it if people treat me as ""just a guy"" and group me into a goddamn sitcom gender stereotype. Especially when people who know me better than that do it for the sake of socializing.  

I don't have any stories about playing with dolls or wearing dresses, but I've never been entirely comfortable being treated as one gender over another. Not sex -- I get that I have a penis and people have hangups about that, so separate bathrooms and everything -- but I don't get the labeling and prefer hanging out with any like-minded people over either gender.  

I guess the bad news is that a lot of people don't *get* how gender and sex stereotypes are so frustrating. However, on the upside, a lot of people *do*. I have friends that post info graphics about gender identity, sex, and orientation every now and then and I'm really happy when they do, because it's a sign that someone gets it (the majority of them are straight or mostly-straight and cisgendered, too, so again there's hope. It's not just the people facing the problem being vocal about it).  

Anyway, OP, from someone who can't begin to comprehend the enormity of what you're feeling or facing, keep looking up and ahead, and give yourself time to sort out what *you* feel about yourself. It's not like letting anyone pressure a label onto you is going to help anything, so just wait until you can decide for yourself."	2	0

It's a true story about a boy who was given a botched up circumcision and he ended up losing his penis, was given a sex change operation, raised as a girl and not told about his birth gender.  The circumstances are very different (obviously) but the confused feelings, the cruel remarks and feeling different or outcast from your peers is similar I'm sure. 
He lives in Manitoba,  is in his fifties, married to a woman and has a few step children.
You may be able to identify with him, perhaps meet with him.  In any case he lays his story out for all to read and doesn't hold back, I admire him to no end.  I truly hope that it gives you comfort and hope for your future.

I was born female, raised female, socialized female. I tried having girlfriends, and I had boyfriends. It took me 23 years to get my shit figured out, but eventually, I came to realize that despite all biological signs pointing to *bonjour madamoiselle*, I was actually a dude. (For reference, I'm 31 years old now.)

For some people, they knew from preschool that they were supposed to be the opposite gender from their birth sex. In my experience, it really is a mindfuck when you put the pieces together so much later in life like I did. On one hand, it's completely terrifying, because you don't know how you're going to handle it or proceed with your life, because it gets to a point where you can't ignore it, no matter how hard you try, so you have to face the music. On the other hand, you *finally know*. The secret that's been kept from yourself from within your own mind and body is finally right there in front of you.

As a guy without a dick, I can empathize with the frustration of not being able to have sex ""the right way"". I *know* I should have what I don't have, and it's disheartening and infuriating and makes me want to scream in exasperation. But... There are other ways to express love, and I do, with my husband(!) who is living proof that to some amazing folks, an excess or lack of various parts means nothing about your worth as a person nor your worthiness of love.

But the gist of it is: there are people out there who love you and who will stand by you no matter what. You can be a girl. You can be a boy. You can be somewhere in between (it's an option!), and there will be people who adore you and want to be around you and think you're the shit. Take heart in that. No matter how you proceed, you're not alone."	1	0

Although you've certainly got the far more powerful life experiences there, I can say I can relate just a little. I'm an identical twin, and I've always been attracted to women. My twin bro, on the other hand, came out as gay in college. I suppose I might have on some level wondered, but I always believed him when he told me he was straight. So, that day when he came out was a complete life changer not only for him, but for me. In hindsight, I can say I probably suffered some sort of mild PTSD.

What was so traumatic for me? Well, all my life I'd thought I was genetically straight, and although I'd wondered as every guy does whether I was gay it was always pretty obvious in swim class when I looked at a girl in her swim suit too long and had to cross my legs. But now, all of a sudden, the sexuality foundation I thought I had was essentially pulled out from under me. Nowhere near as impactful as a blood test telling you who you ""should be"" (I don't mean this literally but I'm guessing this is how you feel), but I essentially experienced  a ""role model"" version of that. Here was a person with the same genetic profile (I learned about epigenetics later) and he was gay. Shit. So am I gay?

Suffice it to say that it took me several years to become comfortable again with my sexuality. The fear pops up periodically, unannounced, but I've dealt with it pretty well by now. I don't hold any resentment towards my brother (how could I? Not his fault society hates gays) but it certainly took me a long time to feel comfortable around his gay friends, for example. But recently a whole flock of them wingmanned for me and got me a date with what seems like the perfect girl, so hey, sometimes things have a way of working out. 

Maybe what I should say is this - your sexuality is based on the feelings you've felt all your life. Being attracted to women all your life is quite the powerful revelation and might at some point actually be a relief to you. But don't let what is or isn't said by some genetics or blood test, don't let that tell you how you think you should feel. Explore your feelings gradually and perhaps speak with a friend (like me!) About it. You will likely have thoughts that kind of force themselves on you, pressures both from society and generated by your own mind (""i should feel male"", perhaps) but pushpst them until you find yourself again. And you will, regardless who that person is. And you'll feel better once you have."	1	0

Genitals aren't why I fall in love with people and they're also not why I stay with people. There are too many great ways to be intimate without another set of genitals to mush into mine for me to be that wrapped up in them.

I'm certain there are loads of other women out there who feel the same way. Get an okcupid profile or something similar where you can be upfront about who you are. It takes away from that awkward moment when you have to break it to someone and only people who are good with who you are will message you. :) At the very least, you might make some new friends!

He had the depth to accept you as, I'm not exactly clear, what amounts to no gender physically but assigned, for lack of a better word (chosen comes to mind, but feels judgmental), female. I don't think you internally being male with nothing changing should make a difference. Most Christian opposition to homosexuality comes from the ability to reproduce, or the inability (which is a broken argument from the start, but it shows he didn't fully buy into it at one point).

I like to think people are just _people_. There are gays and lesbians and bisexuals and straight people and the adventurous sort who will try anything, as well as manly men, girly girls, manly girls and girly guys, and they're all okay in my book as long as they show a certain minimal amount of respect we should all show one another. That being said, if you were comfortable living as a woman, maybe you should stick to it. You definitely want to explain the full condition as you currently understand it (including biologically male) to any potential partners, but I think there is no shortage of people who would be glad to have you as their partner. Plenty more who wouldn't, but that's true for us all. As a fairly unattractive guy (I'd give myself a 4/10, maybe 5 on a good day, I suppose) who is about to be 34, yet married for 7 years, I really believe there's at least one person out there for everybody who is perfect for you.

What makes you male, or female? I don't think it's 100% tied to reproductive organs. You've lived 34 years as a female, so I don't think you should describe yourself as a _""girl""_ with quotation marks. Your claim to the gender identity of female is, I think, completely acceptable."	2	0

All I can say is to keep in mind that people's reaction to you has more to do with their own insecurities about sexuality, gender identity, and masculinity or femininity,  and almost nothing to do with the person you actually are. We all hold up mirrors to others, and your particular mirror shows people aspects of themselves they find unsettling,  or would rather ignore.

One of my best friends is a lesbian transwoman. Of course she has a penis and of course she's a lesbian, who cares? I'm an almost-asexual lesbian, by the way. Labels are difficult.

But we're not even asked the question. Nobody asks us ""what gender do you define as"" or ""do you like boys or girls"". Even in 'tolerant' environments, these questions just aren't going to be asked, you are supposed to find out yourself. But so many people just don't find out, because they never realize there's a question to be asked."	1	0

Gender is a spectrum and those that fall in the middle typically tend to be the more interesting individuals.

From reading through it sounds like you've been living by the expectations of society. You're a girl so you date guys for example. Now though a whole realm of possibilities is open to you, and it always was but now you have a reason to go seek out new ideas and new communities. 

I don't see you as 'living a lie' if you identify as female. You are whatever you want to be. Whatever feels right for you, be that, even if it makes no sense to anyone else. Your ex is hung up on his own issues, and it's sad what he did but understand he left because he was having problems, not because there's anything wrong with you. Hell it's not like you knew... and it's only at the chromosomal level anyway. That's microscopic. To me leaving you over being XX and not XY is stupid, but if that's how he wants to roll you wouldn't have been happy with him in the long run anyway. 

You've got a lot of reading and exploring to do. :) One thing that's cool about the GLBT community is that when it comes to sexual expression they are way more open minded than the general straight community. If you want an identity, you could just call yourself queer for now, that kinda covers everything in a nutshell.

And BTW, I know you're in Michigan but if you ever head south stop by Columbus, they have [one of the largest GLBT communities in the country](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/07/20/the-20-gayest-cities-in-america.html) (I know rite? go figure). 

So take heart, there are many people in the world that want to know you and will support you in whatever you want to become.  :)"	1	0

You mentioned faith specifically the Christian faith, how strong are your convictions are you hardcore im Christian or are you just Christian by birth and upbringing.  I would suggest doing what I did when I had my life changing turning point and figure out where I stand on religion, first don't be afraid to challenge your beliefs research what it means to be Christian and what are some logical reasons to become something different.  

I became atheist, I was raped in foster care as a child at 8 for a total of 6 months day in day out. I went search in search of answers that were not there and lead me to look at my beliefs in a scientific answer. I am not trying to offend you just offer a bit of potentially helpful advice. 

Now onto my next point that I can relate to with you. I am 100% male I love my penis and would never change it however I feel traped by my male body as I feel I should be female I am transgender,  I feel 90% wrong and trapped I should be female above the waist I want the long flowing hair and breasts the sweet cute female voice but I want my penis.

I love the female body and form. The problem I am straight I have no interest in men.

As is I make a passable female when dressed right I turn guys heads and I have been hit on by guys and made them look like idiots because they were trying to impress their friends by picking up a girl at the mall.

I feel your gender identity pain I may not understand the frustration that comes with your condition but I feel the emotion turmoil gender identity causes. 

Never give up, if you like women go for it and make the rest up as you go, if you find a girl you see the rest of your life with go for it. Something to consider tho just because you can not see your life as a male does not mean you can't have a penis if you want it a penis Does not mean that you have to change your whole identity. Heck I have a penis but want to keep it and be female from the waist up.

Good luck keep your chin held high and make it up as you go and figure out what YOU want be it men or women a penis or a vagina.  The one thing you have to do is not give up. Keep moving forward not looking back wondering what might have been. From this point forward you are incontrol."	1	0

In all honesty I think 'gender' is an illusion. Male and female are just the body parts that fit together and not much more then that. I think in this world, a person can love another person and that 100% natural no matter the ethnicity, race, gender or anything. You in your mind are Strait Cis female, me in mine is gender-neutral.    
You saying you 'never really connected with males' might not have been because of your genetic gender, but because the men you've met not-so-great-guys.     
This is just my opionion, so don't take it as fact, but i think most people are just 'strait' by choice. Every man or woman i've discussed about this have admitted that they've had same-sex attraction at some point even if they never acted on it.

Edit: i want to jump back on and add another question. Just because you dont have visible genitalia doesnt mean you may not have the similar nerve endings. Have you dont a lot of exploring sexually to find out? And even if you dont have specific nerves that were meant to be your penis, there is always the ""phenomenon"" paralyzed people use when another body part they do have feeling in becomes sexual to them, like an ear or finger and they can orgasm from touch in those areas. i cant remember what that is called though."	2	0

She gets sexual satisfaction from fucking me (note that some men like penetration as well), and from external stimulation.

Also, sex is 90% in the brain.  Does any kind of touching turn you on? Like back rubs, light fingers all up and down your body, licking your breasts, etc.? This could stimulate you mentally enough to provide you sexual pleasure.  Think about what turns you on, and if you don't know, think about a lot of different things.

That is, there are certain things that are 'feminine, and certain things that are ""masculine"", and most people posses a mix of those traits, and aren't purely male or female, but rather, lie somewhere in the middle. The idea that 'male' and 'female' identities exist is a social construct and not a natural occurrence. However, these genders, and the characteristics associated with the genders, have become so ingrained in society that they have become a part of our own identities, for better or for wore.  


Your gender is your own.  Whether you identify as a female, male, or neither, is just one aspect of your identity and personality.  Don't let the rules of society, or jerks like your (thankfully!) ex bring you down.  

You are a beautiful person, regardless of your gender.  You are so much more than a single chromosome or sex organ.  You have hobbies and personality quirks that make you unique, and combine to make you who you are.  


There are so many different types of people out there, and you are in no way alone in this gender identity crisis.  Thank god we live in a world where people are able, to some extent, to express themselves.  I can guarantee you that there is someone out there who will love you regardless of your sex organs, and will love you because you are you.  There are so many asexual people out there, that don't need or desire penis-in-vagina sex, that I am confident that you can find someone to spend your life with who will love you BECAUSE you are different.  Not inspite of it.  "	1	0

On the other hand, fuck it. You've spent your life the way you are, why change now? And what do you mean ""blood work"" says you are one gender? Men have penises, women have vaginas. Without either, it doesn't really seem like the blood means shit. It's like being born into a Jewish family but choosing not to have faith. The blood work only means you are male by blood.

They removed the genetic gender test from the Olympics because it is inaccurate, not sure if this applies to your situation, but illustrates the whole mess of defining a gender.

Sex with men is so penis-centric; it starts when the penis starts, ends when the penis ends, with no regards for the full body experience that can make sex so amazing.

Sex also doesn't need to be orgasmic, but I think you said below that you have a spot that ""tingles and jingles"". Have you ever tried a really strong vibrator like the Hitachi? Some women who have gone through female circumcision can orgasm like that. 

But if you can't orgasm, no sweat. Some of the best sex I've ever had was non-orgasmic for both me and my partner."	2	0

I just watched a documentary about how in India, there are 3 celebrated genders: male, female and intersex. 

This goes with anything, why does there have to be a clear cut answer, ideal, reason or term for what goes on in our lives? That's when people feel stuck that they don't fit the certain ideal, or societal norm. I don't think that is fair to anyone, and I hate to see somebody struggle because they aren't who someone else says they should be. I personally am speechless and mind-boggled anytime I think about how we are all so *seriously* different. I can tell, you are a beautiful person, who were dealt cards that are a true test of your strength. I would be your friend in a heart beat. When did looks all of a sudden identify how you would be as a person? Maybe I am wise, or maybe I just understand that nothing in nature is perfect (except bacon.).

As with your ex, his obvious blinders are religion. That just goes to show bronze age thinking  **REALLY** needs to fucking disappear! The hippies, albeit were drug induced a good chunk of the time, had it right with their way of thought. 

Anyways, just know that there are mature, wise and compassionate people out there. I'm sure you have read this a million times already, but seriously do what YOU want, think what YOU want, feel what YOU want. We are all here for you!!

Although in the past they simply changed all ambiguous male genitalia into female genitalia, the protocol has now changed to allow the individual to decide for themselves which gender they would like to be once they reach a certain age. Do you believe that is the correct approach, speaking as somebody in your position? 

Chromosomal sex does not equal gender identity. You may be genetically male, but that doesn't mean you are hormonally or anatomically male. Take the time to figure out which gender you feel you are. Just because you like women doesn't necessarily make you a man (for example, I'm a female who likes females!). I would say take your time. Although there are some dickheads in the world, there are also plenty of lovely people who will want to help you through this undoubtedly difficult period of your life.

First, I'm super impressed at your openness and ability to handle this all.  I can't imagine not being able to talk to anyone who can relate. 

Given my experience with 10+yrs of debilitating chronic pain, I have to reiterate what Msbobdobbs said.  No matter how psychologically/emotionally strong you are, society doesn't properly teach emotional intelligence, and we can all use a lot more.  Going through something like what you're experiencing, having better mind/emotion skills can make all the difference in the world.  And those skills will improve quality of life even when you get out of the rough times. Well, as long as it's ACT, CBT, or DBT (Acceptance &amp; Commitment, Cognitive, &amp; Dialectical Behavioral Therapy), as they're all skills based, rather than the movie stereotype of talk therapy. 

Pursuing medical research now is also a great idea, as it can give you so much more access to better and more medical options, which in this country as you know can be unobtainably expensive.

Oh yes, that is amazing, it's even better than it is in your imagination right now :)

Even though you do not have genitalia that is visible on the outside, the clitoris isn't actually only the small visible nub. The bigger part is inside the body (see the wikipedia article for a drawing). Maybe you do have that? If so, you can probably still get aroused by... maybe vibration, down there? One of the strongest vibrators is the Hitachi Magic Wand, in case you want to try it.

Took a while to figure it out, but eventually I got it. The gender binary is stupid, and people who cling to it scared. I'll not turn this into a crusade, and I'll ask others to not get defensive - this is not the place.

When you get down to it, ""girl"" and ""boy"" things are only that way because you were told they were. Once upon a time, you were told the world was flat, Australia didn't exist and the toothfairy was real. Ignore the concept of boy or girl, man or woman. You're you. And uoy. Ouy. uyo. Whatever you want to be. 

Nobody is really straight or gay - homo and hetro sexual are extremes. Everyone is in the middle to some degree. Maybe it's not a lot, but most likely it's self conditioning, and convincing yourself that you're not attracted to them. Know what? Screw that, and then screw them. Or buy them dinner. We should be past that kind of discrimination, and by the sounds of it you know why.

The last thing you might need to understand is pushing you to girl mode was probably the right thing to do. There is a lot more tied to girls physical sex, where girls tend to get tied to willingness and maternal instinct. The lack of testes would of affected your growth as a guy too, so you would of been one of those small guys that get picked on for not being man enough. It might not be the correct answer, but given the data at hand, it was the safe bet.

So moral of the story? This doesn't change anything. Society has hang ups, you're being hurt because of them. That's an abusive relationship - get the fuck outta dodge. There's plenty of ways to play in the bedroom, so that really isn't a huge concern. To be crude, you still have a mouth for guys, and a mounting/belt point for girls. Love is about the soul, not the body and you appear to have one of those.


Besides, we're on the verge of a huge technological golden age, and it looks like a large part will be on human augmentation. You're missing bits which could very well be grown and transplanted to you. Give it a few years, explore yourself, and find someone to hang out with for the rest of your life. or someones - Just because monogamy is the norm, doesn't make polygamy bad.

Most importantly, this isn't a mountain. It's like a half story at most. Breathe deep, seek peace."	-2	0

It is sad for you that your boyfriend felt that way, but that was his choice - he minded. He doesn't matter anymore. 

A lot of people would mind, I imagine. People have trouble wrapping their heads around things that are new to them, and tend to judge what they don't, can't, or won't attempt to comprehend. 

That being said, there are also a lot of people who won't mind, and will thus come to matter. It won't be easy for you, not by a long shot. But I really don't think your odds of finding someone to be happy and in live with are that astronomical, especially with the worldwide internet connections today. 

Don't make finding someone a priority, like finding a door in a burning building. Take some you time and figure out what you want and need, not from your future SO but for yourself. You don't have to identify your gender or sexual orientation.

From what I understand, you have spent your entire life thinking of yourself as a girl. Society around you also thinks of you as female. In your case, which is having no genitalia, the notions of male and female are just meaningless tags. You got devastated because the genitalia you don't have are male, while you expected that the genitalia that you don't have to be female. It's like saying that you are angry that your imaginary Lamborghini Aventador is white and not black. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't want to donwplay the pain and anguish that you must be feeling. I just hope to assist you in putting things into perspective, so that you realise that you are already dealing successfully with the biggest of your problems (lack of genitalia). I am not a psychologist, but I think that this revelation that your asexual body is 'male' rather than 'female' was the drop that caused the whole dam of pent up emotions to come flooding down. This may be a good thing, eventually, when the emotional debris dries up and you come out of this stronger and hopefully happier.

I think that you may be downplaying the heroic fact that you overcame your hugest problem, ie that you lack genitalia and rectum altogether. You didn't break, you didn't become a shadow of a human being, just trudging along, broken and miserable. You got a job, you got a partner, you built a life, as a (beautiful? I don't know how you look like, but from what I read, your inner self must be amazing) girl. This is true living, true fighting spirit that we are talking about! You shine, tough as a diamond!

So, at the bottom line, you find yourself attracted to girls? Congratulations, you are a lesbian! That might a bit tough to deal with, given our homophobic society, and that may be a good reason to freak out. 

So, your body hormones and blood kind are 'male'? You are a girl with male blood. I don't think that this adds much additional trouble to *NOT HAVING GENITALIA OR an ASS!*

From what I understand, in this rare situation you find yourself in, you have one upside: You get to pick your own gender. Use it. Since doctors picked female for you and it seems to have worked to a degree that even your mom did not find it worthwhile to 'correct', don't fret too much about it. 

I don't know you, and I don't know what you look like. But reading your post, my mental image of you is that of a girl."	3	0

First of all, with the advances made in stem cell research, it might be possible in time to grow you not only a set of genitalia, possibly of your choice, but also a functioning anus and any bits of colon you might need.  I would keep an eye on that research and see if any trials come up if and when you decide you want to solidify your external gender, or if you just want to ditch the colostomy bag (totally wouldn't blame you).

As for your boyfriend, sorry to hear about it.  I don't suppose it was any easier for him to digest than it was for you, especially with the biases you mentioned, he probably just lacks any sort of perspective around which to form an opinion.  That said, perhaps it's a blessing in disguise, if you really were only going through the motions, perhaps now you can investigate those more loving feelings you've had towards women.  I bet you could find a lesbian or bisexual woman who could return your feelings, or as others have pointed out someone asexual.  Really, whatever floats your boat, and now you have some information that might help you answer some tough questions that your partners might have about you.

No matter what, you are the same person you've always been, gender is only a small fraction of that, and gender is less cut and dried than it ever has been before.  http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Genderbread-2.1.jpg  If people have a problem with how you chose to live, or who you choose to be, they aren't worth your time.

Science made you a woman, and you didn't have a choice about it. So in their view, would it be more Godly to remain the sex that you were raised and continue to date men, or attempt to start living as a man and dating women? I guess it just shows the limit of that type of black and white thinking that doesn't allow for the realities of the variety of human beings in the world.  

I'm glad you're at peace with your God. I admire you for your honesty and humor. It's been said several times but I'll say it again... you are what you think you are and what you want to be, not what your chromosomes say. It shouldn't really matter... you can be a butch woman or a feminine man, or something in between... that ought to be available to all of us.

The way everything works together is just amazing.   I do not get erections when looking at nude or vivacious women. But yes we do get erections, only time I might get one is when I am with a woman and we are getting fairly intimate.  Even then it doesn't always happen and if it does its because its biological not because I want to have sex.  

Many people forget that becoming aroused (erection, becoming wet) is something that is human nature.  It is our nature to survive, but for asexuals.  We can become aroused and not think anything of it, I have had erections many times and thought nothing of it and just let it go away. 

When I want to please her, I can maintain an erection.  Its difficult in actuality cause my mind normally goes off to other things(what I need to get done the next day, do I have homework or tests etc.)  But it is possible. "	9	0

When my cancer relapsed, my local oncologist said statistically I had a 10% chance given the circumstances.  I'm of an underrepresented mixed-race in the world, so finding a DNA match for a bone marrow transplant went nowhere.  My only option was an experimental procedure where I'd basically be a guinea pig to research and probably not survive, or get an umbilical cord transplant where the donors' DNA didn't have to match as much, but would take twice as long to recover.  I guess another option would be to ride out my disease until I would terminate months later (I guess some people actually take this route).  I chose to go with my best risk and get a cord blood transplant.

Umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant donations are collected from stem-cell rich umbilical cords' blood of babies at birth.  These vital umbilical cords have been historically just clamped and thrown away.  But now provided the parents know this information, these umbilical cords can be donated to save lives like mine instead of trash.

To prepare for transplant, a patient has to be rid of any infections (I had pneumonia they had to take care of first) and has to undergo a temporary chemotherapy protocol to put them back into a suitable remission.  After that's all ready, the patient has to do a barrage of high dose chemo and sessions of both isolated cranial and full body radiation.  This effectively kills off the patient's ability to create any new blood in their bone marrow.  The stem cell transplant - whether collected from harvested stem cells, bone marrow donation, or cord blood donation - is then given to the patient as a 'save'.  Since I'm a tall male, I needed 2 cord donations.

Well after an exhaustive search, the medical team found 2 suitable cord donations: 1 boy and 1 girl.  They both had different blood types than each other and me, but when it was all over with, I'd end up with one of their blood types....

and their sex marker in my blood tests.

The boy's stems cells ended up winning, so I now have his blood type and his sex marker.  I used to be B+ but now I'm A+ (it sounds like science fiction).  If the girl's stem cells would've taken over I'd have her type O blood and marker.  But if I had the female sex marker, it would affect nothing, just what I would've received in blood tests.  I joked to my doctor, asking if I would grow boobs if I got the girl's blood.  He just looked at me like I was crazy.

And all of this makes sense when you think of females having male bone marrow donors (I have a friend who got one) and vice versa.  Their new blood tests reveal that they are of the opposite gender, but nothing sexually changes.

With this in mind, I hope you can find peace.  Are those sexual markers really as definitive as they're made out to be?  Only you have the power to decide!

**tl;dr** As a male leukemia survivor, if my cord blood stem donation was from a female donor, my blood tests would show her sexual marker.  It wouldn't change anything sexually.

(note: I'm not well versed in the medical science behind this; this is just the info gathered through the process)"	2	0

From personal experience and extensive psychology classes and studies, I really think it'd be beneficial for you to try out both hats, so to speak. Every person feels the need to discover themselves in one way or other, some through sexual experimentation, others through major and job changes. Go to a club, make out with a girl. Date around with both genders and those in between. See what you like. If you like women, you don't have to go be gender reassigned, you can stay a woman. This may be wrong, but since lesbians aren't looking for a man with his natural tools, they might be more accepting than allot of straight woman. If you feel comfortable as a woman, there's no reason to change that.

Now something I have way more experience with.
Your ex was a dick.
You said he was very religious and left you because you were born a man, but I'm hazarding a guess that he was with you to begin with to get the good Christian points. After all, premarital sex wouldn't be an issue and he could chalk it off as religious self sacrifice and charity. He was a worthless human being and your better off without him. My fiance feels no need for sex (but enjoys it if it happens) and is bisexual. He honestly wouldn't care if I was a woman, man, neither, or both. I'm the one that'll push for sex because he's apathetic. He told me that any man that would leave you over that isn't a real man. Go find a real man or a good woman. And find yourself in the process."	1	0

Biological determinants of sex (however those are defined by the scientific community), self identification of gender, and sexual orientation can take any sort of combination because the other two do not determine the third in anyone.

Sure, we can be raised to believe that they all align, and we do live in a heternormative, cis-gendernormative world, but that doesn't mean that we can't break off from that thinking, and we can avoid ostracizing people who don't completely align with our societal expectations.

It does not change any facts though - she could be asexual without knowing it, or she could be asexual while having sex - just like there's plenty of homosexuals that have sex with girls either because they haven't realised it yet, or because they want to hide their real orientation from the disapproving society.

Similarly, there are plenty of non-offending pedophiles who simply go through life not having sex with kids, just like I and most normal people control our own sexual urges, and don't rape people they find attractive. I haven't had sex in quite a while, and I am most definitely not asexual; merely involuntarily abstinent. (Or rather, I choose not to have non-consensual sexual relations.)

Currently I only recommend 2.5% BP gel from acne.org, it's the best I've ever used. It absorbs the best, no real scent, no irritation, and it works well. Tests have shown that 2.5% kills the bacteria that causes acne just as well as anything above it, with less irritation and dryness.

For face wash I recommend Cerave hydrating for normal or dry skin, and foaming for oily complexions. Always use a moisturizer, I wish I knew that was my problem, over-production of sebum beyond puberty for me was because I was so aggressive with my treatments and would strip all the sebum thus requiring more production. Cerave moisturizer in the tub is hands down the best thing ever for face and body. I get serious alligator skin in the winter. Not greasy, absorbs fast, no scent, and completely awesome.

Bullshit - sort of. If you're stuffing yourself with sugar and you have acne, you will break out like a mother fucker. 

I no longer have acne, but I do have dry skin due to sebhorreic dermatitis. My skin is usually red, puffy, and when it's not dry, it's super oily. 

Once I cut unnecessary carbs (i.e sugars and carbs that don't go right into workout nutrition), I starved the yeasts that cause my condition, and my skin turned the correct color, and my dandruff and general flakiness disappeared. "	2	0

My acne is severe and cystic. I can tolerate a little bit of whey as a filler, but I cannot drink the shakes without a major acne response, usually about 36 hours later. It's casein that really gets me though. I avoid anything that lists it or skim milk as an ingredient - even things like burger buns. I never do cheese unless I'm willing to take a week of shut in. Thankfully I can handle butter, as it has very little dairy protein. I limit my chocolate, and I suspect that peanuts may cause my skin to flair up as well, though I have no idea why that would be.  I've accepted a certain amount of acne as the price for eating out when I choose to. 

It's a pain, but I'm doing much better than I was a year ago, and I feel like I'm in control. I dont use any special products anymore (scripts never worked for me and I am unwilling to use accutane). Truthfully I dont even use soap anymore, just a physical exfoliator. Soap makes me overly greasy. I typically use a two week elimination diet, test, and observe my skin's response for five-ish days when I'm concerned about an ingredient. Citrus is apparently another trigger, but luckily I haven't had a problem with it. Best luck!

-I should clarify- accutane is not an option for me because I'm looking to conceive this year. Same with spiro. It also seems to not work permanently for hormonal acne in women. "	33	0

This is especially true if you're a cycler (good month followed by bad month, repeat).  

Cleaning with mild soap (I'm using the new Cetaphil oil control cleanser and moisturizer), never sleeping on the same pillow case twice (I flip my pillow to get two nights out of it, then change the case), NEVER touch your face during the day, especially without first washing your hands, exercise to relieve stress and promote circulation to your skin, get some sun regularly, and dry your face with a different towel than the body one.  These things may help a little bit, but what's happening deep inside your skin is going to win regardless.  Also note that much of acne takes a while to develop; a breakout this week may be because of triggers that happened months prior.

If you haven't been to a dermatologist in a long time, give one a try. New and better medication comes out all the time.  If some haven't worked for you before, new ones may do better.  I just started Aczone and a new retanoid with microsphere technology, as well as one cycle of a new antibiotic that targets the red breakouts without bad side effects (Solodyn).

See r/skincareaddiction for more info if you want to know more) I have seen major improvements. I still get zits, but nowhere near as regularly, and nowhere near as bad. 



Also, I just answered a post about this over in the aforementioned sub, but Aztec Healing Clay mixed with Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar... Holy crap does that stuff work. It helps bring things to a head, decrease inflammation, and keep your pores from clogging. There's a lot of science behind how it does that, between the malic acid in the ACV that acts as a mild alpha hydroxy acid that helps break down clogs and is a mild chemical exfoliator, and other stuff like the calcium bentonite clay drawing out excess fluid from inflamed tissues and areas, etc. Seriously, this stuff will help keep what breakouts you do get under control better with less inflammation, hyperpigmentation, and scabbing/scarring... AND it will often help prevent breakouts from occurring when built into a regular regimen. 



As for the OCM, I just mix my own oils, a blend of Grapeseed or Avocado as a base/carrier oil (1/2), and then some almond or apricot oil to add some thicker emollient oil (1/3), and then jojoba to fill the rest off to help it mesh well with my own body oil (jojoba oil is extremely similar to sebum produced by human skin, and I even use a mostly jojoba moisturizer after all showers and especially shaves with tea tree oil and cedar essential oil mixed in for antibacterial and scent properties). Seriously, it has changed my skin forever. No more dry flaky skin. I smell good all the time, and my skin has a totally different tone to it after a few months of this regimen. 


Personally, it seems to also help me to stay away from wheat gluten products... Not like gluten free, but any time I start getting carried away and eat processed foods, or gluten heavy meals (even home prepared) to regularly, my skin lets me know I'm on the wrong track along with my gut.   "	25	0

Stop washing often. Stop using harsh soaps. Your face/skin was not ment to be subjected to constant cleaning. You do your skin and your immune system a disservice. Excessive washing forces your face to over  produce oils which leads to arms race between your oil production and your soap. Try this if nothing else works for you... Declare soap bankruptcy. Do not use it on your face. Try washing with only warm water. The chlorine in your water will suffice as a cleaning agent. Obviously use soap on nether regions but only water and hands for face. Allow 1 time 1 day a week of light neutral soap on face. Wash pillow cases often. Try at your own risk.	2	0

I'm not sure if it's whey, but if it is, that indicates that it's the milk protein, not the sugars that causes us to break out.

It took a week long fishing trip and no running water to realize that simply washing my face with water only, no products whatsoever, was all it took to remove my acne.  For over 15 years I'm yet to use any sort of scrub or product on my face other than my hands and water.   My skin is pretty much perfect and has been for years. 	3	0

The ritual that made my skin literally flawless (while I actually followed it) was buying a decent Cleanser + Exfoliant (Separate from the cleanser) + Toner + Moisturizer.

*Cleanser*: Make sure that it doesn't dry out your skin, a lot will. It should be a softer cleanser WITHOUT any exfoliants in it. I used it every morning and night.

*Exfoliant*: I used a walnut extract rub. It wasn't a cream, just a tons of tiny little bead like things in it. It was really expensive for a tiny little bottle so I barely used it and only used it once every 3-7 days (I have sensitive skin and it can really dry out/irritate your skin using exfoliants too frequently) and I used it AFTER I cleansed my face. This helps remove dead skin cells and unclog pores.

*Toner*: This is probably my favorite of all of them. I bought it in a spray bottle as opposed to having to douse cotton swabs with it and then apply it because it was a lot easier and I didn't have to apply as much. The toner will help tighten skin and shrink pore holes as well as return some nutrients to your face that has been taken out by the removal of oils (the cleanser and exfoliant). I used this after EVERY face wash. Just a couple sprays did it.

*Moisturizer*: One of the more important aspects for me, since my face dried out after every time I washed it. It's important to pick one that doesn't make your face too oily (I used a once a day and didn't apply too much). I only used it in the mornings because it would make my face extremely oily over night if I slept after using it, but if your face is extremely dry, it could be useful to use twice.

A trip to Ulta (yes, I'm male) or one of the nicer outlet stores like Macy's (where I got my first stack) can really help. They're always helpful to find the right choice for your face.

But seriously, this ritual made my face look like a model's. My complexion was perfect... Unfortunately I stopped using it because everytime I go back from college to the city (Nacogdoches has literally nothing) I never had time or money to re-up my stack.

Hope this helps someone!"	2	0

However you say that after research, you concluded that different things cause acne in different people, and that everyone would need to perform a similar experiment to yours to resolve their acne.

Well the fact of the matter is, acne is a living organism whose growth is primarily determined by the amount of different hormones.  Moreover,  the hormonal surges that cause acne are heavily influenced by the consumption of sugar (especially high fructose corn syrup), as well as gluten and dairy, and some other things.  Basically, for the most part, high-fructose corn syrup, dairy and gluten are directly responsible for acne *in everyone*.

I still flake and I get very greasy.  I never had luck with various bp, salicylic, sulfers, retin a, finecea, or tea tree. I got them from my derms so I assume I was doing them for reasonable times regardless. Oral dioxy was good, minocyclin, fine, but diet helps a lot. Starting protein shakes as i got into fitness was a real lesson. As for accutane- it would require me to go back on the pill, as would spiro. I would like to conceive soonish, so it's a no for me. Also, it doesn't often work permanently for hormonal type acne in ladies, just fyi. Good for men though. If it works with your life style it's definitely worth a try. I certainly don't mean to discourage talking to a doctor, perhaps I'm coming off that way? But there is research to back up a connection between dairy proteins and acne, and I suspect it has to do with insulin response or hormone content, which are the cause of my problem.  It might help someone out there	6	0

A ton of anecdotal treatments in this thread with little or no real scientific evidence to back them up.  Acne is one of those diseases where there actually is a decent amount of evidenced based treatments.  Instead of going over the standard for acne treatment, let's look a few facts about acne and see it can shape the views in this thread:

1. Acne is a cyclical disease.  It gets better and worse over time for no rhyme or reason.  These cycles can last for weeks to month, often leading people to falsely conclude that whatever they were doing before it got better must have been what they had most recently been doing, which is often incorrect.

2. Acne is a disease of comedones (basically blocked oil glands).  The process of forming a comedone to develop a pimple takes TWO MONTHS.  Our best acne treatments (the retinoind medications) require that long to actually have an impact by stopping the comedones when they start.  Most other medications inhibit inflammation but won't actually remove the primary lesion, which is the comedone.

Once you understand those two points, a lot of the conclusions reached based on anecdotal experience begin to seem a little silly.  

So where are the actual answers and the science?  How about starting with reddit itself!  Inequilibrium has put together a [Redditor's Guide to Acne](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1bs7nv/the_redditors_guide_to_acne_2013/) which is relatively unbiased, informative and understandable.  While mild acne can often be controlled with appropriate over the counter treatment alone, moderate to severe will likely need the assistance of prescription medications.  

Hope that helps!"	217	0

5. SALT THE FIELDS! A tried and tested method of warfare. Don't let their crops flourish. Swim in the ocean and salt their earth. If you don't live near the ocean, you can bathe in epsom salts (though it's not the double whammy that you get from a nice day at the beach)

6. CHEMICAL WEAPONS! This is a dirty tactic, but it works. Salicic acid based cleanser. Put a spot of Benzoyl Peroxide on individual spots afterwards. If you leave this on new spots, they will dry up. Avoid the temptation to rub it everywhere - It works best as a surgical strike.

7. CUT OFF FOREIGN AID! You should not be supplying them with aid or weaponry. This is a no-brainer I guess but many people keep up diplomatic aid, and keep arming these evil little fuckers with lactose (milk/cheese/dairy) and sugar. CUT THEM OFF. Yes you'll need to cut that out of your own diet too for this to be effective.

Godspeed.

**Edit:** To answer the bulk of questions:

Yes this is anecdotal evidence based upon my own experiences of choosing to beat acne through diet, lifestyle,hygiene and fitness. There might be individuals who won't benefit their lives by improving those things, though I've yet to meet them. 

Yes you will indeed learn more about Machiavellian thinking by reading Machiavelli than by reading a post about acne on a fitness forum.

Some rare cases might need to see a dermatologist if all else fails. 

Sometimes you just grow out of it. Acne has affected some of the greatest, most beautiful and most successful people. They've grown stronger from it. Keep your head high. "	2026	0

Did accutane my junior year of high school, and it worked for about 4 years. My 3rd year of college I started breaking out worse than ever. I always thought acne went away when you hit 20+ years old but no luck in my case. I'll skip the parts about the insane social anxiety it caused me. I initially tried a holistic approach to dealing with it. This meant mega dosing vitamin B, D, and zinc and eating strict paleo (gluten and dairy free). This didn't work. Coincidentally my acne only got worse. I tried many different acne products (with different active ingredients; Benzoyl peroxide, Salicylic acid, Alpha hydroxy acids, etc). None worked. Hell, most caused insane irritation and I broke out even worse. 

I had been a long time member of the site acne.org as I tried to cure my condition. Eventually, I decided to give [their products](http://store.acne.org/) (I order off amazon) a go. Combining these products with [the regime](http://www.acne.org/regimen.html) my acne was gone in three weeks. GONE. I've been acne free (aside from a zit every month or so) now for about a year. I have no idea why the acne.org products work (I've used Benzoyl peroxide based products before), but they do."	2	0

Basically, physiologically we know the receptors for growth and inflammation is tightly coupled. Which makes sense because they generally happen when you have food so your body can both purge pathogens and grow. 


Milk happens to be one of the best agents that induce growth because babies need to grow and need a kick start for their immune system. (there is a reason why GOMAD is like roids for beginners). In fact, we know milk is basically the only natural source of trans-fats, the most toxic inflammatory thing we know in our diet. 


Although inflammation is a good thing for babies and cavemen who were often starved and have a chronically under active immune system, When we are often over eating a carb rich diet that is high in omega6, it is basically our biggest health problem. (acne is probably the most benign aspect of inflammation if you think about it. Many people with inflammation might not have acne, but they end up with heart disease, stroke (from the heart disease), or arthritis)"	4	0

""Cocoa and coconut butter are very likely to cause acne. Sesame oil, corn oil, avocado oil and soybean oil all have high levels of risk. Peanut oil and olive oil are mildly risky, while castor and safflower oil have low risk.""

So maybe the problem with peanut butter is that many processed peanut butters include hydrogenated soybean oil in addition to peanut oil?

Some months ago I had folliculitis and acne (not too big amounts though) on my shoulders and upper back. I got kind of sick of it and went to a dermatologist. She prescribed effaclar, which helped but not spectacularly.

So I decided to look at my habits and see if I was doing something wrong. I realised my back and shoulders were pretty dry, due to my washing habits, etc.

Now to get to the question. Is it possible that due to my dry skin, my oil glands became more active, which blocked my pores (or whatever the stuff comes out of) and formed acne and folliculitis?

This is painfully obvious to me, which is exactly why I ignore anyone who says their acne magically cleared up for 3 weeks after using/removing/altering something in their diet/routine. I'm not really sure why people don't understand this. Show me something that makes a marked improvement for 3-6 months. Then I will listen.

&gt;The process of forming a comedone to develop a pimple takes TWO MONTHS.

Exactly why ""my acne flared after I ate/did this"" is bullshit. Again, why don't people understand this?

No, Cetaphil is not made for the scalp. I use Lush's Superbalm for my scalp.

It being natural and organic is a huge plus when it comes to treating any skin conditions, in my opinion, because I've always found this to be the case for me. I moisturize with shea butter after using the black soap. 

Your scalp is a different kind of skin than the rest of your body. What works on the face won't work on the scalp unless it says it will. (There are certain black soaps made by certain companies that come in a bottle instead of a bar, and they work for both head and body. You just have to go out and find them. They should work pretty well. I don't have experience with them, though.) Like I said before, if it's natural and organic, it's good for your skin. Bottled black soap comes with perfume agents moreso than other black soaps. Avoid scented soaps too. The products used to add scent in soaps aggravates sensitive skin."	1	0

Although 1% suffer from direct gluten sensitivy resulting in celiac disease there are a number of us that are gluten sensitive that can result in autoimmune inflammatory conditions (ie acne, rheumatoid arthritis, etc). They may or may not be the cause, but they can definitely make symptoms worse. Gluten in wheat is not the only culprit. Another common proinflammotory protein is lactose in dairy products. My suggestion is to go wheat free for a few weeks (ex. paleo diet) and see how you react. On top of that it's just good for your fitness. Good luck!	2	0

2. Apply benzyl peroxide 2.5% forumla gel (daniel kern is best/cheapest by a mile) right after cleansing before face fully air dries. Never towel dry.
3. Apply jojoba oil as moisturizer if needed, a simple drop should be enough if your face is still wet from the bp gel (NOW brand, cheap and light). forget every other moisturizer that has more than 1 ingredient.
4. Now you just have to watch out for some bad habits. Never let anything touch your face (scratching, caressing, dandruff, face mask, pillow) unless you're going to wash and treat it within the hour. If you ever noticed an oily face when you wake up, try to prevent it by sleeping less hours. Never skip these rules or you will pay. 

I rarely skip these rules and I only pay when I skip them. Like wearing a breathing mask at work that is touching my face, thus pushing dead skin cells into pores, and I'm obviously unable to do the full wash and treatment at work so I only wear the mask when it's most required and never re-use them. Also when I wake up after sleeping 8 hours and don't wash my face because I have the bad habit of going straight to the computer and forgetting. Never for any other reason will I get acne. It's all about controlling oil and dirt build up on your face.

I think this is a problem with medicine as a business not modern medicine in general. Diet often gets overshadowed as a cause or catalyst for creating a situation for acne to thrive. I try to spread the good word, but most people think they can take the easy route and take a magic pill without changing their diet. That guide is really good, I just wish more emphasis was placed on diet in real life treatment like it is in section 4.	2	0

For many people, gluten (and similar proteins in other grains) promote an inflammatory response not just in the gut but all over.

I just it in the shower every morning. 

After you've washed with warm water, splash your face with cold water, leave wet, then apply a good moisturizer. I use Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion.

If you want to knock out zits, try tea tree oil (diluted in a bit of water if you like). I will sometimes add a little bit of tea tree oil to my moisturizer (once a week at most), but I don't have any real issues with my skit/zits anymore so it's usually not needed, but I always have some around.

Using a facial scrub at least twice a week is good too, once you have things under more control. This will lift all the dead skin away and allow your skin to breath a little better.

Side note: I've also found that eating carrots can work wonders for some people, and obviously drink a lot of water."	1	0

It may seem counter-intuitive, but eat plenty of essential fats, fish oil or flax seed oil.  The problem being that he sebum your body produces when these essential fat isn't present clogs your pores.  You may find oilier skin but it won't clog your pores.  Removing sugar and grain also helps many.  The biggest thing though, is honey.  Specifically Raw Honey and more specifically Manuka Honey with 16+ active or more rating.  It's a miracle.  I use it daily, it's expensive but if someone had told me about it when i was a teenager I would've been so much happier.  Put it on your face for ten mintues a day (mix a little in your hand with water) and EAT A TABLESPOON OF IT EVERY DAY.  Not only will it kill the bacterial internally and externally it boosts your immune system greatly. Also it won't kill your positive gut flora like a round of antibiotics would.   Remember the bee colony collapse thing?  They died because the farmers were told it was safe to remove their honey and give them corn syrup instead.  Their immune systems couldn't fight off the chemicals that were introduced to them through pesticides.  Science!  There are more reasons why honey is wonderful for you, (oh yeah, i haven't been sick in over two years, while before I was sick every year at least twice) but as far as acne, get it, try it, take it for a week and put it on your face for ten minutes every morning.  There was a post on here not long ago about a kid who did just that, cleared his cystic acne up pronto.  Link to imgur is here: http://imgur.com/YeIVX  .  It's worth a shot, if it doesn't work it doesn't work, but I can almost guarantee it'll work.

TLDR: Raw Manuka Honey or just raw honey if you can't get your hands on anything else.

edit: Please don't take accutane, it may save embrassment, but it's so bad, look at studies about depression later in life.  You don't want chronic depression.  Source:  My mom was one in a trial for accutane in her twenties and my brother took it.  So glad I did not."	2	0

Raw honey seems to work well for me. I lather that on and let it sit for 20 min. Then rinse it off with hot water and pat with a warm towel. I then put on some Eucerin Everyday Protection face lotion. Using a dry sauna seems to help too. I have had really bad acne for most of my adult life and have even been on all sorts of meds from the dermatologist. The method I am on now is cheaper and works just as well if not better. Also, all the info from the OP is crucial. Also to add onto the list washing your hair daily is key as well.	6	0

At the moment my acne is on the mild side, and the majority of the acne I seem to get is blackheads and these small white lumps that you can barely see under the skin, when squeezed comes out as either a hard lump or this stringy shit. I especially get it the side of my chin/mouth. Any ideas what this is, and what could be good to treat it?

I've tried a LOT of things in the past, including BP which I've recently just got back on with the Acne.org regime. But with pretty much everything I've tried, I see good results in the first few weeks or so of using something, then after that the effectiveness seems to wear off. I've tried so many cleansers, moisturizers, BP, zineryt, bio oil, different soaps, tried cutting certain things out of my diet; I've not had any dairy for months...

Hijacking this top comment to inform everyone why and how this worked for the OP.

1.  Cutting out whey shakes.  Whey is rich in leucine.  Leucine is the primary driver of mTORC1 activity, which is the process responsible for protein synthesis.  Unfortunately, unchecked mTORC1 at the skin level, which is androgen sensitive in acne patients, induces the clumping of dead skin cells at the stratum corneum and the increased lipogenesis in sebaceous glands that is necessary for comedone and acne lesion formation.  Combining these factors with increased androgenesis due to high intensity exercise makes acne-prone skin highly likely to break out.
2.  High fructose corn syrup.  Still iffy on this one.  Not speculating until sure.  What is known is that insulin sensitivity decreases when consuming HFCS, which further contributes to mTORC1 activation.
3.  The week where he ate out.  Hypercaloric states, which are easy to reach when eating out, invoke over-activation of mTORC1 by increasing circulating insulin and leucine.  There are many other factors, including oxidative stress through malliard reactant products, but it gets too complicated to illustrate quickly.  High-caloric meals that are rich in saturated fats, malliard reactant products and protein promote acnegensis.

Check the graphic below for more information on mTORC1 and acne.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408989/figure/F2/

Confounding factors that make this entire thing hard to pinpoint:

 *  No real dietary journal from OP.
 *  No real reference point for acne states before, during or after.  I.E. OP's definition of clear may differ from those of others or the full, medical description of acne-free skin.
 *  No information as to OP's insulin sensitivity, such as his weight, height, exact age, body fat, fitness level etc.

I went to a dermatologist for years and years trying every possible option (not to mention the obvious diet, exercise, sun, salt etc. listed u/bitcloud) however nothing worked.  The anxieties this put on me in my youth were unbearable.  Everytime I left the dermatologist with a new cream/pill/method I was on top of the world because I had a glimmer of hope that this would finally end...however time and time again I was left disappointed.  Finally I made my way to Accutane.  The number of products and medications I tried before Accutane really goes to show you that it is truly the nuclear option.  All that said, if you go for regular blood work and checkups you can minimize side effects.  For me aside from severely dry skin (I went through probably 100 tubes of chap stick in the 6 months or so I was on it) I didn't notice many side effects. Ultimately, it worked so well that I was really frustrated I hadn't used it earlier.  That was probably 7 or 8 years ago and I've been zit free ever since! 	20	0

* Drink up, get some clean water, it help with digestion. Your body is tripping with inflammatory drama. Don't fill it with Chlorine. 
* Find a way to repopulate your gut flora. Theses are your army. They clean up the mess and fight the good fight. 
* If you've got bigass red ones its, cut things that fucks up your liver. After dairy and sugar cut LEGUMES they are evil to some of us. Peanuts are legumes. Cut that too right away see what happens.
* If you've got tiny, plenty little one, its Acidity. Get more greens, get herbal tea, cut floors, cut wheat all together. [watch ingredient lists](http://www.billschoolcraft.com/ph/), acidic food will get it worst. 
* Get some god damn decent soap. Y'all need to stay hydrated. Dry skins creates crevasses and them bastard entrenches themselves there. I'm talking coconut oil handmade soap for your face here.
* Try out something like Paleo, but not 100% theses guys are insane (sorry paleos guys) Some carbs will help you through all the sports you need to do to get cleared up and keep your brain active. What they go right is all that good fat. loads of them. you will be more energetic and have clear hydrated skin. 

If you are over your teens years and still have way too much acne and more than anyone around. You most likely have some chronic condition you should be aware of. IBS, Candida overgrowth, Crohn's disease, Some allergies you are not aware off. Some things triggers your inflammatory response and you need to start researching for what it is. Then you can start balancing your life to have life you like with the amount of acne you can tolerate.

If you're already observing the above mentioned items from user bitcloud's reply, then the ultimate thing that I have shared with numerous people in life and found consistently working is what helped me get through this.

In 2005, I met with a nutritionist and they figured out that I was not eating enough protein or acquiring enough omega-3 in my daily regimen. The nutritionist professionally recommended Nordic Natural's Ultimate Omega lemon flavored pills found here specifically for their safety and consistency:
http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/156/?ProdID=1428
and pointed me to online protein calculators to figure out as well.

Fast forward two weeks after that and all acne was healing, no new out breaks, and I was loosing fat weight as well faster than I had ever before in my life. A month later my skin was clear. In the past 7 years since that one week I started taking the nordic natural supplements, I have only broken out when I stopped taking the omega pills. Worth every damn nickel.

I have shared this awesome biochemistry knowledge with at least eight people and all of them have healed and acne free since. All of them. I shit you not. Science for the win!

The thing is, I see people with acne all the time, and I hear tons of stories and things they have tried.  Because believe me, people will try anything before they actually come see a doctor.

1. They don't have to be so rude. 
2. It doesn't work for everyone.
3. Changing your diet is much less invasive than taking antibiotics or steroids.
4. If your body is having a negative reaction to the food you eat, which is better? A. Masking it by treating the symptom but allowing the cause to remain or B. Treating the cause and eliminating the symptom.

People get prescribed steroids and antibiotics for skin conditions all the time when it is often an issue with diet. True other factors such as hygiene definitely come into play but people should be more concerned with the cause of the issue not just the symptom (not just acne here guys, im talking skin conditions). The prescriptions are expensive, the doctors visits are expensive and the solutions are often not good for your body in the long run.

I've known four people who used Accutane (all of them girls) and from the four of them I've seen a lot more side effects than ""very rare"" implies.  One of them developed joint pain and tendonitis in her wrists during the treatment which has remained to this day (7 years later).  Her lips were so dry during treatment that she had to carry around lip balm and basically apply it continuously throughout the day.  Sun-sensitivity and dry skin were very prevalent in all of them.  Apparently ""excessive hairiness"" was actually a thing for one of them, but I only found that out through a third party because that's not the sort of thing girls generally talk about.  Depression is more common than you seem to believe.  You might say sure, all teenagers are depressed at some point, but in two cases I saw two generally upbeat, outgoing girls become progressively quieter and more withdrawn over the course of a few months at most.  Doesn't seem to be on the official side effect list because pregnancy is strongly discouraged, but birth defects are such a massive concern that they also strongly urge if not require teenage girls go on birth control even if they claim to be sexually inactive just in case.

Obviously you won't get all of these side effects, the point is they're all possible, and the fact is that Accutane was originally developed as a chemotherapy drug to treat cancer when the scientists involved discovered that one of its many side effects was to greatly reduce the production of sebum, and thus the most effective acne treatment was born.  But all the same, you can't discount the sheer amount of dangerous potential side effects that come along with it.

All four of those girls say they would do it again, and most people I've heard from say the same thing.  But that doesn't make the side effects any less crazy."	1	0

Thats part of the problem. There is a huge waiting period for most people to see this kind of specialist. Then when they get time with one, the doctor doesnt spend any time with them. Goes with what worked for someone else (prescription). Then if it doesnt work, you have to go back. More money spent. And the doctor will prescribe something else that worked for someone before you. This isnt absolutely what will happen but its what happens most commonly.

Sometimes treating acne with prescriptions works at removing the acne. Sometimes it doesnt. I have friends who have had seen so many dermatologists and tried so many different things. Then fixed it with diet. Thats all I'm saying. "	-7	0

I threw a lot of products at my face for years that dried my skin, didn't help my acne and my oil grands would produce even more oil to compensate. Terrible. I use Jojoba oil from Trader Joe's. In the shower, quarter size amount, and message it all up in my face for a health minute. Feels good. It won't work overnight but eventually it did- for me. Also: I had moderate/server acne. I have no insurance but I go to the dermatologist once a year to refill my Retin-A which cost me about $140 all together. Way cheaper than buying every imaginable acne product-cure. These  two things did it for me. I even get compliments on my skin- from strangers. I shit you not. Sometimes I don't even wash my pillow cases for a few weeks and still don't breakout!

Read [this dermatologist's advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1odvrk/lets_talk_about_acne_and_how_i_alleviated_it/ccr9xks). He/She is right, there are a lot of anecdotal stories and advice, sometimes more aggressive treatment is needed. From what I've learnt in nursing school, is that hormones, especially higher androgens, tend to aggravate acne. 

[Pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001876/) suggests that yes cleaning your skin helps, but also contributes hormonal changes.

Obermok &amp; Shalita also state that it is due to physiological factor such as excess keratin growth, excess sebum perpetuated by androgens, inflammation of the dermis, and proliferation of cutaneous flora.

I can keep researching, or you can do a bit of reading and look it up yourself.

Edit: Here's a quantitative study looking at whether exercise causes acne, it was found there was no difference in this single blind study. Oberemok, S. S., &amp; Shalita, A. R. (2002). Acne vulgaris, I: Pathogenesis and diagnosis. Cutis, 70(2), 101-5. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/202891441?accountid=26528

I'm anal and I tend to research almost anything, it's too a fault. I'm supposed to be writing pregnancy induced hypertension but instead I'm researching acne for reddit....

Edit II: This research showed that exercise actually increases androgen production (not really a surprise, but is beneficial for aging men especially). This information is great if you're low in androgens, but the problem is that those with acne vulgaris have their conditions aggravated by excess androgens.

Western medicine is not preventative, and that's a little sad. I've never been to the doctor and had him prescribe me with a better diet (never even been asked about diet), more physical activity, earlier sleep, earlier rise,  lowering stress levels, but they're the foundations of good health. 

Yes, in some circumstances, genetically perfect, young, disease free  individuals might need medication, but those cases are extraordinarily rare. Most of the time I would say a decent doctor or an intrepid patient could trace the issue back to circumstantial causes like diet, sleep and physical activity. "	1	0

Thankfully, I got through it, and now I'm happier than ever. I lied to my doctor about these effects though as I couldn't go back to acne. 

I'm a rare case though, probably one in a million. Doc also told me I was handling the drug well, body wise (clean bloodwork and what not). Regardless, the emotional pain was well worth it. 

edit: I changed from being extremely optimistic, too an annoying extent, to a balanced level. I also just perceive life differently, can't really describe it. I'm different, I know that for sure, and I can never return to who I am."	1	0

In HS while I was on Accutane I played football.  During the summer time my team would meet at 6 pm to work out and then at 7 we would condition.  The conditioning varied but a few times each summer we would run ""The Beast"" which was basically a mile jog to the park followed by numerous sprints up an incredibly steep hill through the woods to the water tower and back down until our coach decided it was enough.  Our coach was a bit psycho so this usually lasted a long time and it was these days that we dreaded, although it day pay off with a state championship.

Anyways, one summer morning my mother and her friend wanted to go to the beach so both I and her friend's son went with.   This was rare because I thoroughly dislike baking in the sun on the beach.  Being the naive child I was, I made a similar conclusion to you ""fuckit"" and didn't put on any sunblock forgetting about the Accutane.  Needless to say I was burnt to a crisp.

Fastforward to 6 pm, we're back from the beach and I go to football.  I am so burnt at this point that I was very nauseous but all I cared about was football so I went anyways.  Get to the gym, the workout on the board is by far the hardest leg workout we had done all summer (leg press burnouts with our coach in our ear).  The skin on my body was so burnt that I couldn't sweat.  From lifting alone I had blisters of sweat all over my body that just couldn't escape the now dead skin (gross I know).  And of course...with my luck...7 pm rolls around and our coach announces we will be running ""The Beast"" today.  As if I'm not already suffering enough....but it gets worse...

Fast forward the mile jog and a few reps up to the water tower.  I'm so exhausted and nauseous from the sun burn and lift that I am already bent over throwing up.  Push myself through a couple more reps and finally our coach gives us a breather.  The entire team is at the bottom of the hill keeled over sucking wind, myself included.  All of a sudden I feel a very sharp pain on the side of my ankle, then another, then another.  My foot was on top of and squishing a wasps nest hidden under the leaves and before I can even realize what was going on I am SWARMED by wasps.  I couldn't count or know for sure but I had to have gotten stung atleast 15-20 times.  My teammates see what's going on and so a whole slew of them rip off their shirts and start whipping my body to get the wasps off.  I had to strip down to my boxers because they began to get inside my clothing.  

So yea, I did experience the sensitivity to sunlight side effect as well lol.  As I stood in the woods burnt to a crisp covered in sweat blisters, exhausted to nausea, receiving 20 or so wasp stings, and being whipped by my teammates sweaty tshirts...well I didn't make the connection to the Accutane at the time ha but it for sure played a part.  I spent the rest of that day on a recliner on the back deck not moving.  My grandmother told me meat tenderizer helps with the stings so I covered all the stings with that and the rest of me I covered in vitamin E I believe?  I'm not positive but yes...many sleepless nights followed and sensitivity to sunlight is for sure a side effect."	42	0

That accutane is linked to damage to your liver, dry skin and in very rare cases they see depression in people who are already prone. Also, I wouldn't say constantly. They do bloodwork once to check on my liver and from there I don't need any other tests. The only reason why they do it is to check that my  liver can hold up.

also i am talking about more than just acne here. eczema and rosacea are often caused by dietary sensitivities as well. 

just because you eat dairy and dont have acne doesnt mean that dairy doesnt cause acne. as I have said countless times today defending my stance on addressing diet before medicating there is a different solution for everyone. diet changes wont work for everyone especially those with severe acne. I drink milk, eat yogurt, cheese and butter meanwhile downing two scoops of whey every day. but dairy doesnt affect me the way it does for some people. so many people dont know that their conditions are caused by diet, and I see my friends and family struggling with issues, getting frustrated with medications that dont work, become determined to solve it with diet, and poof its fixed.

Lay down a fresh towel on your pillow every night before you go to bed (or if you don't have a shit ton of towels, an old t-shirt or something will work fine).

Also, you may be over washing your face.  If your face is always really dry it'll worsen the acne.  You need to find that balance between having a really dirty, greasy face and having a dry, cracked face.  If this is the case for you, I recommend NOT washing your face daily with Salicic acid or Benzoyl peroxide.  Try and find a face wash that doesn't have too many chemicals as they will dry your face out.  Use a Benzoyl Peroxide-based spot treatment sparingly once every other day or so.

Oh, and possibly the biggest thing for me is resisting the urge to touch, pop, and pick at my face throughout the day.  Leave it alone.  Also be as gentle as possible when you're washing your face."	1	0

It's broken in a lot of ways. One of them is clearly documented. It's not a conspiracy. Doctors I know have expressed to me their frustration with their schooling and the process they are forced into from the hospitals/clinics they work for. They are only allowed a short amount of time with each patient. They are encouraged to use prescriptions. They get perks for using certain meds. They make more money for prescribing certain meds. They are taught in school to sell prescriptions. 

These are doctors that were trained at OHSU which is a fairly prestigious medical school on the west coast. 

My experience defines me. A dermatologist is an individual and their experience defines them. Each one is different. My experience with dermatologists has been bad. My experience tells me that most medical professionals resort to what works most commonly, or what works best for most people. From my experience they dont tend to take enough time to find a solution for their patient as much as they should. "	0	0

It might have cyclical patterns, but there absolutely are plenty of things that make it better or worse in an immediate way, ""with rhyme and reason."" If I skip my face regimen even once, my acne gets worse. Without fail. Every time. The very fact that topical treatment can affect the severity of acne to any noticeable degree blows a hole right through your first premise.

&gt;Acne is a disease of comedones (basically blocked oil glands). The process of forming a comedone to develop a pimple takes TWO MONTHS.

Clearly, then, because direct therapy does affect the issue, the comedone formation process is not the only factor involved with the appearance of acne.

Sure these things will help to combat existing acne but until the origin of the problem is corrected and the hormones become balanced it will continue to be a persistent issue.	1	0

Your body has hormonal cycles, chemical symbiosis. Certain foods contain chemicals proteins, vitamins and minerals that act in unison. Complex reactions occur and are utilised in different ways at different times of the day, depending upon your differing schedules, sleep cycles stress levels and activities. 

More importantly than that is the fact that not everything we eat is actually food. Preservatives, and other inorganic compounds are indigestible at best, and fit and block receptors at worst. They often accumulate and create problems.

Let me give you an example. We know the human body utilises millions of proteins. We have labeled some of them. 

Recently we imaged one (1).

Diet is at the root of your health. You may be a rare case wherein genetics has failed you, but more often than not you won't be. Believe me. Don't. Makes no difference to me.

But it does conclusively:
-Cause skin cancer
-Cause wrinkles

1. Avoid going in the sun when unnecessary, especially in the middle of the day 

2. Wear sunscreen (the SPF really doesn't matter than much, 15 is totally fine) every day that you step outside of the house. Even in winter is a good idea (unless it's cold enough that you cover up your face). 

3. Wear a hat (the big floppy ones are better, but any shade = good) and sunglasses

4. UV-A radiation passes through clouds pretty easily and DOESN'T CAUSE SUNBURNS OR TANS BUT WILL STILL CAUSE WRINKLES AND SKIN CANCER. UVB also causes wrinkles &amp; skin cancer but at least it's blocked by clouds and causes sunburns and tans so you know you're getting damaged. 


If you want to stay looking young without surgical scars on your skin, do these things. And don't use sunlight to treat acne, it doesn't help. "	1	0

It did, I'm handsome, and I get compliments on my skin (despite doing absolutely nothing different vis a vis facial care). 

All I'm saying I guess is that if you can find that switch in your head that helps you stop worrying about it so much, you may find that before you know it your face has cleared up.

Anyway, to answer your question... no, I don't need a direct study before I go outside. 

However, I would need a direct study that finds a difference before I believe that vitamin D helps acne... 

And I certainly would want that study before I recommend either vitamin D or sunlight as a treatment (which you did, despite apparently not having evidence for it).

Even the Vitamin D council (which exists solely to promote Vitamin D use) reports that there is no known link. 

Quotes from their website: 
""Vitamin D does not appear to affect the risk or expression of acne.""
""There is little evidence that vitamin D reduces the risk of developing acne.""


If you're worried about vitamin D deficiency (for other reasons than acne) then change your diet or take a supplement... sunlight isn't the only way to get it, anyway.

The main allergens that lead to gut inflamation are: sugar, alcohol, corn, dairy, and gluten. You need to cut those out completely for 12 weeks (how long it takes the body to heal a damaged gut) and then you'll see results, provided that diet was a large part of why you're breaking out, it obviously factors in less or more in different people. Further, to support your bodys ability to handle toxicity, eat more fiber (50g+ daily) drink more water (like close to a gallon a day) and get more antioxidants from your diet (greens/fruits).

If doing that + all of the above commenters tips won't work, I personally would get a GI pathogen screen done to see if there's any bacterial/yeast overgrowth in your colon, parasites could definitly be a reason for chronic inflamation, which can lead to many skin conditions including but not limited to acne.

You should also consider supplementation, especially fiber (psyllium husks, cheap as hell stir into your water twice a day and you're golden), a multivitamin is always good to make sure your cell function is closer to optimal, and lastly look for a quality probiotic to assist in populating your gut with microbials that help you break down and absorb nutrients (one with live cultures, with multiple different strains). If you want to take it one step further, get water kefir grains and culture your own probiotic, guaranteed magnitudes more potent (not to mention cheaper) than any pharma grade probiotic pills.

Finally, here are a couple of useful resources:

http://www.acneeinstein.com/dont-know-how-to-get-over-acne-let-me-help/

http://www.acneeinstein.com/acne-antibiotics-short-term-gain-with-long-term-harm/

One last thing, all of the things I just listed have I specifically mentioned because they've worked for me, it's not something I've merely read about (although I've done a shitton of that as well), I've actually experienced my gut go from unhealthy to healthy, increasing my bowel movements from once every 2-3 days to 1-3 times per day, and I've experienced my skin go from breaking out with cystic acne, to having as clear of a face as I had when I went on antibiotics prescribed by my dermatologist (which surprise surprise did jack shit for me long-term, acne came back within 3 months of ending the cycle being even worse than before I did the ""treatment"", which incidentally is just how long it takes for the antibiotics to leave the system).

Also, try to not let the acne stress you out *too* much, I empathise with you and believe me I know how hard it sucks, but try to learn to put it in perspective every now and again and realize that it's not forever, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the entirety of your life."	0	0

I started getting bad nodular acne when I was about 13. After trying some over-the-counter products with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide and getting no results, my general practitioner referred me to a dermatologist. In the ensuing 6 years, I tried over 30 different prescription medications or treatments, some of which were in combination with each other. I had topical and oral retinoids (examples are Retin-A and Accutane, respectively), topical and oral antibiotics (examples are Benzaclin and Minocycline, respectively), and a few different topical and oral Sulfa drugs. (I've forgotten their names) I tried treatments from a product called ClearLight, which operates on the same principle as those antiseptic lights they use to sterilize barber implements in old barbershops. I tried more than one kind of laser treatment; those hurt and left scarring, fyi. I never could do the birth control thing, because I have the wrong plumbing downstairs.

The Acutane I'll speak to specifically, because everybody's talking about it. I know quite a few people who tried it and had everything go well, so, if your doctor thinks it's a good idea, give it a shot. That said, I turned out to be allergic to it. When you first go on it, you're supposed to have an initial ""flare-up"" period where it gets incrementally worse. I had a pretty bad ""flare-up."" My cheeks swelled solid, so my Dermatologist cut my dosage by 75%. My face continued to be more swollen and painful. After about a month with no change or reduction, she admitted it might not be a flare-up, and she put me on prednisone, a steroidal anti-inflammatory. My acne was completely gone after 36 hours on prednisone. Prednisone should not be used for long periods of time, and she kept me on it for roughly double the recommended guideline duration. It profoundly affected my ability to concentrate and control my attention. I was frenetic. The success of a steroidal general anti-inflammatory should've clued my doctor in to what was going on, but, to be fair, she wasn't a rheumatologist. 

Now, arguably, Acutane was probably a bad move in general for me personally. My whole family on both sides has issues with mental health, with depression being a particular theme. Moreover, my mom has Crohn's disease, which you may know from some of these other comments has been tenuously linked to Acutane use. The best research at the moment indicates that Crohn's disease can only arise from a combination of factors, both genetic and environmental, so, if you don't have anyone in your family with immune problems or IBS problems, it probably won't be a problem.

I'm now 26, and I still have acne on my face, shoulders, chest, and sometimes on my rear. It's nothing nearly as bad as when I had adolescent hormones raging around egging things on, but it's still very definitely there. I also have some Crohn's symptoms. Over the last couple years, testing has revealed that I have some kind of systemic autoimmune inflammatory condition, a state of affairs consistent with with a family history with Crohn's, but I'm still in the diagnostic process. To quote my rheumatologist, my immune system ""is what we doctors call 'pretty fucked up.'"" Apparently any systemic meds they give me that chill out the bowel problems will make the skin worse, and vice versa.

So, TL;DR: Read [the whole wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_vulgaris) on acne, and the whole page on any medication you're thinking about. Listen to your doctors, and find the best ones you can.

Backstory: I've suffered from cystic acne for about the past 4 years, and no treatments have worked on me. I even did a cycle of oral antibiotics as well as many attempts with prescription grade topical creams, which did clear my face--as well as make it extremely dry and flaky, which persists to this day--for about 2-3 months, which is how long it takes for the antibiotics to leave your body after you complete a course.

Lo and behold, the acne came back with a vengeance, this time along with dark circles underneath my eyes and a butterfly rash as well as various other flaky rashes on my face. The antibiotics decimated the flora in my gut allowing parasitic bacteria/yeasts to overgrow, which lead to an array of new problems including abdominal bloating after eating certain foods.

After some (a whole fucking lot) of research, I decided to experiment with diet (which my dermatologist had so adamantly advised me against). I eliminated the most common food allergens from my diet for about 3 weeks (sugar, alcohol, gluten, lactose, corn) and watched my bowel movements increase from once every 1-3 days, to 1-3 times every single day. I also noticed an absence of diahrrea/constipation, and my shit smelled not nearly as rancid as it did before, it actually became close to odorless which was completely new to me.

So I stayed away from those foods and have been doing so since about may, and guess what, the cystic acne slowly disappeared (I'm not even using a cleanser as of now, just regular soap once a day), and the few pimples that I get are scarce and much more manageable than before, and as long as I get enough fiber I've found that eating gluten/dairy/alcohol are completely managable for me as long as I limit them.

The people in this thread who adamantly deny that nutrition can have an effect on your skin, or that the health of your gut can at all affect a condition such as acne, pisses me the fuck off. Not because I have any personal stake in the matter, but because they're misleading thousands of acne sufferers from what could potentially be a simple and long term solution, and instead pointing them toward antibiotic presciptions which almost never work long-term, and will just leave them with an even weaker gut and worse acne when it eventually recurs. If anyone here with acne who has tried the conventional means to no avail wants a more detailed version of how I healed my GI tract and thus decreased internal inflamation, you can PM me and I'll link you to some resources."	-1	0

Read the book ""The Clear Skin Diet"", author has been published multiple times in leading dermatology journals. In the book he details how and why acne forms, why acne-rates have risen so dramatically during the last half a century, and one of the most comprehensive guides to curing acne through diet, supplementation, and lifestyle alone. Although, of course, you really don't have to read the entire book as it's quite difficult to get through for the layman, and most of the vital information can be found on the internet if you're so inclined.

I've personally suffered from cystic acne for about 5 years, and having tried just about every topical cream there is as well as multiple cycles of antibiotics, the one thing that finally got me clear was going on a--temporary--very restrictive diet, after which I've been able to slowly reintroduce the offending foods and gauge how much of them I can tolerate. I've been completely clear for 4 months now, I don't even use a cleanser anymore, just regular soap.

*Disclaimer:* I have absolutely no stake in this, I'm just appalled by the blatant misinformation in this thread regarding both the link between nutrition and skin health, and the true rate of ""success"" of antibiotics. If you want a more detailed version of the diet and lifestyle fixes that finally gave me healthy skin, or perhaps want some resources to study for yourself, feel free to PM me and I'll answer as best I can in the morning.

I used to see a dermatologist for a couple of years after obviously going to the doctor many many times and trying everything they had to offer.nothing worked. In the past couple of years I have realised that changes in lifestyle work a hell of a lot better. (For me at least) I work out, I cleanse and moisturise with oil-free moisturiser and most importantly I eat well. I do NOT notice changes from day to day or week to week depending on what I've eaten but I cut down on milk over a year ago and eat mainly grains and vegetables and my skin is much much better. I really believe that over-medication is a real thing, and a dangerous thing. So if diet and lifestyle work for you, go for it.but I also know how frustrating it can be and how upsetting it can be dealing with acne, so you should try every option there is! Including diet AND medicines and acids and chemicals and whatever else.	1	0

It differs from person to person.  For me it was a major contributor to my acne.  The choice between being more physically fit or suffering from acne was not a choice I made lightly, and it was one I am still very bitter about having to make.

Before I realized how much of a problem it was causing, I worked out and ran regularly.  It was only when I got fed up with my skin breaking out and started to approach it scientifically that I realized it was a major cause.  I followed the same routine every day for a week to see how my skin responded, and change 1 thing every week.  When I stopped working out, my skin stopped being incredibly greasy and irritated all the time, and it reduced the amount of cystic acne I got to almost 0.

I've been on antibiotics since '08 which have more or less completely eliminated the acne.  I have been running/lifting regularly since then.  

Occasionally I'll develop a resistance to my current med and have to switch to something else.  I'm currently doing this.

It's easy to say ""I wouldn't avoid sweating,"" but the psychological effects of being ashamed of my appearance (especially now that I'm 30) and having painful, irritated, greasy skin were significant compared to the 0 side effects I had from avoiding strenuous exercise.  I still walked a lot, used the stairs etc. - I just avoided strenuous exercise that would cause me to sweat.  My doctor said I was perfectly healthy.

Also, salicylic acid was one of the things that noticeably improved my complexion, but I had to be careful about how much I used and where I used it, because it could dry out my skin and make my condition worse.  If I used it on my beard area, the dryness would lead to ingrown hairs.

I'm sure following this advice would help some people, but it would actually cause my (and presumably other peoples') acne go from mild to moderate/severe.  

The best recommendation you can make is to find a GOOD dermatologist, if that's possible.  I've found that most aren't really interested in what you have to say and just want to go down the standard list of acne meds until something works."	1	0

One is that medicine evolves excruciatingly slowly; for example, 30 years ago people would've called you crazy if you proposed that diet had anything to do with heart disease. In fact, it wasn't until very recently (last 15-20 years) that doctors began prescribing dietary and lifestyle changes for heart patients.

Another is that there's a lot of monetary interest in maintaining status-quo regarding acne medicine, it has grown into a multi billion dollar industry, which has more than enough monetary power to finance studies that end up supporting current practices. One example is that most historical studies ""disproving"" the link between diet and skin health were far too short-term to show any significant results. It takes the gut at least 12 weeks to heal while not exposing it to food allergens, whereas the money-studies--the ones that have had any chance of affecting practice--have all been between 1-4 weeks long, and usually not including nearly enough restricted food sources to be taken seriously.

Acne is a condition caused by oxidation of sebum in the skin, which sure you can chalk that up to hormonal imbalances since our sex hormones certainly do increase sebum production. However, all the excess sebum in the world isn't going to give you cystic acne if there's no inflammation in your body to cause it to oxidize. The western diet provides plenty of reason for our bodies to react with an inflammatory response."	0	0

I noticed the more I cleaned my face and the more I used the Acne medicine the more it stayed the same. I decided to just stop messing with my face and over the course of a year it all cleared up. 

Now I suppose one thing should be mentioned, acne is not the same as regular pimples. Acne is an acute infection while things like white heads and black heads are clogged pores. They could be infections also but I am not sure. Acne really hurts, pimples don't hurt as much. 

I also noticed that the sun and ocean helped on my body. All doctors seem to believe the sun makes acne worse but I have always experienced improvement with the sun/UV.

Acne is caused when excess sebum production (usually hormone-related) clogs the opening to the oil glands opening onto the hair follicles in your skin both with gunked-up oil and shed lining cells from the ducts themselves. (This process is known as comedogenesis.) 

The backlog of cells and sebum then gets infected by bacteria from the environment, causing inflamation, swelling and pus. 

As such:

* Sweat does nothing. It's the oil glands that are the problem, not the sweat glands. You can sweat buckets, and all you'll do is slightly irritate your skin. 

* Enough UV to kill skin bacteria is going to cause a whole lot of skin damage and premature aging. Less than that is going to do fuck-all. Also, benzoyl peroxide causes UV sensitivity, so you really want to be getting *less* sun, not more. 

* Clean clothes: Never a bad idea, but 'natural detergent' isn't going to change a damn thing. Clean pillow-cases is also good in general, but srsly, trying to keep bacteria away from your face is like trying to stay dry in the rain. You only need *one* bacterium to start a colony, after all. Keeping hands and used cloth away from your face might help mitigate the spread a little, but it won't clear it up. 

* Salt water can strip the oil out of your skin a bit, but again it's not the oil on the surface that's the problem, and overdrying your skin will lead to drying and cracking, which presents a lot more access for bacteria. Normal hygiene - regular face-washing, without harsh drying which will only further stimulate the oil glands - really is the best approach here. 

* Salicylic acid-based cleansers: Yes. These actually help to break down the plugs of dead cells clogging the ducts, and is mildly bactericidal too. 

* Benzoyl peroxide cream: Yes. This is the first thing you should reach for. It is anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and most importantly, anti-comedogenic. It actually helps prevent your oil glands from plugging up in the first place. 

* Lactose is not comedogenic. It doesn't increase oil production, it doesn't promote overproduction of epithelial cells in the oil glands, and it doesn't promote the growth of *Propionibacterium Acnes*. Cutting the stuff out of your diet will not reduce acne, but eliminating dairy can significantly impact your daily calcium intake, which is a shitty idea, especially for adolescents who need calcium by the truckload. Junk science is *dangerous*, people. 

Other actually useful treatments include oral contraceptives (for women), which regulate the hormone levels that drive the excess sebum proctuction in the first place, and in severe cases, retinoids (however these *absolutely* cause birth defects, and *must* be combined with oral contraceptives in women)"	17	0

The acne.org regimen is basically just: every morning and every night, wash face, apply a bunch of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel, apply moisturizer.

Talk to a dermatologist about a prescription for amoxycilin.. I know that sounds weird,  but it really really helps the sensitivity of your skin. Keep your skin incredibly clean (do NOT touch it unless your hands are oil and dirt free), drink plenty of water,  get some sun, and take amoxycilin. You will still have breakouts, but at a very reduced rate and intensity.    	1	0

If you're like I was you have stubborn, severe cystic acne. It sucks big time, it hurts and it's ugly and it will scar you badly if you leave it untreated!

That's the bad news! The good news is that you have a lot of medical options. A GP will usually start you out on a course of antibiotics. This sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.

Assuming the latter, don't despair,  there is also stuff called isotretinoin (roaccutane/accutane). There is a lot of bullshit surrounding this drug, namely strong links are suggested between depression and the medication. This is all demonstrable nonsense.

In a course if about six months, it will completely clear you up, and chances are it will never come back. Changed my life completely.

There are some side effects that all relate to the drying if your skin, lip balm and sum cream become your best friend. But trust me, it's a small price to pay for the results.

Further,  I should also mention that good hygiene will also definitely not help, and that there is very little evidence to suggest a link between diet and sebum (pore oil) secretion, so be wary of that advice."	1	0

Benzoyl Peroxide will fuck up your skin in the long term. Yes, it dries them up a little bit but as a response you'll skin will produce twice as much oil, then you will again apply Benzyl Peroxide and the cycle will continue. 

The thing that no one tells you is that while oily skin causes acne but it also has benefits. You age a lot slower than people with dry skin. Yes, you might get a pimple here and there but in the long term it's worth it. Look at Brad Pitt he had awful acne and he remained looking young for a very long time.

Do the above, but when you shower use a salicylic acid face wash (as high % as you can find) on face, chest, and back.  Let sit for like 20-30 seconds.  Now wash again with the same wash or with a different one containing as high % benzoyl peroxide as possible.  Let sit 20-30 seconds again.  Now wash with bar soap, something with no sydnets, you want that super dry, squeaky clean feeling afterwards (Nothing that leaves your skin feeling smooth afterwards, you want it feeling like it does after using the bars of soap in hotels).  This removes the oil and fights the acne.  

Like 3 times a day wash your face, back, and chest with a washcloth soaked in super hot water.  Let sit on face for a bit to open the pores up.  This removes the oils and orcs from your face throughout the day.  

Do not touch your face, back, or chest ever, or you put orcs on that shit.

The only way to fix it is to change the pore structure itself. There are topical treatments for this that range in strength, with rho-accutane being the most common, however it can have some nasty side effects. There ARE others though that are much more gentle and can still be effective. A doctor or dermatologist will be able to prescribe them for you.	1	0

Accutane is the same stuff you would give to someone with skin cancer, it's essentially chemical warfare with your body, you roll the dice on wether the cure will be worse than the disease. And remember that it's not even close to a guarantee that you're going to be acne-free forever after you've taken accutane, unless you also address the underlying causes (doing which would also make such harsh treatment both redundant and counter-productive).

With that said, I'm not trying to argue that there is no place for accutane, or for acne antibiotics for that matter, I just think that they are far too overprescribed and given without sufficient information. Just make sure you educate yourself on the drug as well as the mechanisms that lead to acne before you take it, and good luck."	1	0

What we've evolved to eat is not the only element germane to discussions like this. Saying that we should base our diets solely on prehistory when we live in a modern world is reductivist, and, last time I checked, a bunch of ""artificially constructed"" chemicals have *saved millions if not billions of lives*.  This whole granola-crowd definition of ""artifice"" is dumb. Nature is all things that exist (barring belief in the supernatural). If I squeeze orange juice on my cut apples or if I apply a mild solution of synthesized aqueous citric acid on them, the result is the same: they don't brown up (oxidize). The source of the chemical does not matter. If there's a problem with a specific preservative, then science needs to be done to find a better one. This is how we, as humans, win. Drawing arbitrary distinctions between what's ""natural"" and what's not serves literally no one but the people who can make money off it.

Look at *Brassica*. Have you ever heard anybody advocating eating [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Brassica_oleracea0.jpg) over [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Cabbage_and_cross_section_on_white.jpg), [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Boerenkool.jpg), [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Collards_in_container.jpg), [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Woolworths-cauliflower.jpg) [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Fractal_Broccoli.jpg), and [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Broccoli_and_cross_section_edit.jpg), [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Brussels_sprout_closeup.jpg), [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Kohlrabi_against_an_exotic_cushion%2C_Gurgaon%2CHaryana.jpg), and [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Gailan.jpg) because the first one is more ""natural?"" The latter forms are perversions of the original organism created *by humans* in a timescale small enough to not matter much evolutionarily. Oh gods, what have we wrought! Look at the mutation! Clearly, those horribly distorted forms are inferior to the pure original - we should only be eating that! And this is only what we've done to that *one species*, to say nothing of the hybrid horrors we've created. 

""But FPR,"" I hear you cry, ""those were created by the entirely natural process of having humans control what individuals bred with which, unlike your freaky frankenfood monstrous lab horror ^(other scary words) science experiments!"" Right, because every hybrid we've created through ""natural"" *artificial selection* has been totally free of emergent, deleterious traits. It's obviously safer to blindly shuffle together genes than to pick specific ones that we at least have some idea of the effects of. 

But sure, if your aunt's friend, coworker's brother, and every other human with instinct, hunger, sexual selection, and the means to evolve is specifically geared to eat a more ""natural,"" ""healthy,"" ""whole,"" ""organic"" diet, then that fact surely has been borne out in the overwhelming majority of scientific research. Why, I bet you'd have to try hard to find a major scientist who didn't think that this was the consensus! Like with evolution, the scientific evidence must be so overwhelming that no one but holdout contrarians contests it!

Oh wait. None of that is true. Research doesn't indicate any of that. 

I'd go so far as to say your justification here is...

OK, I like you, so I'll explain this. 

First off, ""natural"" is hugely misunderstood - both by the proponents of ""natural"" products, and by the proponents of the ""naturalistic fallacy"". This is because it seems no one understands what the word actually means. 

A thing has a nature. Every individual conceptual entity has a nature that is it's essence - it's how we conceptualise ideas and utilise them in the world. Yes, zen and particle physics aside, there are ""things"" and they have a nature.

A ""naturalistic fallacy"" advocate is correct to point out that the universe is a ""thing"", and that it has a nature. Everything within the universe is natural to the universe, ergo everything is natural - to the universe. The fact that we're lazy and omit the subject from our ""x is natural"" statements means we're not framing the debate correctly. We need to have respect for our language and be specific.

What is the nature of water? It's wet. That's it's nature. Is it natural for water to not be wet? No, it's not natural for that to be in water's nature. Water is wet. Wet is natural - for water.

Is arsenic natural? To the universe? yes. To the planet earth? Sure.

Is arsenic natural to water? Sometimes. Is it natural to the human body? Certainly not. The nature of the human body is to NOT have arsenic in it. Infact arsenic changes the nature of the human body so much that is ceases to BE a human body and dies.

Arsenic is NOT natural to the human body.

Now you can apply this logic to ANY food product you choose. Is it natural for the human body to consume brassica? Sure. Over thousands of years we've eaten leafy vegetables for our sustenance. Is it natural for the human body to eat iceberg lettuce? It has been in our nature for thousands of years also. 

You could say ""It's in homosapiensapiens nature to eat leafy vegetables such as brassica"", and ""it's in civilised human's nature to breed leafy vegetables and derive variants over time, favouring nutritious varieties and disfavouring toxic varieties""

That's their nature...

Is it in Homosapiensapiens nature to eat Ractopamine? Absolutely not. We wouldn't put this on the voyager record outlining our nature. Is it in civilised human's nature to eat Ractopamine? Absolutely not. It's a blip. 

It's in our nature to explore and experiment - and that includes food, but our food experimentations have thus far been pretty conservative, because our NATURE is to have chemical and biological processes that favour specific, EXTRAORDINARILY complex things that we have yet to fully understand. 

That is to say - our bodies seek out that which is ""natural"" to the human body.

-----------------

Which brings me to the second point. Why are there things which are natural to the human body and things which arent? Why on cthulhu's green earth are some things edible and others inedible? Why do some things digest well, convert to muscle and blood cells and energy, and other things accumulate as toxins, clog up processes and act as carcinogens?

The answer is SIMPLE if you're willing to be factual and pedantic. 

The human body is not an isolated species - it's a part of an ecosystem.
You can think of an ecosystem as interlocking gears. When you evolve one of the gears to have different shaped 
pegs, the other gears co-evolve to respond and fill those gaps and needs.

That's why chemicals created by plants often perfectly fit our neurological receptors and work in symphony with our digestive and immune systems. It's why we breathe out and plants breathe in. We co-evolve. 

Now, thus far the evolution - even the selective breeding (humans aren't the only species to cultivate specific symbiotes) so far that evolution has been slow - it's been what you would call ""generational"". This means that a change in a species is evolved and tested over plant generations, and evolved and tested over human generations. 

Already this monoculture methodology is messing with the gears of the ecosystem. It's ruining insect and marsupial symbiotes in favour of specifically changing the gears of those plants to fit the gears of humans. It's also having unknown effects on our health. But for the most part you're right - the benefits (to us) outweigh the costs, and generally speaking other species have managed to cope. 

Now introduce NON-generational mutations to the mix, and what do you expect to see? You'll see gears out of sync, unable to mesh, and you'll see the machinery fail. It's why throwing a bunch of rainforesty chemicals into a paddock doesn't make a rainforest. You can't be reductionist when it comes to complex systems, and it's the great failing of our current method of thinking.

So, in short, we eat ""food"" because we ARE food. Those plants, and by extension the supporting symbiotes that encompass the entire ecosystem are inextricably linked to us. We're gears - pieces of a puzzle that fit snugly, and co-evolve. We cannot fundamentally change the external human processes without expecting to fundamentally change the internal processes. We cannot expect to consume eg. Ractopamine without having some internal processes that can actually PROCESS Ractopamine. 

It is almost too obvious to mention, but I find myself tirelessly going over these points. People get to feel smarter citing ""the naturalistic fallacy"" than actually understanding and respecting the enormity of complex systems. People want to believe - and are raised (as i was) to believe that science was basically 99.999% of the way there, when we're NOT. We have great models of tiny isolated aspects of complex systems (eg an image of a single static protein out of the billions a human body interacts with every day), but we have NO idea of the way it works in unison.

What we DO know, however, is there are systems we favour - human life, the ecosystem and the climate system are three examples - and those systems have certain natures. If we are to preserve those systems, we should do what we can to preserve their natures. If we find things are disrupting those natures we should make an effort to cease that activity and restore the natures that are essential to maintaining those systems. We don't need extensive studies on every additive to know intuitively that NO, the human body, the ecosystem and the climate system does NOT have evolved mechanisms to deal with this alien additive.

The basic fact of the matter is that, in the ecological niches that we and many (every?) other species has occupied as long as these systems have existed, it has been the nature of every individual to suffer and struggle. Ethics may vary, but this is generally held to be a bad thing, especially when the species under consideration is human. I, for example, have a natural genetic autoimmune disorder, among any number of other endemic maladies. It would have been in the ""human nature"" for me to die years ago if it weren't for some of these additional synthetic elements you're decrying.

You say that the behavior of complex systems is not well understood, and I agree. It's definitely true that capital-S Science as an institution is not 99.999% there, or even 50% there, depending on where you put the goalposts. (Your knowledge of proteomics, medicinal chemistry, microbiology, and pharmacology sounds a little out of date, for what it's worth. Higher-order interactions of systems are increasingly well understood, but not so much so that you're wrong to claim we don't really have it fully figured out. Personally, none of those are my areas of expertise, either, but basically half my social circle are researchers in relevant fields at the local Uni, so I'd like to think I know enough to be obnoxious. Frankly, I was shocked at how far we've come on proteomics even in the last decade. It's really something.)

The conclusion you seem to be drawing is that, because the somewhat ineffable behavior of these high-order systems eludes us, we should revert to intuition. The problem is that we're actually really bad at that - the way we ascribe agency to the behavior of higher-order systems just breeds the old ""when I do this the nature gods mostly seem to bless it"" mindset. You say that we should cease activities that disrupt the essential natures of these complex systems, but I, for one, have a vested interest in not going back to everything's essential nature. My essential nature is to waste away and die in short order.

I would argue that we, in fact, *do* need extensive studies on *every* additive, because the whole point of making additives in the first place was to pull absolutely every biological, chemical, and mechanical trick possible to reduce human suffering, maximize human happiness, and maximize ethical behavior. We need as much research and as many failsafes as possible so that the ractopamines of the future don't get used the way ractopamine was. If ractopamine continues to cause problems in the ecosystem at large, would your suggestion be to just wait and let evolution take care of it? Absolutely not! Human ingenuity and science work on a much shorter timescale with a much higher ethical potential. You'd say to clean that shit up, and that ain't evolution.

Unless you have some scientific study that says otherwise, there isn't really a good reason to believe that man-made food additives are more bad for us than they are good as a whole. If 95% of the additives that have ever been made wound up screwing something up, and 5% didn't, I'd totally be with you on the ""let's generally not eat those"" thing. (I'd still think ethical research should continue, though) The data just doesn't back that ""more bad than good"" assessment up, though. The world's scientists would be having conniptions. The root of this is that you have decided to not trust random additive X simply on the basis that it's man-made, and the data does not support that bias.

I don't think life should be ""natural"" for humans. ""Natural"" makes for a lot of suffering. I want us to do better, and the only way we can do that is to *try*. People are suffering right now for the lack of tomorrow's inventions.

Also, fwiw, saying a climate system has ""evolved mechanisms"" is just silly. Humans, yes, ecosystems, in a certain view, but climates, no. Adaptive behavior is not necessarily in the essential nature of all high-order systems. "	1	0

I agree that unstable systems can often be stabilised through ""non-natural"" means. Stable systems however don't need artificial stabilisation, and those blunt efforts to stabilise always, always, always have consequences precisely because they are non-symbiotes. You'd understand this given that you likely experience side effects from your drug treatment. We CAN sidestep problems by blunt instruments like drugs and other interventions, and we have a moral obligation to do so. That being said, most people DON'T suffer from those problems - the ecosystem certainly doesn't, therefore we shouldn't mess with their nature. We are messing with the nature of the climate system, with the ecosystem, and with the human body, which is leading to climate change, mass extinction and cancers. On the human scale there are benefits to individuals as a result of intervention, but it should be the fringe case, not the default.

In a perfect world we would deal with your genetics and stop the problem in a ""natural"", or symbiotic manner - so you can continue your life as a full ecological symbiote. Until then, blunt intervention will have to suffice.

&gt; because the somewhat ineffable behavior of these high-order systems eludes us, we should revert to intuition.

There's not reverting here. We primarily operate on instinct and intuition. Our sleep cycle, our hunger, the foods we desire, the people we desire, the comforts we seek - they all play into the evolutionary needs we had to, and continue to have to fulfil. 

What I'm suggesting is that, like Malcom Gladwell says, most of our decisions are subconscious, much of our complex reasoning is inexplicable, incredibly difficult to articulate, and (drumroll) right.

Yes, we can't intuit our way into building a bridge or engineering a manned mission to mars, but we CAN intuit our way to a healthy lifestyle, a healthy diet and a symbiotic relationship with our ecosystem. This isn't heeby jeeby witchcraft - we have simply evolved those neural pathways. We are born experts at deriving meaningful and beneficial pathways through these complex systems. Our brains are literally complex system emulators.

The closest computer can emulate very shallow models of complex systems. Computationally, we're better at this problem, and this is more the case the more ""natural"" to humans the system is (shelter, lifestyle, diet).

It doesn't mean we go back to caves, but it *does* mean we need to constantly evaluate how natural our choices are to us. We live in houses. Houses are great - they're like big caves. However, is asbestos good for us? Is there a side effect to killing off the spiders with insect spray (eg, mosquitoes). Is there a side effect to living inside of a monoculture? Is there a side effect to farming in monocultures? Is there a side effect to allowing fat intake without the evolved meat intake that has traditionally come along?

More importantly perhaps is the understanding that because the fact that they're complex systems, we more often than not won't know the answers to these individual questions, and indeed won't even be asking the questions most of the time.

**There is ONE scientific observation that we truly need to employ:** When a complex system has factors changed, the complex system becomes unstable until a new equilibrium is reached. Humans are brilliant at destabilising complex systems. We're also arrogant enough to think we can blunt instrument our way to plugging up all the holes left by complex gears that have been eradicated.

I agree that sometimes we need to take action and attempt to restabilise unstable complex systems (eg, individual health problems), but 99.999% of the time all it takes is observing what similar complex systems that operate at their capacity are doing (time tested), and emulate this. We intuitively know this if we can manage to listen to our instincts rather than the little narrative voice in our heads.

&gt; fwiw, saying a climate system has ""evolved mechanisms"" is just silly

The climate is a direct reflection of the ecosystem. The chemical makeup of the atmosphere changed as a result of early primordial organisms pulling CO2 and other chemicals out making way for complex life. Presently the atmosphere is constantly filtered through the biosphere, including you. There is an equilibrium in the chemical makeup of the atmosphere, and a predictable expected cycle of temperatures, and processes.

Now when you change the chemical makeup of that complex system by adding that primordial CO2 back into the atmosphere, you can refer to our ""ONE scientific observation"" to get an entirely reliable result. That complex system will become unstable."	2	0

My genetic deficiency arose ""naturally,"" as far as anybody knows about this stuff. I exist as a natural part of a greater system that trends toward a ""stability"" that involves specific individuals (e.g. me) dying.

&gt;That being said, most people DON'T suffer from those problems - the ecosystem certainly doesn't, therefore we shouldn't mess with their nature.

The ecosystem certainly does suffer from ""those problems!"" There ain't never been no ""balance."" It's always been slow change. We're just changing it faster now. Ask a liopleurodon how slow change and nature's balance worked out for it; spoiler alert: it's not poor mental acuity that'll stop it answering.

&gt;We are messing with the nature of the climate system, with the ecosystem, and with the human body, which is leading to climate change, mass extinction and cancers.

You won't get any argument from me against anthropogenic climate change. Ocean acidification data makes it clear enough all on its own. But cancer? That was described by the ancient Egyptians. How exactly are you going to tell me that this is some new thing caused by our modern imbalances?

&gt;most of our decisions are subconscious, much of our complex reasoning is inexplicable, incredibly difficult to articulate, and (drumroll) right.

Which is why the foods that people gravitate toward most are healthiest for them, right? The very fact that you have to give people diet advice belies the truth here; basic instinctual intuition is not as useful as intellect in governing these matters anymore. Also, tell the huge proportion of people who struggle with various mental illnesses how human intuition is really good at all kinds of stuff and so should be trusted with big decisions over scientific reasoning and explicit logic. Imean, humans have been surviving for generations, so, if your intuition tells you that your neighbor is plotting to kill you, you should probably trust that over objective analysis.

&gt;It doesn't mean we go back to caves, but it does mean we need to constantly evaluate how natural our choices are to us.

But you're just using ""natural"" as a proxy for ""broadly beneficial"" here. Asbestos isn't bad for us because it's ""not natural,"" it's bad because it makes us sick! Drywall isn't natural, and it's fine. Cement isn't terribly natural, and it's fine. Roofing tar certainly isn't naturally arranged, and it's downright helpful.

&gt;There is ONE scientific observation that we truly need to employ: When a complex system has factors changed, the complex system becomes unstable until a new equilibrium is reached. 

Ah, well my baby-eating machine only eats ten babies a minute, and nobody's really sure how it works. It's better to just leave it alone than to turn some buttons and knobs to see if we can get it to stop eating babies. It might settle into an equilibrium at eating 20 babies a minute because of what I did! Best to do nothing.

&gt;Humans are brilliant at destabilising complex systems. We're also arrogant enough to think we can blunt instrument our way to plugging up all the holes left by complex gears that have been eradicated.

We're doing pretty damn well - way better than before, when we were just letting the world kick us around. Look at us! Look at the natural forces we bend to our will. We regularly deliver food to distant populations using boxes that get there using very tightly-controlled explosions. Hardly anybody dies of a whole slew of illnesses anymore. Scurvy totally isn't a thing. Polio's almost gone. When you have a hammer, all the problems look like nails; it's a good thing we keep trying to expand the toolbox, too.

&gt;I agree that sometimes we need to take action and attempt to restabilise unstable complex systems (eg, individual health problems)

No you don't! What if that heritable variation is the one that restabilizes the larger ecological system? What if you ""fixing"" that one little thing in an effort to make it more like other things actually destabilizes the higher-order system? Your assessment of what things are okay to try and what aren't is based on imprecise criteria. One of our futuristic polyclonal species of sustainable herd animals sometimes dies of a horrible genetic disease, and we fix that one little thing? Oh no, some other organism relied on those deaths to balance out some other thing! We should never have tried! Their deaths are part of The Balance.

&gt;We intuitively know this if we can manage to listen to our instincts rather than the little narrative voice in our heads.

wooo wooo and if we listen with our hearts to the woo woooow ooo- Please. Rationality is better than the alternative. Let's just nip that one in the bud. If you can't justify something, then it's less justified than something you can justify. You should make decisions that are more justified. If you don't think that, there really isn't a lot to talk about. In a gut/head conflict, I try and find some resolution between the two. I'm not just gonna go with the gut.

&gt;There is an equilibrium in the chemical makeup of the atmosphere, and a predictable expected cycle of temperatures, and processes.

The ice samples from Greenland disagree. In the long view there aren't ""cycles,"" there's ""progression."" 10 billion years ago, as far as we know, there wasn't a magical stable equilibrium of biological forces going on earth, because there wasn't biology, and there wasn't earth. 14 billion years ago just **wasn't** at all. Balances and cycles aren't inherently good - neither capital-G Good nor good for us humans. The only cycle or balance that can be assured is the heat death of the universe, and I don't see that as being particularly good for us.

Tell you what. Go back through your own post, and capitalize (or capitalise, if you prefer \^_~) every instance of ""nature,"" ""balance,"" and ""equilibrium,"" then re-read it. Tell me you're not assigning value to something that doesn't necessarily have intrinsic value. What element of the ethical framework you're proposing does this support? Imean, what if we made an unstable trend toward satisfaction and fulfillment for all mankind? That'd be good, right?"	1	0

Weeeelll... to be fair, so (presumably) did your life expectancy.
What we're discussing are two separate things:

1) Is it a good idea to artificially increase function where there is previously disfunction. Absolutely (assuming all side effects have been considered)

2) Is it a good idea to artificially alter well functioning complex systems in order to arbitrarily change their external symbiotes with no useful or meaningful advantage. Of course not!

Of course the line is a little fuzzy for us humans because we DO like to keep everyone alive, and for as long as possible, despite the ramification (genetic disease, exponential population explosion). Objectively the system would be brought back into balance by the removal of artificial additives and influences, but that's not a moral goal. 

Therefore our moral goal should be: confine our system additives and influences to within very controlled boundaries. Employ them when, and only when necessary.

This has been summed up by smarter people by recognising that humans DO have a technosphere as well as a biosphere (medicines would be included in this), and we need to have robust systems in place to ensure the technosphere is as sustainable and as symbiotic as possible. Currently this is not the case, and currently people don't even recognise the need to draw up these boundaries. 

&gt; There ain't never been no ""balance.""

If you're talking about ecological matter, there sure has been! For millions of years the ecological makeup of our planet has remained relatively stable. Species have evolved and changed at a relatively predictable rate. 

When there are huge disruptions to this system - meteorites, climate change, pollution - there are huge losses of biodiversity, losses of ecological function and, you guessed it, instability.

That's what we're seeing now. As expected. An entirely predictable outcome from introducing unnecessary, unplanned change to a complex system. The same thing would happen if you introduced your medicines into my diet. (or a more apt analogy would be, if I started drinking water that was runoff from the drug factory)

&gt; Which is why the foods that people gravitate toward most are healthiest for them, right?

Yes, the foods people gravitate toward are the healthiest. The deconstructions people gravitate toward are not. This is complex systems vs reductionism 101, right here.

People gravitate toward fat, why? Because we're evolved to understand that fat means we're getting our protein and iron intake. (along with all of the other mutualistic processes, such as teeth cleaning, saliva generation, sleep cycle regulation etc)

People gravitate toward sugars, why? Because we're evolved to understand that sugar means we're eating fruit and vegetables. We're getting the sugar hit that we'll immediately use in our hunting pursuits, and a bunch of vitamins that also benefit this fast action.

When you separate these out, you screw over your brains wiring. It's getting the evolved reward mechanisms without getting the appropriate intake.

It's one of the single most potent examples of the problems with deconstructionism when it comes to diet and lifestyle. Your brains fundamental processes are being tricked. We've managed to trick ourselves into obesity.

We've done this through creating an option to intake food that is contrary to our brain's evolved expectations. In other words - we're eating non-natural food. 

I'm glad you brought it up.

You also mention objective analysis. This is another virtue of the human mind. We're intuitive, we're instinctual, we're brilliant at creating a lifestyle balance in our natural habitat. We're also, as you've pointed out, great at elastically modelling other complex systems and behaviours - so yes, avoiding predators would be one of those.

It's also interesting you'd point that out because a human brain can determine threat levels from instinctive sources like facial expressions, scent, hormones, pheremones, state of hygene, tone of voice, FAR more readily than they can piece together that the neighbour bought some hose, a shovel and has been playing violent video games.

Your point though is that you shouldn't always trust instinct - don't worry, I got that ;) You're 100% correct. Reductionism is fantastic as creating models and hypotheses of situations and circumstances that have limited, measurable variables. (such as piecing together a crime, planning a mission to mars or engineering a bridge). What it's not good at is circumstances that have billions, or even infinite possibilities and variables - predicting behaviour, predicting the weather, knowing which way a drop of water will fall, understanding what the ocean will do. understanding what introducing a new species will to do an ecosystem. understanding what introducing or removing specific proteins or chemicals into a body will do.

For those things we need intuition first, caution second, centuries of observation third, and deep simulation (not that our models will ever be able to capture the intricacies of complex systems, but they may one day give us working models)

&gt; Drywall isn't natural, and it's fine. Cement isn't terribly natural... Roofing Tar

Drywall is Gypsum, so we've had 3000 years to test this for it's effects. Cement is the same. 
There ARE side effects to certain kinds of cement, though generally speaking both of those involve taking geology, and reshaping it into geology. It's still not 100% certain, but it's more certain that 20 year old asbestos technology. 

Roofing tar can cause lung issues and birth defects from what I read, so yeah, terribly useful for us short term perhaps, but terribly damaging for the planet and the health of our future generations perhaps.

Perhaps there's already a link between certain genetic diseases and roof tar, but we may never make the connection. All we have to go off are ""Studies show now link"", and our intuition and knowledge that a complex system has had a free agent addition, and that we should expect instability. 

&gt; baby-eating machine

Cute, but a baby-eating machine isn't exactly the same as a life support system for every species on the planet.

And if there was a baby eating machine that had been functioning perfectly for 10 million years without maintenance, you're a fool for fixing it.

Just to close this one up I'll answer the question. Yes, we humans carve our place out on the earth by killing ""baby killing machines"" like bears and tigers and bacteria and disease. That doesn't mean there aren't unintended side effects.

I would class those as ""defensive manoeuvres"". I would class deforestation as ""offensive"".
So, is it worth destabilising the system for personal gain? Sure... but you don't destabilise your own life support system or you're a damn fool.

An example would be: Your arm is itchy. Do you cut it off? No? Then why the hell would you cut down a forest, kill a million species (including natural cancer cures as have been found in the amazon) just so you can sit in a chair?

We do destabilise the ecosystem - CONSTANTLY. There are always consequences. It's ALWAYS a big deal. The only thing is, sometimes it's absolutely necessary. (like cutting off a gangrenous arm). If it's not, you keep the arm on. you keep the system stable. 

&gt;  Your assessment of what things are okay to try and what aren't is based on imprecise criteria.

They're based on human interest. They're based on the fact that I'm putting your life above the life of individual from another species. 

&gt; Oh no, some other organism relied on those deaths to balance out some other thing! We should never have tried! Their deaths are part of The Balance.

It's the circle of life Simba. Yes this is infact how the ecosystem works. We can choose to be stronger than the next species, but we're still an organic entity. We're still worm and bacteria food. We're still eventually going to be grass eaten by buffalo, and air breathed by whales. We can elevate ourselves slightly above, but we cannot extricate ourselves from this system. 

Our goal shouldn't be ""Win"". Our goal should be ""create symbiosis"". That's what's sustainable.

But yes, in an ideal world we would be a much smaller species, we wouldn't be dealing with genetic diseases (or diseases in general), we would be living high technology, low footprint existences, living in harmony and symbiosis with the rest of the ecosystem, but would have absolute security.

&gt; If you can't justify something, then it's less justified than something you can justify. 

I can justify my intuition. These are neurological pathways that I'm evolved to have. They're smarter and better established than any that have been put there since I was born.

They're the reason you Blink. Breathe. Sleep. Hunger. Lust. Survive."	1	0

Of course! Why the hell would I care if humans destroy the planet if I didn't stand for a set of values?
My set of values however are based upon recognising what humans are here for, recognising what the ecosystem is here for, and establishing a mutual respect between these two symbiotes.

I personally would love to see humans, AND the biodiversity of the planet survive. I would love to see us populate the solar system - explore the stars.

What I see happening, however, is arrogance. I see us thinking we can destroy the ecosystem, and just - repopulate it somehow. I see us oblivious to the complex behaviours in the human body - we think we can make a strawberry by throwing a bunch of strawberry dust into a blender. We think we can outsmart natural selection by keeping everyone alive until 200 years old. 

We're at a point in history where we can PLAY with affecting these complex systems, but we cannot control them.

We're at the point where we know where the paints are - enough to make a terrible mess and spill all the paint for good - but have no idea how Carravagio could have created his masterpieces.

Hell, not even smart enough to appreciate that the original Carravagio is a priceless, irreplaceable work.

So yes, in my subjective value set, you're cured, humanity lives a technological life in symbiosis with a biologically rich ecosystem, and we spread that model throughout the universe.

Check out hackacne.wordpress.com and you will see non-anecdotal lab work.
It will hopefully put you out of a job one of these days!

Not because I dislike dermatolgists (I don't), but because it makes zero sense to treat acne from the outside. According to Darwin, attractiveness indicates fertility.  If you have a skin condition that is extremely unattractive, what sense does it make to use drugs which harm health even further?

Humans get into fights with animals all over the world daily. And sure enough once in awhile there will be freak encounters with strong, athletic humans who know how to fight. 

Shit, when I was 7 years old I got ambushed in an alleyway and chased by stray dog that started to attack me and snap at my legs. In panic I swung a kick and connected cleanly with its nose which resulted in the dog backing off. My skinny 7 year old ass should't have been able to stop an attacking dog in its tracks, but I did. And I don't think it's too far stretched to think that there are some Chimps that suck at fighting, and some Kangaroos that can't defend off their back. "	12	0

And that article says that the strength of the apes has been exaggerated in the past. I mean, we have programs like Fight Science where they just measure the force of a strike applied to a stationary target and think that's the thing.

My grandfather (RIP) grew up in Steubenville, OH the son of Irish immigrants. He worked in the mill for a bit, before going to play college football at University of Houston in the late 1940s. He played fullback and worked in the oil fields on a rig. He basically became a roughneck. I tell you this because he was a tough bastard and there was a story of him fighting some sort of ape. 

The story goes there was a traveling carnival/fair that came to the Corpus Christi area. There was a carnie running an event in which you paid $5 or what not and got $100 if you fought this ape and won. The ape was described to me as most likely an orangatuan and apparently it had a muzzle on it to prevent biting. The ape had made short work of the many challengers that day. This is Texas but fighting an ape that makes it living kicking ass at the county fair is a tough task. The story goes that my grandfather had a few and went to fight the ape. My grandmother's family was there and they all went apeshit (har har) worrying he would get hurt. So my grandpa walks in the ring/cage and the ape is swinging on his little swing just chilling out.  He decides to take the initiative and walks up and trys to ""one-punch"" the ape to hell. He connects right to the beasts face knocking him off the swing and to the ground. The ape gets up immediately screaming like a banshee and charges my grandfather. What ensues was described to me as chaos as the ape claws the shit out of his chest and back and my grandfather basically grabs the thing by the throat and pummels it. 

Eventually after five minutes or so the carnie calls the fight, declaring it a draw and giving my grandpa $50. 

It seemed believable to me, this? Not so much. "	17	0

Genes we lost as we evolved to reduce our muscles to allow our skulls to grow, to allow our growing brains to fit inside.

They have a different bone structure, and their muscles have different attachment points. Such that they get  very significantly increased leverage, compared to where our muscles connect to our bones. So even if their muscles alone were not stronger, they would still be significantly stronger just based on the extra leverage. 

Virtual all chimpanzees you've ever seen on TV and movies have been young, very young. Adult chimpanzees are almost never seen. Because an adult chimp, no matter if male or female can easily rip a human to shreds. A top professional fighter maybe not quite that easily. But an average human certainly.

tl;dr: Do not fuck with chimps.

&gt;

&gt;The __eastern grey kangaroo__ (*Macropus giganteus*) is a [marsupial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial) found in southern and eastern Australia, with a population of several million. It is also known as the __great grey kangaroo__ and the __Forester kangaroo__. Although a big eastern grey male typically masses around 66 [kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram) (weight 145 [lb.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass\))) and stands almost 2 m (6.6 ft.) tall, the scientific name, *Macropus giganteus* (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the [red kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo) of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to 85 kg.

I think I might have burned my son out on games a bit by having him play games that were a little over his head. He was 6-7 and playing Flash Point, Small World, Stone Age, Dominion, Thebes, Tobago, and others. He could play all of them fine, and understood the rules, but was maybe a little too young to really grasp the strategy and seldom wants to play anything more complex than Love Letter or No Thanks now. I think your staged approach would have worked better. I didn't realize that the fact that he would play the games meant that he was really enjoying the games. 	13	0

He loves playing Robot Turtles but that is mostly me playing the ""computer"" for the turtles while he builds the programs. He needs to learn a bit more about turns and winning/losing. 
He is super interested in a what I have but encouraging him to take steps towards getting to them has kind of helped. A well practice your reading and we can roll super hero dice(we roll Marvel Dice Masters and I tell him whats what) But having games we can play and he can grasp that are competitive would be a big help I think.

For my son who is very good at Chess and only seven, there are times for fun dexterity games and there is a time for deep thinking games. Its important to mix it up. If playing games is always a serious strategy situation its going to stop being fun because the reality is that hes a goofy 7yo who loves horsing around.	13	0

Ive realized that **Quarriors** did wonders for Violet's gaming development.  Entranced by the cool cool (cool!) dice, her 7/8 year old self just one day clicked on her ability to cross-reference the cards and their effects, including amplifying abilities, canceling out others, and altering the order and pace of play.  The games a bit limited, frankly, but its eye candy + intro mechanics value will make me love it forever.

**Settlers** ----&gt; **Seven Wonders** ----&gt; **All Creatures Big and Small** has also been a great path for resource management and introductory worker placement. "	7	0

Yes, learning to deal with setbacks instead of throwing a tantrum is good, but this particular game is brutal about them (unlike, say, backgammon, or maybe parcheesi).

To add to the list, my 6 year old absolutely loves Splendor. He begs to play it daily.  His other game that he loves is Lords of Waterdeep. He needs help explaining some of the cards but plays well and has fun. 

When he started playing games he took losses very poorly and occasionally he still does but much less now.  We discovered that if we set goals within a game or point out areas within the game that he did well then he can appreciate a mini victory even if he loses the overall game.  I think gaming has been very good for his development because of this."	2	0

Flashpoint and Forbidden Island are also games they love too. I'm particularly fond of Flashpoint and we've played the simple game with their younger cousins.

My kids (8 and 9) have been playing Carcassonne for years (with the farmers from the beginning, though they're really only getting the strategy for that now. We pretty much don't hold my son back from playing anything he shows an interest in now (he's almost 10 and has all the right aptitudes for learning and figuring out strategies on his own or with a little help). He loves Agricola, Catan, Ticket To Ride, etc. At the same time, we played Pirate's Cove last night (which really doesn't take much strategy at all) and LOVED playing simply because daddy (me) kept ending up at an island with someone else and getting my ass handed to me. Both kids were in hysterics.

So, again, the list is great - I do appreciate it, but don't fret too much - sit down and play, help them out when they need it, and just have fun!"	2	0

Actually, I agree with you even if you're not my assistant. I love spending time with the kids and gaming is just an excuse to do that. Well, and to get some time with the hobby I love. 

While I agree mostly with your point I will emphasize that it's easy to turn off kids by getting them too deep into a game they just won't win, *depending on the kid*. That's why I put together this list. 

My eldest gets frustrated if she just can't grasp the winning strategy. She doesn't need to win, but needs to see how to win. I wouldn't throw her into Agricola right now because she wouldn't' grok it. 

My youngest is there purely for the experience as she's recently learned how to lose gracefully. She'd play just about anything at least once. "	1	0

Let's do this....
Joijob's home brew dungeon crawler for my 2.3-3 year old (we are playing this for 7 months now).

--------------------------------------------------
You will need:


10 Claustrophobia room tiles (carefully selected for variety). Entrance and final treasure room should remain stable from game to game.

10 Descent 1/2 minis (painted=bonus). One (or more) per room.
6/12 King of Tokyo dice (different color dice for monsters/heroes=bonus). 3 for you, 3 for the kid 4/5 for the monsters (so you mostly win).

Mini figures from Claustrophobia for the heroes (Me=priest, kid=one of the guys with the swords). Assign stable names to the heroes.
Tokens for treasure from any game you like/find interesting. I tried Jamaica coins but it got repetitive. I now use Descent one leftover tokens (colorful and great variety).

Lots (and lots) of room for improvisation

----------------------------------------------------

How to play:
You preselect the 10 monsters that you will encounter during the adventure (I assign sound effects to all).

You start on a great adventure inside the cave of the bad monster X (named Super bad guy). For us the final baddy is always the red Giant from Descent.

You have the entrance tile open without a monster. You ask the kid to select one of the ""secret"" (randomized except the last) rooms that you are exploring. Also s/he has to decide which direction the room will be placed (left/right/in front). As the kid gets older he has the responsibility of aligning the path correctly between tiles.

You ask the kid which monster lives in the room (I usually create stories relevant to the appearance of the tiles). Some of the tiles we use are usually “paired” with specific monsters (e.g., water tile with the Merriod). Once decided the monster arrives with the designated sound effect. A pile of treasure (i.e., 2 carefully selected tokens) are placed in the room as well. Note: the treasure is not revealed before the battle.


You both roll dice (and the monster too). The King of Tokyo dice have sides with 1/2/3 and 3 symbols (thunder, heart and Paw). You assign events for each symbol and number. For us: 1/2/3=damage, Thunder=you fall down, i.e, you do no damage, Paw=Double/critical hit (special effect, it doesn’t actually affect the outcome of the battle) and Heart=you either get up (if you fell down with the same roll) or you help your friend (i.e., each other) if they did. If not, no effect.

You count (as the kid grows, progressively together) the damage points. Bonus: Enact the battle in real life: sword/hammer/shield movements/sounds required.


If you win (90% of the time) the monster dies and you reveal the treasure. In turn you select the one you want. Note: my son always wants to select first (he likes very specific tokens. I usually pair those with ones that he doesn’t like), so this is where I taught him the meaning of a turn. First room he selects (all is ok). Second room I do (he doesn’t like it when I take the treasure he wants). There is a lot of room for teaching/fun here.


If you don’t win (1/2 time per adventure max), the monster is following you (sound effect) towards the exit. When you reach that tile you have a choice: Do you want to exit the dungeon and finish the adventure (my son says yes if he is bored/not very often), or do you stand and fight? Repeat battle.


So on and so forth till the last room where you defeat the last Baddy (same system, nothing special in reality) and you get the final treasure (I save some nice tokens for this: Ghost sword and some kind of magical armor).



For us it takes 30min to an hour to complete (depends on the mood and the number of tiles). It is really magical to experience the kid growing and gradually grasping more and more of the concepts. Enjoy……

When playing a game, what is the first thing you do?  You figure out how the system works.  You figure out what you can and cannot do within the game world.  You figure out what things are within your control and which things are not.  You decide on goals, and need to formulate plans of actions to take in order to achieve them.  

All of this is generally gathered under the generic term 'systems thinking'.  And it's going to most likely be the world your kids live in.  Increasingly, people spend all of their time involved in man-made systems.  People don't spend much time in situations where nature sets the rules, it's all about laws and policies of the workplace and things like that.  Learning how to manipulate those systems and optimize your actions for them is extremely important.  And games are the only thing which teach this aside from pretty deep study of philosophy."	3	0

First, my compliments to those involved, no innocents hit, do you think that was intentional or just dumb luck?  

Do you guys like watching Sons of Anarchy or is it so much BS it's laughable?

Is there ever any chance that a guy riding a goldwing would ever be accepted by a club?  If no, why ... If yes, under what conditions or circumstances?

It seems, in my limited experience, that different clubs can hang out at festivals and events (thinking Sturgis etc.) without much trouble but then, something like Waco this week happens.  How does this paradigm work?  Why would the groups involved be hanging out in the same Restraunt if there is enough bad blood to spark such a major incident?

Meaning, the women are merely property to the club members.. That women so easily get passed around... How about the process of joining a club... I believe its hang around, prospect to a patch?

So not only did you not answer any of the questions, specifically about why you're such a dickbag, you basically just devolved into 'i dun care', which is the battlecry of the infant - really though, you sound like a teenage girl with that line. Does that make you proud and manly and tough? If nothing else, you've proven why nobody should actually give a shit about you or your friends' lives, because by your own admissions you're a bunch of dicks that don't care about anyone else, and so shouldn't be left in society anyway. 	6	1

We have prostitution rings, hard drug trafficking, and frequent violent crimes.  Its gotten to the point where the high school is one of the more dangerous places to be, as so many of the kids are recruited at a young age.  It's not uncommon to see gang tattoos on 16 year olds in my town.

We also have a very small biker gang presence, like 2 patched members and 3 prospects of a 1%er gang. (honestly not sure which one, I'm told they are affiliated with the hells angels)

  Our gang unit seems to be focusing most of their efforts on countering the biker gang problem, and very little effort on the extremely large street gang problem by comparison.  Sure, they ID street gang members and keep a database of them, but most of their time is spent on recon for the biker club.

I'm a financial and fraud crimes detective, who sometimes works cybercrimes, so my experience with street level crimes is limited, however even in my two years on patrol, and year in property crimes investigations, most of our problems stemmed from the street gangs.  I literally didn't even know we had a 1%er gang in the area until recently.

My question to you, is are they right to devote so much energy to the biker gang?  What is it you guys do that concerns us so much?  I'm not asking you to incriminate yourself, I just want to know why there is so much effort put into such a seemingly small group of people, and a look from the other perspective would be interesting."	2387	0

Now, bars are full of ignorant rednecks, and no one is safe. I stopped going to bars for this reason--my third broken nose for no reason was enough for me.

My question is, from your experience, how much of a balance do 1%ers play in keeping ""disorganized"" crime at bay nowadays? Sort of like the Mafia used to in the 20s and 30s. And do you think its still something to trust; the ""nobility of thieves""?"	40	0

Care to answer that question too, or are you so sincerely weak that you can't even face the honest questions about yourself?

Not man enough to admit that your lifestyle is wrong, childish, and that you're too weak to go about correcting its path like basically everyone else around you, who worked to earn what you would steal? 

Since you're ok with taking things from other people, do you get angry or upset when people steal from you? Honest question. If you do get upset or mad about it, do you realize how much of a hypocrite that makes you?

The book you are thinking of is No Angel, by Jay Dobyns. He infiltrated the Arizona Hells Angels. Jay still has a price on his head, but the HA aren't willing to risk exposure. If they wanted him gone bad enough, they could go to a book signing, interview, or other public appearance. 

As it is, they're content to run a smear campaign on him and his book. 

Angels of Death is a similar book, but it focuses on multiple different operations in many countries, only touching on Black Biscuit a little bit. No Angel gives you a more full insight into the operation as a whole, and if you haven't read it yet I'd encourage you to.

Edit: I would like everyone to remember that /r/AMA is a sub designed to be both informative and entertaining. The only proof that the OP gave was a pic of a patch on a vest, so as far as proving identity he's lacking, but he's commented on this already and he doesn't care and neither do I. I have been both informed and entertained. He could be legit or he could be a creative writer. Either way I liked the commentary. 

He has responded to both genuine questions and trolls with wit and has not resorted to feigning Internet violence. Anyone who has issues with the popularity of this post has forgotten the popularity of The Sopranos, The Wire, Sons of Anarchy, and Breaking Bad. All of these shows glorify drugs and violence, and the public eats it up. 

To be honest, I think all gangs should be arrested for their illegal activities. My comment thanking him for being awesome has to do with his AMA skills and not his choice of lifestyle. "	806	0

If you're still answering, I have a couple of questions.

1.  How do most biker gangs view and/or deal with non-gang people on average? I would assume indifference, but maybe there is something else.

2. What was the worst prospect you ever dealt with? Did he get his patch, and if not... why?

It's my understanding that it requires some sort of criminal act, whether that's selling/producing meth/drugs or murder or intimidation/extortion tactics. Please correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like there's usually a singular crime that warrants a 1%er patch so I'm curious as to what it was you did that got you your patch. 	0	0

You tackle them because you can show the progress to the public, you can justify your salary and expansive budget and new military toys. I know several cops terrified of marijuana legalization because they think they might lose their job. So many people smoke pot, and it's so incredibly easy to bust, the perps are almost always nonviolent and terrified of the police and getting in trouble so they cooperate. Then the department talks about how much pot they kept out of your children's hands and their budget goes up.	47	0

Honest question though.

It doesn't really bother me at all because I love to hear the power such a small engine can produce. And I think its a cool sound. 

But honestly, why do bikers just rev out of impulse? Or is their some signal/cool factor thing to it? Does it help the engine prepare for acceleration? Or does it help the rider get a feel for the power being delivered before acceleration? So they know how much to throttle up slowly but quickly?(That's when I hear bikers rev up the most)

He fled to the otherside of the country and lives in a campground without a legal traceable residence. I'm pretty sure he's using a different name, and I've never heard a last name used.

He left back in the 80's, but I want to know what the culture is like now. Do people that leave have to worry this much? Does it depend on what they knew?"	5	0

But it's absolutely not something that was agreed upon beforehand or intentional.  Just serendipitous and extremely lucky.  

Bringing that kind of violence to a public place, whether the instigator or the target, demonstrates a total lack of regard for any innocent bystanders and a complete and total interest and absorbency in the self alone.

The only reason no innocent, non-biker-affiliated person got hurt is complete luck, and certainly not because of the bikers' aim, restraint, or concern for anything but themselves in that moment."	46	0

I sped a bit, but I was never the person weaving between cars. I'm still not sure how the people in the bar would have known that, the comments mostly came from the latest group walking in the door that had to pass my Ninja in the otherwise Harley lineup.	4	0

As for the ""unnecessarily loud"" bikes:  Stock bikes nearly always come with shit, baffled pipes that adhere to the standards of the most strict state (I assume it's always California).  By doing something as simple as removing the baffles from the stock pipes you can help increase performance on the bike (you also need to adjust your air intake and carb/ignition to compensate).  This has the side effect of more noise.  As a side note, bikers usually prefer loud pipes as there are too many oblivious dickheads in cars who refuse to check their blind spot and a motorcycle horn is generally not much louder than the bell on a Huffy."	1	1

I don't think vets have the generalization for being 1 uppers outside of their own circles, which they sometimes are with their own ridiculous posturing, I think what you're trying to refer to is the first-day private's sense of pride and *wanting* to wear his uniform 'accidentally' so that people thank him for his service.

Nothing wrong with that, don't hide behind their perceived safety value as a reason for justification.  Just as many who like them, there are magnitudes more citizens who absolutely despise them.

They were pointing out how biker gangs seem to be more glorified and  romanticized but I feel the point they miss is that to an extent biker gangs try to paint themselves as a good wholesome group of people that enjoy bikes and can do good for the community.

While yes odds are each biker gang has a foothold on the drug community when you compare them to the Bloods and Crips they are a one-dimensional group that's all about gangbangs, drugs and shooting up rivals.

So this is my question, how do you feel biker gangs differ  from the Bloods and Crips and without incriminating yourself, are you more on the law or chaotic side of the biker gang?"	0	0

In my area these gangs don't cause many problems. There was a ""Hell's Angels territory"" sign down the street from a friends house when I was growing up, most I heard from them as far as trouble were loud parties on New Years and 4th of July. They even helped a lost kid who wandered in there one time. Then I also hear about motorcycle clubs opposing the WBC, making appearances at military funerals, etc., and it just gives me the image that real crime among biker gangs is sort of a thing of the past.

I learned on a Shadow, but my first bike was a Kawasaki Vulcan 500 - too small for me (I'm 6').   


As for weight, the distribution matters (e.g. how high the center of gravity is) more than the raw number.  A Sporty is about 560lbs and a Softail is about 750lbs, but the Softail is less tippy because its weight is lower.

Once a group of our most predominant 1% ers came into a bar and you could tell something was up, maybe they were looking for someone, who knows. We sent a pitcher to their table just to show respect. Once one of them came over and thanked us and asked if we needed anything. I just asked him if shit was going to go down, I'd prefer not to be sitting here when it did. He said no problem, about an hour or so later he tapped me on the shoulder and told me it was getting late that we might want to hit the road. I appreciated that.

First off, i recently started riding motorcycles and am absolutely loving it, do you have any tips or points for a novice to improve my  riding skills?

Secondly,i would like your opinion or perspective on something that's been happening in my country, a local gang has for nearly 3 years been making over 500 sandwiches a day to be delivered to children who go to school hungry in poor areas, does this kind of generosity happen in America? Or do the 1%er's do anything for the public to help or improve their general image?

He isn't obligated to make a case for himself. This is an ama for questions with a 1% biker, I don't see it as posturing. That is like saying an ama with a major movie star is them gloating about being fabulously wealthy and not about the ability to ask them questions. Also you are making a lot of assumptions about your service and his life. Just because you may or may not have been in something you think is tough doesn't give you the right to use your experience to discredit others.

Vets definitely have a stigma about being 1 uppers, anyone who interacts with the civilians around a military post knows that. 

Do whatever you want, but try to remember that within our circle there are plenty of people who are harder, faster, and been through way more then us and it does a disservice to them to act like shit heads while flaunting our brotherhood.

For instance, if marijuana were to be legalized nation wide do you think police would crack down on the gangs pushing heroin, meth and cocaine?  Or would they turn their attention to ecstasy and the research chemicals.

People that smoke weed don't have a habit of shooting at police officers.  Stupid ravers and people tripping balls don't either.  The people peddling the hard drugs, actively involved in gang life do have a tendency to commit acts of violence.  As an officer would you rather round up people who are relatively harmless (in the prone to acts of violence sense) or go after someone who would sooner shoot you than be arrested.  I'll put dollars to donuts that they'd choose the next easiest target.

If he's for real, then it's an interesting opportunity. You can try to make the world better by shouting down and driving off people who do things you don't approve of, or you can take advantage of someone opening up and use it as a chance to learn from them and understand their perspective.

My best friends were involved in things they shouldn't have been and one of my favorite friends was recently shot and killed. I myself pulled out of that lifestyle 10 years ago but not everyone has that option. Some people live in areas where education is poor and the people around them make their money off of illicit trades. They do not have positive influences and the people who live law abiding hard working lives make little more than minimum wage. Their friends are shot and arrested by police, and chances are home life was scary. I as  a child remember the places in the house I could hide where I wouldn't get a busted lip or a black eye. Yet they see people involved in various gang lifestyles who are protected. Who have a ""family"" there (at least on the surface). They make more money than minimum wage and don't have to wear a funny uniform. You talk about these people as if they grew up in a nice suburbia with lawns and loving parents. My current job which I just started 3 weeks ago... ....it's in an area where it's the first time I've witnessed a lawn being mowed in years, I am so used to inner cities.

You say a leech on society, but they serve a purpose.  It's the back end of the life/death cycle.  Nobody gives credit to the flies and the carrion-feeders and the mushrooms that decompose things so fresh soil can grow beautiful flowers.  We all serve our purpose for the species.  And shit, dude probably is on the chain that got me drugs sometime in life, and drugs(weed, really) give me fun times.  Realize it or not, you NEED men like this to juxtapose the self-proclaimed 'good' people in life, otherwise you start tearing apart the good ones looking for evil. It's no coincidence we're grilling cops hard in society at a time when there is no crime.  We ran out of criminals so look hard now at the ones we hired for ourselves.  Blue cotton or Black leather, both sides maintain the line, and are more similar than we admit.  And both sides are needed.  It's those crazy Joker motherfuckers we need to put down, the real psychos, not those that just do a different side of business, that realistically, is not a worse crime that what some bankers do.  AND, leech?  I bet this dude is not on food stamps or welfare.	1	0

-------------------------

Edit. Oh shit, this looks too offensive. Sorry. What I really want to say is that in my mind biker and biker clubs are somehow anarchic, outlaw-y people, more or less agressive. I think you know about such a stereotype.

But as far as I have some talk and invited to real life of a biker, it looks more just like a faggotry without a reason. Like, no one likes that fat boy, but if he puts his jacket on and rides a chopper, he's a hero now.

I understand, that that's somehow true with every other culture/subculture and club theme overall, but you still have to be a Person, not just a Member of some club or movement or culture, to be honoured and respected. And from experience that's just an easy way - buy a chopper, and here you got it everything, plus allowed to be a dirty stinky guy, with never washed hair."	-5	0

When you order food from a restaurant, at least one convicted criminal is touching your plate/food. When you look people in the eye, do you immediately take what you see and conclude opinion, or do you observe and deduce later? I grew up very average. Only child, divorced households, good education, capable athlete. I went to school, got a degree and moved out into the world. I am off. I paid for school, food, clothes, bike payments and held a great relationship with my local community and girlfriend. You know how all of this was done? By selectively choosing wealthy, over privileged, unaware, selfish, egotistical civilians, observing their habits and lifestyle, maybe even interacting with them. Then I break into their personal property and take from those who have more than they need. The blood diamond you wore twice that would otherwise become a worthless, priceless possession paid my bills for three months.
Some of us are smart and stay very low key. Some of us are stupid and leave prints, blood, semen and God know what other basic criminal mistakes at scenes we crawled in through the window we broke. Some of us, the higher class, are people you know. People who pay taxes, and hold jobs regardless. Some do it for money, some for thrill. None of us care what you think. Each criminal has their own reasons. Some are heartless, others kind. We all do what we can with the talents we have. I knew who I was the first time I picked a lock.

And that is taking care of your own and your family. The cops obviously aren't out to help us and most gangs are only doing what rich politicians do now but on a much smaller scale. And most bikers I've interacted with were decent people. The same can't be said for cops and politicians!

If someone asks you to stop or is clearly made uncomfortable by your actions and you don't do anything, then you're just ridiculous. 	6	1

The last one I was working on the lakefront and rode my Honda Spree down to work. On the way home I come to a stoplight and am suddenly surrounded by large grizzly men on Harleys, one guy looks at me and says ""ride with us brother"", I laughed so fucking hard and then proceeded to ride in the middle of this pack for a mile or two. They were all just idleing at 30 mph going down the lakefront while I'm just giving the spree everything it's got to keep up. One of my favorite stories of my entire life. 


Edit: so people usually say "" oh my god, thanks for the gold!!!"".  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it. But I have no idea what it means. Anyone care to enlighten me, am I now your king?"	1491	0

A new mayor promises lower crime rates, and demands it from his police chief, who must, in turn, cook the numbers in order to meet the political demand, if they cannot reduce crime itself. It is easier to keep tabs on a loud motorcycle club, rather than going after the system that creates ghettos. Cops just aren't equipped to do that. But they are equipped with guns, the law, and a motive to make headlines for their police chief, mayor, and the political promises to the people.	21	0

1. When a Riding Club is a ""supporter"" of a 1% motorcycle club, or a part of the ""red and gold nation"", for instance, what is their level of involvement in or contribution to the criminal activity of the 1% MC? 

2. Would being a member of, or a ""friend of"", one of these subsidiary ""supporter"" Riding Clubs associate me with any criminal activity or make me a target for the 1% Motorcycle Club's rival clubs?

3. How do members of serious Motorcycle Clubs view regular motorcyclists? There seems to be a lot of natural camaraderie between regular motorcyclists, waving to each other on the road. Does this extend to the interaction between a regular motorcyclist and a Motorcycle Club? Basically: If I wave to a group of Bandidos, will they wave back?

I think you really have a reading comprehension problem and should get out of this thread. You seem really dumb and incapable of comprehending the information exchange that's going on here.

You're acting like OP is trying to pretend he's some upstanding person. He has been very open about the fact that he engages in criminal activity and uses violence as a common tool.

Quite frankly, you coming down on him like an internet hero is going to do very little to his self-esteem. He will ignore you completely and continue being the way he is. Maybe let people who are actually curious about his lifestyle do all the talking and you go do something that doesn't irritate you as much? Or are you a masochist?

Oh, and newsflash: Being curious about a criminal's lifestyle, and interacting with them, does not mean you ""respect"" them, at least not as an upstanding person. Basic respect should be shown to everyone in a public setting, though (a.k.a. the Social Contract), and you should definitely respect someone who has a gun pointed in your face.

He was riding a bicycle and nearly slammed into my car when I turned right into an intersection. He failed to stop and walk his bike through the intersection as legally required in my jurisdiction (also violating my right of way).

He followed me into an auto parts store parking lot. Identified himself as an Outlaw and told me he was going to kill me. We ""chatted"" while I reached for my concealed carry and only backed down when my wife exited the vehicle and he told her he would kill her too.

Sensing I had lost control of the situation, I apologized (even though I thought and still think I did nothing wrong). We shook hands and he pedaled off.

Do you condone this kind of behavior in your club? If someone nearly injures themselves due to their own error and attempts to hold someone accountable - and claims they'll kill them for it - isn't that misrepresenting your group as a bunch of assholes?

I like bikers. Much of my family bikes and I always check twice for motorcycles and yield to their antics within reason. My 3,000 pound car can wreck their 1,100 pounds of bike and rider far more than they can me - but when a dude on a bike identifying himself as an outlaw aggresses me over his own error, I make preparations to end the threat he represents.

Worse comes to worse - had I ended him - should I expect an unfriendly visit from his buddies?

Edit: I should add that he was on the sidewalk. In my jurisdiction, sidewalk bicycle riders are legally required to stop and walk their bikes through all major intersections. On the sidewalk, you're considered a pedestrian. No walk signal - no right of way."	1	0

This is due to the shower injectors they have in the throttle bodies. When the butterflies are closed, not all of the fuel gets passed and builds up. When the throttle is opened, all that liquid drops into the cylinders and hydro locks the engine. Then you look like an even bigger dick when you stall your bike and can't get it to refire.

They're great on the track or when rolling on the freeway, but when they stop, they need to either keep the butterflies open slightly (basically idling too high and overheating) or rev the engine till they take off again."	1	0

Its used as a simple example to demonstrate the concept of an outlier that becomes an accepted stereotype, implying vocal minority.

Its part of the larger phrase ""only %1 of X is Y, but that %1 accounts for 99% of Z attribute in group X"". Its not meant as a litteral one out of one hundred, but its a figure of speech. There are a lot of %1s. Its sometimes used backwards as ""the 99%"", to imply about the %1

In 1948, the idiom was used by the head of the American Motorcycle Association after a large out of control dance party threatened the peace in Hollister, CA. He assured the public in a press statement that 99% of all bikers are decent ""christian"" types, and its %1 of the biker scene that causes the problems. The next day, the %1 was born. The people who resented mainstream society started wearing %1 patches.

Decades later, a political movement also used the idiom to describe that the top %1 of America wealth wise was resposible for the nation's political woes, by disregarding the ""average"" 99%'er.

a member of the biker %1 posts a question on a website known for its puns, a pun is made."	5	0

I was lucky, and had some employees that welcomed me into their family, and I enjoyed being a part.  But, the family kind of went to the wayside, as folks drifted away for one reason or another.  It was generally as a result of prison, overdose, suicide, bankruptcy, or a combination thereof.

Two are the aforementioned that you described, the third being the legendary stunter.    

This is the guy who might wear a reasonable amount of gear, but he wears it EVERYWHERE he goes. Work, clubs, home, family meetings, hospitals, weddings, the like. This guy also has more miles logged on a motorcycle than every other vehicle he's even driven combined.    

A stunter is the kind of guy who rides his motorcycle when it's pouring rain outside, but he has a roll cage on the front and rear so who cares.    

You might be a stunter if you've woken up to snow and thought ""Eh, it's not too bad, let's put on the chest protector and give it a rev.""     

A stunter is the kind of guy who doesn't just wheelie, he goes up and down doing wheelies all the way to work, back, and everywhere he goes. A stunter knows how to do more than just wheelies, like high chairs, bunny hops, tank splits, skating, the works.    

You might be a stunter if you've gone one hundred and sixty miles per hour and thought ""I should buy a liter bike just so I can break 180."" You're definitely a stunter if you've run from the police on a 600 class bike and gotten away safely.

I don't know what your club may or may not be involved in but I imagine it's real deal. I personally don't give two fucks about prostitution as long as a person isn't forced into it. I also don't give a shit about drugs as long as they aren't sold to kids and teens. I'm just curious if it is at least some what common amongst the 1%ers to regret some of it. Anyways, ride safe out there. 	2	0

What's the deal with all that?  Are these guys usually friends / family, or just random people who want to claim some affiliation?

Seems weird that some outlaw 1% club would like it if some random guy pulls up wearing some ""81 support"" shirt or something.  

Also, do you ever see people wearing SAMCRO (sons of anarchy) hoodies, and go try to scare them just a little bit?  I hope so, because that would be hilarious.

I ride a Honda because I got it (Goldwing basically) for $1,200. It's immaculate basically, but I can't afford a Harley equivalent. I ride, and ride a lot. I'm pushing 8,000 miles a year in WI, and if you know the weather that is a lot. I'm used to the full fairing, and full cargo. I can fit my leathers in one side compartment, all maintenance tools and a 12-pack of beer in the other side compartment, rain gear in the fairing compartments, and a full 17"" laptop (in a backpack not on me), extra jacket, extra gloves, extra clothes, a carton of cigarets, and extra towels in the trunk.
     
I can't ride a Sportster and feel nearly as comfortable as I am on my full-dress bike. I could sell my bike as-is for maybe $3,000. I would in a heartbeat if I could get a full-fairing, full-dress Harley. That's only about $20,000 short. 
    
It's ridiculously expensive to get a Harley that suites my daily needs, and I ride as I said every day I can in my climate. 
    
I love the culture, and am a biker in the sense of someone who rides frequently. I just really can't finance a Harley that meets my needs.

It feels like we're reducing people to our first perception of them without entertaining the possibility that we're only scratching the surface. Doesn't everyone deserve some benefit of the doubt? Loud exhaust on motorcycles can be a good thing; they're tiny and easy to catch in your blind spot. When I was a teenager with a loud car and subwoofers, I'd only be noisy if it were the daytime and I was clear of residential areas. I kept a decibel meter in the car for when I was in neighborhoods and the like to ensure I wasn't being a dick. Also, people do need to have big trucks for the purpose of hauling or going offroad when their jobs, homesites, or lifestyles call for that. People are allowed to have hobbies and the means to fund them, and if they're bothering you, you should say something to them. If they continue, call your local police station and ask them to go out there for noise abatement. That being said; yes, I understand there are some incontrovertible assholes out there, but I'd like to think that might just be our perception of lifestyles and communities that we're unaware of or uncomfortable with. We should try to be open minded. 	1	0

Do you find that the cops are afraid of you? How do civilians treat you, generally, and more importantly, how do biker gangs treat civilians, especially the ones that violate the rules of your subculture? Do you generally take it easy on them, unless they've done something really ill-advised?

What things do the biker gangs do to gain the support of their local communities?

Did the TV show Sons of Anarchy change the way people treat biker gangs and their members in certain ways? Did it force the gangs to change their behavior as well, like do you get people asking you a lot of questions, silly and otherwise?

One more question, what books do you recommend about biker gangs? I've already read Outlaws by Tony Thompson, and that was good.

Also, I always wonder what club members might think of people who only ride around town, don't belong to a club, and don't ride much on the highway.  I ride my bike (Yamaha V-star) to work and back every day, rain or shine, summer or winter.  The only time I don't ride it is if there's ice on the ground.  To me, I ride.

Interstate gets a little clogged for about an hour before and an hour after. Safety isn't an issue as long as you drive like a normal person.

Not sure if news from Australia on how one of our states has made being part of an Outlaw Motorcycle gang illegalis known over therel but in the state of Queensland that is what they have done. Almost overnight the clubs shut up shop, at least visibly, sure stuff still happens and over a year later we still get the odd arrest. It is illegal to wear colours or to have 3 known members or more hang out together as well as a host of other things.

You said ""I'm an old man, and one of those old guys who will just sit and talk your ear off about the weather and apples and my joints. And how back in the day we had it harder than you kids!""   Sounds good to me.   

But when asked about targets on 'your back' you reply ""this is true. This is the point too, its a come and do it mentality. We are either too brave or too stupid to back down. Both really.""  Okay - not my thing but maybe it isn't that bad.

Then, a few comments later, ""We handle most every interaction with people we don't like with violence.""  Well, okay.  Are you going to shoot me for calling you an ignorant asshole?  Because I want to.  

Now this one put me over the edge...  you think you are better than the Crips and the Bloods because, and this is a direct quote:  ""i think deep down that has less to do with their organization and more about my views on them. clubs are pretty much white street gangs.""  So let's add racist asshole to your short list of life accomplishments.  

But hey - I could be reading this wrong.  And as you said, you wanted any questions about your culture to be answered truthfully.  And not by half truths.  You are either the biggest troll.  Or a complete asshole whose very few redeeming qualities are completely outweighed by the 'outlaw 1%er life' that you are so proud of.

He tried to pick fights with club members so he'd get kicked out, but everyone knew what he was up to. So then he pulled a gun, explained that he wanted out, got the gun taken away, was beat up, had the patches taken off and was booted, and that was the end of it.

Supposedly, the book said that when club members are kicked out or even leave voluntarily, not in good standing, the club rolls by their place and takes many of their possessions, since they view it as items gained through the fruits of the club's labor. Since Boone had been with the club so long, they opted not to do this. I think he was able to keep his tattoos too, I'm not sure. Even then, he still ran into rival biker gangs in other countries and got into bad situations. He couldn't hide it."	1	0

Someone close to me (don't wanna specify if someone decides to look me up) has got some friends who happens to be 1% club members. He is not by any means into their activity, he's just a friend to them, but he's been hanging around them (but never at their clubhouse and roundabouts) as a friend chugging beer and so on so forth, but the police are up his ass, and they've actually been hiding in the woods outside our house more than once, and they've also stopped him in his car and in his truck during work with sirens and so on. My someone is just a regular truck driver with a heavy interest in motors and bikes. 

My question is: Do you think the cops believe my someone is actually affiliated with their business, or are they just ""scouting"" the roundabouts of the members to find connections to suspicious activities?

I live in Sweden, so I don't know if the cop routines are different from the US, I mostly abide by the law (I'm just a computer geek with a passion for music, so no reason not to lol), so I haven't really looked into it.

Where as since the 1950's the biker gangs are a small closed easier target that the police can use to prove their effectiveness in different areas (thereby keep their jobs) rather than going after the ethnic gangs that arise from the impoverished areas which would be ""impossible"". 

Not to mention that the ethnic street gangs represent job assurance for law enforcement.  They're going to be a continuing presence that usually has ties within the police force themselves. 

Given the choice the police will always go for the juicy soft targets.
2 decades ago, the police went after the ""ravers"" and the ""organized crime"" that supplied them with the hug drug ""ecstasy"".   That was discovered to be a source of high profile and low risk operations as the ravers didn't generally carry guns and folded into informants quite easily. 
The police LOVED that ... many promotions were handed out as a result for very little personal risk... over organizations  that actively used violence and intimidation to gain profits. "	3	0

Do your brothers feel the same way as you? For a group that prides themselves on physical toughness I'm curious to know your thoughts. This quote jumps to mind from Friday:

""Oh, no, son. That's not the way it is. You kids have been nothin' but punks. Sissified. So quick to pick up a gun. Too scared to take an ass-whipping.

For example, if you hit a pothole with loose hands, the directional velocity of the bike will do most of the work. With stiff arms, one is more likely to jerk the handlebars, jerk the throttle, etc. 

It also depends on the bike. If you're on a cruiser, youre almost at a lounging position, so there really is no weight being put down on your arms. raising the bars exaggerates this effect. If you're on a stretched hayabusa laying on the tank, you fall more on the bars, so thats why your elbows get tucked and lowered. This also takes weight off the bars. 

It's not really something most people consciously think about, your core is really *always* supporting yourself in one way or another. You're just supposed to focus a little more on keeping the weight off the bars"	18	0

I can't seem to find it now (I don't remember the name of the MC), but a few years back I stumbled across a 1%er MC website that actually listed some of their requirements, and they included things like must ride a Harley, be male, and be white.

People join gangs for because of poverty, respect and power. You can't create jobs with police work, you can't create after school programs so kids stay off the streets with police work, and in general you can't change the socio-economic status of a community with police work. But I think biker gangs are at least a problem solvable by police work.	4	0

For the cops it was like shooting fish in a barrel.  I have a strong hunch that most if not all the casualties were from police bullets.

We're a group of guys that like riding, doing charity and drinking each other under the table.

Anyways if we were to wear a 2 piece patch with no affiliation to any other clubs would we get harassed?

I have no issue taking the vest off if asked by a local mc (again we have nothing but respect) but I'm concerned about getting pulled over and beat up simply for being associated with an RC.

Again no affiliation and not out looking for trouble. Some guys are vets, some are drinking buddies with bikes and so on. Basically just a fun group of dudes that like partying and riding Harleys

Is this a product of in fighting and an attempt from one clubhouse to take over the whole region?

Also, would this be a kind of weakness inherent to a group... some sort of inability to be organized and structurally cohesive?

I assume you guys believe that being in one's optimum physical shape is important... how does alcohol help one's fitness?

Also, any ex-military teaching other members how to handle urban setting  gun fights and outdoor survival tactics? Seems like that might be at the top of the list, as well as getting cops/politicians in your pocket.

I also saw a documentary that bike gangs used to be less organized before the 60's, but the american mafia ended up pretty much teaching you guys how to take it more Fortune 500, if you will. Would I be wrong to assume that biker gangs today are closer to La Cosa Nostra today than say... a group of 12 younh african american men wielding gats and waving colors?

Their backs were to me and I saw their club name (can't remember now, known for being a violent offshoot of another, larger club - Ottawa, ON, Canada area), which interested me, but I figure no one like being stared at so I just kept eating while trying to steal glances at the other patches on their vests. 

However, a guy, maybe 18-21 range, a couple tables from me was turning completely around to stare at the two 1%ers. After a while I got the distinct impression that the 1%ers were getting tired of being stared at but were ""behaving"" for the child's sake. My question is, had the child (and woman) not been there, how would that situation have most likely ended?

Also, my uncle like to talk about how one day, maybe 20 odd years ago he had a flat tire on the side of the road when a large group of Satan's Choice went rumbling by, with two near the back turning around. They came up to my uncle, changed his tire for him, have him a nod, and carried on the way they were headed. Is this common behavior among 1%ers? My uncle used to ride a motorcycle and wore a vest with a number of patches on it even when he wasn't riding - would my uncle wearing his vest have made a difference?"	1	0

There had been a rash of killings/deaths in his club. And his closest brother was finally hit and drug behind a semi for about half a mile. It was finally too much. 

At the funeral he took his cut off, laid it on the casket and walked away from the life. 

Mostly for good. He still rode. But he wasn't involved in the clubhouse politics and culture anymore.

There were problems after, he had major concerns that he was going to be killed for leaving without permission or something. I was pretty young, so not sure. But he used to sit in his chair looking out the window in the dark smoking cigs with his gun.

He did that a few months then I think he worked something out and was 'safe'.

Curious if you know if he was actually in danger or if the many years of alcohol and drugs were making him paranoid? He died a few years ago, from Viet Nam related illnesses... so I never got to ask him.

That's my question. Thanks."	1	0

We shoot the shit with him and drank until the rest of the club came, at which point he became their little bitch. My buddy was drunk as shit and making fun of the prospect, loudly calling him a ""boot"" ( Marine Corps lingo for newbie). I could see that the other patched guys in the MC were getting pissed off so I sent a round of double whiskeys over and told my friend to STFU.(I can hold my own but when the odds are 8-2 in a strange bar, you shouldn't look for trouble).
Anyway, my dumb ass friend shut up and bought a round, we drank for a bit, and they wound up telling us we were welcome to come out to a rally. We wound up not going because I was crossing my T's and sitting my eyes working at the embassy. ( You get shitcanned and kicked out of the country for the tiniest little fuckup.)

I've been around people who are affiliated, and they have pretty fucked up views of what's alright and what's not. 

One time, I was at a friend's house while his roommate was doing a deal, and when I refused to join them in doing drugs, one of them described in detail how he would get his buddies to hold me down while he beat me if I didn't join and that he didn't like my attitude (I wasn't giving them any actual disrespect, I just refused to take their drugs). 

After a while, he backed off and tried to play it off like we were cool, but if he had just been a slightly shittier person, or if I had been a little less prideful, that situation could have gone pretty sour. 

I don't disrespect people out of the blue, but I sure as hell am not going to show any kind of appreciation to someone because they wear a patch or color that identifies them as an asshole. "	68	0

Then there're the old guys who don't come around as much, mind their own business but, as much as they want to make fun of the young guys, were that way too. All we can do is explain to them the mistakes they're making, try to show them more productive paths and kind of laugh it off when they don't listen and repeat our mistakes.

When we had an MC in the area, we didn't have much of a street crime problem. We had some fairly rough looking characters hanging around and some loud bikes in the neighborhood at night, but my car was safe on the street and people's houses weren't getting broken into. Yeah, the guys were a little scary looking, but they were generally polite and were also good neighbors. I'm sure they got up to stuff that might cause them to run afoul of the local constabulary, as it were, but I knew I didn't have to worry about walking my dog around the block at night by myself because I would turn the corner and the bikers would all be sitting on the porch. They would say hi and pet my dog and I knew if someone bothered me I could ask them for help.

Since they all got arrested and no longer have a hangout spot in my neighborhood, street crime has gotten quite a bit worse. There are break ins and thefts all the time. Hell, someone stole my little old neighbor's flower baskets right off her porch in broad daylight. I know it sounds crazy, but the bikers actually made the neighborhood safer for us normal people and I appreciated them being around."	11	0

I think 2007 for Spostster and Twin Cam were both the first year for EFI standard.  I have a 2006 Sportster with a Carb, when the bike is cold, you do occasionally to rev the engine to keep it going.  I will blip the throttle to check the carb response right before the light changes, and to get engine speed up.  There are quite a few old Harleys on the road and also there are kits to switch from EFI to carbs, so there are still some out there if you know what to look for.	1	0

I also got a new backpack with a single strap. Again, great around town, but after 12-13 hours it was digging into my neck and uncomfortable as hell. I've done a lot more riding since that SS1000, and I NEVER take a long trip with gear that hasn't been thoroughly broken it. 

With respect to getting a chapped ass, there is a product called MonkeyButt Powder. Dust your ass and undergarments with it before you set off and at stops. Oh, and buy yourself some good bicycling shorts with no seams where you sit to wear under your riding gear.

I think you're misunderstanding what's meant by ""territory.""  They're not fighting over which piece of dirt someone can park their bikes on, or which restaurant they get to eat at.  They mean ""territory"" in the sense that their black market business(es) sell in that ""market"" and those are their ""customers.""  By not respecting the dominant club in an area, that club is communicating an intention to deprive them of business.  

Since black markets operate outside of legal protections (by definition), then all disputes have to be handled by the clubs themselves.  That's not to say through violence (though it does occur), but because you can't sue the rival organization, or call police to report trespass/theft/etc. of illicit goods, there's no choice but to provide their own enforcement and protection.

I'm a 911 paramedic and one time was called to help a dude that was hurt. Traumatic injuries enough that he couldn't ride, at the moment, or really even walk. Circumstances not suspicious, actually seemed like a legit accident not involving motorcycles at all, it just happened to be at a sketchy biker bar in my territory that sits a little bit off a lesser used but incredibly useful highway. Long story short- he was hurt, needed the ER, we were gonna take him, law enforcement was present, they weren't confronting the bikers, bikers weren't confronting them, just super tense and the bikers were worried about their guy and looked pretty ready to hulk out. I asked the hurt guy if it was ok for me to talk to them openly about his medical situation, because legally I have to get his ok, he said yes, so off I went. Saw three 1% patches and a bunch of other ones I don't remember, wasn't really focused on it. Explained everything to them, where we were going, how to get there (they weren't from that area, just staying a couple weeks), my field differential broken down in plain English along with the treatment options available and what both the hurt guy and the bikers could expect over the next 12 or so hours. They were so nice. They called me sir, they shook my hand, they said thank you, they asked what they could do to help, if it was appropriate to visit the hospital, how to get in touch with him at the hospital, bunch more questions, which I answered the best I could. Thing is... I'm pretty obviously gay. Like I'm not a drag queen and I didn't tap dance and explain medical procedures through Broadway musical numbers, there was no glitter involved, but I'm quite obviously a homosexual. They didn't bat an eye. So polite. I even got an arm around my shoulder and got called ""brother"" and ""hoss"" which was awesome. 

Guy made a complete recovery, and when they were leaving town they stopped by my fire station when I was on shift and waited for the ambulance to get back from some other call we were on. They'd got me a zippo lighter, no engravings, because they didn't want to put anything on it that someone else might see and get me in trouble. So I have a normal looking brass zippo that actually is the coolest thing a patient ever gave me. 

Does that sound normal? Are you guys all like that? Seemed like a pretty laid back There was no ""you better take care of him extra good OR ELSE, boy"" stuff that I was expecting. They were honestly the nicest people.

Also, was the lighter to mark me? am I owned now? Lol kidding. "	84	0

They operate (by definition) outside of legal protection and in markets which they have to protect against competition themselves. 

Comcast gets to have a monopoly because of government regulation, and thus they have no concerns about competition.  If anyone started up a new cable tv company in their area, they could sue.  Likewise in the sale of alcohol - the state and municipalities control who can distribute and sell beer, wine, and spirits.  In some cases, their prices are even fixed at a minimum, allowing competitors to sue for ""unfair"" competition.

This is not true for illicit markets.  They have no legal nor police protections for their goods.  Their customers have no protection against bad actors, and nobody can call the police to deal with a trespass or theft.  Thus, they have to provide their own market protection and enforcement.  

The MCs aren't being violent for the sake of violence, they're being violent because it's one of two ways to solve problems with rival MCs (the other being talking).  

Let's pretend that MCs are the source of weed in an area.  Something like 2/3 of the US population has a favorable opinion of it, and only a handful of states permit it.  Thus, the majority of the country has to deal with black markets to obtain it.  Those black markets lack legal protections, and so must sometimes resort to violence to protect their businesses.

How is it immoral to provide something that a great many people want but can't obtain because someone said so?  If you agree that it's not immoral, why would you think it's then immoral to protect that business?"	6	0

Having the patch isn't his proof.  *Wearing* the patch is his proof.  If you flash a fake badge at a cop, you're going to have a bad day.

The scooter motors we work with are pretty simple. Cam on top, two valves, single cylinder, piston, crankshaft, and all the little goodies to hold it together. Instead of a traditional distributor/coil pack they have a stator with a metal drum over it which is turned directly by the crank.

Great timing these 2 posts - last night in Houston a police officer was killed by a suspect when the officer tried to throw tire sticks in front of the suspect's fast moving vehicle. The officer was killed after being struck and or ran over by the vehicle. Later the suspect shoots himself in the head before the cops get to him but the cops rush him to the hospital where his life is saved.  

Early this morning the D.A. announced Texas would file capital murder chargers and seek the death penalty.

Reading between the lines (and if I remember correctly) not so between the lines you are a bit of a racist. Do you think if you grew up today you would hold the same prejudices or do you think growing up, being involved with clubs and in a time where racial equality wasn't a thing yet molded those feelings into what they are?

The VP of a 1%er club (81 supporters) used to come into my old job quite often and I would talk to him. Real nice guy, friendly respectful. We started off  talking about SoA, and ended up talking about whatever was going on when he would come in. He once gave me a business card and told me if I ever needed anything to just let him know. I once bought a bike raffle ticket from him and after that he invited me to a party that the club was throwing. I didn't go, didn't feel comfortable being black and going to a biker party.

3. SOA seems to have started a 1% member Jumpstart but with a lot of wanna bes. Has your club had a surge in wanna be's since SOA?

4. Ever ride any sport orientated bikes? Enjoy it? Scar you? Or eh.

First time drug use feels really good, negative effects afterwards are low. Over time the good feeling lessen and the hangovers increase. A lot of addicts talk about using just to feel normal, not even to get high.

We wanted to show respect to the clubs in our state, so we did months of research and asking around to find out how to go about doing things. By the time we had educated ourselves, we determined that it was likely going to be more trouble than it was worth. After assembling a charter, patch design, colors etc, which we already had done, we would have to approach the dominant club in our home state, Banditos MC, and present ourselves to them in a private meeting. From there, they would either approve, reject or modify our club plans. 

From there I learned about club sanctions that are attached to pre-deterimed support of the dominant club. In other words, a club may give me permission to start my own club under the agreement that I wear a support patch for their club. This support patch may or may not require me to do potentially nefarious tasks when and if I get the call. 

The whole thing was so very involved and orchestrated and governed with so many rules, my head was swimming. There were more rules than running for a state representative. To me, an MC represented the greatest concept of American freedom. Brothers on bikes, nonconformist, counter-cultured, fringe lunatics seeking absolute freedom on the open road. In reality, the MC world is a highly structured, brutally-governed, oligarchy with untold rules, regulations and expectations. Some written, some not. In the end, getting permission to start a club became a philosophical stonewall to our group, so we abandoned the idea. That said, MCs have been around a long time, and the reason why is because of their strict rules and enforcements. If you want to wear a 3 piece patch and be a part of that world, you’ve got to come correct and do it their way. 

My question is this: Even in my state, I see mickey mouse “clubs” riding around wearing patches that I highly doubt were sanctioned or “blessed” by the dominant in a COC setting. These days, are people like that even messed with, or do clubs just look the other way? I’m seeing a lot of sport bike club wearing patches and LEOs even rolling 3 piece cuts with a bottom rocker claiming the state. How do OG outlaw MCs deal with this kind of thing these days?"	2	0

On an injected bike with a re-flash or a carb bike with a re-jet, new exhaust should give you more airflow (and therefore better performance). Same as on a car. Of course, more air in means more fuel in to keep ratios, so you lower mileage a bit... and you get louder. 

A lot of guys just do the exhaust, though, without also changing the fuel mix (reflash or rejet). This makes the bike run lean, hot, and generally makes things worse."	2	0

That...that is an extremely naïve viewpoint on society and the diverse morality of the individuals that populate it. 

It is one thing if an individual breaks rules/laws because they may not know any better, it's a completely different situation when someone just actively chooses to ignore them.

The whole point of their mentality is ""don't like it? Then do something about it, I dare you"".



*Adiamondpatch*
&gt;this is true. This is the point too, its a come and do it mentality. We are either too brave or too stupid to back down. Both really.


Yes you do have every right to use the road just as much as they do, and by the law you are free to pull up and tell them off if you like. 

But on that same note any passerby viewing will probably think you're actively looking to invite trouble or you're a complete and utter moron.

To believe others will obey certain standards just because you do is futile at best. If that were true there would be no such thing as  locks or keys of any kind."	8	0

I am just a regular guy, who does regular things, works a regular job, and have almost no chip on my shoulder. I'm no biker, and don't pretend to be anything that I'm not. But I do recognize apparent injustice when I see it.

Several years ago I became friends with some people who had a group of bikers in their mix. No gang or MC (though they tried to act like it, and some of them idolized SoA to the extreme, to the point of talking about getting matching sweat-shirts printed up and ""hiding bodies"" if needbe). They were all in their 20s, mostly cool/mellow, no criminals. Only a couple of loose-cannons who would brag about going out of town to random bars just to start fights for the fun it it -- I later learned those stories were completely fabricated bullshit to make themselves sound hard-core, and that several people within the group knew they were lies but never bothered to call them on it.

One day at a big barbecue, there was a line of bikes at the street, and my 4yo kid asked to sit on a bike. I asked one of the more approachable fellows if that would be alright and he said yes. I took a picture of the kiddo, and all was good. It was a social event, so shortly after my back was turned for 60 seconds, and my kid decided to climb up on another bike without asking permission. It was innocent enough, but I dealt with it immediately and explained why that wasn't okay, which was probably confusing to the child, but oh well. I figured that was that.

2 days later the owner of that second bike approached me and threatened to kill me for disrespecting him and his bike by letting my child climb on it. I simply could not understand how something so simple, innocent, and trivial could result in one man threatening another man's life. And to this day I still don't. The mentality just seems ludicrous to me. But I digress...

A month or so later, another equally trivial incident occurred, and this man threatened my life again for it. A month after that, I had complimented the appearance of a woman at another social gathering (I can assure you that my compliment was tame, not derogatory or sexist!), and an hour later this same man approached me, hit me, and threatened to kill me for a 3rd time. In hindsight I wish I would have called the cops at this point, but I didn't. After this, I exited from that social group completely, giving up several good friends in the process.

So my haphazard questions are: What is your opinion of what I described? And of this individual, and his mentality? Why do you think he acted the way he did? Do you think I actually did disrespect him in some way and deserved the threats on my life, and if so how? Please explain like I'm 5. Or do you think that this guy is just a pathetic piece of shit? I seriously do not understand his mentality, but I admit that might be a social difference that one cannot understand unless they've been a part of it. But since I've never been a part of it, do you think that I should be subject to it's unwritten rules, or that this guy should've just let it go?

In hindsight, I kinda wish I would've challenged him to follow-thru on his threats, because I know that he wouldn't have. He had no prior record, a wife &amp; 2 kids (and in seeing the boy, he's gonna grow up to be a bully just like his dad, which is unfortunate). So I know it was all talk, despite him having a conceal &amp; carry (which was on him on that last occasion).

In your opinion, am I wrong to think that this man's attitude was grossly pathetic and wholly unrealistic in a civilized world? And in general just plain wrong to have done?

As for anyone else, I'd appreciate only the OP responding here, at least at first. Your other responses can come after OP's.

Respectfully! And thanks for the insight!"	3	0

State police showed up to an annual cabaret saying they had complaints of loud music. Me, a simple hang around at the time, cited the zoning location as being commercially zoned. I informed the officers that our particular zoning code allowed for unlimited noise, as it was to be expected in such an industrial area. State police don't usually know zoning code/laws. They fell for it. They said ""we weren't aware of that. Have a nice night"". They bought it but I was bullshitting. Definitely scored me some credit at the cabaret."	48	0

I get why some posters are upset that we're intrigued and enjoying this AMA, but from my perspective a 1% MC is a criminal organization, but they're not the same as a street gang, like MS-13 or w/e. Their violence doesn't strike me as mindless. They're not out shooting up buses of school children/innocent civilians to send a message. They'd rather keep a good rep within their community to make their lives/""business"" easier, and many give back to their communities and take part in charity events (WBC protest blockades, funeral escorts, toy runs, community bbqs, etc.), which, to be fair, is largely PR, but provides a striking contrast to a street gang. Leave them be, and they'll leave you be. Don't fuck with them, they won't fuck with you. 

If I see a 1% MC riding, or at a bar, or whatever, I'm not immediately concerned they're going to start something with me - they're not likely (IME) to harass a civilian/outsider/whatever going about their own business. They won't target me or fuck with me unless I give them cause to (more often than not). I don't have to worry about them aimlessly shooting up my neighborhood, or that I'll become a target simply by crossing paths with them. Violence, re: 1%ers, seems to be directly associated with ""snitches"", people betraying them (stealing, embezzling from the club, breaking deals, etc.), or things getting heated with rival clubs. Or matters directly tied to their trade(s), which I obviously have nothing to do with. I'm not going to linger in a bar with multiple 1% clubs present, but I also don't shit my pants if I'm driving by the local MC clubhouse. 

Sure, a 1% MC may be smuggling drugs or managing prostitutes or whatever, but it's in their best interests to do it ""clean"" and without blowback. The problem isn't going to resolve with the end to all 1% MCs, so if we have to live with it, I'd rather it be with an efficient organization than a gang that doesn't mind their shit spilling over. Thus, I don't experience ""moral outrage"" over 1%ers, nor do I consider them *as* frightening/problematic as other gangs (as I have no ties to drugs, theft, embezzling, prostitution, laundering, etc). Perhaps the PR is just that good. "	8	0

Also, a couple of buddies of mine have our own little group that we hangout with and they have brought up the idea of making shirts and clothing with similar designs like a biker vest (logo in the middle with our groups name over it).

Granted, a lot of them are stupid douchebags who just want to get some easy power to lord over people, but a lot of people grew up in fucked up homes and communities where doing anything *but* joining a gang was basically suicide.

I've known a few career criminals, and a lot of them are just assholes. But some of them basically just don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to stop being a criminal either because they have no other skills, or they're in so deep that they don't really have any other option than to keep going. I knew one guy who was basically picked up off the streets when he was a young teen, then told by the guy that took him in that he ""owed him his life."" It wasn't a metaphor or anything, the guy basically said he would kill the kid if he didn't help him mule drugs around and hold people up and shit. Few years later and the guy was constantly struggling with addictions and suicidal thoughts because he couldn't see himself doing anything else because he just didn't know how.

I mean, it's fine to be angry at the people who do it for the power or the greed or the simplicity, but there are a lot of people who just kind of end up in the life and don't know how to get out. I don't think that they deserve the ire and rage as much as they deserve pity and compassion."	3	1

Not all religion is bad and not every religious person is running around crashing planes into buildings or encouraging people to bash on the gays or whatever.

Saying all religion is pure evil is like saying everybody who's a biker is a criminal and a murderer.

There are good religious beliefs and followers and bad ones, just as there are good people who rider bikes and not-so-good people who do.

Also, xSociety, I find it interesting my religious remarks are more of a problem to you than a guy saying he's killed so many times that he's gradually deadened his sense of humanity."	-8	1

The atmosphere was very brotherly, I bought soo many drinks for other people, and others bought mine. I'm looking forward to the next!	13	0

But when i was 18 i had one of my coolest moments in my life, there were 2 hell's angels riders waiting at a red light and i was a pizza deliverer with a scooter. Without thinking about the consequenses i drove up between em, looked at them with the biggest exciting smile i could have and waved, they were so cool they pulled up immensely fast on there bikes when it went green, as if they were racing with me

Now did i just get lucky theze guys didnt get mad at me? Might it be because these were dutch hells angels?(i live in the netherlands)

But if we introduce a rule like ""no stealing from other men"". Then the likelihood of being stolen from by another man goes down and everyone can scale back time defending against theft and use more preparing for zombie attacks. Further, let's introduce a rule like ""help other men whenever you can, rather than hurting them"". Now in a population of 1000 men each man has the assistance of 999 men instead of just one. Some men will actually be hurt by this since, depending on various situations, it may be advantageous to break these rules. But on average, each man's chance of survival will increase through mutual assistance. So, one reason why you shouldn't steal my supplies is that our chances of survival will increase if we work in tandem rather then against each other.  "	9	0

I just wanted to say respect and gratitude to you. Good, Bad, or In between, I have seen some amazing things from, because, and around bikers. When I was a kid we lived next door to some 1% ers and there had been some break-ins and a few molestations and rapes in our area. My younger brother and I had gone to sleep playing and the babysitter and my older brother had fallen asleep in the living room watching a movie. A guy opened the window and came in (our room faced the front yard) The baby sitter heard him and came in and the guy took off out the window with the babysitter yelling. 

The guy never made it out of the yard. The Bikers heard the babysitter yelling (they were in there front yard having a few beers) They got the guy and ruined his day. The cops came and took him, they seemed very grateful to the bikers (this guy was a real creepy home invader, when they went through his apartment he had kiddy porn and so forth) I found out years later that my mom's band were regulars at the bar they hung out at. They liked her and she always showed them respect so they watched the house. They even ran off an abusive boyfriend who would not stay away. They always seemed to be decent people. 

I know there is a lot of criminal activity in any group like that, but I will always remember the great neighbors who caught the guy that could have done horrible things to my brother and I. 

Like I said. Mad respect sir. Thanks for this informative AMA. "	50	0

Having a ""1 piece"" patch on the back is safer than a ""3 peice""

Having a 1%er, MC patch or certain colors may be discouraged.

Some clubs require an AMA patch on the vest.

These are encouraged to avoid confusion. If you want to be a riding cub, no one is going to force or ask you to do anything illegal. If it was that common, undercover agents would do it and it would lead to quick arrests. 

If you ask to be a support group, they 100% will task you out.

If I'm at a bar or restaurant or something and my girl friend insults a 1%, what do i do?


How would i become a hang around if i don't ride and don't want to. Just show up and buy drinks or something?

How much if any do you guys help or look out for hang around people?

Lets say I'm a hang around for a while and liked by most members and i accidentally piss off or show disrespect, do i get some leniency?

Kinda along the lines of other questions, if as a hang around a member asks me to do something, can i say no, and if i did what would that mean for me?

If you have never seen me and i stopped to help you in a fight what would you think? Cool guy or disgraceful.

My clothes, more often than not, support sweatshop slave labor. The fuel I put into my car represents exploitation and death in Nigeria (and other areas of the world..). The palm oil in most of my food represents exploitation, forced evictions of indigenous peoples into diminished, impoverished conditions, and deforestation of one of the last largely untouched rainforests.    

Yes, 1% do bad things. They might launder, steal, extort, pimp, traffick, etc. But it's a hydra. Before the MCs, we had the Mafia. If the MCs didn't exist, the street gangs would fill the void. So long as the *demand* is there, *someone* will supply it. Shouldn't those creating that demand be ashamed? 

Interest in gaining insight into the life of a 1%er doesn't necessarily mean it's supported or encouraged. People are intrigued by a romanticized lifestyle (bikers) and the mystery that surrounds it, and this AMA brings a needed dose of reality to it. That said, I'd personally prefer a 1% MC in my neighborhood over a street gang like MS-13, Los Aztecas, etc. Perhaps that's just due to good PR, but I know at least with a 1%er, they won't fuck with me unless I fuck with them.

Your dad is part right. Harley motors off the shelf will idle fine but a lot of people rebuild the motors and throw in bigger cams which control when the intake and exhaust valves open and shut. Bigger cams will have the valves open further and for longer than a stock cam, which is great for making huge power at high rpm, but makes the engine struggle to run at idle speeds.

I've also seen several guys wearing 81 colors in some of the photos after everything went down.	2	0

I live in a small town in NC within and hour or so of Charlotte and there was an Law Enforcement/ATF raid on an AOA building in my town. ATF blew a hole in the wall just for the fun of it during the raid and ended up finding nothing during the raid. There were a couple of local news stories about it but no follow-through because it was just a failed raid.

I drive by this building a lot and see the hole was just covered up by a piece of plywood. I was wondering if you knew of this raid and wanted to know if the hole is still there and is being used as a memory of the raid? If not oh well and thanks for doing the AMA.

At first I wasn't expecting this at all. I won't speak on treatment from the 1% but average riders of all styles of bikes, and the local 99%s all signal to the scooter riders as well. I did finally realize why though. It isn't about the ride, or the power, or the origin of your bike. It is about the fact that you're so naked on the road. Everything around you can kill you instantly with no warning, even at 15MPH on a lazy Sunday driving on a side road. That is where the camaraderie comes from. Riders, always return your respect, and don't be afraid to throw the sign yourself, even if your ride has a weedeater engine on it.	15	0

So for that reason, I'm not afraid of him, or them. Not because they're not scary people, but because I sure as fuck will make an open concerted effort to fully respect them/never disrespect them, etc. And absolutely never join a biker gang that could be rivals.

Luckily for him he had the good sense to quit, sell his bike, and move us to the other side of the Portland area and cut all contact before it caught up to him (I was 5 or 6 so him and his bike and my ""uncles"" are some of my earliest memories). I always knew my dad was not someone to be fucked with, I had no idea that in his former life he was actually a legitimately bad man.  If I'd known at a younger age what I know now I'm not sure how I would have reacted. He's spent the last 25 years as a stand up, upstanding member of the community, but if you knew how he spent his 20s and early 30s you'd never guess it."	66	0

Do you run with the ""biker"" thing because you think it makes you better than someone doing what you're doing in a ghetto? somehow more respectable?

 Likewise if you weren't riding bikes and wearing a ""1% patch"" wouldnt you be a lot less likely to be caught and do time, since you're white and people don't automatically assume you're up to that stuff? "	4	0

The type of biker who actually rides at least every couple of days knows that you set it all up to be comfortable to ride without unnecessary actions like having to rev up every couple of seconds. A comfortable ride usually includes a nice cruise switch on the throttle and either pegs long enough to fit your whole boot or pegs that have a folding part you can kick down and have your heel on.

I thank you for taking the time to share your insights with us.

That said, it's obvious you are a violent man in-the-know, with a background built on experience and participation.  You have insights into the events in Waco, and I expect beyond Waco as well.  I have questions regarding the direction things may go next, and regarding MC culture at large.

[NOTE: I just re-read what I asked, and I realized some of these questions are possibly too intimate.  I post them with no disrespect, but rather a sincere curiosity.  Please skip any that are uncomfortable]

1) You make the claim that LEOs were the first to discharge firearms during the CoC event at Twin Peaks.  Regardless of who shot first, do you foresee a change in MC rules of engagement when it comes to large scale fights with each other?  ...in how MCs react to local police?  ...in how MCs adapt to the expected FLEO (Federal Law Enforcement Officer) and/or Texas Ranger presence to come? (conjecture on my part that higher level authorities will deploy, but not unreasonable)

1b) Do MCs make a distinction between local, state, and federal authorities?  Is there any difference in respect given to a FLEO or Texas Ranger as compared to local/state LEOs?

1c) Do you expect MCs in Waco, or elsewhere in the country, may begin targeting LEOs as some form of retaliatory measure?  Would it matter if it became clear that LEOs did not actually kill anyone during the Twin Peaks incident?

1d) How do you expect MCs would react if confronted by National Guard forces, should the situation arise?  ...or separately, with private security forces (eg: Triple Canopy, Vinnel, Academi, etc)?

2) Are the events in Waco indicative of an increased rash of violence beyond McLennan County?  Can MC-based violence be expected to escalate nation-wide?

3) Will any response be likely from any other criminal organizations (street gangs, cartels, organized crime, etc)?  If so, which ones, and what would you expect to be their response?

4) How would you rate the current health of MC culture?  Are ranks refilled fast enough to replace retired/deceased members?  Can MCs be seen as an enduring force, or on the tail-end of their history?

4b) If MCs are dying out or evolving, what type of organizations might eventually replace MCs, while retaining their heritage?

4c) Following from the previous questions, are MCs being exceeded in capability by other types of criminal organizations?  If so, in what ways are these organizations exceeding MC operational capability?  Are MCs capable of adapting?

5) Do MCs ever conduct operations outside of the United States?  If so, do they take their bikes?

6) Do you see MCs as a positive force in any way to American culture?  If so, what good is produced by MCs?

7) How do MCs feel about the military, fire fighters, federal employees, and other non-LE public servants of various levels/types?  

7b) How do MCs feel towards various professions in society / are their any unexpected biases? (silly examples: MCs hate janitors because they often times wear blue; MCs hate doctors because stethoscopes are basically the opposite of exhausts).

7c) For those who aren't felons, do MC members vote?  Have any run for public office?  Is there any participation in the political process at all?

8) How will other MCs view your AMA here, should they see it?  How will your own MC view your choice to perform an AMA?

9) If given the chance/a free flight and supplies, would the majority of MCs be inclined to go beat the shit out of ISIS?

9b) Are there conversely MCs that would side with ISIS if given the chance?

10) Do you mean to be charmingly disarming at those who have directly criticized you in this thread, or is it natural?  Do MCs have their own PR charm schools?

11) Where did you (and the majority of MC members) learn to fight?  Have you had any marital/combat/tactical training, or is it mostly just improvised?

Again, thank you for making the effort to so thoroughly do this timely AMA, /u/diamondpatch.  You've earned a special place here on reddit thanks to your impressive ability to communicate between two very different worlds, and you've brought to light many questions and misunderstandings in the days follow the Twin Peaks Incident."	40	0

In fact, a society with less social capital and trust might even put him in a better position, he is after all a leech on the products of others so less trust might even make life easier for him. What I'm implying is that his actions and life decisions in many ways are rational, that you should ask yourself why it is rational for you to behave altruistic and empathic (which it probably is) as a part of understanding his decisions.

Being a small town it was basically run by bikers. I was a regular in a bar that had quite a few of the older guys. I remember one night being pulled aside and one guy says to me ""If you ever need help with anything just let me know, we'll take care of it."" I politely responded thanks but no thanks I prefer not to get into any shit and he just laughed and said ""That's why I offered"". 

Fast forward a few years. I had fallen on hard times and took in a crazy roommate just to help with the bills. This roommate was dealing dope and had quite the crew coming and going. I saw some serious shit in those few months. I stopped going out just to play protector of my apartment. 

As odd luck would have it just a couple short weeks after I booted the old roommate out, he and his entire crew all got busted for possession and trafficking. 

It's always seemed just too close for comfort and I think somewhere somehow through the different brothers I had met and befriended that the raid on his little dealing operation was postponed for my safety. "	12	0

oh hell no! 14 hours, and about 30 tons of shit later... you got your $100.

I thank you for taking the time to share your insights with us.

That said, it's obvious you are a violent man in-the-know, with a background built on experience and participation.  You have insights into the events in Waco, and I expect beyond Waco as well.  I have questions regarding the direction things may go next, and regarding MC culture at large.

[NOTE: I just re-read what I asked, and I realized some of these questions are possibly too intimate.  I post them with no disrespect, but rather a sincere curiosity.  Please skip any that are uncomfortable]

1) You make the claim that LEOs were the first to discharge firearms during the CoC event at Twin Peaks.  Regardless of who shot first, do you foresee a change in MC rules of engagement when it comes to large scale fights with each other?  ...in how MCs react to local police?  ...in how MCs adapt to the expected FLEO (Federal Law Enforcement Officer) and/or Texas Ranger presence to come? (conjecture on my part that higher level authorities will deploy, but not unreasonable)

DP: not really no, as much as people think this is not the norm and the fear mongering has started. This is actually pretty normal. I'm sure both sides will reel in their members and let it dry out before restarting, but this is a decades long fued. 

1b) Do MCs make a distinction between local, state, and federal authorities?  Is there any difference in respect given to a FLEO or Texas Ranger as compared to local/state LEOs?

DP: Not really no, i have never dealt with a ranger, but from what i understand they are just state level detectives. 

1c) Do you expect MCs in Waco, or elsewhere in the country, may begin targeting LEOs as some form of retaliatory measure?  Would it matter if it became clear that LEOs did not actually kill anyone during the Twin Peaks incident?

DP: No they will not. that is biased fear mongering to think otherwise. 

1d) How do you expect MCs would react if confronted by National Guard forces, should the situation arise?  ...or separately, with private security forces (eg: Triple Canopy, Vinnel, Academi, etc)?

DP: its not going to escalate so its not relevant. 

2) Are the events in Waco indicative of an increased rash of violence beyond McLennan County?  Can MC-based violence be expected to escalate nation-wide?

DP: this is not really anything new. Did you know that a clubhouse was blown up in this cossacks and bandit war thats going on?
Nope, none of you do, because this is not a new thing going on. This is just the only piece of it that has been in the media. 

3) Will any response be likely from any other criminal organizations (street gangs, cartels, organized crime, etc)?  If so, which ones, and what would you expect to be their response?

DP: no, its not their beef.

4) How would you rate the current health of MC culture?  Are ranks refilled fast enough to replace retired/deceased members?  Can MCs be seen as an enduring force, or on the tail-end of their history?

DP: there are more members of clubs than ever throughout history. And its only growing. Its not the same culture as it was in the past, but its there.

4b) If MCs are dying out or evolving, what type of organizations might eventually replace MCs, while retaining their heritage?

DP: MCs are here to stay.

4c) Following from the previous questions, are MCs being exceeded in capability by other types of criminal organizations?  If so, in what ways are these organizations exceeding MC operational capability?  Are MCs capable of adapting?

DP: yes they are, and they do. 

5) Do MCs ever conduct operations outside of the United States?  If so, do they take their bikes?

DP: yes they do, and no they dont. Do you take your car when going on vacation?

6) Do you see MCs as a positive force in any way to American culture?  If so, what good is produced by MCs?

DP: we are apart of american history. 

7) How do MCs feel about the military, fire fighters, federal employees, and other non-LE public servants of various levels/types?  

DP: nothing against them, we only hold ill will to those who hold ill will to us.

7b) How do MCs feel towards various professions in society / are their any unexpected biases? (silly examples: MCs hate janitors because they often times wear blue; MCs hate doctors because stethoscopes are basically the opposite of exhausts).

DP: no, that makes no sense.

7c) For those who aren't felons, do MC members vote?  Have any run for public office?  Is there any participation in the political process at all?

DP: yes, many of us who are not felons vote.

8) How will other MCs view your AMA here, should they see it?  How will your own MC view your choice to perform an AMA?

DP: This is not my first AMA and the ones who matter in my club know about it and trust me to do what i want. I have been in my club long enough that they know what i'm about and that i'm harder in this club than anyone else. 

9) If given the chance/a free flight and supplies, would the majority of MCs be inclined to go beat the shit out of ISIS?

DP: i dont know. Many of us served and are done serving.

9b) Are there conversely MCs that would side with ISIS if given the chance?

DP: maybe some clubs in the middle east some where, i dont know.

10) Do you mean to be charmingly disarming at those who have directly criticized you in this thread, or is it natural?  Do MCs have their own PR charm schools?

DP: no, i just know that the people asking those questions, or trying to be hard asses would never even dream of doing it in person. So i dont get offended.

11) Where did you (and the majority of MC members) learn to fight?  Have you had any marital/combat/tactical training, or is it mostly just improvised?

DP: I served, so learned to fight in the military. Also I learned to fight by fighting...a lot.

Again, thank you for making the effort to so thoroughly do this timely AMA, /u/diamondpatch.  You've earned a special place here on reddit thanks to your impressive ability to communicate between two very different worlds, and you've brought to light many questions and misunderstandings in the days follow the Twin Peaks Incident.

DP: thank you for reading it!"	83	0

Same. I'm a classical musician so most of the live metal I go to is either tech death or symphonic shit. There was one sixteen-year-old running the wrong way in the pit at the last Dying Fetus gig I went to, but outside of that most folks are just there to enjoy the music and have a good time."	1	0

From my research the 1% grew from the Hollister riot where the AMA (American motorcycle association) said that the riot was caused by only 1% of the large group of people there and that 99% were good guys.

You are treating this guy as if he is filth... you obviously don’t know the fact that 1% bikers clubs put time and effort into the life’s of Americans and other  countries.  For example as said above they have served fighting for your country so show some respect. instead of sitting in your little house playing on the internet thinking you’re a keyboard warrior. 

Also 1% clubs do shed loads of charity work and community engagement it’s not all bad. Yes there is activities they do that are illegal and each to their own if they are caught so be it but think about it like this....

Bankers and stock brokers regularly steal money and cause people to go homeless.  Everyday people you wouldn’t be screaming this abuse at have prob broken the law also...  

How about being a decent human if you are thinking they are below you.. show them what you think is someone who is decent is like and talk respectfully and mannerly to them. I’m sure you will show them.. after all you are the epitome of good in the world.

If you simply google ""human trafficking"" you come up with all sorts of scare stories that imply millions and millions of people being trafficked all the time.

However, if you look closely at the stats.. it's mostly voluntary i.e. people being smuggled from one country to another on their own volition.

It's interesting everyone is downvoting me.  I'm not surprised.  ""Human trafficking"" has become the worlds latest bogeyman full of hollywood supporters, new charities raising money, etc.

However, just TRY to dig deeper past the rhetoric.  While every sane human being finds the trafficking of a person in sexual slavery to be abhorrent, you will find it near impossible to dig out the exact numbers of those ""trafficked"" in sexual slavery vs. those who voluntarily pay someone to go from one country to another.

Then, if you question it online somewhere you get this really bizarre situation I am in now where the response is to try to make the definition of trafficking different from the one the politicians and celebrities use in order to make my question moot.

Edit: I feel I should point out I really want the wide glide because it is such a great american bike which is my biggest draw to it."	1	0

I was on the way to work coming up to this 3 mile stretch of straight road.  I see this pack of 15-20 bikers coming up in my rear view mirror.  So I move off into the right lane to let them pass.  But they follow behind me into the right lane.  There was very light traffic so it says kinda weird.  So I start speeding up.  

I try passing and cutting through traffic but they still are behind me following my every move.  They are definitely keeping their distance though, maybe line 100 back.  But just imagine a whole wave of bikers following your every move.  

After the second mile it felt fucking cool ass shit leading this pack of bikers. Then I turned into my work and got a cool wave to the first 5 bikers up front. "	29	0

Although I'm not sure when u say black and white if you meant a race issue or that it is not a binary situation, if that makes sense. Either way I agree, I don't think gangs have much to do with race, gangs have existed since the beginning of time in all races and cultures everywhere, the common trend being poverty and lack of education in most cases. And in my opinion the easiest way to stop a forest fire is to douse the entire forest with flame retardant aka education and a reliable source of income. Police running around arresting gang members only ensures that they all become dependent on crime as a source of income because once they've been arrested more than once it becomes near impossible to break the cycle since a legitimate job will likely not hire them. This may be elitist of me but I would rather educate as many people as possible and allow the rest to waste away in the life they have created for themselves. Basically just ensure that everyone being educated today avoids this trap and allow the issue to die with those who have prolonged it, I have the same opinion on how to end racism. I know police don't have a huge role in my scenario but regardless of gangs, criminals will always exist because who really wants to work hard for something when there is an easier way? Sorry for the rant but I'm in public health so promoting education is basically my life goal.

Most often, you will stagger yourself a length back and to their opposite side.  Not so much a 1%er thing, more a personal space thing.  I don't know how you're going to ride and you don't know how I'm going to ride and I don't want any shenanigans you pull to be misinterpreted as me joining in or being a part of it.  If you blast off at the light and I'm just cruising, I don't want that cop over there to tag us both for racing or whatever (this has happened to me before by the way).	45	0

The story is that it's about a quote from the American Motorcyclist Association that 99 percent of motorcycle riders are law-abiding citizens. This in response to gang activity in the mid-1940's. 

Thus implying that 1 percent of motorcycle riders are 'criminals'. These days it mostly means they stick to themselves and generally don't like authority. 

So identifying as a 1%'er means they have a certain mindset about authority, fitting into 'normal society' and obeying laws. That said, many supposed 1% clubs are just nice upstanding citizens anyway, but they like to be a bit rebellious at times. They just like the bad boy image. "	1	0

He seems comfortable and honest with himself and isn't an asshole even when people are insulting him. 

Something to consider: there are thousands of people out there that look and act normal that fuck children, scam innocent people out of their hard earned money, abuse their spouses, children and employees; and some that use their position of trust and authority to take advantage of others. I would argue that these people, some who you likely know and respect, are more of a drain on society than any thief, brawler or drug dealer could ever be. 

Some are ever police officers, judges,  and politicians. 

More than half the girls I've dated have told me about being abused as a child, and it was all at the hands of seemingly normal people, some even family members. None of these men have ever been punished, despite some being turned in.

Tl;Dr there are way worse people hiding in plain sight that are easy worse for society than thieves and drug dealers.

I'm military and live in San Antonio where they pretty much tell us all the time that we're rife with Bandidos.  I don't know what the hell they look like compared to other biker gangs, so I just trust the briefer.  I had come from base (thus in uniform) and went to the park to pick up my wife and infant son and I see a *large* group of bikers (50 or more) grilling it up on the park-provided grills.  They all had black kuttes (I just learned how to spell that word, just now, in this thread), and all had grey t-shirts underneath them.  I didn't check the patches but there was no color but silver/grey in any of the design.  We go right by the outer edge of the gathering.  One of them looks me over and then starts waving me over to join them.  It seemed friendly enough.  I was alright with it, but my wife thinks I'm an idiot.  She points out that they weren't inviting anyone else despite dozens of others nearby so she thought we were being 'targeted' for something.  We ended up saying 'thanks, no' and driving off without event.

What's your take here, though? Was it the uniform, the baby, the fact that we didn't seem afraid while everyone else was fifty or more yards away, or what?  Depending on the club, was I moments from losing my wife to a prostitution ring?  What's the over/under on if I had stayed and schmoozed a bit?"	1	0

Many, many moons ago in Houston, I was trying to get the carb on an old TC185 to behave itself. I was an 18-y-o pipsqueak (now a 50-y-o pipsqueak). 

Finally think I have it working and take it onto FM1960 (very busy 5-lane [at the time] road). It's running fine for the mile or so it takes to get there, so I decide to go for it. Open it up and.... blerg

On the shoulder tinkering and inventing new cuss words when a car pulls up. Good Samaritan walks up and asks if I need help. I say no, thanks and explain the situation. We're chatting as I work when we hear a *ROAR* getting louder.

I look up and see 5 Angels ride by in the far lane. Few minutes later and the *ROAR* gets loud again. They'd pulled a u-turn on a very busy road. 

My brain is now freaking out. I'm on a bitty enduro rice-burner. That ISN'T RUNNING. ""OHSHITOHSHITOHSHIT"".  

*CLOMPCLOMPCLOMP* heavy boots approach from behind. I'm trying to make myself very tiny and disappear. 

A big voice booms out, ""Hey, brother! You need some help? This guy didn't *hit* you, did he?""

I turned and looked to see the other 4 had surrounded the cage driver, and said driver standing in a puddle bigger than the one I'd made. 

""No!  No no no! He didn't!"" And went on to explain what was up.

""Okay, brother! Peace! Be safe!""

*CLOMPCLOMPCLOMP**ROAR* and off they went. 

I feel absolutely certain that if I'd said ""yes, he did"", I would have seen Death right there on the shoulder. 

It was then I learned that most of the time it's not what you ride, it's that you ride at all, and that anyone on a bike (except maybe squids) is a Brother. At least until proven otherwise. "	5	0

When I was 8 years old, my family visited Key west. Coincidentally, the Hells Angels were in town as well, we stayed in a campground and so did they. They were the nicest group of people I've ever met. Us, being from PA, were shown how to open coconuts, and were lead to the awesome parts of the water to see the awesome fish. A group helped my sister learn how to swim and my folks and them set up a BBQ and we all had a great time! 

I was t-boned by a guy in 2007 while riding my new (to me) little Shadow 700... The first person to stop and help me was a guy in an ""Outlaws"" kutte. I never caught his name, and I have kept my eye out for him at the various shows to thank him, but never saw him again. I owe that man some beer!

In 2009 I began teaching motorcycle classes in FL. I've had so many pissed off guys come in from the different clubs because they  were required by the courts to take the class to get a ticket reduced or to keep their license. Nicest people as long as you treat them like people, ever. 

These are just a few. I have read your AMA and your responses, and I'm quite familiar with ""you gotta do what you gotta do to keep your family taken care of..."" However, Like the examples above. In what ways have you surprised people by not being what the media makes you out to be?"	1	0

My dad was a biker, and I've been riding my entire life, but I didn't want to 'live the life', so I didn't join any clubs or anything. 


Fast forward to 15yrs ago, and suddenly 'Biker' takes on a while new meaning. Now it's all retired office workers, taking part in the largest LARP known to man, buying 40,000 dollar 'custom' bikes, and never turning a wrench.

I know I'm way late to the party, but it's cool to see someone giving out factual info. I grew up around the angels. My dad wasn't a member but was very close friends with several members. I think he was looking at joining but never really said one way or the other. I remember hanging out at the HA club house throwing balls for the huge rottweilers. Big cuddle bears... until someone they didn't know walked past the fence. This was back in the midwest(Northern Illinois) during the height of the HA/Outlaws feuding in the early 90's. We went to all of the Easyrider rodeos in the area among other smaller runs/events.  I saw all kind of fucked up shit. I saw more tits and pussy before I hit puberty than most 40 year-olds as well as dudes getting the fuck beat out of them and one guy get hacked with a machete up in New Glarus, WI.

One of my dads best friends had a bomb set up in his shop when he opened the door in the morning. He lost one of his legs and half of his arm. Dad pulled back a bit after all of that went down. Never stopped riding but kind of disassociated with the club. I still love riding, but I'm not really involved in that culture. I have a few friends who are but I have a somewhat addictive personality and an often short temper. I could see myself getting into a lot of trouble, so I make the smart decision to stay away from all of that. I definitely understand the culture though. Best of luck, brother. Stay safe. "	3	0

Then Lucas, in an effort to preserve the loner hero vibe of the protagonist, CHANGED the scene in the rerelease to show Greedo firing and missing just before Han shot and killed him.

The whole 'Greedo shot first' story is just a cover up by a director trying to make a character something he isn't.

Han Solo killed Greedo by taking the only shot in the original release.

Though, one could argue that Han feared for his life because Greedo did have him at gun point. I know if I were in Han's position, I wouldn't wait to see if the Bastard pointing a gun at me will shoot and kill me. I have to assume that's his intention because he is pointing a weapon at me capable of ending my life.

So if what I'm understanding is correct, you're saying the cops started the shootout in Waco by shooting first? This doesn't make sense because at the time of the shootout, there were no cops involved. It wasn't until after the mayhem that cops were able to respond."	1	0

I tried to hide it, but when they found out all the guys (even the instructors) just laughed and told me I should stop by the bar there on site and have a beer with them. They didn't care what I rode, as long as I rode.

Also, about all you see where I live are Harley's and crotch rockets and the Harley guys are always so nice and chill - I'll be in my full race suit in the mountains with my crotch rocket, stop at the local motorcycle place for lunch, and it never fails that I'll get a group of Harley guys that offer me a beer and just want to shoot the shit."	2	0

Wow never thought of it that way. Yeah that could be a problem as the owner. In Australia, a few years back the government just made it a crime for any person wearing club clothes to be in the vicinity of a bar. Might be a liberty violation, but it sorted out the issue real quick! I used to go to the closest, seediest bar after work which was full of bikies and fights. I'd say it was cleaned up within 36 hours of the law coming into effect. Probably less. The joint was refurbished and made family friendly in no time - now packed with hundreds of business suits daily and kids in the bistro at night. I can only assume the bikies had to retreat to their clubhouse for a drink. In fact in Queensland, it is illegal for bikie members (wearing colours or not) to even be in each other's presence. You and your brother are bikies? They will arrest you for gathering at the parents house for Christmas."	6	0

1. Bring a gun. Preferably, bring at least two guns. Bring all of your friends who have guns. Bring their friends who have guns.

2. If you can, make friends with those on the crew served weapons. Bring them as well. Borrow money from them, it gives them an added incentive to protect you.

3. Anything worth shooting is worth shooting twice. Ammo is cheap. Life is expensive.


Also 20. Applies to any fight: The faster you finish the fight, the less shot you will get.

I don't know if you still steal motorbikes or regret doing it but I'd just like to say that a lot of the people in this thread are sucking up to you because you've come across as a genuine guy with a decent sense of humour. However, as someone who has had 2 motorbikes stolen, I've often wondered about the type of person who does such a thing. If I found out that whoever stole my bikes were junkies selling them on for a fix I could kind of live with it, but someone who supposedly loves bikes and revolves their lifestyle around them? You supposedly know the joy and sense of freedom that owning a motorbike gives you, yet you were willing to take that away from someone else for your own pleasure? You're not a biker, you're a fucking criminal and don't kid yourself. You may ride bikes and be in a bike club but anyone that can fuck with someone elses bike that they worked hard to earn doesn't truly appreciate or deserve one. "	13	0

It is commonly used to describe a white supremacist.  Also, the 1%ers are members of the Outlaw Motorcycle Club. And...

&gt;Outlaw motorcycle clubs reflect their social roots and the demographics of motorcyclists in general[citation needed]. High profile outlaw bikers have historically been white and their clubs are typically exclusively racially homogeneous.[49] Other sources state outright, that ""With few exceptions, blacks are excluded from membership or riding with one-percenter biker clubs.""[50] The average age for a club studied was 34.[51] There are black gangs, white gangs, and Mexican and other Spanish-speaking gangs. Although race does not appear to be important as a creed or philosophical orientation to them, virtually all of the clubs are racially unmixed.[citation needed] Bikers in American prison, as prisoners generally do, band together along racial lines.[52][53][54] It is claimed that racial discrimination within clubs has led to creation of rival clubs in past, such as the Mongols Motorcycle Club after members were rejected by the local Hells Angels chapter.[55] Some clubs or individual chapters are now multi-racial, but the number of ""white supremacist biker clubs are growing nationwide"".[56][57]

Years ago I was violently attacked with a knife, raped, and beaten by an acquaintance of my then roommate who broke into our house while she was out with her boyfriend, a 1%'er in the dominant MC here.  They got back soon after the attack happened and her boyfriend never said a word but a few days later he when he came to our house, he told me not to worry, that the guy was gone, that he'd been taken care of.  I didn't ask what happened, but the guy who attacked me was never heard from again by our circle of friends.

I know diamondpatch already gave the big answer to this but to expand on why gang units focus on biker gangs early on.  Most largescale motorcycle clubs follow a predictable pattern when they are setting up a charter.  They will move in a ""puppet club"" (a smaller, less recognizable name that is usually off the radar of the big gang units) and have them establish a medium sized charter which they can later patch over to the big club when they have a strong enough control over the area.  

In your city's case, they are in the early stages of establishing the puppet club who may later be patched over to HA.  Your local gang unit is focusing a lot of attention on that handful of guys because they are trying to prevent a much larger long term problem."	2	0

ALWAYS LOOK before merging. 

When making left turns, LOOK for motorcycles so you don't cut them off and have them T-bone you.

Give us plenty of space. You know how they say for every 10mph you are going, there should be one car-length between you and the vehicle in front of you? Yeah, actually follow that. DONT tail gate a bike, it's just going to piss off everyone involved, and I *have* kicked a cars door, leaving a huge dent, as it had just been tail gating me, then sped around me (I was already speeding, so dude was just being a dick). He looked at me in shock, freaked out, and just kept going. By the way, in my state, open carry is legal. I ride strapped, so everyone can see.

Don't pass a speeding bike. Why would you, to show off? Well, enough people do/try that I feel I should mention it.

If a bike is passing *you*, don't speed up to prevent it. This can cause accidents and anger.

Try not to stare at bikes, because your mind tends to steer you towards what you're looking at. 

If you see a scooter going 40mph, don't try to go around them like it was a bicycle. Even 50cc scooters that don't need to be licensed have the right of way, and when they are in a lane, they own that lane. I had a friend killed riding his scooter because someone tried to speed around him and instead hit/dragged him.

And finally, THANK YOU for actually asking what you can do to make the roads safer for everyone on them."	2	0

Street gangs are jut thugs hanging out on the streets, slinging some drugs and that's really it. Sure they get into fights with each other but it's pretty much limited to their area and their group. Biker Gangs tend to be into organized crime, they will move drugs, guns, etc. Biker gangs are much more like dealing with the mob (With a touch of extra violence) than street gangs. 	1	0

The difference between a reason and a justification is that the latter states why something *should* happen, and the former states why something *does* happen.

Myth 2: Loud Pipes Save Lives
Yeah, there are a few situationslike where you are right next to a driver with his window down who is about the to change laneswhere full-time noise-makers might help a driver notice you, but all that noise directed rearward doesn't do much in the most common and much more dangerous conflict where a car turns in front of you. Maybe it's the fatigue caused by the noise, maybe it's the attitudes of riders who insist on making annoying noise, or perhaps loud bikes annoy enough drivers to make them aggressive. Whatever the reason, the research shows that bikes with modified exhaust systems crash more frequently than those with stock pipes. If you really want to save lives, turn to a loud jacket or a bright helmet color, which have been proven to do the job. Or install a louder horn.

Shoulder checks are my friend, I'm always doing them, sometimes 2 or 3 before changing lanes, just to be sure.  Though, I'm not sure how I would be t-boned by a bike while making a left - I suppose if the bike was in the opposite flow of traffic, but that's just common sense: vehicles coming, don't turn. - I'll look extra carefully for this, and make it a habit.

I'm always trying to give bikes extra space: mainly for the fact that if my bumper touches your wheel, at all, there's a good chance someone is going home in a body bag.  I don't want to live with that; and bikes can stop, really fast.

Open Carry, and even concealed carry, is permit only here (I'm in Canada), and the only people with permits are essentially the police; though, I don't blame you for riding strapped, since most people are jerks.

I make it a habit not to pass anyone going the speed limit or more.  We're already 'breaking the law' and going faster than we should, why would I need more than that? (not that I ever speed. ever. I never do. *looks around nervously*)

&gt; If a bike is passing you, don't speed up to prevent it.

This happens? seems moronic.

&gt; If you see a scooter going 40mph, don't try to go around them like it was a bicycle.

Even with bicycles, I try to pass them as though they are full-sized vehicles.  If I can't put a full cars-width between the curb and where I need to drive to pass, I don't pass.  I know not everyone does this, **BUT THEY SHOULD!**

&gt; if you live somewhere that allows filtering,

What is this? I don't know what filtering is.  Obviously, we don't have it where I am, otherwise I would know what it is.  Would you be so kind as to elaborate on this for me?

Other points:

&gt; Please just put down the phone.

It's illegal where I am to use a ""handheld electronic device"" while driving, and I understand why.  I've seen the ""texting and driving"" dashcam footage from teenagers who do it, then crash into guardrails and stuff.  Not cool.  Fun fact, the laws that make it illegal here don't differentiate between driving, while in motion, and ""driving"" being temporarily stopped at a light.  So you can get a ticket for texting at a red.  The vehicle needs to be ""legally parked"" (in PARK) to allow the driver to use their cellphone.  This can mean an emergency stop, but now we're splitting hairs.

&gt;  use your head. Don't just glance at your mirror, but turn your head and quickly check the blind spot before changing lanes.

Shoulder checks.  Taught at all driving schools in my area. Always a good idea. I try to do these without fail, though, sometimes, I just simply forget, then beat myself up for the next 15 minutes going ""I should have checked! WHY DIDN'T I! nobody was there this time, but there could have just as easily been someone there!"" - needless to say, I infrequently forget.

Carb'd bikes aren't always. For example, my '06 FXST was tuned at about 80F, and as such, will idle smoothly down to about 60F. However, when I ride in the 30s, if I stop at a light for longer than a minute or two, my bike will cough and sputter unless I blip the throttle after about 30 seconds. (Hence why I want to replace my idler screw with a thumb screw so that when it gets balls cold, I can re-adjust the idle).

That would be a huge breach of civil liberties here in the US if the government tried to limit when and where people could meet just because of a group they are affiliated with. Its our very first amendment in the constitution that you can assemble when and where you want, and things like clothing (wearing club clothes to show who you are affiliated with) is protected under freedom of speech. Say what you want but I would rather the government not have the ability to strip citizens of their rights even if it does mean a few thugs can go around being criminals. If the government here in the US ever tried to pull some shit like that I would be standing right beside those thugs saying hell no.   	13	0

Because motorcycles accelerate so much faster from a stop, it actually cuts down on congestion.  However if a biker is stuck behind cars trying to accelerate from a stoplight it can actually take longer because if someone doesn't pull away smoothly and evenly, the bike may have to come to a stop to keep from losing balance and falling over.  In ""stop and go"" traffic I actually wait a bit before moving just so I can be sure that I won't have to put my feet right back down if someone ahead of me isn't pulling away fast enough."	2	0

The bike is going forward, you are on their right attempting to make a left to go in the opposite direction the bike is coming from. Basically cutting across oncoming traffic to get into the outgoing traffic side. 

Yeah, mostly younger people, but from time to time they think they are being cool by speeding up, or want to test their car against a bike, so they make it hard to pass, and you can't be sure if they are going to tap your back wheel when you merge. Especially dangerous on the one lane (in each direction) country roads I love so much.

And with scooters, yep, treating them like a car is the right thing to do. Unfortunately, a lot of scooter riders act less than confident, and will ride the shoulder to let traffic pass. This is *very* dangerous for the scooter rider, and every time I see one in traffic, I make it a point to catch up with them and make sure they know they own their lane, and are likely to be hit if they ride the shoulder. 

Thanks again for being a safe driver :)

I flipped a safe (but definitely illegal) U-turn because I was sure he went down the embankment. He went down the hill and spun a few times, then as I stopped and started to get out he drives up to the hard shoulder, stops, checks traffic then speeds past me as he gives me a thumbs up.

Dear God, I can only imagine what that man was thinking/not thinking. I'd be curious to hear his thoughts during that whole event. 

Why does it seem there are never officers around when there's someone so obviously inebriated on the road? No, instead I get a speeding ticket, while the drunks are taking people out left and right. I hate to say it, but I wish alcohol didn't make the body so loose and able to come back from wrecks like this. If someone is going to be that dumb, the only one who should get hurt is their own stupid selves.

I have police flashers in my car (for legitimate reasons), and I can't tell you how many times I've 'pulled' someone over, called the cops, then waited until an officer was on scene. "	2	0

The reason it was popular in Japan was because when the country was poor beef was very expensive and was a delicacy. Whale however was very cheap. In schools for lunch they were fed whale meat.

In a press release some years back, if memory serves correctly, the president of Harley Davidson was trying to correct the 'outlaw biker' image of the motorcycle in general and the Harley in particular. He said that only about 1% of Harley riders are criminals, and that the Harley itself is just a classy bike for everyday people. Criminals latched onto it, and started calling themselves 1%'ers. As I understand it, from members of a local MC chapter that is definitely not a 1% club (they patch sworn LEOs), one must have been convicted of a crime committed for the clubs benefit to wear the diamond patch. Someone correct me if I'm mistaken. 	3	0

What I'm curious is how frequently do you or other members of your clubs travel to other countries to meet up with members of the same club? How difficult can it be?

I am sure there are no rules dictating what you are allowed to wear when going into certain establishments (other than maybe health codes like wearing shoes/shirts or something like that). If there is then it would be easy to argue that clothing constitutes free speech, (off the top of my head I can think of Cohen v. California and maybe Tinker v. Des Moines as precedent on clothing protected as speech, though admittedly they are a stretch in this specific case) And there is no way there is a law that says people associated with a certain group cant congregate (unless its something like a group of pedophiles can't get together for a nice day in the park or something). If there are laws like that then they probably just haven't been challenged yet in the courts, and it would just take a lawyer to fight it.	5	0

They are a part of a strongly-bonded group that gives out positive reinforcement for violent actions. Their fellow members probably are fighting alongside them when they're beating someone and patting them on the back when they kill them and then helping them evade the law if an investigation starts. These actions serve to further strengthen the emotional bonds between them and a sense of indebtedness towards each other, so violence is rewarded and becomes ingrained in their lifestyle and group dynamics. Most of their energy is invested in supporting each other and their habits and the club, allowing them to detach themselves from the people that they hurt and the societal norms that condemn violence. It becomes an Us vs. Them mentality. It would be very difficult to remain a valued member of a club like that if you sympathized with your victims (or ""opponents""), so you would both consciously and subconsciously learn to desensitize yourself. The culture of violence just keeps reinforcing itself. "	4	0

Anyway he denied any affiliation to any clubs even with the HA stuff in his windows. He was old, heavy and needed a cane. He said he lived somewhere south (can't remeber exactly where ) but he lived in a mostly black area with alot of crime amd gangs.  He said the stickers and stuff keep them from fucking with him.

Could he have been telling me the truth? Or was he also affiliated and just didn't want to share it with me. He was a very nice fella if I might add.

I'm also law enforcement btw. I see a fair amount of guys from clubs and have never had an unpleasant experience. Like I tell the newbies, just treat them with respect and you get it back. They know how it works and are never dumb enough to actually cross a border with anything illegal. "	1	0

For fuck sake, if you *really* have to know where I stand on this, then allow me to state that with a few rare exceptions, I hold almost nothing but outright disdain for the majority of modern military members as a matter of principle. 
In my eyes, with the now nearly unheard of exception of targeting those ever illusive *actual objective military threats*, the moment you leave your country as an invading, occupying, or intervening force, you've ceased to be solider altogether. At that point, when you're no longer *defending* your home, you become a mercenary, almost universally defending the financial interests of a select few individuals in exchange for a small portion of money for yourself.

But you know what? I *didn't* add any of that shit to my reply. Why? Because he didn't *ask* me any of that shit.



Never mind the fact that there's simply no need for me to pick a fight with a bunch of ex-service members who joined up straight out of highschool, too young to think ""hey, maybe I should dedicate a month or so to researching and understanding the vast and varied intricacies of this intercontinental conflict -which has been raging in one form or another since the nineteen fifties- *before* I sign up to end the lives of strangers over political ideologies which I don't really understand"".  
There's a time and a place for such discussions, one where the details and rationalities behind diametrically opposing sociopolitical opinions can be carefully laid out and debated with a cool head and rational outlook, so that at the very least everybody can go home at the end of the day knowing *why* those who disagree with them disagree with them.

As your incredibly thinly veiled attempts at goading and guilt-tripping (because apparently you decided I was a solder somewhere down the line, as opposed to the other four professions I listed) illustrate, *this is not that place*. 

&gt;Nope, simply disputing the fact that you think it's okay. 

No, *I'm* disputing the fact that I think it's okay, on the basis that I've made no statements which indicate I believe any such thing.

*You*, on the other hand, are disputing the *notion* that it's okay. 

&gt;You appear to feel like it's our duty to hurt our fellow man, or at least that's how you came across to me and that's what prompted my initial comment.

Yet still you refuse to actually quote whatever led you to believe this, dispute being asked now for the third time.

&gt;our opinions on what humans are supposed to be doing differ completely

That's more than a little presumptuous. You sure you don't want to, you know, wait for me to *state* what I think humans are supposed to be doing? Perhaps consider *asking* me?

You see, unlike yourself, I actually happen to draw a bit of a distinction between the way the human body and mind have been shaped by millions of years of hunting, fighting, and killing things on a daily basis simply to eat, and what longterm goals we should collectively be striving to achieve as a species *today*.

And whether you like it or not, the fact of the matter is that instincts and social mechanisms which our bodies retain from the past *does* have an enormous impact on human behavior in the present.

&gt;You said humans were built for violence, I said we're not, a soft blow to the head in the right place can kill any one of us.

And any any one of us can deliver a soft blow to the head.

Humans didn't become the single most deadly species on the face of the Earth by loving everything around us. As much as we might like to think otherwise, we exist as a result of a legacy of conflict and violence.  
Maybe *you* perceive acknowledging that indisputable scientific fact as avocation that we should continue on that path, but me?

I perceive it as the answer to the bloody question the man asked. "	2	0

I recently got escorted out of chicago by a motorcycle gang to get a ride to my family! It was such an insane experience. My stepdad is a Preacher, and has a motorcycle ministry. He does bike blessings, and is respected among the 1%ers. My question is, how do you guys find a medium with police when traveling together? It was a terrifying and awesome experience to see 70 bikes all in formation via pairs. And every 10th pair, there was a bumper on the side to mediate traffic. All of the license plates were blocked out. For every street light, the bumpers would stop traffic so everyone stayed together. It was such a sight to see! No cops stopped us, but they definitely knew what we were doing.	2	0

My thought, though, is that while he may be a thief and he may be dangerous, he's not *bad*, nor is he dangerous to the general public. His comments are along the lines of ""just enjoy being who you are"" and are indicative of a person who means no harm to anyone unless he himself is at risk. Beyond that general character analysis, it's a peek into a world few people ever experience  - a world of freedom and rebellion, two things that capture the hearts of the people. Your rapist comparison is off base because hearing from one wouldn't offer a glimpse into any other world, nor could they claim to be anything other than dangerous to the general public.     
    
Stealing doesn't hurt anyone, and from the sounds of it he doesn't hurt anyone who doesn't basically challenge him to. I don't steal, and I don't like motorcycles. He does. There are many worse people out there, most of them less willing to accept that they're bad and *far* less willing to offer a good-humored alternative viewpoint to the general public."	-1	0

Even during the prohibition the mafia made most of it's money from money lending... and Olive Oil, not from drugs, alcohol, or extortion. Literally over 70%, and even today it's said to make up well over half.

I mean even in the media they don't hide that drugs and alcohol were a relatively small thing, look at The Godfather for instance. The Corleone front is the Corleone Olive Oil Co., and Vito rose to power in the Olive Oil Wars. Michael is sent to a Don who owns an olive orchard to hide, and Vito grows up working on one.

In fact for a long time American gourmonds *weren't able to tell* what ""real"" extra virgin olive oil actually tasted like because they were so used to having cut oil (they made their money, and still make it, by either ""cutting"" oil with vegtable oil, or by buying low-cost Tunisian or Greek oil, smuggling it into Italy, then exporting it as premium EV Oil).

If people really only do things for the fear of consequences then I'm very sorry for them, they are unable to process that other people are human too and deserve what you expect of yourself, and ultimately are fundamentally limited in the scope of their life. 

The best moral guide for me is ""Would I understand if that happened to me?"", if the answer is no, then I wouldn't do it. Not whether I like it or not, but whether I understand. 

Law!=justice!=morality, they are all distinct and separate things, I don't fear a lawless world, I feel for those that live in a world solely controlled by those more powerful than them, in a literal sense. 

If you want to talk philosophers then you can't ignore the fact that in Plato's Republic Socrates is fighting the idea, being introduced by the Sophists (Callicles especially), that immorality is a virtue or that  it is just, as it allows the strong to exercise their natural right to exploit the weak.

Like, your daughter marries an accountant.  Does he know about your lifestyle?  Does he get invited to the club for beers?  Part of this question is prompted by the weird overlap of your life that maybe lingers on the fringes of legality/respectability while your daughter and her accountant husband are going to black tie fundraisers, raising money for the opera (either way, congrats on raising a daughter.

We were the only ones that would help, they were turned away everywhere else.

That said, I was scared to death, and horrified by the way the women that showed up were treated. However, the women were there voluntarily, so there's that. One time, the cops wanted to come and do something, and we said no. Not the time or place, because they weren't investigating, they just wanted to collect information. 

My question is, how are you treated by local non-biker business people? Are you ostracized, or treated with respect? Do you tend to not try and perform criminal acts against those service businesses that help you? 

And, as a lone female, if I were at a bar, should I be afraid of you? I'm not a bitch or a flirt, but I might look at you and smile, just because that's the way I am. If you said something, I would reply, but not flirt or be rude. (I end up in places where I appear to be unescorted, although I am not. I have no control over where I am, as it is work related.) 

Also, it isn't the Harley people, but why do gangs of motorcycles go so damn fast on crowded highways, and almost cause accidents? It's usually crotch rockets. This bugs the crap out of me. I saw my brother rot in a nursing home due to a head injury, and I just want to shake these people and tell them it isn't just themselves that are hurting.

Do you wear a helmet? What happens if you go from one state to another, where laws are different? 

How do you deal with the bugs? You said you have a windscreen, but it's Texas....

What's the funniest thing that has occurred due to you being an outlaw?

The shell, which is anything from plastic to fiberglass/lean.  Expanded polystyrene foam in higher end with differing densities or styrofoam in lower end. Pads for fit which changes the way the energy is dispersed from a crash, a loose helmet is just as bad as no helmet, and straps/visor materials all make a helmet different. Along with different safety ratings, there is snell, dot, ece, and many more every country has their own standard. Snell is an unaffiliated safety rater that is a foundation for cyclists (motor and non-motor) that was started up in order to make helmets safer and up the bar on safety ratings.


Hope that answers your question. I spent a lot of time researching for a good helmet on a budget. I have a Scorpion that I got for 180 which is a company that's philosophy is to make good helmets for low cost. Or you could go with an Icon which runs around 300 and is midrange or something like an Arai which is a high end helmet and they run around 700.at the end of the day the only thing protecting your head from a 20 grit asphalt belt sander is your helmet.

As a silly example, the goth kids from South Park, whose recurring gag is their non-conformity conformity, are actually some of the most uniquely identifiable characters in the show.  Sure, they all dress the same, but within their group they are still incredibly distinct.

I believe in these cases ""who did what"" isn't THAT important for the overall case, as they are all charged for participating in organized crime, so they will all be charged with capital murder. I bet the FBI will be having a field day with other criminal activities they've compiled on these gangs. "	4	0

So at the end of the day, and in my opinion, getting all that tech stuff in your helmet, and paying 1.5k for something that's intended to basically become unusable after an accident, is a big waste. When as you say, you can get a high quality helmet for half the price....in saying that, I love technology and that rearview camera is a good idea haha.	1	0

Your little buddy sounds like an awful person trying to validate himself in life. Just don't even worry about people like that, no one likes him. Seen a bunch of guys like him in life, they're the kind of person that looks for losers when everyone runs away from them.

I disagree with this. Yes, human trafficking tends to be for sexual purposes...but that doesn't mean that prostitution is inseparable from human trafficking. There are plenty of prostitution rings across the country, and just because they are illegal most everywhere doesn't mean it is human trafficking and the women are forced into it. "	8	0

The two biggest dangers for a biker is somebody switching lanes while you're in their blind spot and somebody pulling out in front of you. All data has shown that loud pipes DO NOT HELP in these scenarios.  If you want to be safe on a bike (impossible, they're inherently dangerous) you need to practice defensive driving and not ride in people blind spots.

When you make your exhaust artificially louder all your doing is pissing the rest of us off, alienating yourself from society and losing any sympathy we may have for you.

They're not forcing anyone to take their drugs. The police are the ones initiating violence against them.

Obviously a different take on other activities that some OMCs engage in, such as extortion, human trafficking, prostitution (when you're not the one providing the services). OP denies involvement in human trafficking, but didn't make any such claims about prostitution. But since I don't think they're a gang of prostitutes (gay or otherwise), I'm assuming they're selling someone else's body for money, which is not significantly different from human trafficking. 

But yes, I think we mostly agree. Some are upset with OP for *illegal* activity, and claiming that makes him a bad person. But without knowing the context of the actions, I don't see how a moral judgement can be made. See St. Augustine.

In reality, I'd venture ""amoral"" is a better description of OP. 

(And note, I'm neither excusing nor condemning OP's life choices. Not my place, and no one asked me, anyway. For my own, I'm Catholic, and my morality is about 90% in line with Church teachings. You can infer from that as you will about decisions I might have made differently in OP's place.)"	1	0

If you give them the respect you would hope from them, they will see that and give it back. If you stay out of their way and mind your own business (which is in a way more respect) then they will leave you alone. 

Yeah outlaw biker gangs commit crimes, the word outlaw is in their description. They deal drugs and run protection rackets and control prostitutes and so on. That stuff exists no matter who controls it. But the thing I have seen with bikers, they actually have a code and rules. Not all, but the ones I have known and seen. Kids, seem to be protected and treated like a precious resource. If you and/or your business treats them with respect, then they return it. I am not talking about bending over backwards, just being polite and respectful. 

I can say this, I have lived in neighborhoods with street gangs and neighborhoods with bikers. Both had loud parties at times, both had issues that would scare you. But I never felt afraid around the bikers. While they both did similarish things, the Bikers would also say hi and talk, would talk to the area kids about their bikes and, if something happened in the area, they would even ask if you were ok. The street gangs, they would just seize ever opportunity to take even if it might end u cutting their own throat. Maybe this is a bit of delusional one sided because of them helping me as a kid, and the respect they gave my mom (they loved her band), but this is what I saw. I am not excusing the illegal stuff, just pointing out some good. Like I said, it is all about respect.

That's a bullshit argument. The police enforcement of any law wouldn't exist if it wasn't illegal, that's kind of the point, we as a society have decided that these things need to be outlawed and policed. 

Why don't we just not enforce any traffic laws either?

I understand the origin of the name - the American Motorcyclist Association said that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens, and the last one percent were outlaws - thus was born the term, ""one percenter"", and therfore, the majority of bikers are not criminals. Also, movies and TV shows have caused a negative stereotype of bikers, that they're all thugs and are large criminal organizations, and I had hoped this AMA would shed a positive light on the group, and you'd answer some unanswered questions about the inside of the organization. But based on what I have seen on the news over the last few days, as well as your comments/replies to the questions posted on here, I actually now think worse of your group. Most of your comments and replies to questions joke about how you, people you know, and most of your fellow bike gang members are heavy involved in prostitution, narcotics, and violence. You seem to have gathered a fan base in this thread, by replying with witty comments and jokes, which is fine, however, these are serious crimes that are just being brushed over because you wear a leather jacket and have a Reddit account. I'm also not a fan of the fact that a few of your replies mention that buying a round of drinks, or letting the bikers have your seat at a bar/leaving the bar is showing respect. I think that is just pure intimidation and a horrible way to act in public. You aren't above the law, and you sure as hell aren't more important than the people in these bars or on those streets.

I'm not so much commenting on the bike gang activity and your responses, but the Reddit community's smiling attitude when reading about violent crimes. I would like to say, thank you for your responses and your time.

Also probably wouldn't call them lowlife thugs or insult them in general. If you say sorry and admit the mistake in a respectful manner you're good. 	3	0

He rode with the Hells Angels but never joined. He got away from riding with the club when I was born. I know that he made false titles for stollen bikes and delt some heavier drugs. He kept his bikes until strokes made him too unbalanced to ride. We'd run into people that remembered him from his biker days and they were terrified of him. Some guy that dated my dad's ex wife years and years ago thought my dad was still going to come after him. They ended up laughing together about how crazy she was while his wife taught horseback riding lessons. We'd have an increased biker presence around my house when my dad was admitted to the hospital for various complications from diabetes. Loads of Hells Angels showed up to his funeral. My dad died when I was just 12 years old. The bikers still take care of my mom. My old neighborhood has gotten a bit rougher but my mom's house hasn't had any break ins. The guys still drive by and will shovel snow for her randomly in the winter. I know that these clubs and gangs do very bad things but I have a bit of a soft spot for bikers that walk the line between good and really bad. Sorry this was so long. The anniversary of my dad's death is coming up and he's on my mind a lot right now with the MCs in the news so much.	23	0

I have two uncles that were part of the SoS (one still is), their chapter all act like they're in the Sons of Anarchy, pretending to be hardcore law breaker types. Threatening the locals, rampant misogyny, racism and such. The thing is, I know for a fact both of my uncles are pretty damn far from tough and in reality the highest crime either has committed was speeding and petty theft. My uncle ended up having to quit because his chapter were trying to force him to abandon his wife and three children for the gang while my other uncle basically disowned his brother for the gang.

My questions are: Is this normal behavior within biker gang culture? And what is your opinion of SoS? (I don't mind if you skip that one but I am curious as to what you think.)"	1	0

The police enforcement of any law wouldn't exist if it wasn't illegal, that's kind of the point, we as a society have decided that these things need to be outlawed and policed.

Just like we decided that alcohol needed to be outlawed and policed, which created Al Capone et. al.  It is incontrovertable that prohibition creates black markets.  Black markets have no recourse other than violence to protect their business interests (by definition).  Thus, prohibition creates the conditions for black market violence.

&gt;Why don't we just not enforce any traffic laws either?

Because driving isn't prohibited.

The problem with your analogy is that drugs aren't legal.  They're not regulated, they're prohibited.  You actually make my point for me that regulated legal activity is better than prohibited activity."	1	0

That attitude of the club/chapter being family and totally loyal to each other is very appealing, and certainly well represented in the available fiction and non-fiction literature... but it also seems to be mostly prevalent in the older members.

I would ask you how do you find that contrasts with much of the backstabbing / disloyalty that can be found in the news regarding more current members of otherwise established clubs?

I know I'm being vague, and intentionally so, but it seems like that idea of family/loyalty/brotherhood is the old school ideal and much harder to see in the new generation of guys.

These people still commit assault, murder, destruction of property, blackmailing and a wide variety of other crimes in connection to operating these black markets.

These are the only options in a black market because they do not have the ability to obtain protection under the law. How awesome would it be if we could take all the money we're spending on the War on Drugs and instead turn it towards ending human trafficking?

&gt;The biker criminals are morally responsible for committing these actual crimes, as they were not committed in any way under duress or coercion.

People who murder are morally responsible for that murder.  The qualifier ""biker criminal"" is unnecessary and that's one of the things I'm objecting to.  

&gt;If the bikers only produced and distributed drugs in a fully non-violent manner, I might give them a pass.

My question is: Do you think that a biking gang is a place someone may fit in 'naturally' than anywhere else in society? Do you think that these groups have not just extreme relevance (as it clearly does with you), but necessitation for some who devote their lives to the matter?

It wasn't some cheap dollar store light, but a Maglite. I would use it every chance I got. I loved the satisfying click of the rubber on button, the way it felt in my hand, and fiddling with the focus ring. I'd spend long hours in the quiet darkness of my room, nestled beneath the sheets, clicking that rubber button on and off. On and off. I simply couldn't get enough of it. My mother became suspicious after a while, as before I purchased it, I used to never help out around the house. I used to volunteer to get things from the basement, just so I could run my hands across the knurling of my Maglite. One day, I was in my room, clicking the button with great enthusiasm, holding it close to my face, so I could hear every detail of its glorious sound. On and off. On and off, the clicks becoming rhythmic, and intensifying with my growing satisfaction. I started to caress the focus ring, and began to moan softly, with pleasure, as I watched the beam narrow and then widen. All of a sudden, my mother burst in, without knocking, to deliver some laundry. I screamed in surprise, dropping my Maglite. She clearly had caught what I was doing, as evident by the overturned laundry basket that now laid on the floor. ""I...I...was just seeing if this flashlight was dead..."" I stuttered, my voice shaking; the words sounded hollow, even to me. I could tell by the tears in her eyes that she knew I was doing more than that. She quickly picked up the laundry, left the basket on my computer chair and left without a word. Later, my dad came home, and he was furious when he found out. He made me throw my Maglite in the trash, because my obsession with it was 'unhealthy'. I was sent to my room, and grounded for a week. When I got to my room, I could hear my parents arguing. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but this was a big fight. My urges for my light hadn't subsided, as I was so rudely interrupted. In fact, they grew with my anxiety, over my parents yelling. I had to find some way to satisfy myself. I looked around the room, and there I saw the light switch. I began to flick it on and off, on and off. It was nothing like my Maglite; nothing but a cheap imitation, but it would have to do. I heard the basement door slam, and my dad storm downstairs, where he usually went when he was upset. My mother went up to their room, obviously to cool down as well. My dad had seemed to have gotten the worst of the argument, apparently. I decided risk my parents ire and sneak down to the basement, to make sure my dad was OK. As I approached the door, I heard it. The flick of a light switch. On and off. On and off, followed by a sad moan of 'I miss you...Golight... I miss you..."""	20	0

 The Sheepdogs

Most humans truly are like sheep
Wanting nothing more than peace to keep
To graze, grow fat and raise their young,
Sweet taste of clover on the tongue.
Their lives serene upon Life’s farm,
They sense no threat nor fear no harm.
On verdant meadows, they forage free
With naught to fear, with naught to flee.
They pay their sheepdogs little heed
For there is no threat; there is no need.

To the flock, sheepdog’s are mysteries,
Roaming watchful round the peripheries.
These fang-toothed creatures bark, they roar
With the fetid reek of the carnivore,
Too like the wolf of legends told,
To be amongst our docile fold.
Who needs sheepdogs? What good are they?
They have no use, not in this day.
Lock them away, out of our sight
We have no need of their fierce might.

But sudden in their midst a beast
Has come to kill, has come to feast
The wolves attack; they give no warning
Upon that calm September morning
They slash and kill with frenzied glee
Their passive helpless enemy
Who had no clue the wolves were there
Far roaming from their Eastern lair.
Then from the carnage, from the rout,
Comes the cry, “Turn the sheepdogs out!”

Thus is our nature but too our plight
To keep our dogs on leashes tight
And live a life of illusive bliss
Hearing not the beast, his growl, his hiss.
Until he has us by the throat,
We pay no heed; we take no note.
Not until he strikes us at our core
Will we unleash the Dogs of War
Only having felt the wolf pack’s wrath
Do we loose the sheepdogs on its path.
And the wolves will learn what we’ve shown before;
We love our sheep, we Dogs of War.

In most environments where people would know what ""sport"" or ""supersport"" are, saying that it's a CBR600 is more beneficial to the conversation than saying supersport (i.e. at meetups, racetracks, etc...).

He said they knew a lot of meth houses, but rather than bust them they would try and bust pot growing operations, because if they got to impound the house/auction it off and keep the proceeds it was $$$.  However, a meth lab house needs a deep cleansing that can cost 20 or 30 thousand dollars.  Thus, the pot bust was more lucrative to the force.

The HA's I've met there were all nice guys, but some of them were a bit crazy. A guy I met a couple times father was put in jail for murdering some Bandidos guy at the airport some 20 years ago. "	1	0

The 1% patch originates from some pushback against the mainstream opinion that bikers were outlaws.  The AMA, amongst others, were fighting the outlaw biker image saying that 99% of motorcycle riders were just normal dudes. The outlaws response is much more concrete &amp; easily remembered as they just adopted the 1% patch &amp; owned up to it.  I guess given the context of this thread you're kind of right.	1	0

If that was the case there would be no point to having RICO statutes. All you need is to prove is that they are part of an organization and members of that organization have committed crimes with organization approval. Here's the bit from wikipedia: 

&gt;Under RICO, a person who has committed ""at least two acts of racketeering activity"" drawn from a list of 35 crimes—27 federal crimes and 8 state crimes—within a 10-year period can be charged with racketeering if such acts are related in one of four specified ways to an ""enterprise"".

So, they need to commit ""racketeering activity"" not necessarily crimes, the nuance of which is for lawyers to argue though, eh? The article also says: 

&gt; Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts.

I got involved once I realized my buddy was unconscious yet was still getting his ass kicked. Needless to say it's not like the movies where everyone takes turn, we just got jumped by close to 6 bikers.

""In the late 1960s, a former AMA president was irritated over the raucous behavior of the outlaw motorcycle gangs and declared that 99 percent of the motorcyclists in the United States were law-abiding citizens. This statement was a public relation's effort to demonstrate that only 1 percent of the motorcycling public was involved in criminal activity. Thus, denoting the term ""1 percenter""; those who chose to be a part of the outlaw motorcycle gang subculture. The outlaw motorcycle gang members coined this phrase--using it to differentiate themselves from the law-abiding social motorcycling clubs. ""

The question 'do you like **either** drinking or smoking dope,' is a yes or no question, and is equivilent to 'logical or.' people also say 'and/or' to specify 'logical or.' the question you're asking sounds like the answers are 'drinking,' or 'smoking dope,' but not neither or both.	1	0

Alcohol is directly responsible for millions in monetary losses, lives being ruined, and the deaths of tens of thousands every year. We don't call the owners of companies and liquor distributors evil. Shit we applaud alcohol in society. 

Second prostitution isn't really a bad thing. It's legal in many places. So if he's in Vegas managing a prostitution company, he wouldn't be committing a crime. Just because he's a few hours drive away doesn't change the morality of it. One of my childhood friends had a prostitute for a mother. It was the only way she could bring in $10k a month and provide a great life for her kids. She wasn't drugged out. Her ""pimp"" treated her really well and didn't force her to do anything she was uncomfortable with. He took a reasonable percentage and didn't exploit her. There's nothing wrong with prostitution, and I don't see anything in this thread to insinuate that he mistreated any workers. I think you have some misguided and preconceived notions about the industry. Do you know anyone that's involved in the industry? There's nothing wrong with sex. It's natural. 

The only grimy thing he mentioned is insurance fraud,  and ultimately I don't really care enough to get angry. He admitted he's a criminal. Why am I going to act like I'm offended by his lifestyle? As long as he's not hurting innocent people what do I care? "	0	0

As an example, if the person you pull over doesn't know what they've done wrong, and is having a panic attack because they've been pulled over by a cop, but is polite and cooperating to the best of their ability, it doesn't seem respectful to interrupt them when they're trying to talk to you, to patronize them, to not actually listen to a word they're saying, and then to leave them stewing in their car for fifteen minutes while they approach hysterics and don't know what's happening and can't breathe.

Also, on a one-to-one comparison, cops driving cop cars are 100% more likely to let you go with a warning if it's your first ticket and it was for an incredibly minor infraction and innocent mistake that endangered absolutely no one.

But it's just weird to think, and by all scientific measure, whose to say we're on the right side of the moral compass and not them? I mean, I think we evolved society into generally agreeable norms, but then it gets all hairy because we can't exactly disprove the existence of a god- so there's a CHANCE there is a god and there's a chance the ISIS have it correct- and maybe much more open minded western society was the abnormal development and we're in the wrong?

I have read all your previous IAMA's, and you are very patient. Also glad to see you are still alive and kicking, your last one suggested you weren't doing well. I have a kinda dark question for you.

I acknowledge most 1% clubs are dealing in drugs, guns and prostitution but I've heard that some big name clubs such as the Mongols and 81 deal with such irrevocably evil things such as child pornography and sex slavery. 

Is there a line you all agree to not cross, from outlaw to plain evil? Or is any profit okay? I could see being a drug dealer, illegal gun smuggler. Protection rackets even, it's not legit but you make a living without having to do ""legit"" work. But hurting kids, raping women and selling them... does this happen in MC clubs? Or is it government propaganda? Maybe I romanticize your clubs a bit too much, but I have a hard time thinking even 1% would do such things or that other chapters/clubs would allow it.

Also, do you own a ""cage""? Or is it frowned upon to own a non two wheel vehicle. Do you follow the rule of no colors in cages? 

Do you feel kinda famous right now, there are close to 9000 comments on here...

Just because someone provides adults with services they want, even if illegal, doesn't mean he has no morals.

They run drugs.  Meh.  Drugs that should be legal.  It's not that different from prohibition era bootleggers (how many people does alcohol kill a year?)

That whole ""commit a murder"" thing ... I just don't see it, how many Hells Angels are there?  10,000? You think they've really all killed people?  Nah.  There would be a certain guy who's probably not even an angel that kills for them in any kind of planned killing

ie hit men 

ie just like any organized crime ring

They wear UNIFORMS, they're not secretive about their identity and affiliation, this kind of ham strings them as far as any truely aspirational criminal activity, and makes for short career as an actual drug peddler.

And protection rackets?  Really?  Theres no money in that.  There's a little money in prostitutuon, sure, but  I just don't get the sense they are making cartel / mafia money, I think the Angels make more selling t-shirts and knick knacks with their logo than actual drugs.

It's accepting the person for being a person, and telling them that some of their choices are destructive to themselves and those around them. Not accepting someone who is going to steal from me and beat other people up for whatever reason 'just because *looove*'. That notion is nowhere to be found anywhere the phrase 'love your neighbor as yourself' is found.

Some people are trash, basically by their own actions. Cartel leader? Trash, because he destroys lives for his own gain. Human trafficker? Trash, because he destroys lives for his own gain. Guy that works at a factory for a paycheck? Not trash, because he's not destroying anyone's life and is earning and honest paycheck to support his family. Self proclaimed outlaw that would steal from anyone and gets in firefights outside of diners because pride? Trash, because this guy is presumably an adult human being that can make decisions for himself regardless of his past, but still wants to use it as a crutch excuse for doing bad things. That doesn't mean those people can't become good citizens, but it *does* mean that right now, they're human garbage because they're choosing what they do to the extreme detriment of other human beings.

If I grew up as anyone else, I can still absolutely say I wouldn't have turned into a human trafficker, thief, drug dealer, or whatever other shitty life because those are *shit* choices to make that are irrelevant to how I grew up...because I'm an adult now and can make choices for myself.

I'm willing to have a rational discussion with you, but you can't twist my words like that. 

&gt; At least you're self aware enough to know you're a bad person. 

No, no. I am just a person, neither good nor bad. Morality really depends on the culture. Good and Bad are polarized things that just happen to be part of our culture here in the US. Bad people are murderers and liars, neither of which am I. If you want to categorize me I am comfortable with being morally ambiguous. 

The 1%er's exist because bad cops exist; you really can't have one without the other. For every crime a 1%er commits I can show you an equal crime a cop commits. Why do you think people want ALL cops to wear cameras? So they stop breaking the law, of course. 

A drain on society in my opinion are all these fat cats and billionares that hoard the economy and drive people into poverty on purpose. Yeah yeah, get your tin foil hat I hear you say. Well, it's true.

As a final point, being a biker has nothing to do with crime. Go visit /r/motorcycles, no one in there gives a crap about biker gangs, lol. We just like to ride.

Its is incredibly disingenuous and a false equivalency to suggest that for every bad deed done by a biker there's one done by the police though. 

For the sake of clarity when I refer to bikers I am specifically referring to the 1%ers though. People who identify as outlaws and who's livelihoods depend on the proceeds of violent crime. As much as there have been sensationalist stories in the media as of late about bad cops, and as much as I personally think the entire policing system is fundamentally broken, by and large police officers are decent human beings with families, who are productive members of their communities. The same cannot reasonably be said about 1%ers. Sure a few bad apples spoil the bunch where cops are concerned, but 1%ers are exclusively bad apples. 

I agree with you about fat cats though. There are far worse systemic problems in society than bikers, but that doesn't excuse the 1%ers shitty, anti-social sociopathic, criminal behaviour.

I also agree that riding a motorcycle has nothing to do with the 1%ers criminality. I equally loathe gang members who's preferred method of locomotion be 4 wheeled or otherwise. I ride a bike too, and literally every single person I know who rides hates the Angles. They have an especially bad reputation where I'm from having been involved in many murders and gang warfare.

They started the culture, they maintain the culture, and they regulate all clubs under the COC which is controlled by the dominant outlaw MC in each state. If you want to start a riding club that's one thing, but if you want to start a club wearing a leather or denim vest adorned with a 3 piece back patch flying bottom territorial rockers, you're emulating an MC.	0	0

They had another mass arrest of the Cossack's in DFW around Christmas 2013 if I remember correctly, and pretty much jack shit stuck then because they overreached then and this has been going on continually since. Banditos and Cossacks keep stirring the shit pot and the feds keep trying to charge them with something. I hope this plays out well, but I have a feeling the defense will get it knocked out reallllly quickly. They can't even prove organized crime, they were in a bar brawl- nothing is proven beyond that. And they're charged with murder when ballistics haven't come back on the bodies to show who was shot or how- and there's plenty of rumors saying the police shot first (hmm, that could be either way really) and the police were the ones who shot those who were killed, they weren't shot by the bikers. If that's the case I really don't see how it could be capital murder for any of them. The whole thing is a clusterfuck.	3	0

At this point ballistics haven't come back to prove who was shot by whom, and there's lots of rumors flying about who shot first- and most are saying it was the police who did. If it was the police who shot those who died and their deaths weren't as a result of the mass assaults (beating with chain? really? OW.) or of being shot by other bikers, I don't see how they could be charged with it. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out but it seems a bit preemptive and overreaching of the prosecutor.	1	0

I agree with the fact they can't arrest them on suspicion they'll commit crimes, but they don't really have them on crimes here besides assault and nobody's filing assault charges here. At this point the charges were a bit preemptive as they haven't even got back ballistics reports, they aren't sure who shot those who were killed. If it was the police, they're going to have a hell of a time charging anyone with murder or organized crime- it was a bar brawl, pure and simple, and there were multiple assaults but nobody pressing charges. Destruction of property could be filed by Twin Peaks, but past that if the police were the ones who shot those who died and not bikers, the case is basically nil. 	1	0

In a few questions which have mentioned race, specifically black people, you have (to my mind) sidestepped the question. I'm wondering why? You don't give the impression of caring overly much what others think of you. The thought crossed my mind that you just didn't want to give offense. But of course I have no idea. Given that you seem to be a pretty intelligent guy, in spite of doing activities which many folks here would probably find troubling, I'd be interested in hearing you describe your perspective on race.

I simply choose to be a good, upstanding member of society due to my own rational self interest. I adhere to rational ethical behaviour right now for that reason alone.

Honestly, I view the whole Hollywood ""Hero has a moment of hesitation and a moral quandary about pulling the trigger"" trope to be fictitious. I think modern ethical behaviour has more to do with our being domesticated (and therefore afraid of the results of our actions, as well as generally squeamish), than because of any deep seated sense of something being intrinsically right and wrong.

I know, it's not the common, pretty, social lie that everyone so enthusiastically repeats but this is the Internet and I'm anonymous. If you met me in real life, I'd lie and with a tear in my eye talk about what a tragic, heart wrenching struggle I'd find it to be to rob or kill to survive.

I mean, one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of biker activity in areas ~like~ South Central or Compton is probably that you basically can't *ride* in those areas -- they're too densely urbanized, too many traffic lights, you'd literally be idling or stuck in traffic or if a 1% member did the typical thing and ignored a red light, they'd be needlessly risking their own neck.

""A hells angels would be shot dead if they tried to enter texas. ""

... for the sake of this question, let's take the HAs and Bandito's. Since they claim territory in TX and CA, is it just understood that they should not enter that other territory for any reason?

Second question, say a member of one club is on vacation or traveling to the rival state. He does not wear any colors or identifying markers, so he is not obviously sticking out like a sore thumb. Now say one of his club tattoos are showing... would he take heat if spotted by the opposing club?

He comes in with a few angels one night and I just go up, shake his hand, say whats up and put his beer on my tab.

The guy I know came over and said it was all good (he had gotten between us when the dude started to get crazy) and to just ignore it all and dont apologize or say anything just go about my shit.

I guess my questions are:

Is that prevalent or is he just a douchebag?

How else could I have handled that/what the fuck could I have even done? (Honestly I'm super friendly anymore and well known at the spot for being pretty low key/just there to play pool and have a few beers).

I've been following this AMA for the last day and find it fascinating. I'm a pretty sheltered and naive person, so I love that you're opening my eyes to something I would have never thought twice about otherwise. Anyways, it seems as if a lot of people have taken an interest in what you do in the club, or what the club does, but I'm quite curious about *you* as a person. I realize I may be a little late to this AMA, but I'd love to get a response from you! 

1) What is a typical day in your life like? Do you meet up with club members daily?

2) What is your favorite TV show or favorite thing to do for fun?

3) Would you want your nephews to follow in your footsteps and join a biker gang? Why or why not?

4) Do you have a long term girlfriend/wife? I was reading in some of the other comments that women are passed along and seem to be ""shared property"", but does that mean you aren't *allowed* to have monogamous relationships, or is that just something you don't desire? Or maybe it's something you have and the comment was just buried! But the way women are treated within the club seams very... Out-dated! So I was curious..

5) I read about how you got into the gang, but *why* did this life style appeal to you? Did you grow up in a stable household? Was school not your thing? 

6) What is one thing you'd really like to cross off your bucket list?

7) Have you ever considered distancing yourself from the club and doing something else with your life? Is that even possible? What would happen if a young guy suddenly wanted to go to school to become a doctor?.. Would you guys allow that?

8) What legitimate jobs have you had in the past (not illegal things!)? Did you enjoy them or did you work there to simply pass the time?

9) How do you guys get insurance? Perhaps this is a silly question for the younger guys in your club, but as you age, I'm sure you'll need healthcare..

10) And lastly (and this has to do with club stuff), when big things happen in the news (like the Waco shooting), how do you hear about it? Is there a phone-chain that happens and you get filled in on details from the perspective of 1%ers? Or do you find out via the news like everyone else?

There are plenty of bikers who are criminals, because the lifestyle tends to attract alot of criminals, but that has nothing to do with being an outlaw.

The term outlaw in the automotive context originated in racing.  Outlaw races were usually races not sanctioned by the race sanctioning organizations.  

The motorcycle specific context comes from some bikers rejecting the rules of the American Motorcycle Association regulating motorcycle races.  These bikers starting holding their own races, separate and unsanctioned by the AMA.  These races were called outlaw races.

Later, someone wrote a letter to the editor of a motorcycle magazine (it may have been an AMA magazine, but I don't know) criticizing motorcycle riders, and a representative wrote a response, wanting to protect the image of motorcycle riders in order to protect the marketability of motorcycles to the public, saying ""most motorcycle riders are regular citizens, only 1% of bikers are outlaws.""   

Many bikers identified with being in that 1%, and instead of considering that comment an insult, they embraced the term and began wearing it like a badge of honor.  It was at that time that the terms 1%er and the term outlaw came together.

Each club does something a little different when it comes to the 1%er term.  The red and white abandoned the term, but most other Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs still embrace the term, and most of those wear a diamond 1% patch on their cuts.  Some of them, like the red and gold, only allow members to wear a 1%er patch if they've earned it, so you'll see some red and gold who wear the patch, and others who don't.

The term 1%er has little to do with committing crimes.  When a biker calls himself a 1%er, he's not thinking ""I'm going to go rob a bank, or shoot someone because I'm an outlaw""     They are thinking, ""I'm not like everyone else, I live my life on my own terms, to hell with everyone else.""  In the process, if the 1%er runs afoul of the law, so be it.  It happens.  But it's incidental, not essential to being a 1%er."	1	0

My argument isn't *in support* of drugs (I don't actually care about drugs *per se* - I don't even use them).  My argument is *against prohibition*.  It is the prohibition which creates the black market.  It is the black market which causes the violence.

1. Assuming your length of time in your MC, I take it that you're not prior service? Do you see a trend among the vets that try to get into the MC's? Do they act differently than other hang arounds, are they preferred, or is it a negligible difference?

2. Same goes for the younger generations trying to join the MC's these days. Are they more wreckless, less respectful, dumber, smarter, etc?

3. When an MC votes for a new president or other senior leadership roles, is that because the last one fucked up? Is it shown as a sign of disrespect? Do they step down diligently or raise hell? I always pondered about those you'd see who were ex-outlaw MC presidents or whatever, doing something else after 20+ years. 

4. Are you a sports man? Whose your team?

5. I don't know if it's just a state thing or federal, but I know in my area where I grew up, if you were a ""Known Gang Affiliate"" your sentence was usually doubled. Do you see the same for the guys getting pinched that are making money for the MC but not riding or wearing their colors?

6. Drugs is a big part of the culture...it makes sense. How do you handle a brother who's definitely got an addiction? I read one of the comments about having the oldest prospect who you guys helped get clean. Do you guys tell him straighten the fuck up or we can't hang around you anymore, pay for a rehab, just tell him he needs to settle down but let the grown man make his own decisions?"	1	0

Judging is in fact a Biblical concept, the verse you're specifically referencing is [Matthew 7:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%207:1&amp;amp;version=NASB)

&gt;Do not judge so that you will not be judged.

However, you're forgetting the latter part of the [same statement](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%207:1-5&amp;amp;version=NASB) by Christ;

&gt;“Do not judge so that you will not be judged. For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.

Broken down, Christ is not telling us that we can never judge another person's actions; as we do not judge people, God does that, but we are called to judge another Christian's - and persons in society in general - actions, 'hate the sin not the sinner'. Rather He was making a statement to live a righteous life so that any judgement or pronouncement would not be made in a rash fashion and that the efforts would not be wasted in trying to correct another Christian. Taking that first line, you could make the statement that a person could simply escape final judgement by never judging another - this is, of course, not true; everyone is judged once by God, so this cannot be the proper understanding. Instead, people that point to this passage and claim 'hypocrites!' are correct here - hypocritical judgement is not effective, you lose your witness at that moment. Christ instead tells us how to do it effectively - first taking the log out of our own eye so that we can then clearly see the speck in our brother's. 

Do not forget that there are other instances in Scripture where Christ actively calls us to judge;

[John 7:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:24&amp;amp;version=NASB)
&gt;Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”

[Matthew 18:15-17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.%2018:15-17&amp;amp;version=NASB)
&gt;If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother. But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

These are among more; [1 Corinthians 5:12-13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%205:12-13&amp;amp;version=NASB) and [1 Corinthians 6:2-18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:2-18&amp;amp;version=NASB) come to mind. 

There is a big difference between judging someone's behavior and judging the state of someone's soul. Far too often Christians get this confused, and the effects are more than detrimental. That is reserved only for God. 

In this case, I'm judging his behavior, and correctly calling him a criminal scumbag. Is there anything else for today?"	1	0

I think you're leaving out a key detail when jumping to that conclusion and that's that it's all about the club, not the individual.  Biker gangs, just like street gangs, drawn their power by presenting a unified front against all threats no matter what degree that threat is.  You're not insulting or harming an individual if you get into a confrontation with one, you're insulting or harming the club.  The clubs consistent unified response to a threat or insult also cultivates fear and apprehension in their enemies and society, which further increases the power of the gang to control their environment and grow their criminal enterprise within a path of least resistance.  I'm not in a biker gang myself, but that's what my deductive thinking leads me to conclude when considering your comment.  Maybe OP will verify or refute my conclusion for us.	0	0

During a St Paddy's day party at our local ""Irish"" Pub here outside Las Vegas I ended up in the bathroom to break to seal. As I was at the urinal this guy comes out of the stall and washes his hands. I'm guessing he saw my shirt in the mirror. I was wearing [this shirt](http://imgur.com/4uQ2p72) because hey, shamrocks.

The guy behind me says ""Hey, I'm just letting you know that Vagos are here and we are here to party and be cool like you are."" To which I replied, ""Good. Don't start no shit and there won't be no shit.""

As I got back to the bar I told my wife (then girlfriend) what had just transpired and how weird it was and she, having grown up around here, looked horrified. She said, ""Don't you know who the Vagos are?""

I had no idea.

I figured out that this non TV-watching motherfucker was giving me some sort of respect or heads up because of my shirt. I laughed. *Then* I realized that I just told a 1%er ""Don't start no shit and there won't be no shit."" I stopped laughing and became a little more watchful for the rest of the evening. But I continued to laugh on the inside."	1	0

Frankly the thing is so comfortable and enjoyable to ride I think more people would if they could. I don't know about the safety, but it can't be worse then my Suzuki Vitara...	1	0

The fact that more than half of all federal prisoners are there not for violent crimes (which may or may not have been motivated by drugs), but for drug charges themselves (regardless of whether they lead to violent crime) is the sad proof that prohibition is a profound failure.

There are more than 32,000 fatal car crashes per year in the US.  However, despite this staggering number  (which is double the homicide and suicide rates combined), we don't look to outlawing driving, nor do we look to outlawing alcohol (the primary contributing factor for these deaths).   Just because a behavior *might* lead to crime - even violent crime - is *not* sufficient reason to make that behavior illegal.

Having said that, it's perfectly sensible to have the position that drinking is legal, driving is legal, and drinking-and-driving is illegal.  That is where I encourage you to develop a sensible drug policy, rather than prohibition.

You misunderstand.  I make no claims about the morality of drug use, and I make no claim that drugs are consequence-free.  What I do claim is that it is not your fucking place to tell someone else how to live their life.  Even if the way they live is self-destructive.

&gt;for a population of more than 318 million would be better used as an argument for building safer cars.

And our government's attempts to do just this has resulted in vehicles that use lighter and lighter (thus less safe) materials.  Sensing a pattern of the negative consequences of government involvement?  How about the next time you think to yourself ""there ought to be a law against ..."" you instead think ""Would creating legislation about this increase personal liberty or restrict it?""   If it restricts liberty, it's probably a bad law. 

&gt;What percentage of the people who consume alcohol have psychotic episodes which make them prone to hurt or kill someone to get their next drink?

Fallacious argument.  People who drink and then drive kill people as a documented fact.  There is (correctly) no call to prohibit either activity (by itself) and the combined behavior is already illegal.  Most importantly, it's illegal at the state and local level. 

&gt;It is true that people who consume a lot of alcohol are more prone to fighting, but usually the fights are not about getting the next drink.

Again, you are inappropriately concerning yourself with the behaviors and choices of others.  Of what concern is it to you that someone does or does not wish to have ""too much"" of an inebriating substance?

&gt;In the US, their are laws about guns and gun usage, but how many deaths are gun related?


There are an inappropriate number of (in my view) unconstitutional laws regarding firearms, especially considering how few homicides involve guns.  Over 50% of ""deaths involving firearms"" are suicides, which makes the link to firearms specious.  In years past, nearly 80% of homicides involving firearms were gang-related.  We know that gangs use firearms because they are protecting their black market enterprises.  Thus, these deaths (or a great many of them), are a direct consequence of drug prohibition.  Some of the most draconian and onerous firearms restrictions are for so-called ""assault rifles"" (in quotes because there is actually no such thing).  This is despite the fact that those rifles make up a small portion of the 700 deaths per year caused by **all rifles combined**.  Again, the government has enacted misguided legislation which a) doesn't seek to preserve or increase liberty and b) doesn't actually address the real problem.

&gt;What is (in your words) a sensible policy regarding a drug that even trying it once can form a lifelong addiction that robs a person of their ability to think past their next hit?

None.  The number of people so affected is so minuscule that it doesn't warrant the attention and money and unintended consequences of any federal legislation whatsoever.  State and local governments are free to enact whatever legislation their populations will support."	1	0

You had me with you until you got here:

&gt; am sure you can come up with a reason why someone should take a drug that can cause permanent psychosis, and the person who took the drug to rob and/or kill someone just to get more of it.

No.  No. No. No.  It is *wrong* for anyone to, for any reason, attempt to control the behavior and choices of someone else.  Even if we don't like that behavior.  It is authoritarian, and it has no place in this country.  If a person wants to cause themselves harm, then we have to allow it.  That person owns his or her self.  They are the ultimate judge of what may be done to that self.  This may shock and offend you, but it is immoral to try to impose your will about what someone should be allowed to do to their own body.  It's even more offensive to think that because a small few people do bad things that you would use that as an excuse to control *everyone's* behavior through threat of violence (which is ultimately what the government is - a monopoly on coercive force)

The robbing and the killing you're desperately trying to link to drugs is already illegal (and appropriately so), and the people who commit those trespasses should be held accountable for those trespasses.  It doesn't matter what motivated them.  Who cares if someone commits murder as a result of drug use or as a result of racial intolerance or as a result of psychosis?  The victim is no less or more dead, and the offender is no less responsible.

Given your line of thinking - if someone might commit murder if they do a drug, therefore that drug (and all drugs) should be illegal.  Doesn't it follow that we should outlaw all other things that would lead to murder?  Outlaw racial intolerance - you just created the thought police from Orwell's 1984.  Outlaw psychosis - you just returned to the vile ideas of the eugenics policies of the Fabians (and others).  Can you not see how critical it is that we divorce the illegal acts of trespass from the morality of the thoughts and behaviors that may or may not precipitate them?  It is enough that murder be illegal.  There is no need to make it more bad by saying it's extra murder if you don't like black people.  Doing so is a violation of our freedom of conscience."	1	0

The OP admits condoning murder, presumably of people he feels deserve it, but won't condone trafficking, presumably because he thinks the people subject to that crime don't deserve it. He is taking moral high ground on people trafficking, which is hypocritical for a person who admits to being a violent criminal &amp; who has probably supported people involved in trafficking (Hells Angels). You want to compare his stance to mine by suggesting hypotheticals that challenge my admittedly simplified statement that no violent crime is justified. I have never committed a violent crime. Even if I did commit a crime based on your hypotheticals involving self defense it would not be comparable to the type of murder for money the OP is condoning. As far as self righteousness goes, you are demonstrating yours as well. I wonder why you prefer a view that justifies some violent crimes but not others. 	1	0

Given your line of thinking, what you are proposing is anarchy. Every law that is on the books is an attempt to in some way control the behavior of others and has consequences for non-compliance.

Under your proposition, if two people have an argument and one decides to kill the other to settle the argument, that person should be allowed to, because prohibiting such an act would mean that the government is trying to control the behavior and choices of that person.

There is nothing in what I said that would (as you claim) outlaw psychosis. There are already existing laws that attempt to keep people from ingesting or injecting items that artificially create psychosis.

Honestly, as this ""debate"" continues, your arguments make it seem like you may either be a young person studying law and practicing rhetoric, or someone vetting passages of a dissertation.

One thing I have to say for your logic is that if we followed it to the letter, the crime rate would instantly drop to zero. If there are no laws prohibiting anything, then everything, including rape, murder, arson, terrorism et al are all perfectly acceptable.

Locks keep honest people from breaking into your house, but do little or nothing to deter a thief. Laws give basically honest people an increased reason for remaining honest, and offer penalties for not doing the right thing.

Under your pretext, every atrocity known to human kind is okay, because banning any of it would be an attempt to control the behavior or choices of another individual or group.

BTW, if you are writing a paper, feel free to ascribe a co-author credit to the enigmatic oddlycurious1.

I sense that this debate could go on for ages, and I honestly believe that the line you are taking is not one that you actually hold, merely one that allows you to continue the debate.

Years ago I had to defend Ford for their decision to sell an automobile with a known defect that caused that automobile(under the right conditions) to burst into flames, despite knowing about a fix that would have cost $5 per unit.

I know, it sounds vaguely like a movie plot, but, the difference is, it was real, and real people died, as a result of a corporate decision related to a cost/benefit analysis.

Although I found the decision to be morally reprehensible, I still won the argument.

One last point, if anarchy was the ""law"" of the land, this discourse would have never been possible.

My original question still remains.

You're quite mistaken.  I am proposing that the government - that is the people who have the monopoly on coercive force - should be limited in their role.  However, the protection of my rights and your rights and everyone's rights is their foundational purpose.  You should have the liberty to do as you will, however, when you trespass upon my rights, the government's role is to force you to stop the trespass and/or to compensate me for it.   Proper law should say ""you may not kill someone, as that deprives them of their right to live.""  Thus, a murder is illegal, and murderers should be punished.  The law should **not** concern itself with *why* the murderer committed the act - that part is irrelevant.  This is the fundamental distinction.  You're conflating the act of violence with the behavior that precipitated it. The former is rightly illegal, the latter is immaterial (from the government's point of view).

You're making up a story about what I believe which is precisely contrary to what I have repeatedly said.  In this case, the murder is illegal.  However, *the argument* is not.  Additionally, the government should not endeavor to make arguments illegal because they might lead to murder.

&gt;There is nothing in what I said that would (as you claim) outlaw psychosis. There are already existing laws that attempt to keep people from ingesting or injecting items that artificially create psychosis.

And they are immoral (and in my view unconstitutional).  It is sufficient for the **act** of murder to be illegal without concerning ourselves with the **reasons** for it.

&gt;One thing I have to say for your logic is that if we followed it to the letter, the crime rate would instantly drop to zero. If there are no laws prohibiting anything, then everything, including rape, murder, arson, terrorism et al are all perfectly acceptable.

I don't understand how you can continue to falsely accuse me of wanting no laws against violent acts.  I have very clearly and repeatedly stated that violent **acts** are and should be prohibited.  My complaint is that you conflate the circumstances that precede the violence as being something that should also be illegal.  They should not.  

&gt;Locks keep honest people from breaking into your house, but do little or nothing to deter a thief. Laws give basically honest people an increased reason for remaining honest, and offer penalties for not doing the right thing.

Locks are not governments nor are they laws.  My house is my property, and I have rights to my property.  If someone enters my property without my permission, that is a trespass on my property rights.  That **act** is illegal, and rightly so.  The lock is there merely because it is a low-cost measure that I may take to dissuade casual trespass and to delay felonious trespass long enough for me to ready my firearm.

&gt;Under your pretext, every atrocity known to human kind is okay, because banning any of it would be an attempt to control the behavior or choices of another individual or group.

Please stop making these false accusations.  I could not be more clear that the ACT OF VIOLENCE SHOULD BE AND CORRECTLY IS ILLEGAL.  An argument that happens before the violence is protected speech and should not even enter consideration for legislation.

&gt;Years ago I had to defend Ford for their decision to sell an automobile with a known defect that caused that automobile(under the right conditions) to burst into flames, despite knowing about a fix that would have cost $5 per unit.
I know, it sounds vaguely like a movie plot, but, the difference is, it was real, and real people died, as a result of a corporate decision related to a cost/benefit analysis.

&gt;One last point, if anarchy was the ""law"" of the land, this discourse would have never been possible.

 ""I could not be more clear that the ACT OF VIOLENCE SHOULD BE AND CORRECTLY IS ILLEGAL.""

If I am not mistaken, both of the preceeding staments are yours.

If it is wrong for anyone, for any reason to attempt to control the behavior of others, yet you contend that certain acts are and should be illegal, then how can you reconcile the two statements?

Making something (anything) illegal is an attempt to control the behavior or choices of another, which violates you first statement in principle.

Even an act of violence is a choice made by an individual, but in the case of a drug affected individual, the drug can rob the person of the capacity to make that choice.

Before replying, read through all you have written. I have highlighted two of your most contradictory premises, but there are others.

Be thankful I am not grading this.

Yet again, my original question goes unanswered.

Let us instead seek clarity.

If you don't like my word choice, then propose an alternative.  It's not the word choice I care about, it's the underlying principles - which I assure you are consistent.

For the sake of this discussion, I am using ""behavior"" to mean ""the things that people do, think, and say in pursuit of their own desires which are not acts of violence or other trespasses against the rights of others.""  I am distinguishing it from ""acts of violence"" and ""trespass"" on purpose to indicate that I believe it to be completely inappropriate (and unconstitutional) to seek to control the behavior of people for the purpose of either a paternalistic goal (e.g. a ban on drinking large sodas because it's bad for your health), or because it might lead to violent crime (e.g. getting drunk or having an argument).


I am drawing this bright line because it's precisely in the blurring of the distinction that we find soft-authoritarianism.  This is where we get Hate Crime regimes which hold that the beliefs that an attacker held make their violent crimes somehow worse than if they were instead somehow motivated by good and pure intention when they committed them.   It is also where our primary disagreement exists: I believe that the violence should be illegal and punishable, and you believe that additionally the thoughts, ideas, and motivations that occurred prior to those acts should also be prohibited.  


Stated simply: ""it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg"" which was restated for the modern era as ""don't hurt people and don't take their stuff.""  Notice that TJ doesn't say ""it doesn't lead to the breaking of my leg"" nor ""it doesn't cause them to feel they have no choice but to break my leg""  nor ""it doesn't cause them to be robbed of free will, putting my leg at risk of being broken.""  


It's also important to keep in mind that we're implicitly talking about federal laws and regulations (since we're speaking about the War on Drugs).  States and municipalities are, in my opinion, welcome to enact whichever rules they wish, provided they comply with 14th Amendment incorporation.

You are not in favor of the government controlling that choice, which you suggest is non-violent and harms noone.

The reality is that the choice to take the drug may in fact be non-violent (unless it is an intentional overdose resulting in death), BUT the effects of the drug on the person who took it can, and often are, far from non-violent.

I personally have never taken drugs, but I have seen the effects close up and personal. Sadly, I have even had to hurt people who were drug affected in order to protect myself or another.

Your argument is fine for a panel discussion or a thought exercise, as long as your conclusions do not have to be tested in the real world.

For illustration, I will use the real world example that I witnessed first hand.

A gentleman (using the term loosely to the point of absurdity) was drinking heavily and having a good time with another male who drank with him, but in moderation.

The one who had been drinking heavily was falling down repeatedly, and the other male had been looking after him to ensure that he did not get hurt.

The heavily drunken man then smoked a synthetic form of pot, which according to your argument he should be allowed to do unimpeded by legalities.

Shortly after smoking the synthetic, the man had a psychotic episode and seriously hurt the man who had been doing nothing more than looking after him.

To be clear: Drug ingestion may in and of itself be non-violent, but the effects of the drug use have a propensity toward violence.

Your argument also assumes that the drug user has no change to their mental capacity before and after drug use, but the intent of most illicit drugs is to alter that capacity and change ones perception. In fact, the drugs exactly do rob people of their free will. Heavy users would hurt or kill a beloved family member to get money for the next hit, and may not even be aware they have done it.

I get your argument, succinctly is that you feel that the government is intruding into areas that they have no business intruding, and on that point you are correct. Chances are good that someone at the NSA is reading this thread, but illicit drug use is an area where I am personally quite happy for the government to do all it can to control. Not because of the ingestion of the drugs, but because of their effects on the user.

BTW, My original question was to the effect: ""Why should anyone care what a self professed criminal thinks?"" which resulted in you saying that his offenses were probably only drug related, a supposition not supported by the evidence. Unless you happen to actually be or know the OP, there is no way you could know.

THE WAR ON DRUGS IS A HOPELESS ENDEAVOR. Drug distribution and sales is a massively lucrative business, and extremely expensive to combat.

If the government would adopt the simple premise of merely seizing the drugs and seizing the money at street level, mid level and international level and very publicly putting the seizes assets back into tools for more seizures, the the busy model the drug trade uses becomes less and less profitable. The street price increases due to lack of supply, and the profits drop.

Low end users are the basis for the thriving trade, but if the price of the drugs went high enough, a percentage of the low end users would be forced to give it up as they would be unable to secure sufficient funds to continue use.

Finally, choose your words more carefully, and understand them in context. I feel like you are either someone working on a thesis, or someone in or on the cusp of a position as a lawyer.

Your amendment citations raise you above the category of the standard Reddit user.

False.  The prices are what they are because the seller may set the price and the buyer has no recourse.  Causing the price to go up would only exacerbate the problem.  You observed previously that some people turn to robbery and theft to support the habit.  Increasing prices would push more users towards those crimes, not fewer.

What I am suggesting doesn't solve the drug problem, and it doesn't solve the negative consequences of drugs.  However, it does solve the profound cost of both blood and treasure in continuing the failed and hopelessly misguided ""war on drugs.""  

&gt;THE WAR ON DRUGS IS A HOPELESS ENDEAVOR. Drug distribution and sales is a massively lucrative business, and extremely expensive to combat.

What if we were to take ... for the sake of argument, let's say half ... of what we spend on that ""war.""  And instead of using it to incarcerate millions of young black men, we used it to fund drug rehabilitation? Or we used it to fund those treatment centers you reference?  Or any manner of positive, community-based organizations which exist to help people in these terrible situations?  Anything except putting more people in prison to train them how to be career criminals (of the violent type).

I have no illusions about the dangers of drugs.  However, making it illegal to have and to use them only creates criminals out of desperate people.  You have thought long and hard about the consequences of having drug habits, and I understand why you would think that prohibition might be a solution.  However, the past 30 years have demonstrated that it isn't.  Why not consider how the black market created by drug prohibition creates the circumstances that destroy minority neighborhoods?  Why not think about what solutions could be had to solve that problem?  If the black market for drugs didn't exist, what could be done with all that money to educate people about the risks of drug use?  

We have essentially solved smoking - use of that perfectly legal drug will basically be gone in a generation.  It wasn't prohibition nor using taxes to drive up the cost that did it either - it was education.

Just because I want to end the War on Drugs doesn't mean I think everyone should be using heroin tomorrow.  I haven't ever used it, and never will (for many reasons, some of which you've articulated).  However, my feelings about it and my choices about it are immaterial, and I don't want coercive laws to be made enforcing my preference.  "	1	0

Drug selling is a business like any other. The law of supply and demand governs the price. If the price went up, the ""so called"" recreational users would be the first ones to drop out of the market. Hardcore users would still need their fix, but if (even using crime to generate income) would either opt for rehab, or are more likely to get caught by the police during one of their criminal activities.

My suggestion regarding you volunteering at a place that deals with addicts was for you to get some real world insight into drugs and their consequences. The way you speak it sounds like you have never encountered anyone on drugs, either than what you have seen in the movtion pictures and/or documentaries, or what you have read about.

FYI, your comment about the incarceration young black men could be viewed as racist, although I am sure that was not your intent. From experience, drugs know no racial boundaries, and the prisions are full of people of every race, creed and color.

Your comment about solving smoking made me laugh. It is not correct, but it is funny. Smoking will always be around chiefly because the government make so much money from it that they will not sacrifice the revenue stream.

Granted, the reduced health care costs down the track would more than offset the revenue stream loss, but it would also be political suicide for the party that ""solved"" smoking.

As much as you think you know about the dangers of drugs, until you've stood face to face with someone freaking out on ice, you know far less than you think. Personally, I've been there and done that.

People have known about the dangers of cigarettes since the 1950's, but still billions (perhaps trillions) of packs are sold every year.

Education will not stop an addict from using. It will also not keep young people from experimenting.

50 percent of federal prisoners are drug offenders.  38% of federal inmates are black while they represent only 13% of the general population - thus: black men are over-represented in the prison population by 300%.

The majority of drug offenders are white males, however, the majority of drug offenders who are imprisoned are black males.

False, it does not ""continue unabated"".  In the last 20 years, drunk driving fatalities have declined 36% and among those under 21, by 63%.  Since 1982, drunk driving fatalities are down 50%.  Education works, it just doesn't work quickly.

Have you considered that the reductions cited are not necessarily due to education? When I was younger, drunk driving even when there was a fatality was treated more like a misdemeanor than a serious crime. In the past 20 years, the penalties for drunk driving have significantly increased and the rate of enforcement has also increased.

The laws of supply and demand govern prices in a purely free market. A black market is not a free market economy, so those rules don't apply.

The law of supply and demand governs every market. In a black market environment, the prices are higher, but those selling the drugs are aware that there is a limit to how much they can charge and still move their merchandise. Pay close attention to the nightly news and when a drug seizure is announced, they will also report the ""street value"". The street value is the price that the drugs would sell for based on current levels of supply and demand within a given country.

What you also may not realize is that one of the reasons that more drugs have not been legalized is that drug cartels do not want them to be, as it would cut into their business.

In the last 20 years, drunk driving fatalities have declined 36% and among those under 21, by 63%. Since 1982, drunk driving fatalities are down 50%. Education works, it just doesn't work quickly.

&gt; Have you considered that the reductions cited are not necessarily due to education? When I was younger, drunk driving even when there was a fatality was treated more like a misdemeanor than a serious crime. In the past 20 years, the penalties for drunk driving have significantly increased and the rate of enforcement has also increased.

This is called ""shifting the goalposts.""  You set the condition of ""it continues unabated.""  When I corrected you that it has in fact reduced by half, you changed the conditions to ""that may not have  happened for the reasons you say.""

I won't have a discussion with you if you can't restrain yourself to friendly discussion for the purpose of clarity.  If you must twist conversations just to give the illusion that you're right, you can have that ""debate"" by your lonesome.

Get over yourself. You're batting 0/3 for your predictions about me.  Again, not that it matters.  A person's argument should be able to stand or fall on its own merits, and not based on the *ad hominem* attacks of the person making them.

May I ask though, why you feel it's a foolish statement? Exhaust has a huge impact on performance, any 'hiccup' in the system will cause your engine to not perform as well. There's a reason Harley has a 1600cc motor that only produces 80hp. Where a 750cc motor from Suzuki produces ~135hp. Sure they are different types of engines, but it just further proves that performance is not #1, or even in the top 10 when it comes to Harley Davidson."	1	0

The reason the claim is foolish is because it conflates the two to be the same thing.   A motorcycle (or any vehicle) being loud provides zero indication on the engine's performance.

One of the fundamental reasons the H-D motor doesn't create as much horsepower is because it is air-cooled.  This prevents it from the high-rpm operation that the water-cooled motor can produce.  Harley's own race platform, the VR-1000, was made into a street bike (the V-Rod).  That bike is water-cooled, and at 1250cc, it makes between 115-125hp (at the wheel, not at the crank).  

Additionally, because H-D motorcycles are all steel and metal chrome (as opposed to aluminum or titanium and plastic or fiberglass), they have significantly more weight.  For this reason, the engines are tuned to produce torque in preference over hp.  The Big-Twin engine (current production) makes between 88-110 ft-lb of torque.  The Suzuki you mention makes about 50 ft-lbs.


Super-bike race-track performance isn't a goal of Harley's Big-Twin engines, I'll grant you. But why should that be the goal of any bike which isn't intending to be that style of bike? and why should that be the measure of a bike's quality?

Finally, just for some context, so we can understand just how silly this entire ""inefficient and loud"" argument is.  



Make | Model | Engine size (cc) | Weight (lbs) | 0-60 time (s) | Power-to-Weight Ratio
---|---|---|---|---|---
Kawasaki | Vulcan 2000 | 2053 | 820 | 3.95 | 0.139 hp/lbs
Victory | 8 Ball | 1731 | 638 | 3.88 | 0.147 hp/lbs
Harley | Road Glide CVO | 1832 | 838 | 3.7 | 0.122 hp/lbs
Harley | V-Rod | 1250 | 666 | 3.59 | 0.173 hp/lbs
Ducati | Diavel | 1198 | 557 | 2.8 | 0.291 hp/lbs

It should be unsurprising that the Ducati is faster than the Harley.  If you look at the serious comparison in terms of weight and engine size, you see that the Road Glide CVO is very similar to the Kawasaki Vulcan 2000, both in terms of weight and engine size.  However, the Harley significantly **outperforms** the Japanese water-cooled bike (despite having a lower power/weight ratio, though this is largely because a 0-60 test would favor torque, not horsepower).

In other words, the arguments that people use to make fun of Harley-Davidson bikes are just not true (at least, not anymore).  Everyone understand that people have preferences, and expressing it as a preference is perfectly fine (e.g. ""I don't like cruizers"" or ""I prefer dual-sports over sport bikes"").  Making shit up to pretend that your preference is somehow proved by some kind of objective deficiency is unnecessary and dumb.  It's enough that you like what you like.

e: added power-to-weight ratios just for giggles, note that the Ducati uses published horsepower info, likely measured at the crank, and not at the wheel (as the Harley data is measured)."	1	0

You are the one who started this ""debate"". I am the one who told you it was getting tedious weeks ago.

If you bothered to notice, I referred to the statistics that you cited as ""cited"", which means that I did not take the time to verify them, but many years ago I had a statistics professor at Villanova who said: ""There are lies, there are damn lies and there are statistics""

Consider the ""real"" unemployment rate in the US as opposed to the pecentage the government supplies (just one example).

As there is no way to verify that my assumptions about you are correct other than your assertion, my batting 0/3 is a bit like Schrodinger's Cat.

I made no attacks on you, merely asserted my opinion based on the facts in evidence and my interpretation.

Seems you are getting a bit hot under the collar, but with eveidence that contradict a point you are trying to make in support of your argument, perhaps that was bound to happen.

If you respond, great, if you don't, that is great too. Read carefully all that I have said, as you may find that the basic tenets of your arguments are deeply flawed.

I'm not proposing anarchy (which is what I assume you mean by ""anarachy"").  I am proposing maximum liberty and Federalism, as expressed in our founding documents.  

The War On Drugs is a 40 year old failure.  The War On Poverty is a 50 year old failure.  The latter has cost us a total of $22 Trillion; and as of this year state and local programs (over 120 different programs) will together add nearly another Trillion.  The War On Drugs has been less expensive (though the costs are more difficult to track).  The human cost of these two programs together has been profound - specifically it's directly responsible for the militarized and aggressive police departments which we see the fruits of in [Furgeson](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-two-civil-rights-investigations-ferguson-missouri), and more recently Baltimore.  It's not isolated by the way, similar DoJ investigations have revealed ""a pattern and practice of civil rights violations"" in [New Orleans](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/nopd.php), Philadelphia, [Seattle](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/seattlepd.php), [Miami](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-releases-investigative-findings-city-miami-police-department-and-officer), Albuquerque, Oakland, Cleveland, Newark, etc.


Before you say it's unrelated, it's precisely because of the incentives set up through the War on Drugs that the police have been militarized in this way.  They are motivated to get drug busts (they get to keep the money, plus federal and state grants for those busts).  In NYC, there were _ thousand ""[stop and frisk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-and-frisk_in_New_York_City)"" interactions with (predominately) poor black youths.  The requirement was ""probable cause"" and all officers reported a reason to believe the youths were in possession of narcotics.  In 90% of the interactions, there were no drugs found.  How is this not a violation of the 4th Amendment right to be secure in their persons?  You can bet that if NYC PD had conducted these frisks on Wall St., the program would have been short lived as a result of the thousands of lawsuits.


In case you think the War on Drugs isn't a complete failure, consider that the ""war policy"" 

* Has not stopped drugs from coming into the country
* Has not stopped people from using drugs (the US is the #1 nation in the world in drug use)
* Has not kept drugs away from schools
* Has not even kept drugs out of prisons

[As of 2012, we had spent a Trillion dollars on it](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/opinion/branson-end-war-on-drugs/).  All we have to show for it are millions of newly-minted criminals who went to prison for decades because of mandatory minimums (because the War Policy dictated we should look ""tough on crime"").

If drug prohibition were ended, and drugs were taxed at a similar rates to alcohol, it would yield $46.7 Billion per year in revenue, and save $41 Billion per year in police enforcement.  That's almost $100 Billion net positive, which is plenty to provide for drug abuse treatment and solve the problem rather than criminalizing people.

And just in case you worry about all the millions who would rush to do newly-legal drugs and have horrible outcomes, have a look at the [actual data from a country that actually did it.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/07/05/ten-years-after-decriminalization-drug-abuse-down-by-half-in-portugal/)  Since you won't bother reading the link, I'll spoil it for you: drug abuse is down by 50% over 15 years.  Rather than locking up 100,000 criminals, they're treating 40,000 people for drug abuse.  Which do you *honestly* think is the more humane choice?"	1	0

The article was from a reasonably good source, however it was very carefully worded. ""The number of addicts considered “problematic” — those who repeatedly use “hard” drugs and intravenous users — had fallen by half since the early 1990s, when the figure was estimated at around 100,000 people, Goulao said."" While claiming it went down, there are no actual numbers cited. Treating 40,000 does not equate to their only being 40,000.

Colorado recently legalized marijuana, and had a marked decrease in crime, although neighboring states have reported marked increases in drug related crime. The phenomenon is known as displacement.
An assessment of Portugal post decriminilization:
Portugal seizing record amounts of Latin American cocaine destined for Europe; a European gateway for Southwest Asian heroin; transshipment point for hashish from North Africa to Europe; consumer of Southwest Asian heroin.

In essence, the decriminilization has made Portugal a hub for the rest of Europe. (displacement)

Of course, the source for that data was only from Yale Law, and what would they know, compared to Forbes? 

Consider how much money is spent keeping people locked up for the rest of their lives, since most states abolished the death penalty. Is keeping someone in a cage for the rest of their life more humane than executing them?

Just as alcoholics will always be alcoholics, drug addicts will always be drug addicts. This does not mean that an alcoholic or a drug addict cannot stop using alcohol or drugs, it simply means that it is likely that most will start using again.

Decriminilization of drugs could make the US Government the de facto largest drug dealer on the planet.

You say you served in the military under Clinton. Ask yourself this: Why was one of Clinton's last official visits to Columbia and what was actually in the cargo hold of Air Force One? Why did Clinton pardon a relative convicted of drug dealing? Why did Clinton set up an office in Harlem? How did the Clinton's, who had legal bills which exceeded their assets (technical bankruptcy) buy a home in New York?

In the final analysis, you are not going to convince that you are right, and I already know that I am. You thought your goading to get me to read the article was clever, so here is the quid pro quo.

If you choose to reply, which you will, because your ego won't allow you not to, then do so and prove my point. I thank you in adavance for your reply, and yes, you are being manipulated.

Were you with the GGMC when your club exchanged patches with the EFMC  or did that predate your patching in?  It is a fascinating history between your clubs and it sounds from your AMA's you were there for a lot of it.  As a history buff I would be interesting to know more about that, and your history with the BFMC.  You should write a book about the early years.  No BS, it's a piece of American history that should be in some way recorded.  Names changed to protect the innocent and all that of course.	2	0

Very interesting and quite amazing your brothers let you do this.  Very cool, I grew up with the avengers and the tribe being very close friends to my dad, sadly most of whom I knew growing up are not alive to this day.  The others have moved out of state, sure you can guess why.  My pops never joined because of me and his big Mexican friend they wouldn't let in, but we stayed around the culture most of our life.  I noticed now a new club has moved into my city and had a problem with what they are doing, so I guess I do have a question.  When they moved into the city they fast patched a lot of people real quick for the numbers...how would you feel if your club did this in a newer territory just to build numbers up?  I feel like the ones that fast patched never earned the respect or loyalty you gain by being a prospect.  Anyways have a great one thanks for all you have shared on here it was really cool to read and enjoy your candid no officer response.	0	0

Someone linked to an episode of the Pack Rat Show on YouTube, but with the nudity edited out. Joel Reed Parker is Pack Rat and he’s currently working downtown with a lovely family. For those that didn’t get to see his show, it was a mix of bizarre videos, rap videos, and clips from B-Movies all thrown together. Like I said, with nudity. 

Joel and I did a live talk show called “Primetime with Robb Zipp and Pack Rat” and it was great fun. We would have all sorts of guests and took unscreened phone calls. Those were the best part. We also filmed some comedy sketches that were so much fun to make. I had to step aside as host, so Pack Rat took over hosting duties and Scare Glow (@ScareGlowMOFO on instagram) took over as Co-host. There was a message board that people would go to and talk about the show, and other random shit. 

That went away after a while and some of the people tried to create other shows in the same style, but it was never the same. 

I think I might have the episodes on VHS, unless they got destroyed. Maybe I’ll put them online, someday. 

As for the current state of cable access, I am pretty sure http://www.hmstv.org/ still let’s you make a show. It’s just that no one really needs to, anymore. YouTube is free and has a worldwide potential audience. The local municipal cable channels are buried deep into the SD network area that no one thinks to look for them.  If you live in the city of Houston, you can take classes and make a show. It might even be a good way to make a better show for YouTube than you’d make on your own. Check them out. 

Since it’s been brought up, I do have a YouTube channel, but I’m not using it as much. There is a video as to why. 

I have a podcast. Just look up The Robb Zipp Show wherever you listen to podcasts. 

I hope this helps everyone! "	19	0

My abbreviated version: I was in the band Inbred Whiteboy with Mel House, who worked at Houston Media Source. At some point, I created 'the packrat show' consisting of odd clips from my embarrassingly large VHS and Betamax library. We met Robb playing at a show somewhere way the hell out of nowhere. At some point, we did a live talk show that started as 'Primetime with Robb Zipp and packrat' and then 'Primetime with packrat and Scare-Glow'. Then we did 'TV Party Tonight!', which was a collaboration between us and other HMS producers such as Thomas Kurzy and Matt Patterson. I'm probably forgetting a lot.

I did very little production(if any) that wasn't my own show so I thank all those guys for letting me wander in every week and host the show!

Mel is out there still making movies, I still talk to him often and every once in a while we try to start up a band until real life takes hold. Matt and Thomas still do some video production on the side, I think. We all have families that take up a lot of our time.

I inherited a bunch of BetaSP tapes that contain various episodes of all the shows that a friend is converting for me that I really need to upload somewhere.

Now I'm a bar manager at the Alley Theatre and the most creative thing I regularly do as of late is noise music shows bi-monthly at Sound Exchange. You can find me on most social media/xbox/psn/steam/etc. sites under packratshow.

Title: **Disputing $600 hospital bill for waiting in ER then leaving**

Original Post: 

&gt; I went to the emergency room at a hospital because I had severe abdominal pain. They checked me in and a staff member asked me to describe my symptoms then have a seat in the waiting area. It wasn't busy but after two hours of waiting I decided to try a different hospital. I told the woman at the front desk I was leaving. A month later I received a bill for $600. After calling to dispute this bill they said that since I told the nurse my symptoms, the charge is legitimate even if I didn't receive any medical services. I've never heard of this before. I was told by a friend that I should wait til my claim goes to collections then dispute it with the collections agency but I am worried it will affect my credit score. Also, when I went to a different hospital, they said I needed surgery immediately. Things couldn have gotten much worse if I had waited longer. I got the surgery and am fine now but I have all kinds of medical bills to pay off now and the $600 charge just seems rediculous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

If they produce it, check each code (you can Google them) to see if they make sense. Dispute any that don't and if you're uninsured, tell them you'll pay no more than the Medicare rate for any that do. They'll probably accept that.

Do not pay any bill until the hospital explains it. You have a right to know what you're being billed for and the rationale behind their chargemaster (the arbitrary table they use to set their rates). Billing for services not rendered, especially if you have insurance, is fraud. 

Be aware that most hospitals use 3rd party collection companies even for bills that arent past due. They are limited in what they can change about your bill. Personnel at that company will represent themselves as working for the hospital, but you can ask if they're with a 3rd party group, and who, and request to speak to someone in the administration at the hospital. Be courteous and insistent. 

Dont be afraid to talk to an attorney if the hospital won't work with you, but they probably will. 

Self-pay collection rates for hospital ERs are usually in the single digits (5% is common). Most hospitals are quite happy to accept anything they can get. However, the main reason for that collection rate is that 99% of hospitals bills are beyond ridiculous in price, sent late (if at all), impossible to decipher, etc etc. The ER bills are often the worst.

The CEO was tripping over himself to refund the money for a patient who left AMA after triage because of excessive waiting.  Although they may technically be entitled to payment, they might waive charges because it looks really bad.  Call billing back and escalate up the  department and see if you catch a sympathetic ear.  Telling the tale of ""I needed urgent surgery and you failed me and I had to go elsewhere"" might actually work, maybe."	66	0

The customer has an intent to pay for and receive a service, now if you choose to make them comfortable while they wait that's probably good for business, but it's certainly not the service they agreed to pay for and you can't unilaterally change a transaction without informing the customer.	15	0

Regarding waiting...do not wait for it to go to collections. The collection agency makes money when they collect from you. If they do not collect, they do not get paid.

Adding that collections may add 20-33% collection fee, plus any court costs they incur if they file suit against you."	7	0

When a patient is triaged they are assigned a level of acuity, those levels of acuity are billable and is what he would be charged for. Once he is triage he has been assessed by a nurse, who is a health care provider. A stable level 3 patient is charged less than a level one patient that is actively dying.

We paid all bills we received. Three years later we start receiving collections notices about a bill for $600+ saying we owe the emergency physicians group this money. The emergency physicians group had apparently gone out of business and been rebranded when the hospital changed names and possibly ownership. 

I politely ask them to send us proof we owe them money and they just keep sending us an invoice with no details stating we owe the physicians group money. 

I'm basically ignoring them since they won't provide proof, and it doesn't bother us because I make enough to get loans like refinancing in my own but it's now hit her credit. Do I just make a complaint with the credit bureaus? I don't even know if we legitimately owe them money which I would be happy to pay but I'm assuming it's nonsense with billing records or something in the business shutting down, seeing as how we never received a regular bill until collections started. 

They actually told me to contact my insurance to get details instead of providing them directly.

I had a similar issue where the creditor kind of fucked up and I agreed to pay everything that was owed 100% upfront, and they said that would cancel the interest and fix the credit ding.

I had to reach out to all three a year or two later when I realized this fact, and make a statement explaining what happened. If I recall, they all had online forms, but they were limited to like 500 characters or something, so I had to REALLY condense my explanation to the best of my ability.

I think one of them reached out to me to ask another question, and maybe another contacted me after a month and said they needed a little more time to continue reviewing. I don't think I heard anything from the third. After a while the incident was just gone from all three."	10	0

Edit: he learned this from a friend that made a living helping people fix their credit score. He posted about it on FB and I decided to try it. I got everything in collections removed from my credit. I forget the reason you use when disputing, but the most recent one I just put I didn't know what it was for (they have pre-made options to choose from)"	2	0

Usually a doctor (or group) is contracted by the hospital and not a hospital employee (with the exception of residents and doctors whose private practice is part of the hospital) so why you may have paid your hospital bill, you may not have paid the bill for the doctor.	1	0

Some states are a little different; NY for example is more highly regulated and may have more rules around what hospitals can and can't do. Financial aid programs may be different from state to state as well. But in terms of the way charges are coded and prices for those codes assigned, in general yes, all states work the same way.	1	0

I'd *not* want to bet on somebody with severe abdominal pain being what is getting them a level 2 *not* shifting up to level 1 (""In need of immediate life-saving intervention"") if just left to sit in the *not busy* ER for a while...

&amp;#x200B;

Though, admittedly, OP's idea of a not busy ER doesn't necessarily match ours--I suspect I would not be wrong if I said that we'd both agree that a not busy time at the ER would not just be few patients, but a pleasant lack of anybody who'd be level 1.  OP might just go with 'few patients.'"	1	0

You are on the hook for the debt, even if it gets sold off.  Debt get sold off for pennies on the dollar to smaller debt collection agencies.  If it's old enough, and not worth the agency's time suing you for, it'll eventually wind up with some bottom-feeder agency who will harangue you by telephone until you send them a demand to only contact you by postal mail (which is your right).

What **does** happen is two timers are running out on this debt.  One is your state's statute-of-limitations for the type of debt you hold.  The other clock is the one that limits how many years credit reporting agencies can take into account / report negative info (~7 - 10  years... varies... bankruptcies stay on your report longer than just defaulting on a credit card).

Once the state's SoL clock has run out, the general advice to to not pay the debt.  The collection agency no longer has any legal way to get the money from you through courts and garnishments if you haven't been sued by then.  By the time the state SoL has run out, in most states you're also pretty damn close to the credit reporting clock also no longer allowing it to impact your credit score / report.  Technically you still owe the debt; there just isn't any way to sue you for it and it doesn't hurt your credit any longer when it rolls off of your report.

Caveat: if you **do** make payments on a debt, you can keep resetting the SoL timer in some states.   If you've got larger, newer debts (that are legit and worth suing you over), trying to run out the clock on them can put you in worse shape.  i.e., if you made a payment on a 5 year old debt for the first time last month, you may have just reset the SoL timer to zero when you did that.

Your post made me emotional because I just moved here from out of state, from a notably “kind” place, and the experiences I’ve had in this area have made me feel a bit sad and as if people around here are just thinking of themselves to get by. I work in social services, and it’s totally understandable given the lack of resources in the rural areas where I work. 

Your post made me happy to see, and I just want to honor the courage and love that it takes to stay open in that way despite everything else."	5	0

My husband and I are foster parents. We adopted our son (now 6) and are about to start fostering another little boy. We are hoping to adopt again if the opportunity comes along. 

I am so happy for you all. You and your siblings deserve all the love you are given. You all have worth and you matter. We can’t choose the family we are born in to but sometimes we get blessed by kind people who love us just like their own. 

My father hasn’t made the best choices in his life but my brother and I had others in our life who stepped in and showed us love. There were times I was angry because my dad wasn’t there but I look back now and am grateful for the love that other people showed us.

It makes my heart happy to read this post. Thank you so much for sharing it. I wish you all a lovely life together."	18	0

It’s a shortening. Here’s the full one in case anyone ever bothers you with it: “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb” - it means the exact opposite of what most people imply it to mean.

By adopting you, your mother is making a covenant with you.  She is your family, through the blood of the covenant, not the water of the womb.

Congratulations all of you!"	353	0

There is a quote I like and I can say *from experience* it holds true more than any other:

""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb."" 

Keep that in mind, family IS something we can choose and family is those who love us and support us against all odds. Your mom seems to be doing just that, congrats on your new family may you enjoy a hundred years of that love, care and support and forge memories to last the ages."	2	0

But you became a real family when you all started to love and respect each other. Yes we all hate rules, but we have to follow all different kinds of rules all our lives. And starting to follow new rules is hard. Making the adoption of all of you means it would break her heart if you guys were moved to another home.

You are so totally lucky. I know you must have went through a lot of pain getting to where you are at. You deserve this happiness. You have to always remember, when things are a little choppy and you are mad at your mom, all of the tremendous difficulties she endured to keep you all as a family. Pray for her health and sanity daily. 

She sounds like a great person; young, single, and financially able to comfortably raise five kids. Sounds like she could have done anything, had her pick from many fine men, could have chosen from life’s many frivolous endeavors. She CHOSE to be with you and your family. She is one in a million. Cherish her. 

I speak from experience from the other side of outcomes. My mom was my mom’s mom until i was six when my mom became my foster mom then my mom became my mom. She is a narcissist and every day sucked beyond belief."	1	0

So some people just use the original because it is all they have ever known (its in writing and stuff) while the newer one is used by those that have found it. 

The original first appeared in German in the 1180s while the longer didn't appear until around the 1900s and there are no sources of where it came from. 

But I agree, I'm glad they found a family and they are certainly family."	66	0

1.Having five kids as a sigle parent is super hard.
2.It's good practice for being in a relationship someday. 
3.Showing gratitude and thankfulness is good for your emotional growth. All real men know how to express both.

You can be your own roll model and a father figure to your younger brothers. You are all they have to look up to as far as that goes. Be your best self and trust in your gut to tell you what choices to make. You can learn all that ""dad"" stuff on YouTube and teach it to them. 

You on are on the verge of becoming ""the man"" of the family. That's not a scary thing when what most people need from the man of the house is love, support, and to feel like they have somebody in their corner who is proud of them.
Always tell your sisters how capable they are and that you're there to listen if they need you. 
You'll be walking them down the aisle at their wedding one day because you are the one man  they can count on."	2	0

In terms of the age gap, there are some biological parents out there with a similar gap, and a lot of them are wonderful. This is just my opinion, but I think age really is just a number, it all depends on the person. If she is right for you and your siblings, then her age means nothing at all. 
Maybe one day she will meet someone and you might have a father figure too, but for now, it's utterly fantastic that you have someone who wants to care for you guys permanently. And it means she can get breakfast in bed on mother's day AND father's day (my mother found it adorable when I did that as a kid, so there's a little suggestion for yah).

Best wishes for the future, I hope things continue to be positive as much as possible 😊"	1	0

She is AMAZING! There is no difference between her and the birth mother. Except she didn't physically give birth. Her first name is Stephanie and she not only has adopted her son, she is in the process of attempting to adopt two little girls ABOUT THE SAME AGE. Plus she helps with the local foster systems by fundraising and support. Stephanie is the epitome of generosity and love. I'm sure you new mom will love and care for you like my Stephanie loves and cares for her children. I am so happy with you and your siblings and I hope you keep us updated. Best of luck.	1	0

Thanks for sharing I needed this. I’m quite worried about our age gap. People are quick to judge and I’m worried people will make fun of me at school or whatever.	2	0

This seems like a planted post from the mother but I hope it’s real. What 13 year old writes that perfectly with punctuation? I didn’t. If it’s real cool and I’m happy for you. 

My mom and 2 siblings were adopted from birth - all had defects at birth or unfavorable circumstances, all fared well in the care of my loving grandparents. I think 4 kids for a single 26 year old is sketchy af and does she work? Cause seriously this seems suspect but I do wish this “child well” and good call being 13 cause you can use the internet. Well thought out. Idk kid. Idk."	1	0

I took my time writing this. Usually I don’t and I make a lot of mistakes. You don’t need to believe me. I wrote it because I was just happy and wanted to share it and my friends didn’t think it was a big deal but it was for me. I didn’t expect so many comments/upvotes and awards. Also we are 5 kids total not 4 and yes she works. I have no idea why a 26 years old wants to care for 5 children that isn’t hers, she could have her own kids so it doesn’t make sense to me either. It’s odds but I won’t complain to be with my siblings and we’re happy there.
I’m happy that your mom and her siblings had their loving grandparents to raise them. We still have our grandmother but she didn’t take us."	1	0
