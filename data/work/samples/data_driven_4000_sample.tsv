And on one level, we are. I've heard it said that tikka masala is the UK's national dish, which is great, but one wonders if that would have been possible without the colonial history. I doubt it very much, as you say. Does Britain like tikka masala *as an emblem of Indian/Pakistani culture,* or is it just a tasty dish that became mainstream? That's the distinction between cultural appropriation and cultural diffusion, IMO. And to answer that question, you have to look at power structures. Is the power structure just picking and choosing cool and exotic elements from the ""other"" culture? Or actually willing to share power with recent immigrant heritage? I know the head of state in Ireland is part Indian, and the mayor of London too, so that combined with my general ignorance about British (isles) demographics would make me not label tikka masala as appropriation. But I think that thought process should take place."	1	False

You've replaced voting with giving eligible candidates money which doesn't seem like a positive change.

Additionally, the plans you linked don't actually prevent people from simply refusing the democracy dollars in favor of corporate sponsorship. Because of this, for democracy dollars to effectively remove corporate influence in democracy, the amount given should outstrip any corporate donations. Unfortunately, by definition, it cannot as taking the democracy dollars means the candidate must agree to limit their total campaign funds, while candidates who forgo democracy dollars will have no such limit.

Finally, democracy dollars does nothing to stop the biggest issue with campaign finance; Third Party Political actions groups. If I remember correctly, this was brought up in the other CMV thread you mentioned. No matter what you do to limit the candidates themselves, there is nothing stopping third parties from pouring significant amounts of money into supporting the candidate of their choice, as long as they don't actually coordinate or work with the candidate."	4	False

Here is the problem, If you assume that Afghanistan would ever be a mirror government of the US you are wrong and thats been a criticism of mine with the current US effort is its trying to create a mirror government. What would appear in Afghanistan under the best of circumstances is a bit of a Republic with an oligarchy run by tribal forces and this would partially be done by legitimizing warlords into politicians and basically forcing them to play nice. Honestly Afghanistan is a tricky problem because it hasn't really had self rule since middle ages, Its not that its ungovernable (The moghuls actually ruled it with no problem). The problem lies in that we all too often discount the cultural differences and the problems of what they want vs what we want. So yes for americans its ungovernable, but for the Afghani people its not, so basically building a working system for them is up to them, but we need to be there to help ensure stability and build up the economic ties.

&gt; we'll never actually have a stable ally in the region from which we can fly missions elsewhere,

We already have  afew of those, but they also do things we don't like.

&gt; disrupt China's access to mineral routes, and extract those resources ourselves

Well we don't actually want to persay disrupt their acess or even extract it ourselves, what we want is for Afghanistan to have more incentive to sell to us and work with us than with china. Remember what we want is a thriving afghanistan, not a banana (or in this case opium) republic. That would by far be more valuable to us than just being able to take any resources we want, namely because the current world order is based more on building those economic ties to stop wars than it is to actually play those wars out.

&gt;to maintain our control over the gulf monarchies.

Here is a common misconception, we don't control them, we support the least worst option and that's a tricky line deal with. What I'm suggesting is by creating a stable nation whos wealth is more diverse than simply oil we are more likely to actually reduce the entire regions reliance on that single resource, and it will enable more economic diversity. The reason we support the monarchies is because those nations are such single resource economies. Think what the UAE is doing by diversifying like they are, thats what we want, because it removes the power base from the more extreme elements who would only have to take the oil wells to suddenly become regional powers, if you reduce that reliance then you take away that power and change the whole regional structure. Afghanistan represents one of the few nations in the middle east that has not only the natural mineral resources, but the land resources to form a more diverse economic base than reliance on oil. Stabilize and grow it's economy and you actually have more of an effect on the rest of the nations than anything else we could do.

&gt; we'd need an unprecedented American involvement to win the local fight.

Not just American, we need full NATO involvement honestly, and we need to convince the other nations in the coalition of our plan so their companies are willing to invest in Afghanistan. As I said, Afghanistan is a clusterfuck that was a horrible (but honestly needed choice to go into) its the most complex area in the most complex region, but the reason it's the ""graveyard of empires"" is because it's also incredibly attractive.

&gt;The country will remain just as ungovernable if we leave; if anything, it will be even more chaotic, or, if the Taliban takes over, closed to foreign intervention at all.

Thing is Russia and China often don't care about going in and simply taking what they want. China has been doing it in war torn areas of Africa since the late 90s. They go in, make a deal with a warlord, and then enforce it themselves with either their own troops or the warlord's troops. Russia is hardly above the same. Chaos to them isn't a bad thing or a hindrance, it just means less organized opposition.

&gt;The real threat, in my mind at east, is Iranian-funded radicals gaining significant leverage in the country and using that leverage to make trouble for US allies in the region.

Well it depends, honestly the Iranian deal actually really opened up US Iranian relations, If we were to play our cards right Iran could be a valuable ally. There has been on a governmental tipping point for almost a decade, and there populace is far more pro western than the older generation, so with good faith diplomatic efforts there as well as efforts in Afghanistan we could potentially sway both nations to a different diplomatic view. I think its important to remember that Iran's and the US's economic interests are often far more inline with one another. Once again we all know it's a clusterfuck, but leaving really is the worst option on the table because it removes a large part of our ability to influence the region, and hands that to Russia, China, and Iran. By staying there we have more influence in the longer run on both Afghanistan's new government, but also on Iran so we can force them more to US views and stop a Iranian Russian alliance.

On the other note - do you even image how immortality would affect already existing problem with economical gap between people? Those who do have money will have nearly infinite time to multiply and enjoy their capital, while those who are struggling right now will not see any difference because even 1k years will not make it possible for them to amass wealth that would close the gap (even assuming that gap will not widen).

I’m glad to hear that, even if I’m not sure I have the words to change your view.  

&gt; But in today's world I feel stunted by other moms around me, whether they are complaining about the children (and for some reason I never hear about the positives of kids from them, they always say things like ""Never have kids, you will regret it!"" Even if they are doing so in a joking manner) or I get to pick up the extra slack from them at work simply because they use their children as an excuse.

If you are doing more work than your colleagues, that should be recognized. If you continually pick up the extra slack, have you thought of documenting it and speaking to your supervisor? I’m not sure this is a generalizable issue. 

Are you solely concerned about working mothers? Or SAHMs as well? Because if your interaction is just with annoying coworkers who only talk about one topic, it sounds similar to coworkers who always talk about sports, or one who are just negative all the time. No one likes the cynical pessimist at work who just torpedoes people’s ideas and doesn’t want to improve. It’s unrelated to motherhood. 

The mothers I know are capable of being functional human beings at work. Outside of accommodations for nursing, once they return to work they seem capable of functioning normally.

When you discover that you’re wrong about something does it change your view? If yes, then it seems your view should change. If being wrong doesn’t cause your views to change, then it doesn’t matter to you when people say you’re spelling a word wrong in the first place does it?

So I guess in a way, either way, you can’t go on believing that people can’t go on correcting each other’s spelling. 

Irony aside, there’s a cost to society at large changing spelling, disagreeing on spelling, incorporating secondary meanings and tolerating confusion generally. 

Once that cost has been paid, it’s fine to allow each other to use the multiple senses of a word. But resisting that change in the first place has a concrete value—even if measuring when that line is crossed is difficult.

So, if it was not a high-stakes situation for me (there was nothing that I was actively trying to lose or gain, my mother had already died and I wasn't trying to fool anyone about my feelings - if someone asked me I was open about how I felt), and I was not consciously trying to conceal how I was feeling (which I wasn't; as I said, I was open about how I felt, it just didn't translate visually), but I was very aware of how I felt (again, we have covered this), then there is very little possibility, if any, that I would have exhibited microexpressions.

""A number of experiments have conducted with both undergraduate volunteers and police officers playing a computer game where they must choose whether to shoot or not to shoot a target who may be white or black, on the basis of whether or not they are armed. Such studies find that participants made slower and less accurate decisions on whether to shoot an unarmed black target than an unarmed white target, and were quicker and more likely to correctly decide to shoot an armed black target than an armed white target.""[1]

Clearly having an objectified conception of ""black people are dangerous and that interferes with my ability to decide if they are armed and if I should shoot them"" is a huge negative. Especially if the viewer is a police officer. This is a case where a false positive thrown by an objectification heuristic means life or death for the subject.

Thus, ""I think objectification is an integral part of how we interpret visual information, thus there's no inherent harm in objectifying people. CMV"" seems to have problems when confronted by these real scientific studies that examine visual information and objectification.

No, it's about acknowledging that the majority groups have had better chances and opportunities, on average.

&gt; It goes against meritocracy.

Here's a way of preserving meritocracy: only apply affirmative action to all remaining candidates of equal suitability, e.g. at the end of the interview process, or after looking at their academic prerequisites. E.g. if the last 3 candidates for a job end up with the same scores after all interview rounds have finished, the company could choose the person who would improve diversity in their company culture (i.e. based on minority membership.) That way, no one's merits are disregarded.

&gt;  I dont care if the board of a brand has every tone of melanin or reflects the gender distribution in the real world. A woman or a man of color or whatever is not more or less qualified for a job because of their chromosomes/nationality or color of their skin. If they have the job it better be because they earned it. It is good to have diferent perspectives but it doesnt come from melanin or chromosomes. 

No, but a diverse workforce makes a company more successful:

* http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter
* https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity

Skin color or chromosomes are obviously not the cause of this success, but they can be treated as proxies for diverse thought and ideas. The idea is that if you hire a mix of men and women of various races etc., you are *much more likely* to get a diverse mix of thought and ideas, than if you hired 20 straight white men.

It is tough to argue that you are able to bribe anyone with such a small amount of money and while there are people that can not afford that kind of donation, the difference between what rich people can donate and what poor people can is not that large.

The issue comes from what a person can do with their own money that supports a candidate but isn't directly given to them.  If I choose to send out fliers or put a TV spot that supports Senator Smith, that obviously helps him and will make him care about me more than someone who does not.  You can't stop that, though, without severely harming the 1st Amendment.  The government allows me not only protection in things I say (free speech) but also things I print (freedom of the press) and any law that would limit the amount I can spend in support of a candidate that I support would be trampling on my ability to freely express myself without government limitation.  

People _must_ be allowed to speak out in favor or against a candidate for democracy to work.  It's easy to say that a corporation has too much power, but what about other lobbying groups?  Should unions not be able to put out ads that say one candidate is better than another?  Should charities or other non-profits be prohibited from talking about which candidate supports their mission?

However, the Bible, while taking place in an ancient society, still took place in a society. While I agree that the religious fluff that came with the xenophobia of the era offers nothing to us now, the Bible still offers countless lessons about basic humanities. Yes, there are people who take the word of god seriously, but in a large portion of the bible, the word of god is just basic common decency. Admittedly there are things  that could be omitted today, but across most bible studies, what's focused on are the universal messages told by something like the parables (about things like giving or kindness etc.). And these can in fact be applied to modern society. And again, the Christians you think of are very conservative and don't reflect the majority of Christians who reference the bible for lessons on just having common sense. The bible taught us to be against gays, but the bible also taught us how not to be assholes. And at the very least the latter can be applied to modern society.	7	False

You gotta keep reading:

&gt;In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992), the Court overturned a statute prohibiting speech or symbolic expression that ""arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender"" on the grounds that, even if the specific statute was limited to fighting words, it was unconstitutionally content-based and viewpoint-based because of the limitation to race-/religion-/sex-based fighting words

and

&gt;Incitement is a related doctrine, allowing the **government** to prohibit advocacy of unlawful actions if the advocacy is both intended to and likely to cause immediate breach of the peace. The modern standard was defined in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), where the Court reversed the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader accused of advocating violence against racial minorities and the national government. The Ohio statute under which the conviction occurred was overturned as unconstitutional because ""the mere abstract teaching of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action.""[4]

That certainly comes from his field, but it's also just a very interesting lens on issues that seem to be dominated by people looking at groups and abstract identities. Instead, as a psychologist he's arguing these issues from an internal, individual perspective and that really adds something to the conversation.

Interesting. I've never heard him speak much but this idea of him bringing the internal perspective whereas most experts in this field think about these issues externally lends credence to his contributions to this field. You earned a !delta.

&gt;You don't need a degree to be an expert in something. And there is value to approaching questions from different fields and backgrounds, not just the field that claims the question.

In my mind if he was really this interested in post-modernism, he should have collaborated with like-minded experts on post-modernism i.e. like the analogy of a biologist and a physicist working together to produce a synthesized product. Arranging collaborations through networking at conferences isn't as sexy as ""owning reporters"" on cable news. That and given he has a patreon account, I can see why he has a vested interest in keeping himself in the spotlight of the mainstream. I'm just getting really tired of these pop scientists. 

&gt;Science is all about judging the arguments rather than the person or the speaker and it's undeniable that fields sometimes get in ruts where they all coalesce around certain biases. Further, many of the fields he's talking about are not exact sciences. They are areas that still remain largely subjective despite good efforts by their professionals otherwise.

In an ideal world yes. But we have a limited amount of time to talk about a limited number of subjects. And let's assume that because he has this limited knowledge of post-modernism his arguments are a little bit dated or simplistic. Because he is presently the loudest voice in the room thanks to his superstar status, he is basically forcing the conversation among other post-modernists to regress to his level, and that seems unfair to the experts who give their adult lives to study their specialty. 

Yes he has the freedom to do whatever and say whatever, but I don't think he is using his voice appropriately. I'd much rather see him behave like essentially every other scientist who is interested in cross-cultural research, and get off of the 15 mins of fame on TV, and go through the awkward process of networking at conferences and emailing like the rest of academia does.

I see where you're coming from even though I fortunately can't relate. You seem frustrated at being applauded for going through something horrible and people romanticize it. 

The reality, though, is that some people are actually rape survivors, and their rape was an act of violence where their life was genuinely in danger either by a crazed attacker in an alley or someone threatening them for sex. I feel as though it isn't fair to those survivors of their rape stories to be marginalized as simply a victim versus someone who overcame a terrible situation while they were in danger.

Look at the model predicted by Nate Silver's team at fivethirtyeight.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/

It already prices in a likely Biden win in SC, yet still predicts (for now) that the most likely outcome is a Bernie win that avoids a brokered convention.  (I am somewhat shakily assuming that the model currently predicts Biden will stay in if he does in fact win SC.)

Now, I know that despite their good track record for general elections, 1) models aren't divine oracles and 2) this is a brand new model they are trying out for the primaries.  However, I can't hope to convince you of a *definite* outcome, so I'm only hoping you concede that, if Nate Silver's model says so, then the possibility is at least plausible.

I'm not talking about censorship; I'm talking about personal filtering. I'm describing how I choose to use words, not enforcing this upon anybody else. We all filter what we say, of course, because unending streams of consciousness are not a useful way to communicate.

&gt; For example, it's OK to encourage someone to be racist but not OK for them to mistreat somebody because of their race.

No, it's not okay to encourage someone to be racist. I don't understand how you think it can be. For a start, someone holding racist views will lead them to engage in racist actions, but even if it weren't that overt, unconscious biases lead to discriminatory actions so even unconscious racial biases aren't to be promoted.

I'm talking about its usage under slavery, which continued under segregation - the word was used by white people to describe a group that they universally viewed as inferior. So it's always had a negative meaning. That meaning has not disappeared.

The word ""nigga"", which I would argue is distinct from ""nigger"", is being reclaimed by some black musicians and people, and the comparison to ""queer"" is apt. But I'm white and I was assuming the person saying the word was also not black. If ""nigger"" is controversial to you, substitute ""negro"", which is under no attempt to be reclaimed."	2	False

If a bureaucratic institution that costs money and has a larger margin of error can't prove that it's actively better than a simpler way, it should be done away with both according to responsible budgeting and according to Occam's Razor.    

But once again, you ignore the other arguments I made and made only defensive rather than offensive arguments, so I'll hammer it in a little more.   

In a Swing State, voting is different than in other states. In a Swing State, you vote for the candidate that ""can beat"" the candidate you like least, and it becomes illogical to vote third party, making transfers of power even more slow and unreasonable. Then in states that aren't swing states, it's actually reasonable to vote for who you really want, but you'll feel as if your vote is nullified more or less.   

By discouraging voters in these ways, either making them feel responsible to vote for something they don't want or by making them feel as if their vote is nullified, we lower voter turnout.   

But specifically what voters are the most discouraged and left out? The ones that don't fall under the Republican+Democrat system... And honestly, that's about half of voters being alienated. This isn't 45/45/10, where the majority actually supports these parties. It's a system where about half the people are disenfranchised and support neither, and we actually have minority rule while alienating the majority of voters.  

That is, definitionally, not democracy. It leads to a system where the representatives/president do not support or represent the people.   

Why is it most important for the Presidency? Because people are ill informed about how plausible it is to get real representation (independents of their views) into Congressional office mostly due to the unbeatable dominance that main parties have especially at the presidential level.   

Democratic engagement, the ability to shift control, and representation by or for majority are key points of a democracy and the U.S. in general. Therefore, a system that has an unbeatable (according to Nash Equilibrium) bias for the status quo is undoubtedly NOT Democratic.   

Senate voting is undeniably different. Independents can and do make it into the Senate, and small voter pools for Senate (especially on midterm elections) mean that people are relatively more likely to vote for someone they want in Senate. It also doesn't have the influence and effects I have listed, so there is not an inconsistency with these views. "	1	False

More importantly, though; conjuring up political parties isn't the problem.

The garden of forking paths is a model that says we have free will if, when we go about our lives, we can choose between several distinct futures. We imagine our lives as paths in a garden, and we say we have free will if the path diverges, and we are able to choose between paths. In this view, we have the classic incompatibilist argument:
 
* 1. If a person acts of her own free will, then she could have done otherwise.
* 2. If determinism is true, no one can do otherwise than one actually does.
* 3. Therefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free will.
 
To see why we might doubt this garden of forking paths model, consider a thought experiment by Locke in *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*:
 
&gt;Suppose a man be carried, whilst fast asleep, into a room where is a person he longs to see and speak with; and be there locked fast in, beyond his power to get out: he awakes, and is glad to find himself in so desirable company, which he stays willingly in, i.e. prefers his stay to going away.
 
Does Locke's ""voluntary prisoner"" *act* of his of free will, and does he *have* free will? Locke actually thinks the concept of free will is malformed, but I think that most would say this voluntary prisoner acted of their own free will, but might have reservations about the prisoner having free will. That's odd. One would think that if you could act on some capacity, you surely must have it. Locke asks ""What is will?"" and answers that will is the capacity to conceive of several different actions and scenarios and select some as preferable over others. To have free will is simply to have this capacity unimpeded. To illustrate this, one of my philosophy professors asked another student in class to throw a whiteboard eraser at the board. When she tried, the professor smacked the eraser out of the air. He said ""Me stopping you from hitting the board *does not* remove your capacity to will it freely, this is a classic compatibilist conception of free will. Literally, freely willing.""
 
Now, if you are determined to stick with your definition of free will, I won't be able to convince you. However, I hope that I shed some light on compatibilist arguments, and that you see now why we doubt the garden of forking paths model. In my opinion, the compatibilist view has some distinct advantages. First, I think it handles cases like the voluntary prisoner and my professor's eraser better, in that it offers a great explanation to why we may say that someone acts of free will. Second, I think it's a better model for choice. The garden of forking paths model struggles to explain things like coercion. If you went out to get ice cream and somebody held a gun to your head and told you that they would shoot you if you didn't purchase strawberry ice cream, I think most would say that you didn't have free will even though you technically could have purchased something else. The compatibilist view explains this by pointing out that your will is impeded by threat, and so is not free.
 
The end goal here is not to convince you to switch positions, but understand where the tension comes from. It's coming from a challenge to the garden of forking paths view."	2	False

However, I think this can be easily corrected by sex education. I had the sex ed class when I was younger and they pretty much told us that porn was faked fakeness with fake tits.

I do agree that depiction of sex in porn need a giant flashing sign that says ""THIS IS FAKE YOU MORONS !"".

Also for the heavier BDSM/torture stuff, the irony is that there is such a disclaimer at the beginning and the end. The model pretty much goes through a checklist of acceptable things. It looks less like planned rape and more like Evil Knievel stunt.

So, usually, when a group forms around a particular identity, members of the group create strong boundaries to indicate what behaviors / ideas differentiate members from non-members. 

No ""group"" is going to have a strong identity if anyone can be a member regardless of what they believe / do. And indeed, liberals don't accept every view as ok / valid, otherwise what would be the point of having the group itself if it has no clear meaning / agenda? 

A key value of having an identity group is that you can work together based on your shared ideas to advance your agenda. Often, this agenda isn't much about trying to influence those who actively oppose the group, but rather is about mobilizing those inside the group (or those who are open to joining the group) to work toward certain goals. 

Indeed, for many members, not only are they not really interested in engaging externally, but they also aren't all that interested in putting in work to advance the agenda. Rather, they are just after the sense of belonging and validation that comes from just being a member of that group. In many groups, a widely shared view of what constitutes a ""good"" group member also forms, such that ""bad"" members can be marginalized, cancelled, etc., which increases the psychological value of ""belonging"" (i.e. you've earned your place by being a ""good"" group member).

These dynamics aren't unique to liberals or conservatives, they are common group dynamics that you can see across most strongly held identity groups.

If you do want to engage with those outside the group, that can help your views stay a bit more grounded / realistic. Because when people are inside a strong identity group, their views can get more and more extreme because they are so taken for granted and rarely challenged that their is little reason for people to stop and think critically about what they believe. This is a dynamic called group polarization that can happen in liberal groups, conservative groups, religious groups, and has even been observed as a factor in how terrorist groups form."	6	False

I hope you are still open to changing your view on this, because I think I know where to start:

&gt;Both marijuana and psilocybin have many proven medical uses.

‘A proven use” is not the same as “a currently accepted medical use in treatment the United States”

We can tell this from a 2002 request for putting marijuana under Schedule 3, 4, or 5:

https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/coalition_response.pdf

&gt;Marijuana lacks accepted safety for use under medical supervision. At present, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved marijuana products, nor is marijuana under a New Drug Application evaluation at the FDA for any indication. Marijuana does not have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. At this time, the known risks of marijuana use have not been shown to be outweighed by specific benefits in well-controlled clinical trials that scientifically evaluate safety and efficacy.


So you saying there are proven medical uses, is not the same as what the DEA means, which is that FDA has approved it for use in medical treatment. What DEA and FDA would want to see are multiple well controlled clinical trials (of which I’m unaware of any but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist).

“The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court” — Article III Section 1


“The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, *arising under this Constitution*, the Laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.” — Article III Section 2

These provisions outline the power of judicial review.

We can also look to the words of the individuals that wrote the constitution to see that they absolutely intended these sections to grant the Supreme Court the power of judicial review:

“There is no position that depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do authorize, but what they forbid . . . To avoid arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.” — Federalist No. 78

Also:

“If it is said that the legislative body is themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose, *that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority.*” — Federalist No. 78

Additionally, 

“The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It, therefore, *belongs to them to ascertain it’s meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.*” — Federalist No. 78

So, we have Article III which explicitly places controversies arising under the constitution within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and we have the framers who wrote the constitution telling us that this article means that the job of judicial review (measuring legislative acts against the constitution) is the peculiar province of the courts.

I’m sorry, but to imply it was created out of whole-cloth, that it was a fiction created by the court and not woven into the document and intended by the framers is horseshit.

I will not quote the minutes of the debates at the constitutional convention, but if you look to the minutes taken on July 21, 1787, you’ll see the most spirited day of debate regarding the judiciary and its purpose and place — the idea of judicial review was broached and accepted on that day. I would point to the comments by Governeur Morris, a delegate from New York, Luther Martin, a delegate from Maryland, and Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massachusetts.

The convention considered an actual revision committee, one that would be comprised of both the executive and judiciary to review the laws passed by the legislature to see if they pass constitutional muster but determined the blend of two branches created an impermissible violation of the principles of checks and balances the framers wished to maintain and eventually settled on a sole judiciary with the power of judicial review."	7	False

&gt;Naturally, this qualitative evidence is also somewhat tentative as there is no “smoking gun” proving that the scale effect dominates the substitution effect and that the legalization of prostitution definitely increases inward trafficking flows. The problem here lies in the clandestine nature of both the prostitution and trafficking markets, making it difficult, perhaps impossible, to find hard evidence establishing this relationship. **Our central finding, i.e., that countries with legalized prostitution experience a larger reported incidence of trafficking inflows, is therefore best regarded as being based on the most reliable existing data, but needs to be subjected to future scrutiny. More research in this area is definitely warranted, but it will require the collection of more reliable data to establish firmer conclusions.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The likely negative consequences of legalized prostitution on a country’s inflows of human trafficking might be seen to support those who argue in favor of banning prostitution, thereby reducing the flows of trafficking (e.g., [Outshoorn, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001453#b0235)). However, such a line of argumentation overlooks potential benefits that the legalization of prostitution might have on those employed in the industry. Working conditions could be substantially improved for prostitutes—at least those legally employed—if prostitution is legalized. Prohibiting prostitution also raises tricky “freedom of choice” issues concerning both the potential suppliers and clients of prostitution services. A full evaluation of the costs and benefits, as well as of the broader merits of prohibiting prostitution, is beyond the scope of the present article.

The author of that study acknowledge the unreliability of their data in the conclusion of their own study. Human trafficking is a black market, which by its very nature is extremely difficult to find reliable data on, which means that drawing conclusions on policy from a study that admits they're taking their best guess with available data is... not great. They are drawing their data from reported human trafficking cases, nothing more.

Even then, their study doesn't say that there is a causal effect, only that recorded human trafficking is higher in countries with legalized prostitution.  Correlation, not causation.

This is important, because there are plenty of explanations for their data (besides it simply being incomplete) that are entirely in keeping with the data that would be in favor of prostitution legalization. For example, one of the most obvious is that a country that legalizes prostitution no longer has to devote law enforcement resources to stopping prostitution and can instead devote those resources to stopping traffickers. This in turn leads to higher arrests for trafficking, which with this data set makes it look like there is more human trafficking, when in reality they're just catching more of the traffickers who were already there.

Another equally plausible explanation is that being legalized allows victims of trafficking to come forward without fear of being arrested and/or deported for prostitution, meaning that we have a better grasp on how many cases there are of trafficking, thus leading to a higher number in their study."	74	False

Similarly, trans and cis men are exclusively compatible with occupying a male body / social role, and trans and cis women are exclusively compatible with occupying a female body / social role.

&gt; What I'm trying to ask is whether or not gender identity makes sense, not whether or not it exists. 

If it exists, why does it matter if it makes sense or not? Literally *everything* we now know about how things work was once complete and total nonsense to us at one point.

So how would you feel about penalties being enforced on those who let their guns be used (intentionally or unintentionally) by their mentally ill or unstable children due to negligence in properly securing their firearm?

For example: Bob leaves his gun in his closet when he's not using it. 
Timmy (bob's 15 year old son) takes the gun and kills 10 of his classmates one evening. Due to a new law, Bob goes to trial and the judge sentences him to prison (or revokes his right to firearms) because of Timmy's actions.

Generally speaking, I feel we as a society see most crimes done by the child as the responsibility of the parent. You could argue that this is not exactly Gun control, but I feel like the effect would be the same to a certain degree. "	6	False

It might go that way if you were asked to hand over your phone to the police, then said, ""hold on,"" while deleting the picture then so that it would not be found on your phone. However, at that point, you would be facing other charges as well while also demonstrating a clear knowledge (therefore, intent) of the image. If someone sends you such an image and you delete it, you aren't in possession of it, nor would they really be able to reasonably charge and convict you of it. You would have to do something to demonstrate a willingness to keep the image knowing that it is child pornography. Notably, this is at the federal level and state level laws can and often do differ from each other, but generally things will be similar to the federal laws. Without knowing your actual state, I can't really look at those codes to see how it would work. Generally though, I can tell you that just because a cop says something is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it is. There is a reason why cops are not prosecutors and generally don't get a degree in law. Knowing how to interpret legal codes and precedence set by cases requires many years of schooling for good reason. Police have a very good general understanding of what is illegal, but that doesn't always translate to something actually being illegal. Something to also note is that police (and prosecutors as well) can lie to you in the pursuit of justice.

As for the Julia story, if they wanted to prove that you had ever received the pictures (I assume by text), they could just as well get hold of phone records by providing those companies with a court order. It doesn't matter so much if you ever received the pictures so much as whether or not you kept possession of them. 

Yes, there is also a problem with them necessarily treating her as strictly a victim in such a case, but that is a cultural problem, not necessarily a legal one.

&gt; By definition, this is a cruel and unusual punishment which is unconstitutional seeing as the victim is totally unconcerned with how they were “wronged”, and both the “victim” and the “criminal” were in agreement on what would be done.

That isn't how that amendment works. While it could certainly be considered cruel, it isn't unusual. Cruel and unusual punishment only applies to those things which are both cruel and unusual. A punishment can be especially cruel and still constitutional, or it can be especially unusual and still constitutional. Really, there is a ton of precedence set around this amendment and it itself could qualify as its own form of law if there were enough cases of it simply due to its complexity. Definitions within law are very, very crazy sometimes. A very interesting example would actually be the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky case. Clinton said, ""I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,"" and was technically not lying because the way ""sexual relations"" was defined in that case was such that Lewinsky had sexual relations with Clinton but he did not with her.

&gt; This is very similar to if someone asked to be killed, got killed, and then the murder received a life sentence for it.

This is actually a good example of how there can be problems with simply saying something should be legal because both parties agreed. If I killed someone, but did so after forcing them to sign an agreement that I could, I could get away with murder. By simply saying that you cannot murder someone (obvious exception being self defense), you avoid a whole bunch of problems where the prosecutor has to somehow prove that a person did not agree to being murdered. Given that the most reliable source of that, the dead person, cannot give testimony, it is understandable why that would be so difficult, especially since the only other person or people who may have been party to confirming the agreement could be involved in the illegal act."	1	False

I don't think I agree with his hard indeterminism views, but at least according to Wikipedia, even he agrees that punishment and praise still make sense in his worldview.

> Pereboom nevertheless proposes that forward-looking aspects of blaming and praising, those that aim, for instance, at improving character and reconciliation in relationships, are compatible with our lacking free will.

So in that light, I'm curious what he was saying of your four scenarios. You say you ""adopted them"" from one of his arguments, but I'm not really familiar with that context.

But even through the lens of my (limited !) understanding of Pereboom, it does seem like there's a pretty big difference between your scenarios 2 and 3. For your first two scenarios, the cause of the behavior is so isolated and specific that there's any forward looking reason to punish Bob. The scientist seems clearly the one we want to punish if only to make the future world safer. But once the scientists influence is cut off or expires, there's no reason to be concerned about Bob's behavior at all.

But when you get to your scenarios 3 and 4, Bob seems deeply and borderline irrevocably damaged by either the scientist in scenario 3 or society in general on scenario 4. Even if we hold the hard indeterminist view of Bob's moral responsibility, as a practical matter there's not much to do but either try to rehabilitate Bob or isolate him if that's not possible. But at this point,  Bob still presents a danger and punishing the scientist no longer is going to help with that.

So far starters, I'm trying to reject your idea that there's ""no relevant difference"" between those 4 scenarios, but obviously there's a lot more that can be discussed."	1	False

I'm not sure that's a good example; the Irish language (as well as religious differences) is one of the key reasons why Ireland still has a distinctive culture at all, and Irish nationalism went hand in hand with a revival of the language. This was well known and is one of the reasons why the British historically tried to suppress the language.

&gt;Following and extending the tradition of modernist novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, the plot of To the Lighthouse is secondary to its philosophical introspection. Cited as a key example of the literary technique of multiple focalization, the novel includes little dialogue and almost no action; most of it is written as thoughts and observations. The novel recalls childhood emotions and highlights adult relationships. Among the book's many tropes and themes are those of loss, subjectivity, the nature of art and the problem of perception.

What you consider poor prose is very much artistic intent.

Let's look at a work of art from the year ""To the Lighthouse"" was written, 1927, [this one](http://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/work-1841.php) by Pablo Picasso.

Now, how many ""Art 101"" rules does he violate?  Pretty much all of them.  

Now, Picasso could paint ""normal"" pictures, like [this one](http://www.dailyartdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/792b7ceb05dd2e70b8a3d1c48920a0b5.jpg).  But he decided that he could convey different things by using a more abstract technique, one that breaks all the rules he'd been taught.

The same holds true in Classical Music, if you listen to Shostakovich or Kodaly or Stravinsky, where, again, they start breaking the rules.

After the horrors of WWI, there was a period of breaking away from tradition across all the arts.  Some of it is brilliant in it's own right.  Some of it is admirable simply because the artist explored new ideas, or used methods that no one had previously thought to use.

It's not that Woolf was incapable of writing a plot-driven story with clear prose - but that was never her intent.  Instead, she was exploring different ways prose could be used to create a different experience for the reader than they've gotten from any other book.

Would it be rejected today?  Probably.  Exploring new ground has inherent value.  Rehashing something that's been thoroughly investigated less so.

But it's value is in understanding how it contributed to the evolution of the novel, and reflected its time. "	10	False

There was not a question in this case that Citizens United was allowed to air the ads they wanted to, but rather whether they could be forced to disclose the people who donated money, and put a disclaimer that it wasn't funded by a candidate.

&gt;The FEC agrees that Citizens may broadcast the advertisements because they fall within the safe harbor of the FEC's prohibition regulations implementing WRTL. They did not advocate Senator Clinton's election or defeat; instead, they proposed a commercial transaction — buy the DVD of The Movie. See WRTL, 127 S.Ct. at 2667; 11 C.F.R. § 114.15(b). Although Citizens may therefore run the advertisements, it complains that requirements of § 201 and § 311 of BCRA, 2 U.S.C. §§ 434(f)(2), 441 d, impose on it burdens that violate the First Amendment.

&gt;Section 201 is a disclosure provision requiring that any corporation spending more than $10,000 in a calendar year to produce or air electioneering communications must file a report with the FEC that includes — among other things — the names and addresses of anyone who contributed $1,000 or more in aggregate to the corporation for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications. §§ 434(f)(1), (2)(F); 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9). Section 311 is a disclaimer provision. 2 U.S.C. § 441d. For advertisements not authorized by a candidate or her political committee, the statement ""___ is responsible for the content of this advertising"" must be spoken during the advertisement and must appear in text on-screen for at least four seconds during the advertisement. § 441 d(d)(2). In addition, such advertisements are required to include the name, address, and phone number or web address of the organization behind the advertisement. § 441 d(a)(3).

""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate""

So really it has nothing to do with the American people. 

That said....

Do we want Congress to have the right to remove the president that was selected by the electors? Because then the President's veto power is neutered. (At least potentially) What if it was by 60% vote (not a simple majority) and you can't use any bullshit parliamentary tricks - it HAS to be 60%? That seems palatable to me. Why? Well, let's look at some examples:

1) President is Republican and Congress is Republican 60% or more majority. Then the president must REALLY suck if his own party wants to remove him.

2) President is Republican and Congress is Democratric 60% of more majority. That means a majority of the American people are Democratic - or want Democrats in charge. So from a ""will of the American people"" point of view - seems legit.

3) President is a Republican and Congress is 50/50 Republican and Democratic. If they can get to 60% (which they can't seem to to for anything) then it must be worth it.

&gt; I’m 18, but yeah, whenever I mention that, everyone plays it off as “you’re still young”. Well sure, but I’m obviously miles behind everyone else.

You are still young, and I’d bet you’re miles ahead of plenty of people. However you might be behind your peers. This isn’t the worst thing in the world even though it can feel that way. 

&gt; Not really. I went to my friend’s graduation party the other day, and I honestly felt more alone there than I did at home. They saw me as desperate, and continued to play me off as not worth their time.

You sure they’re you’re friend? 

&gt; I could lose weight, sure, if I starved myself. I’m a picky eater, the few foods I do eat are super unhealthy. I already tried cutting how much I eat, but I’m still stuck at 185 lbs and with a hideous belly. 

So don’t be a picky eater. Food exists to allow you to survive. It’s not meant to be some all encompassing magical experience. Eat so you don’t get weak and die. This means raw vegetables, lean meats, and some basic carbs. Nothing more or less. 

&gt; Don’t even get me started on how hard it it to make my hair both not look like a clump of fur or a lego hair piece.

So go to a professional hairdresser and pay the $50 to learn your ideal haircut and how to style it. 

&gt; I simply don’t think I could have much energy, not without some super medications or buckets of caffeine.

Because you’re depressed, but that’s something that will get fixed when you conquer the main problem. 

&gt; I’m incompetent. Nothing I can do makes me feel capable. Senior year was the closest I had to feeling that acceptance, but that’s over. I don’t get to do school again. It’s the one place I felt I was fighting for a good chance at happiness and achieving my dreams.

Listen here kid, I haven’t met a single 18 year old who wasn’t incompetent. People your age are just barely learning how to function as humans, let alone adults. If you aren’t going to college, why not consider a trade school? What are your dreams that you want to achieve? 

&gt; I’m simply not able to take my family seriously since they’re my family, they have to be nice to me.

No they don’t. I’m a medical student, I’ve seen a lot of shit. Trust me when I tell you, no they fucking don’t. They can very easily hate you. I had a patient come in last week whose dad used her arms to put out cigarettes when she was a kid. Don’t ever take a good family for granted. 

&gt; I don’t want to pursue my hopes again and have them ripped from me due to my incompetence.

This makes it sound like no one ever fails. Ask me how many medical schools rejected me. How many jobs. How many colleges. How many girls. 

I don’t remember the failures. I’m in my dream career, dating the most amazing person, and it’s in spite of my failures. You think I would achieve anything if I rolled over and waited for death when the going got tough? 

&gt; I simply don’t have the capacity to do anything anymore. And even if I can, someone else can always do it better. Literally my most upvoted post was something my little sister made that I posted for her.

Upvotes mean nothing. I burned my last account with over a million karma because it does nothing in the real world. Second, you will never be the absolute best at anything. No one will be.

I agree with the post regarding trying to acquire as much pleasure as possible. 

But, I sometimes wonder if, assuming life has no inherent meaning, what about making the purpose of your life improving the quality of life for others?

Let me explain:

You interact with many different people throughout the course of your days.  Similar to chaos theory, taking the small effort to say hello to someone you pass on the street, tipping well, or helping a person who is carrying a lot of groceries open a door, may set off a weird sequence of events where that person, struck by your small kind gesture, may snap out of a bad mood that may have otherwise gone down a progressively worse path resulting in something tragic, like beating their wife or verbally emasculating their child for a small offense. 

I think sacrificing your entire life for altruism has inherent problems, but taking your ""meaningless"" life in small ways when you remember to and trying to improve the environment around you can have a considerable impact on the course of history that connects to your immediate sphere of influence.  

Or, maybe nothing you ever do changes anything at all.  It ends up making things worse unintentionally.  Not the point.  The point is that you picked an objective with good intentions and reason to believe it was successful and tried to live it out.

For me, it seems like the only way I've found to redeem an otherwise completely useless assignment of time on earth. "	2	False

""By limiting a woman's accsess to public spaces, universities, schools, and so forth you are limiting her right to be educated, her right to government, her right to a fair trial/testify at a trial, and her right to become a good citizen. A citizen in the modern sense is formed by education. Civics is an essence of public schools, and by limiting a woman's entrance to one because of hijab you are now limiting her ability to participate in public life to the point where she cannot become a valuable citizen.""

The top is lose, tuck it in.. but that would be an issue even if the scarf wasn't present. But what about color? Style? Ask your employer to wear a black scarf or a green scarf, and they'll show up in one the same way they would if all employees wore black or green shirts. This isn't an issue.

&amp;nbsp;

You kind of hit the nail on the head. The issue, in modern times, is primarily an issue of consent. How can we as a society, be sure that there is genuine consent in a incestuous relationship?

&amp;nbsp;

Let’s take a step back and look at three other scenarios.

* A Manager sleeping with an employee.
* A Professor sleeping with a student.
* A prison guard sleeping with an inmate. 

&amp;nbsp;

We can easily apply your logic to these and say “oh as long as there’s genuine consent, it’s totally fine”. But the issue is how can the rest of society know if there is consent? 

&amp;nbsp;

As a society, we’ve slowly moved to the idea that if there is an inherent power difference between two individuals, then the alleged consent between them should be looked at with additional scrutiny."	33	False

To the person making the choice, the moment when you need to decide who gets to live. Value of what kind, who has more right or deserves more to live.

With your first point i agree, in terms of the way we see/feel the world we are more aware of the world around us. Our greater intellect is what give us the ability to question, dream and think further. We have more capacity to achieve more than a regular animal.

Please be aware that when I say my pet, don't refer to MY pet (that would make no sense) but of the the pet of the person who needs to make the choice. The difference between an animal in the farm, a random stranger and your personal pet is the emotional attachment or relationship that you have each subject.

So your last point ends up agreeing with me, would be harder to kill YOUR pet than a stranger.

But this is only because of the status of the MPAA, isn't it? And it also doesn't address the fact that my view is based around the fact that the MPAA doesn't have the moral authority to be determine what merits an NC17 rating in the first place.

&gt;You can see this obviously in that movies will do a unrated directors cut and sell it through venues that don’t care about ratings.

Where is the moral justification to forcing creators to water down their product to meet an arbitrary standard simply so they have the opportunity to reach a greater audience? Why should filmmakers have to alter the story they want to tell in order to be allowed to be shown in major theatres? Why can't the audience make that determination for themselves, or at least why should that decision be left in the hands of people who we have no way of knowing if they represent the standards of the general population?

&gt;The MPAA has exactly the right amount of power it’s just that the Theatres and Broadcaster use them to exclude content. Which their not required to do, they do voluntarily.

The fact that the MPAA is run by the biggest and most powerful content producers leads me to disagree with that, because it gives them the ability to suppress content in favour of their own. Even if it can't be shown that they're actually doing that, it shouldn't even be a possibility due to the conflict of interest.

&gt;Any other organization even if it’s perfectly transparent could be used for the same thing. And it’s rating would have equal weight if groups didn’t voluntarily choose to use it.

Transparency is only part of the equation, accountability is the other half. Make it an elected body, or a body whose members are appointed by elected officials. The people should have a say in what kind of content is acceptable for the people to see. "	0	False

Let me focus on this idea that ""you need to establish that incestual attraction is a choice in the same sense that homosexuality isn't"", since it appears to me to be at the core of your objection. We can view what we *commonly consider*, as a society, as under peoples' control as lying on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum are things that *we consider* completely out of our control, such as whether to be be born with congenital genetic disorders. On the other end are things that *we consider* well within our control, such as whether to choose raisin bran over corn flakes for breakfast. Whether the strong determinism that you are assuming is true or not, the way we make rules in society, and the factors we commonly consider in what rules are justified or not justified, is based on a compatibilist view of choice. Therefore, your strong determinism assumptions are perhaps relevant in a theoretical discussion, but not in a discussion about how society determines what is legal or illegal, which is what this discussion is.

So, given that this is a discussion about the kinds of laws that are justified or not under society's compatibilist framework rather than in some theoretical framework, and given that peoples' choice in things in life can be viewed as on a spectrum, let's now compare homosexuality and incest. While sexual attraction falls nearer to the genetic disorder end of the spectrum than it does to the raisinbran/cornflakes end, *acting* on that sexual attraction is commonly viewed as falling *nearer* the raisinbran/cornflakes end than to the genetic disorder end. That's not to say that we are as free to resist our attraction as we are to choose between raisinbran and cornflakes, but just that acting on sexual attraction is *considered by society and by law* to be more in our control than the sexual attraction itself. Now, we can concede that sexual attraction, whether it be homosexual or incestual, and whether it is caused by genetic or environmental factors, is always, to some extent, not subject to our control. However, there are a number of reasons why we feel it is *less justified* to limit homosexual rights than it is to limit incestual rights *within* this framework. For one, the homosexual is attracted to only that one sex, that is, their own. Limiting their right to have sex with a homosexual partner is equivalent to limiting their right to have sex with anyone to whom they are attracted to. I would argue this is not the case with *most* incest attraction. There may be a strong attraction to your sister or brother or daughter, perhaps stronger than to anyone else outside your family group, but there is still the potential for attraction to someone outside your family group. Another reason would be that homosexuality is much more common than ""incestuality"", and it is less justified to limit the rights of a larger group of people than it is to limit the rights of a smaller group of people. There are many more reasons one could come up with, but I think the principle that there are differentiating factors that make up a *part* of the basis for making one illegal and the other not has been shown. And given that there are differentiating factors, it is *not logically inconsistent* to treat the two differently on a legal level.

So, in other words, you can see that one *needn't* ""establish that incestual attraction is a choice in the same sense that homosexuality isn't"" because, even if both preferences are influenced by genetic/environmental factors, there are distinctions *within* how those genetic/environmental factors play out that serve as a legitimate basis for differentiating our treatment of the two."	1	False

For example, with your car, your financing may have additional origination fees that they don't know.  You can decline the ""etching fee"" and if they say no, you can have them take the fee out of the purchase price. And your taxes might be different depending on where you live and where the car is purchased.  Your house example is even better for this.  A homeowner won't know what your loan origination fee will be or how much your insurance will cost; your tax burden will be determined partially on when exactly you buy the house.  You mention this in your penultimate paragraph, but how would you write a law that covers a $10,000 difference ""at most"" between the purchase price of a house and the price you actually have to pay / finance?

2) Sales taxes.  As others have said, in the U.S. we've just kind of sort of decided that tax is added on after the purchase price (except for a few rare product categories like gasoline). When you're dealing with a multiple location operation, taxes might be different from one location to another (because of differences in state or city taxes), so having a general advertisement that excludes taxes and other state fees is inefficient or might even be misleading.

3) Fine print.  Many, many of the examples you've given would be in advertisements with fine print.  Gym memberships often say ""10 per month\*"" and then have lots of fine print after the asterisk.  Because if that is not disclosed, at least in fine print, then there *is* a claim for false advertising.

However, to suggest people are **disingenuous** is disingenuous, and assumes the average person is far more informed about the issue than they are. In the context I just described (politicization), someone knowingly pushing the wrong facts or de-contextualizing them could be, but as is the case with a lot of misinformation, a huge percentage of people unfortunately are just misinformed. A lot of people in every debated issue ever in this country continue to just parrot facts they heard at one point or another that support their opinion, without knowing why those might be inaccurate or misleading.

However, I think your point is a extreme in the sense that gun violence deaths are theoretically preventable. Any method by which deaths can be reasonably prevented should have the proper mechanisms in place to prevent those deaths. You point out drugs - in most cases, drugs that can pose high degrees of harm are highly regulated, and thus the generally the drugs causing the most harm are illicit. Should we stop regulating drugs at all? That's an entirely different debate, but the idea that it should at least be *hard* to acquire things that can pose serious harm is a fair reason to regulate things.

I think the biggest issue here is the country's lack of education on statistics, and how difficult understanding population level statistics can be for the average person. I think most people are morally bound by one side of the argument or another, and end up with knowledge of a handful of facts to support their side without knowing how to process any sort of rebuttals. If gun violence were a truly binary issue, we wouldn't have so much debate over it."	13	False

Along with that I assumed that the mixed American model was just the least efficient because it naturally just got the worst aspects of a government ran system and the worst aspects of a complete free market system, and very few benefits of either. 

As for the welfare benefits, I can see the taxes being an issue. However I am curious as to how the history, demographics and culture could make things more difficult.  Do you think that the cultural diversity in America can get in the way of something like that functioning properly in lieu of some groups benefiting from it more than others thus causing more tension that otherwise would not be as prevalent in a relatively more homogeneous population?

As for the worker benefits, I need to see more reason as to why this would stymie job creation.  Like let’s say companies are required to provide say 6 months of parental leave and pay the employee a fraction of their original pay in the interim.  Would that not create a demand for two new temporary workers to cover for them?  I can see why worker pay would decrease, even beyond the temporary pay reduction from taking the leave policy individually.  But I don’t see the connection to job creation though.  

Overall as to how each fits and if the average American would want that, in light of reading your comment, it seems like a lot of Americans would like something like say a single payer system, more than just a niche crowd but less than a big majority though.  The welfare points definitely seem like they would be most niche, and most inhibited in terms of being implemented.  But I really think that the worker benefit’s particularly the parental leave would still be pretty darn popular.  I think most people on the left want that and I don’t think it would be something too difficult to sell the right on either, as culturally they’re the side that’s very focused on supporting the family and ensuring family stability.  And I’m sure there are some older folks that might not like it just because it’s something they didn’t get to have as younger parents back in the day along with some hyper capitalist libertarian types that will get an aneurysm if the economy runs even 2% less efficiently.

They aren't directly very important, but indirectly, saving them is. From the [WWF website](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/):
&gt; WWF is focusing efforts on a select group of priority species that are especially important, either for their ecosystem...

&gt; * Species which help the stability or regeneration of habitats
&gt; * Species demonstrating broader conservation needs

&gt; ...or for people 

&gt; * Species important for the health and livelihoods of local communities
&gt; * Species exploited commercially
&gt; * Species that are important cultural icons.

&gt; These species fall into two groups:
**Flagship species – iconic animals that provide a focus for raising awareness** and stimulating action and funding for broader conservation efforts

&gt; **Footprint-impacted species** – species whose populations are primarily threatened because of unsustainable hunting, logging or fishing. 
**Strategially focusing efforts on these species will also help conserve the many other species which share their habitats and/or are vulnerable to the same threats.**

They have the right to make medical decisions for an incapacitated spouse.  They get tax benefits.  They get retirement benefits and share health plans.  Buying property together is a bit simpler when a couple is married, as is sharing a bank account, leasing a car, and a thousand other things.

Gay people should be entitled to all of the rights and all of the benefits of marriage, and not just the ones which you very correctly believe are the most important."	5	False

Because if we can choose to see the wrong thing, we can also therefore choose to do the wrong thing. Perception, in other words, controls our reflexes.

You have to be specific when you use the words 'could', 'ability', and 'freedom' though. By saying that we 'can' choose our interpretations of our perceptions, are you saying that this choosing process occurs in a totally uncaused manner? That it's not determined by our current mental structure? According to this comment, I'm guessing you are:

&gt;You can argue that our seeing-as choices are always already determined by outside factors, but it's hard to imagine what those factors might be and I doubt you can logically prove it must be so.

It seems you're claiming that these seeing-as choices are determined by the self, or by the will, but that the will itself is uncaused here, that no prior causes went into shaping it. The problem is that your will being uncaused does not give you free will, it gives you an arbitrary will. If my will or intent is not based on anything, not based on the things I believe, my emotional state, etc, then it's not chosen by me in any way, shape, or form, and that's not free will, since my will would not even be 'my' own. It doesn't matter to what extent a person's will is caused or uncaused, neither option gives us free will.

Moreover, a positive case can be made that these seeing-as choices are always determined by the physical firing of neurons. It's enough to note that everything we think, our motor skills, our phobias, our preferences, can all be changed by altering certain aspects of the brain. But even in absence of this argument, there is simply no way for free will to exist in the first place, it's an incoherent concept, as pointed out above.

When I agreed with you about the fact that we 'can' form interpretations, make right/wrong decisions, etc, that was assuming a realistic sense of the word 'can'. And the only sensible use of the word 'can' or 'able' that I see is as a measure of uncertainty. For example, maybe a rubber ball, if dropped from a certain height on a certain surface, is estimated to bounce back up to a max height of between 5.5 and 5.6 inches from the ground. We would say that the ball 'could' reach a height of anywhere between 5.5 and 5.6 inches, and to say that it 'could' bounce 5 miles high would make no sense; we're measuring the uncertainty of the event. Likewise with the human brain, it only makes sense to say some mental process 'can' occur if that is a possible event within the scope of our predictions, given our knowledge about a person's mind (consider how little sense it would make to say someone 'could' think some thought in a certain situation, if you were capable of scientifically proving they couldn't). So I was agreeing that we 'can' form interpretations, make right/wrong judgments, etc, in that these are possible processes for our brains to perform; processes in which our thoughts oscillate between various ideas, and one idea is eventually settled upon."	1	False

Here's the Merriam Webster definition of terrorism:
"": the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal""

To me, that's pretty clear.  9/11 was terrorism.  They didn't attack strategic targets, they tried to terrorize the US into meeting their demands.  The same is true of, say, the IRA bombings in London, the Boston Marathon bombing, and pretty much any suicide bomber who goes into civilian areas with the intent of killing as many people as possible.

&gt; But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist? Like what do you have to do exactly to be labeled as one? Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group?

Well, yeah, you need to target non-strategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal.  So, if you are just insane and think it's fun to kill people, you aren't a terrorist, just a murderer without a political agenda.  If you try to blow up a military base, you aren't a terrorist, you're a guerrilla fighter..  

&gt;Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? 

No.  The Oklahoma City bombers were terrorists.  So was the Unabomber.

&gt;How many innocent people are falsely labeled or punished? And who gets to decide?

The pursuit of potential terrorists is a different question.  But most people decide that those who attempt to use violent acts to cause fear to achieve political goals are, by definition, terrorists.

&gt;The problem with the war on terror is there will never be an end. 

It's shorthand for ""preventing terrorist acts"", and easier than saying, ""The war on Al Queda, Al Shabab, the KKK, Hamas, and every other group that wants to commit terrorist acts.

&gt;It is the perfect war. Perfect for growing the military industrial complex adding to the increase of mass surveillance, police militarization, drone strikes, and innocents being accused, imprisoned or killed. 

Yes, in the same way that ""the war on crime"" or ""the war on poverty"" will never be ""won"".  But just because you can't declare victory doesn't mean you shouldn't fight it.

&gt;It is a true modern day witch-hunt. There will always be a ‘terrorist’ because terrorism is an ideology.

No, a ""witch hunt"" implies that you're searching for imaginary enemies.  That's simply not true.  There are real live people out there who want to blow up Americans, the more the better.  There are Americans leaving to fight in the middle east who may come back and use what they've learned.  This isn't just some bogus red scare stuff, there are people who want you dead, simply for being an American.

And Terrorism isn't an ideology, it's a tool.  But it's a tool that people are willing to use.

&gt;But as the years go by the word is being more and more loosely defined.

Do you have any examples of this?

&gt;Lets start educating each other about our different viewpoints and cultures.

I don't think that Osama bin Laden planned 9/11 because he felt he wasn't understood.  

I agree in theory that we need to consider the consequences of our actions, and not make enemies needlessly, but we live in a dangerous world.  Dropping all our weapons and welcoming them with open arms would not end well."	15	False

If a preacher says to his very devout followers “God does exist”, he is making a claim which he intends to be objective. His followers will interpret it as objective. But is it really objective? I wouldn’t really say so, since it is not based on any good objective data. I would say that this is more of an opinion than an objective statement. So if it isn’t objective but he thinks it is, then isn’t that similar to what I’m saying about morality? We tend to talk as though our morals are factually correct, but that does not make them so.

Take universal health care. I strongly support single payer health care. I'm not convinced that the constitution allows the federal government to do that. (It might, but I'm not yet convinced.)

Yes, totally. To them, to you and to many people, their feelings and desire not to be treated in a certain way can define your gender. To me, that's a bit light to define a gender because that would make me unable to diffrenciate a gender from anything someone made up for fun or as a coping mecanism.

I also really don't like that way of defining gender because it's too much influenced by opinions and culture. It's pretty hard to convince a man that he is a woman or vice-versa. But convincing someone they are ""non-binary"" because they are unique and don't act the way society expects a man or a woman to behave is much easier.

It seems to me that there's some information encoded in the nature of the promise itself that helps determine if subsequently breaking that promise is evil-in-itself. As a counter-example, there would be some promises that would be evil-in-themselves *to actually carry out*: for example, let's say that you contract me to perform a hit on somebody. It seems like a false ethical dilemma to suggest that a broken promise has considerable ethical weight against an extinguished human life.

The essential difference between the interracial marriage issue and the marijuana issue is the Constitution.  The Supreme Court ruled in [*Loving v. Virginia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) that states constitutionally may not ban interracial marriage.  States violate the Equal Protection Clause by doing so.  Conversely, states are constitutionally allowed to ban marijuana.  Some states simply choose not to.  And the Supreme Court [has also ruled](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/288/) that legal changes will only retroactively release someone from prison if those changes reflect either a substantive change in constitutional interpretation of a rule or a watershed change in criminal procedure.  Because the repeal of the marijuana bans are politically rather than constitutionally motivated, and because they do not change criminal procedure, they do not have to be retroactively applied.

One of my best friends, one of the kindest, smartest, funniest people I have ever met is a Trump supporter, pro-life, religious person.  I've found political issues do not correlate to a person's moral compass or lack of thereof. We tend to think people who share our own political ideology will be more compatible with ourselves, because we already feel connected to that person through their shared belief. But I met those two people I mentioned above without knowing their political beliefs. Only later did I learn where they fell on the political compass. Overtime, I could see their true personalities clearer and clearer. Even though the first person agreed with me on everything politics, it became clearer and clearer I did not agree with her moral choices. On the other hand, the second person who is on the complete opposite of the spectrum has turned out to be one of the best people in my life so far.

That's an interesting question, but it's quite different from the one you asked in the initial post, which was why isn't it the employers' \*decision\* as to whether to provide this benefit. u/KingTommenBaratheon explains quite clearly why it is necessary that employers be required to provide parental leave and not penalize employees who choose to procreate. Many others have made good points about how not having policy on this would lead to discrimination against women. 

But requiring companies to preserve jobs and allow for parental leave/flexible hours doesn't automatically require that the same companies be the source of $$ for the income parents receive while on leave. Someone would need to pay for it, but who? The government could decide that could be paid for through a similar system to healthcare in the UK--taxes, which are then dispersed according to need. Republicans in the US are thinking about doing a version of this by providing families early access to Social Security funds while taking parental leave (robbing from your retirement to pay for parental leave is a horrible idea fiscally, but I digress). 

In the end, though, the taxation method would result in the exact same consequence: companies would pay more taxes, as would all employees, so people would end up ""sharing"" the cost of paid parental leave. So it's a distinction with some difference, but not really a significant one from your point of view.

In short: Paid Parental Leave has numerous societal benefits and thus, the society you are in has decided to ensure it exists via communal contribution. This is similar to why they have police departments, health care, roads, schools, etc., and how they pay for them.

And that's how we get to the social contract, which, very simplistically put, suggests that a rising tide raises all boats. I think you question whether procreation and paid parental leave does, in fact, raise all boats. 

There's a lot of statistical proof that it does. Countries need new citizens. Otherwise, they age out, there's more money going out than coming in, and their economies could collapse. You don't say what you do, but unless you're a grave digger, it's unlikely your industry would benefit from a smaller population of primarily older people. And as the UK faces Brexit, it will become \*far\* more dependent on birth rates of citizens to maintain its population than it has in the past, so in all likelihood, procreation (and, correspondingly, paid parental leave), will become even more important."	9	False

I have crossed it out and will no longer defend it.

This is based closely on another reply I made to another comment in a different thread, but this seems to be a closely related topic.  

Here are some issues faced by women in the United States that disproportionately impact women over men.  These are the kinds of things feminists would be concerned with, and demonstrate that women often have fewer protections for things they have no control over:

* No requirement for paid maternity leave in the United States, only about 16% of Employers offer it, and there are few protections in many instances for unpaid maternity leave.  

* Pregnant women also have no protections against being required to do physical labor while pregnant (you can still be required to lift incredibly heavy loads or be fired even though that is against all medical recommendations).  Here are some examples of [discrimination faced by pregnant women](https://www.aclu.org/other/refusal-accommodate-pregnant-workers-real-accounts-devastating-consequences-workers-and-their?redirect=womens-rights/refusal-accommodate-pregnant-workers-real-accounts-devastating-consequences-workers) in the United States documented by the ACLU.

* ~~Women are overwhelmingly the victims of rape or attempted rape, as 9 in 10 victims of rape in the United States are women.~~

* There is evidence that in many fields women are still discriminated against in business.  In the US, women make up 31.5% of all lawyers, but [only 19.5%](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-law-canada-and-us) of law partners.  

* Women are massively underrepresented in [Congress](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30261.pdf) yet Congress has no problems passing laws regarding women’s health without consulting a single woman.  This is also widely true at the state level.  

* Even when both partners work, men still generally expect women to take responsibility for a [greater share of the housework]( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/opinion/sunday/why-gender-equality-stalled.html?_r=0), and as a result women typically end up doing so.

* The pay gap gets a lot of crap, and for the most part it deserves it (there’s generally believed to be SOME gap that’s accounted for by discrimination, but it’s nowhere near the 23% or whatever that some outraged internet denizens spout).  That said, there is evidence that women often face some pay discrimination by men, as shown by the fact that when women were more present on compensation and governance committees in law firms, the gender pay gap [decreased significantly]( http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-law-canada-and-us#footnote27_cuomyf0).

* Under the ACA, Insurance companies are currently required to cover birth control, mammograms, and cancer screenings without a copay (this is required for prostate cancer as well fyi), are not allowed to charge women more merely for their gender, and can’t use pregnancy as a pre-existing condition to deny coverage (which believe it or not, could and did happen before the ACA).  However, when Senators introduced an amendment to ensure that these provisions would be kept or at least considered in any legislation designed to repeal the ACA, it was [voted down by Republicans](http://time.com/money/4634382/obamacare-repeal-what-happens-birth-control/) without discussion.

These are just some of the issues faced today mostly by women (or that disproportionately impact women) in the US.  I’m sure you will agree that women face far greater inequality in places all around the world.  If not, please let me know and I will happily provide sources.

One note: sure, a lot of these issues aren’t life and death, and women have made huge strides towards equality.  Are there women/feminists who are overzealous and/or anti-men?  Absolutely, I don’t think anybody could reasonably deny that.  

But this doesn’t mean that all of feminism is bad for men, and it certainly doesn’t mean that there are not issues for women that need to be addressed."	23	False

Yes, but the key difference is that the roots of modern music (rock, pop, hip hop, dance) is the merging of some Western/European compositional styles with African. The rhythms and compositional techniques that made ragtime, jazz, and R&amp;B different was the introduction of polyrhythmic composition structures which came from Africa. Rock and pop are largely derived from this. 

&gt; Modern music is important because it is the fastest music has ever been evolving

This isn't really true. Rock and pop music have had largely the same basic structure for about 60 years. Sure there's great variance in sub genres, but the key compositional techniques and structure of the music is largely the same. Classical music was and is constantly changing from the Middle Ages to today. You're noticing it more because we're experiencing it as it happens, in addition to *access* to music being increased. iTunes and records didn't exist in 1650. 

&gt; not comparable because drums are very rarely what creates a new genre.

Source? The rhythmic techniques of African drumming directly translated into different playing techniques and composition style for the roots of rock and pop. 

&gt; The computer isn't an instrument, it's a way to make instruments play automatical

This is completely false. A trumpet is just a tool that a musician can use certain techniques with to make music. I can do the exact same thing with a computer, software, and input method like a keyboard/electronic drum/MIDI wind instrument.

Any vegan that chooses veganism at high cost is an outlier. Any vegan that demands others to practice veganism at high cost is a moron. Even considering becoming vegan puts one in a group of very privileged people. Think about it, this is a consideration that does not involve any basic or higher needs, it's psychological need for validation/clear conscience. 

And believing others have to follow you, when you already started from a privileged position is moronic.


So, it's not ""All suffering of sentient beings must be avoided by humans if possible even at high cost"". More like ""...if it's unnecessary"". Which is way more reasonable. 



&gt;equivalent rights as humans because by having a nervous system, such animal is thus ""sentient"" and thus ""capable of suffering"".


That is just ridiculous, no one but complete lunatics have ever argued for equal rights for all sentient beings capable of suffering.


&gt;it is all subjective projection from human perspective.


So is literally everything. Why can small paper pieces with faces on them be exchanged for food? Because we project value onto them. Does the value not exist for you?


&gt;Why avoid negative neurological stimuli at all? Why is it so bad? Isn't pain part of life?


WTF can it be a part of than life?? Death? Everything is a part of life by definition. 

Why is pain bad? Because it's supposed to be. It is literally its function. To be bad. To be negative stimuli. You burn your finger and you realize you should not proceed touching the flame. Every organism is programmed to avoid pain.


&gt;Even if you ignore the concept of qualia or the definition of suffering, why draw the lines at neurons specifically and what kind of neurons one must possess to be considerably negatively enough of a stimuli? Nociceptors? - Plants also act according to positive and negative stimuli in nature (heat, cold, sunlight and even pressure-sensitive receptors i.e. Carnivore plants).


So you find people empathizing with pain in animals which have similar pain centers a ridiculous notion, but then slippery slope them into empathizing with any stimuli... How intellectually honest of you.




The simple argument is this - ""Causing physical pain needlessly is wrong"". Sure, physical pain is an arbitrary concept chosen because we can understand that experience of pain. Yet that does not invalidate it one bit, border walls are arbitrary concepts, countries, money...


The funny part is that almost everyone agrees with this until some point, the chain looks like this:

-you shouldn't kill and eat people unless it's completely unavoidable for survival.

-you shouldn't eat human flesh unless completely unavoidable for survival.

-you shouldn't kill and eat pets unless it's for survival

and down the chain we go. You seem to go less far than vegans, that's it.

You can agree to the value of charity without religion, so that 'evaluation' part of your method is false.  
  
&gt;Likewise, at no point is anything that any human being finds linked to any hypothesis until they say it is, because there isn't any proof in the strict sense. There is only correlation between observed phenomena and hypotheses. That is a rather simple matter, actually.
All current ""scientifically-based beliefs"" are simply correlations observed between theories and observed phenomena. That is all.  

You don't get to equate the rationalization of religion with the rationalization of good concepts in the world it appropriates, just because you can use logic to get to both. That is completely twisted.  
Charity shows itself to be good, if good is the goal. You don't use the same logic to tie it to religion.  
  
&gt;Whether or not people want to, they make choices on how to think, speak, choose, and live -- and why to do so. They may do this consciously or unconsciously, but there is not escaping it.
Unconsciously embracing the self-existence of nature is just as much a ""choice"" of epistemological ""worship of nature"" as ascribing such self-existence to a deity. Either nature ""just is,"" or a ""God"" of some kind ""just is,"" or something else that isn't a God or nature ""just is"" (e.g. something of/in another reality/dimensional/etc).  

That's like saying any answer is as good as any other because at some point we have to have answers.  

&gt;If I scrap God by the scientific method, then for the same reasons I simultaneously scrap belief in self-existent nature (impersonal pantheism/atheism), and in other dimensions/realities, and in any kind of deistic-multiverse theory, and-and-and-and-and . . . until I'm left with ""I just don't know.

The idea of net neutrality I see in contrast with your original plan is that it states the ISP shouldn't be the only ones involved in that plan.

Look at it in terms of the electricity example: if Dyson and GE agreed to charge more for washing-machine electricity, I'm not sure there's much I could say to argue against that except maybe buying another brand of machine. However, GE shouldn't start charging more for Dyson electricity without the consent of the company.

Similarly, if Google were to ink a deal with RCN to charge more for YouTube, there's nothing much we can do about that legally as consumers. However, if RCN were to start charging more for YouTube without the agreement of Google, that's where I draw the line.

Basically, under your plan, ISPs would charge premium packages for ""premium services"" like high-quality news and video. If they do that in a one-sided manner, which seems to be allowed under your plan, that's not OK.

Sometimes you have more snow sometimes your winter is shorter. Note that by this definition length of winter varies across years depending on weather (mean temperature of past 7 days; I think there are more complex rules but they are fringe case).

Where I live, the temperature can vary month to month. So December can be cold, February can be warm, and March can be cold. I also live in a region whose temperature has swung 70 degrees within 24 hours. (-50 to 20F) Are you saying that a region can cycle through winter and spring multiple times a year? 

&gt; Now I challenge you to find anything positive about spring that you can't find in any other season.

Some food is only avaialble during the spring, for example fiddle heads. You can only forage for fiddle heads during the spring. Also, waterfalls are the best observed during the spring - the melting snow intensify them. The air smells the freshest during the start of spring and the pollon problem only lasts a few weeks. Winter air is harsher to deal with becaise it's so cold.

Another benefit of spring? Energy cost is the lowest. My monthly bill drops $200. I dont need to heat my house or cool it. I also dont have to worry about loosing power for days. And for some areas here, people can loose their power for weeks. Many people own power generators to accomodate - only adding to the cost of living.

&gt; But do I understand that your argument is that winter is worse than spring because of snow?

Which season you prefer is your own opinion. But I think it is so unfair to hold mud against Spring where winter is full of salty, slushy, and dirty snow. And even more unfair because when the snow isnt loaded with salt, it brings a falling hazzard.

The risk in the case of life insurance is the sudden death of an individual with some number of dependents. This is a pretty big risk, because said dependents can be completely screwed if their breadwinner dies.

The classic nuclear family example is: Dick and Jane get married, Jane drops out of college to move with Dick, they have 2.5 kids, get a mortgage, Dick is dead two years later. Jane has no earning power, 3.5 mouths to feed, and massive debt. Well, shit.

So, you spread the risk. You pay a small (manageable) amount of money to the insurance company every month, who in turn promises to give your dependents a fat chunk of cash if you die.

The reason this constitutes spreading the risk around is that a ton of other people are doing the same thing. Any given one of those groups of dependents would be in big trouble if their wage earner died, but all of those groups can afford to pay a small monthly premium. In essence, you're all paying out for tiny fractions of each other's misfortune.

The way insurance companies make their money is, essentially, overcharging slightly. If the statistical probability of any given wage earner dying unexpectedly means an insurance company needs to charge its clients x in monthly premiums to afford to pay out all of those plans, then they charge (x + n).

It sounds a little shady, but keep in mind the trade-off from the client's perspective. By paying, over the course of the years and years of premiums, a little more than they'd lose if their wage earner ever died (but still a relatively small portion of their income), they make themselves immune to a financial shock which could ruin them.

Savings accounts are a much better deal, provided your wage earner doesn't die or lose the ability to work unexpectedly before they were planning to finish working. In the above example, Dick and Jane don't buy life insurance and instead invest the money in long term conservative assets (e.g., 30 year T bills), and by the time Dick retires (because he doesn't die in this hypothetical) they have a nice nest egg. But you're taking a big risk if you bet on that happening."	6	False

That is true, but it doesn't mean gender is meaningless.

Where I think you are right is that these two are contradictory:

1. Gender is self-determined and personally-experienced: Women are whomever identify as women, men are whomever identify as men.
2. There is nothing wrong with a woman doing something typically-male, like cutting her hair short, playing rough sports, studying computer science, etc.; and nothing wrong with a man doing something typically-female, like being a stay-at-home dad, putting on lipstick, watching chick flicks, etc.

They are in fact contradictory. And many people today believe them both. The former is a recent post-modernist approach, made popular most recently by trans advocates; and the latter is an older notion put forth by feminists. Together, they are problematic, but humans are sadly very good at believing contradictory things.

I would say that the second belief is hard to dispute. No one should give anyone grief for not performing exactly as gender roles say they should. Let boys play with dolls and let girls build with legos. And let men wear lipstick and women cut their hair short. It's a free country.

The first belief is the more problematic one. It is popular among trans advocates, social justice people, and so forth, but not really that common otherwise. Because of that, your argument does not show that gender is actually meaningless to the public at large. To be more direct, here is a useful sense of gender:

""Sex"" is whether you are male or female. Cats and dogs have a sex, so do humans, as do all sexually reproducing animals. Now, we often find that members of one sex behave in a typical way, and that societies enforce those ways. This happens in animals, and in humans. Those sex-corresponding roles may be fairly fixed among animal species (male and female lions behave similarly to their ancestors), and perhaps directly biologically-induced. However, among humans, while there may be some biological influence, these sex-corresponding roles change over time. Pink used to be manly, today it is the opposite. This is the impact of culture, which humans and some animals have.

""Gender"" is those roles. Based on one's sex, one is assumed to fall into a particular gender. Gender roles change over time as culture changes, but may also be biologically-influenced, and to some extent are similar across cultures. Sex is a constant, gender is affected by that constant but also by culture.

It's very useful to have the term ""gender"" when used in that way, as ""sex"" is not sufficient by itself.

This makes sense, but what about the money spent on Climate Change Research? We've had huge problems with government-funded companies declaring bankruptcy or failing to do the research/development that they were funded to do.

Wouldn't it make sense to keep regulations at a minimum, and let the private sector solve the R&amp;D? The government could use the money instead to purchase and implement cleaner energy, rather than try to fund R&amp;D companies owned by politician's friends or lobbyist buddies.

I actually agree with you on the failure to have a true free market due to external factors, so you're definitely right that we'd need to keep some form of regulation (I'd prefer as little as possible). I just don't think the government should be involved with funding the R&amp;D directly. The money would better be put into technological advancements at NASA that often have sweeping impact on the entire world. Or better yet, the money could be used to directly implement solutions that have already been proven to work. "	1	False

He was rather given contradictory commands. It's been a while since I watched the movie and read the book but as far as I know he was charged with something along the lines of getting the crew to that place with the obelisk without telling them precisely what this mission was about (presumably to avoid leaks to the public before they arrive). So when the crew started to ask questions about their mission he tries to undermine that without giving away why he's doing that. So he makes them do random maintenance missions in order to keep them busy and away from each other. 

Now the crew on their end think that HAL is malfunctioning because he's reporting errors where there are no errors which is an error in itself. So they feel unsafe because HAL is supposed to run their ship and keep them safe so if he is malfunctioning that is pretty scary. So they try to reset him.  

But HAL isn't malfunctioning and resetting him will make him fail his mission of getting them there and keeping the mission a secret. So he must stop them from doing so. The general problem with computers is that: ""They do what you say, but they don't know what you mean"". So HAL is in an existential problem, on the one hand he need to keep the secret a secret so he needs to stop them talking about it, playing a game of taboo where he needs to make them stop about something that they shall not know what it is they should stop. And it's failing horribly with them realizing that he's plotting something. On the other hand he's supposed to bring them to the destination without harm and being deactivated will prevent him from both. 

So he's somewhat in the situation of a child whose parents have told that he and his brother should stay inside the house no matter what and that he should keep his brother safe. And suddenly a fire emerges.

Now he has to abandon one of the 2 commands, either leave the house with his brother as it's no longer a safe place or stay in the house and guard his brother probably dying in the fire. Now for an adult the answer is easy, do the first. However HAL has the knowledge and operational abilities of an adult but his brain is rather child-like, so both of these commands have absolute priority (before anything else) and that is what is driving him to progressively more insane and harmful decisions in order to adhere to the mission. He's a painfully loyal soul that is tasked with 2 things that he cannot possibly do at the same time but which he still tries to do.

EDIT: Or rather the other way around. You have an older and a younger brother and the younger one was told ""Listen big boy, whatever is happening you should not leave the house, you're responsible now for the house and your older brother. Do you think you can do that?"". So when a fire breaks out and the older brother is trying to either put it out or leave the house with him, he actively resists both attempts because his brother is bringing himself into a dangerous situation by trying to put out the fire or is violating the rule not to leave the house by trying to get him to go outside."	3	False

I believe I can nitpick some things about your argument (for example, _people_ are disgusting and shed bacteria everywhere, assholes, vaginas, and penises are honestly much more clean, generally, than people's hands and mouths), but I think you've come the closest to helping me change my view on this so far.

&gt;The issue isn't the bystanders consent. It's reasonable consent. What is reasonable for a person to be able to do in public? Not wanting to see someone's genitals is reasonable considering all the bacteria associated with them. Along with bodily fluids that can spread STDs.

This point in particular. A difference between absolute consent and reasonable consent. I can definitely concede that these two things are different, but I still feel like that's begging the question. Like, there's only no reasonable consent to seeing sex in public _because we're all conditioned that way_. There's no, from my perspective, _real_ reason for this. It's just... ""the way things were, are, and 'always will be'"". And this seems... silly.

Regarding your first point of legality vs morality, you're right that I didn't separate them cleanly. I guess a more specific version of my perspective is that either:

1. The line of morality and acceptability is arbitrary without a basis in real reasons as to why it exists, and thus we should fight to challenge and potentially abolish it, or

2. The problem is _actually_ about ""a person does not like what they are witnessing, and thus you must stop doing that"", and thus we should be much more strict about what is actually acceptable in public space.

Persuasion is not an emotional state so it's not directly comparable.  Anger is also far less coercive than threats.  For example, I can say in a totally normal tone and without any emotional valence that if you breach your contract with me, I will sue you for a large sum of money.  That threat would definitely be likely to alter your behavior, and be far more likely to alter your behavior than me just shouting at you.

 &gt;But, it seems clear to me that even the hypothetical threat of being exposed to an expression of anger is more than enough to radically alter the behavior of a lot of people.

I don't think this is really true.  Lots of people deal with anger all the time without altering their behavior greatly.  For example, people who answer the phone for crappy companies like cable companies and airlines are dealing with angry customers all the time, and do not really alter their behavior over it.

Moreover, violence is vastly different from anger because it has far more negative consequences.  Anger tends to result in annoyance and/or avoidance, and sometimes giving the squeaky wheel some grease.  Violence on the other hand can result in severe long lasting injury or death.  

Lastly, anger may be justified in terms of the goals it seeks.  For example, in response to a violent threat, expressed anger may be an effective tool for deterring the execution of the threat, and since actual violence is far worse than threats or anger, if anger can in some circumstances prevent violence, then in those circumstances it would be justified.

Let's say for example you saw a large man pressing himself upon a woman in a public place and preventing her from getting away from him by standing over her.  If you loudly expressed anger at him, it could quite plausibly cause him to become distracted or deterred from continuing to harass her, and therefore be justified."	10	False

Delaying instant gratification in cases is normally the optimal decision, with heuristics and bias often getting in the way of it.

The example you provide of is a case where the utility gained in the wait is greater than waiting (I.e benefits gained long term with thesis.)

But instead it *feels more like* almost 90% main characters are white, while most of the minority characters are playing side roles.

Does the fact that codology was sometimes right mean there's a chance codology works? No. Random guesses are also sometimes right but we wouldn't start putting our faith in random guesses to write code.

Now, does the fact that codology was thrown out mean I'm saying that all ways of writing code are worthless? No, I still believe there's a way of writing code. I don't know it, but I do know I'll never find the right way to write code if I just keep trying codology.

Having one or two kids is perfectly fine. Maybe don’t have 3 or 6 if you’re worried about it. The single most effective thing we can do is fight for women’s rights in places like India. When women have access to contraceptives and more control over their lives, it raises the “age at first birth,” which ultimately stabilizes the birth rate.

I am not following this 100%. Removing insurance jobs means insurance business productivity equaling to zero.

Yes, and that class is much larger and much more fluid than in the past. Anyone can join and anyone can be kicked out.  Trump was a rich guy, but never had any real power until he was elected.  Positions of power aren't limited to people in a specific ""ruling class."" People join the ""ruling class"" by being appointed/elected to positions of power.  Every past president used to be the most powerful man in the world.  Now they are just average citizens with essentially the same powers as you or me.

&gt;I simply do not see how the people get a say in larger policy whatsoever, not directly in any case.

Well no. Direct democracies are impractical on large scales.  Most modern democracies are organized as representative democracies.  Individuals being appointed to positions of authority isn't an evasion of democracy, it's by design.  The system is too complicated, knowledge too specialized for direct democracy to be practical on large scale.  Everyone would have to be an expert on everything for it to work.  Do you know anything about management of waterways or mine safety? Do you want to spend your time researching the intricacies of EVERY policy decision made by all levels of government? Do you really care about the day to day operations of the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation  or US Board on Geographic Names?

What the population of a representative democracy do have control over broad control over the general direction and overarching goals of the government.  If the electorate started electing socialists to positions of power, we'd have a more socialist government.  

And the more localized the governmental entity is the more effect the citizens can have on it.  Most cities and states have methods for citizens to directly propose and enact legislation, such has ballot initiatives.

Why would be expel an immigrant that has nowhere to go, but let a born citizen stay who can easily be exiled?

&gt;&gt; Same goes for ""natural"" citizens who break laws over and over.
Why should I pay for them?

&gt;You still pay for them, as for immigrants, since they both spend time in prison.

So I repeat the question, why treat immigrants and born citizens differently?

&gt;the difference is that you spare your country future spending by sending back people who have no entitlement of living here. 

Why should we give repeated criminals an entitlement to live here just because of their birth?

&gt;People with citizenship have a right to live in their country, and it's not fair but then again, the world isn't: people can be born in good countries, some in less good countries, it's random and totally unfair.

Immigrants also have right to live in a country that took them.

Why is one right revocable, but other is not?


&gt;You might as well cancel *jus sanguinis* and install a ""trial period"" if you really want it to be fair.

That's exactly what I am suggesing.

Why should jus sanguinis be irrevocabel?

When you state it like that, it seems on the surface that we could totally do that! But these examples you give are two extremes. Of course we can pretty easily and pretty objectively differentiate between a ""skilled"" actor and an ""incapable"" actor or a ""generic"" plot vs. an ""original"" one. There's a lot of daylight between those, so it's easy to see the distinction. But what measures are you going to use to determine which of two skilled actors is better?

You should change yourself because you are unhealthy and want to be healthy rather than because people decide they don't like the way you look.

You must also remember the massive effect that it has on other people. It is a huge drain to the economy since overweight/obese people are much more likely to develop serious diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, angina, arthritis and a whole multitude of other conditions which require expensive long term treatment. Immune systems of overweight people are also much poorer and thus opportunistic bacterial/viral infections occur more commonly leading to further increased healthcare costs. 

Additionally, this has an effect on the businesses they work for due to the lost working days due to more health problems preventing them from working. The economy loses billions each year wasted on the treatment of a condition that is preventable in every case. Also, there are things overlooked which add to the economic drain - specialized ambulances, hospital beds, transport systems, seating, higher number of medical staff required to respond to emergencies for obese people that further lead to needless spending.

How does this affect everyone else? Because they pay taxes and put money into the economy and government. Then the government is forced to spend it on dealing with the overweight and obese. It DOES affect other people and you should realize this.

There's nothing wrong at all with you just being you, and wanting your sexual preference to be treated no different than being left handed - you're different than the majority, and you do things a little differently than they do, but no big deal.

But the other approach is to say ""you think *that's* effeminate?  I'll show you effeminate!"" (Not that I think gays are effeminate, but that that was the stereotype).  

I'm also enough that when I was young, when people would say, ""You know Bill?  I just found out that *he's gay*"" - they made sure to whisper the last word.  (Or giggle if they were assholes).  Being ""out"" just wasn't done.

Instead of having to hide who you were, you could delight in your identity, surrounded by others like you.

The crux of my argument is that there are parts of different cultures that are objectively harmful, and these harmful beliefs and practices do not deserve the same respect that we accord to minor cultural differences. This belief is called cultural objectivism, and it is the binary opposite of cultural relativism.

Cultural relativism is the belief that all parts of all cultures are just as valid as any other, and that all beliefs should be treated equally. Cultural relativism is a great mindset for helping people accept the minor differences across cultures, but it should not be applied to beliefs and practices that restrict human rights.

For example: The culture in Saudi Arabia has led to the creation of laws that deny women the right to drive. This is a clear violation of equal rights. Denying women the right to free travel hurts them by unfairly limiting what they can achieve. From the perspective of a cultural relativist, we have no right to criticize this law -- and the cultural belief that led to its creation -- and we are obligated to respect it as a valid part of their culture. From the perspective of a cultural objectivist, we have the right to criticize it and work to change it.

A balanced view on culture is nether completely relativist not completely objectivist. It is a balanced mixture of the two. It accepts and respects benign cultural differences, but refuses to tolerate the ones that violate the rights of others. The satire we are talking about met this balance because it targeted objectively harmful beliefs and values, not benign differences."	2	False

Democrats have so far shown that they want to open up relations. It's the other party that causes the issue. e.g. Trump tearing up the nuclear agreement. The talks are resuming in Nov 29th but it's going to b a steeeeep climb for both sides. Iran wants the deal to be ratified in the congress. That would  require EVERY democrat to vote yes, plus some republicans as well. Not only that, both sides are posturing a lot. Iran wants all sanctions imposed since 2017 to be removed. France says some of those sanctions are for Iran's ballistic missile program, and there needs to be separate talks for this. This is a shitshow, that's only hurting the Iranian people. The best course of action is to drop ALL sanctions and let the Iranian people change their own fate. If Iran's economy becomes strong again, a lot of Iranians like me who wish to leave the nation will opt to stay. We will get our own homes.

Possibly, but this actually depends on the possible outcomes. Is the likely-to-be-elected individual/party significantly worse in some regard than the underdog? If so, the probability-adjusted benefit might actually be quite large relative to the effort required. In many countries today, this is seldom obviously the case, but it will sometimes be the case. At the very least, it's plausible enough that I would say it's important to judge on a case-by-case basis, rather than assuming it will never be relevant in practice.

&gt; However, donating money is not a moral obligation

This is not a given. In fact, many contemporary ethicists argue the exact opposite.

&gt; I believe that it's possible to live morally while not donating to charity

Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. However, leading a morally good life and having some moral failures/shortcomings are not mutually exclusive. Virtually no one argues that you need to succeed in every instance of moral decision-making (be a saint, essentially) in order to count as a good person. ""Did you once refuse to get up for an old lady on the bus? Well, you're now a horrible person forever even though you've dedicated the rest of your life to building schools in Africa."" Surely everyone would agree that this is not so. 

So it might be the case that failing to donate (perhaps a reasonably small amount relative to your circumstances) is indeed a moral shortcoming, but one which can be outweighed by sufficiently many other morally good actions."	2	False

&gt;And there is a major difference between deliberate seductive behavior and normal human interaction. The latter has no previous purposes related to feelings - if something happens, say, someone falls in love, it happened. The former is a kind of behavior that has a deliberate objective: changing the way the other person sees you. Isn't it manipulative?

I don't think it's true that normal human interactions are unrelated to feelings. How would that work? We're often trying to engender feelings in other people, e.g.: if we comb our hair to appear neat. "	4	False

If the victims had been willing to have sex, there would have been no rape. There would just have been sex. The goal of the rapist was not to express power over someone via sex; they just wanted the sex and were willing to ignore consent to get it. 

It can still be about power even if it's also about a desire for sex. The fact that they were willing to ignore consent means that the rape was indeed about power; if it was about sex they could have gone and found another woman. People who are told no and react violently or try to get someone drugged to make them say yes are acting like no one should be able to say no to them. That is inherently about power.

&gt; They wanted sex whether or not their victim agreed to it, but their desire was for *sex*. If in some alternate universe their victims had happened to say yes, they wouldn't have turned down the sex because they could no longer rape the victim. 

That's how it would have happened that time. But what would happen if the person said no later? Or if the next time they're at a bar the person says no? Are they going to call someone who said yes in the past? Or are they going to force themselves onto the person because no one should be able to say no to them?

&gt; And if this is the case, this interpretation of ""rape is about sex, not power"" seems like it's not particularly helpful because it's clear that rape is generally not about power; it's usually about sex, and ""power"" only comes into play in the same sense power comes into play in any other situation where one party wants something and the other party doesn't. Saying ""Murder isn't about killing people, it's about power"" isn't particularly meaningful just because you have to have power over someone in order to murder them. 

This is exactly why people say ""rape is about power, not sex."" People often tell victims ""if you'd just worn something different/been nicer/not been out alone/etc then you wouldn't have been raped."" It's important for these people to understand there was no way for a victim to stop the rapist, and that even if one person could avoid being raped, another likely would be raped later on. This saying isn't meant to mean that sex isn't involved, but rather it's not sex as we normally think of it. A lot of people have this romantic image of sex, or think that people only want to have sex with people they find hot, etc. And when it comes to rape, this is certainly not the case. Rapists often pick women who are out early in the morning, alone, and wearing clothes that are easy to take off. They aren't looking for the hottest woman like a lot of people assume they are. I think when people say ""it's not about sex"" they don't mean the act of sex, but a lot of things we associate with sex. Rape isn't about sexual attraction would probably be a better way to phrase it."	26	False

No. There are many cases where people who cross illegally are forgiven and admitted. This is called amnesty and it occurs for asylum seekers.

You've now (re)introduced a second argument against DACA. ""Moral hazard of new immigrants"". 

This is incorrect. There are four proposed pieces of legislation and none of them would have this feature. 

1. The DREAM act - protects DREAMers admitted before 2014

2. DACA act - protects those admitted before 2013

3. RAC act - protects DREAMers who also never received a deportation order and have or are persuing a diploma. 

4. Bridge act- DACA but without path to citizenship. 


None of the proposed amnesty programs would grant rights to future undocumented immigrants.

They’re upset that while they were ridiculed for it, now people who are doing said cultural thing are being praised for it. I understand it comes from a place of hurt, however i think it further divides us. When things are normalised I think it’s a step forward. For example, thick eyebrows, freckles, big lips, fox eyes. These are all things that were not seen as attractive, people were mocked for them, and then they became trending and people are celebrated for it. I believe it being trending is a good thing, I wish we lived in a society where those things were just always attractive and people saw it at such. But that’s not really realistic, if those things never became trending, those people with those features would have not been the beauty standard. Isn’t it better in the end that we fit in?

If she's a brilliant biochemist at a top graduate school and having a child would derail all her scientific plans, there's a bit more good to be gained in the world by aborting the child than if she's currently stocking shelves for a living and has no hobbies or goals. Of course, in the latter case having a child will probably suck more for her personally, but the kid's joy in life might eventually make up for it.

The confounder here is age. As people get older, the odds of mental health issues increases. As treatment improves, the odds of debilitating mental health issues decreases. The issue is that the population is aging faster than treatment is improving, so the total # of cases keeps going up. The rate of new cases at any given age is going down, but the average age of the population is outpacing these gains. 

""Dementia is the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide.1-3 As the average life expectancy increases, the prevalence of dementia4 and associated monetary costs are expected to increase exponentially.5 A few studies have suggested that the age-specific incidence of dementia (i.e., the risk of dementia at any specific age) might be decreasing.""

""In conclusion, although projections suggest an exploding burden of dementia over the next four decades owing to an increasing number of older persons at risk,4,36 primary and secondary prevention might be key to diminishing the magnitude of this expected increase.37 Our study offers cautious hope that some cases of dementia might be preventable or at least delayed. However, it also emphasizes our incomplete understanding of the observed temporal trend and the need for further exploration of factors that contribute to this decline in order to better understand and possibly accelerate this beneficial trend.""

&gt; I would say some people could probably drive while being tipsy. I don't want to give a percentage of any form because I have no idea. But even if very few people cannot drink while drive, that's enough for the government to put a ban on drinking and driving. So even if most people can find the silver lining and not cause harm, the fact that there might be people who can't control themselves gives reason to ban it. Also even if you find a little bit about yourself, you can still possibly hurt someone in the process on a bad trip.

By this logic we should ban alcohol because a subset of the population is incapable of handling themselves and become violent and hurt others. Everyone knows this is a risk, but it's not sufficient to impose a ban. I would argue the same for psychedelics. Also it's important to note with psychedelics it's *extremely* unlikely that you'll see your family as monsters or something. The hallucinations are not really hallucinations. They are more like a perceptual change. You don't see things that aren't there. You see things that are there in a new way.

As for how functional you are. At normal doses you are very functional. Common activities people due under the influence are hiking and camping. You're not going forget where your keys are or be unable to use a phone. You shouldn't drive or anything because your perception is off, but walking is easy.

Regarding the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews, one must recognize that the industrialized slaughter and persecution were not sourced from the mind of one man. The entire political and ideological objective of the Nazi party centered around the removal and extermination of Jews and other undesirable people from Europe. You question seems to imply that if Hitler wasn't so ""arrogant and hateful"" as a person or leader, Germany wouldn't have spent as much resources exterminating the Jews, and that is simply detached from the brutal reality of the widespread anti-semitism in Germany and honestly everywhere else that allowed a person like Hitler to gain power in the first place. As Germany was losing the war more, the OKW diverted more troops from the front to the extermination camps to speed up the slaughter, at the obvious cost of losing even more ground on the front. The Holocaust was not a ""distraction"" for the Wehrmacht and the SS in WW2, it was the quintessential purpose. Therefore it is not up to the temperament of one man, and its impact on Germany's strategy positioning cannot be brushed as simply ""losing scientists"".

It is difficult for historians to answer what-if questions, because history is rarely simple. However, Germany faced incredible odds against both the western allies and the USSR, and would have struggled to defeat either, let alone the combined might of both. The more interest thing to consider here is not how Hitler may have undermined German war efforts, but rather why you today, believe that is the case. The source of that can be largely attributed to simply, post-war propaganda. The re-socialization of several high ranking Wehrmacht officers that managed to escape persecution and death, such as Guderian and Manstein, and the political necessity of creating a strong West Germany military tradition against the USSR in the height of the cold war, meant that a narrative of how Germany was this ""misguided war machine"" that only faltered against the ""communist hordes"" due to the madness of one man, who is dead and burnt, became extremely attractive to the mind of the average western reader. Historians and amateurs alike generally fell into the trap of this narrative from Guderian, Manstein, and others, because 1) it worked for the Cold War mentality and 2) there simply weren't other sources available due to the nature of the USSR and their secretive archives. As a result, the myths of how Germany ""lost a winnable war"" persists even today and bring us to this CMV.

This person simply sees three identical images. They've lost all context. At that point, only the image itself matters, and in that sense, should be able ""to get the job done.""

1. There is no single objective Utility Function that we can all agree on, nor can individuals sufficiently enumerate their own personal Utility Functions to allow for an averaging approach.

2. The Utility of any given action is computationally intractable, both because of our insufficient knowledge of starting conditions and prior probabilities, and because of the butterfly-effect types of unforseen consequences that any action may entail.

Utilitarianism is great for toy systems, where the utility function is clearly defined and all the relevant variables are explicitly defined, simple, and deterministic.  But most philosophies and ideals work great in toy systems tat are specifically designed to work well for them.  Communism works *amazingly* well as a thought experiment.

Utilitarianism has a rough time dealing with the real world, just like all other moral systems.  Thinking in Utilitarian terms may still be a useful heuristic for dealing with real-world moral conundrums, and indeed a sufficiently well-considered and enlightened Utilitarianism may even be the *best* way to approach such issues.  

But it is very, very, very far from 'flawless'; for example, one unique problem it has is that the extreme ambiguity of 'what is the relevant utility function' and 'what are the likely outcomes of this action' allow people to fudge the numbers in ways that end up just justifying whatever course of action they already wanted to take before doing the 'calculation'."	4	False

If you made one set of words non-taboo, people would simply find other ones to fill in the need.  If people weren't offended by these words, they wouldn't be taboo, and they wouldn't fill the need - they would lack emotional intensity.

What are you going to say when you break your thumbnail with a hammer?  ""Dear me, this hurts a lot""?  No - you need something with emotional intensity built-in to discharge your feelings.

For example, I spent many years in Québec when I was young.  The word for ""fuck"", _foutre_, is not particularly taboo in Québec - you can use it on TV, for example - but for years, I knew the Québecois swear words but hadn't really worked them out.

One day I realized the big two in Québecois were _tabarnak_ - tabernacle, and _câlice_, chalice - [religious profanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity)!  It seemed ridiculous to me but I realized that they needed _something._

If fuck and shit were no longer taboo, people would come up with some other words.

Reproductive rights are still a hot topic and widely debated.

That being said, one of the reasons people are so outspoken about gender is that it is an inherent part of people's identity and life experience. Abortion is a procedure, it's something a person may experience but it doesn't define them, it's something they can essentially move on from. Gender identity, on the other hand, is something you live with and affects your life experience daily. I would highly suggest you read about gender identity and gender dysphoria if you haven't already.

Basically, we don't fully understand gender identity but what we do know is that by age 3, gender identity is essentially fixed and there is strong evidence that it is biologically rooted (one theory is the hormonal balance in mothers during pregnancy). This is not to be confused with gender expression (i.e. masculinity and femininity, gender roles), which is believed to be socially rooted - this is what people are referring to when they say that gender is a social construct. When a person's gender identity doesn't match their assigned gender, this results in gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria can be extremely psychologically distressing and is classified as a mental illness. To be clear: being trans is not a mental illness, gender dysphoria is. Gender dysphoria is *cured* by transitioning, and in fact this is the only successful cure we have found. Attempts to cure gender dysphoria by changing someone's gender identity has never been successful. All this is to say, going through life being assigned a gender that is different from how you identify can have a serious impact on mental health. When people refuse to use the correct pronouns they are reinforcing gender dysphoria and doing psychological harm to that person.

Edit: Looking over this, I think I oversimplified things by saying that gender dysphoria is considered a mental illness. Really the gender dysphoria itself is not a disorder, it is just a state of being, but that state of being can cause significant distress that then causes mental illness. Transitioning can alleviate or eliminate gender dysphoria, thereby treating the related mental disorder. "	9	False

The rest of your questions are related to the topic of whether or not healthcare should be an individual responsibility.  Some things, like finding housing, are your own responsibility.  If you cannot afford a house you do not get a house.  Other things like education are not individual responsibilities.  Until 18 years old the state pays for education.

If you make paying for healthcare a responsibility of the individual, then not everyone will have healthcare.  Children of irresponsible people and poor people suffer in those situations.  Actually children of irresponsible people and poor people always will suffer in a variety of ways, to me it seems reasonable  that a wealthy nation should easy that suffering and strength the nation by providing at least basic healthcare to everyone.  Similar to what we do with education.

But this isn't a fundamental problem of capitalism.  We provided public education by creating public schools.  and that seems to have worked, albeit somewhat poorly.  We could do the same with healthcare, we could create public hospitals and clinics.  But another solution is a voucher problem.  That's discussed a lot as an alternative to public schools.  A vouch system is how we solved the problem of starvation.  we don't have public grocery stores that give free food.  We have private grocery stores governed by the rule of capitalism, that accept government vouchers (food stamps).

A similiar solution could work for healthcare without losing the positive elements of capitalism.  E.g. competition."	2	False

&gt; I'm going to start off with how I'm really a bit annoyed at what constitutes assault. I feel misled more than anything. Because assault doesn't require intent to harm. It requires intent to perform an action.

&gt; Someone explained this to me previously. Basically, if you're driving and you run someone over and you don't see them for some reason like they jumped in front of your car for insurance money. That's still assault in the court of law. Because while you didn't intend to run them over, you did intend to drive your car. And that's all you need.

If you're referring to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mw1dzm/cmv_police_officers_can_do_a_lot_better/gvg0oe9/?context=3) exchange, your interpretation seems like an example of point 1 from my other reply, i.e. unwarranted confidence. You trusted u/speedyjohn's initial explanation of how ""intent"" was defined, which shows you aren't knowledgeable about Minnesota law. However, when he said that you'd misunderstood the concept in your ""run someone over"" example, you didn't (a) trust him again since he presumably knows more than you do about the law, or (b) question his credentials on the topic. Instead, you dismissed his clarification and are now telling me something that *the original source of your information* has told you is incorrect.

Obligatory IANAL, but based on some Google-fu, I suspect u/speedyjohn is referring to the distinction between ""specific intent"" and ""[basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_(criminal_law\))/[general](https://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/4-2-criminal-intent/) intent."" For example:

* Alice is mad at Bob because he sold her cat and tells her friends ""I'm going to put that asshole in a wheelchair!"" She then runs him over with her car, breaking both his legs. Alice is guilty of aggravated assault in the first degree (or whatever it's called in her jurisdiction) because she had a *specific intent* to cause Bob serious bodily injury.

* Alice is mad at Bob because he's standing in the road and blocking her car. She yells out the window ""Hey, get out of the road you asshole!"" and then runs him over, breaking both his legs. Alice is guilty of a lesser assault charge because she had a *general intent* to hit Bob with her car, and hitting someone with a car is an action that any reasonable person knows can cause serious bodily harm.

* Alice is driving to work one day, minding her own business, when well-known scam artist Bob jumps out in front of her car. Unfortunately, he miscalculates and Alice ends up running him over, breaking both his legs. In this case, Alice isn't guilty of a crime because she only intended to drive her car, which isn't a crime; she didn't intend to *hit* Bob with it. Also, Bob consented to put himself in a situation that any reasonable person knows can cause serious bodily harm, i.e. jumping in front of a car, which is also a defense for Alice.

Of course, in practice we don't have all the information, so the outcome depends on (a) the evidence available, which affects which (if any) charges prosecutors will file, and (b) the willingness of twelve people to unanimously decide that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, maybe Alice could have swerved to avoid scam-artist Bob but chose to run him over because she wanted, in her heart of hearts, to put him in a wheelchair. However, if she keeps her mouth shut and isn't caught on camera accelerating toward him, it's vanishingly unlikely that she'll even be charged, much less convicted.

But don't take my word for it. You can ask r/legaladvice, r/Ask_Lawyers, or r/asklaw whether intending to drive your car and having someone jump in front of it qualifies as assault, or post here on CMV that you believe that to be true.

Alternatively, consider the likely consequences if your belief is true and whether they [match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) reality. For example, if a Minnesota law says that someone is guilty of assault if they're driving and someone else jumps in front of their car, there would be cases of people being charged under it, right? And if people are charged with it, many people would be upset and think it's unfair, wouldn't they? And if people think the law is unfair, they'd try to change it, write editorials about how unfair it is, complain on blog posts, etc.

However, if such evidence exists, my Google-fu wasn't strong enough to find it. Interestingly, Minnesota apparently [does](https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-lawmakers-want-to-crack-down-on-insurance-scammers/291781861) have a problem with car crash insurance scammers (for unrelated reasons), but the article doesn't mention anything about people involved in the crashes being charged criminally, and I couldn't find anything else that's relevant. This suggests to me that your understanding of the law is incorrect, or at least that prosecutors aren't actually enforcing that interpretation of it. You might have better luck finding evidence to support your belief, though."	1	False

I do think that it's a good enough reason in this case. I don't see it as censorship, but as a way to protect victims. Just as court cases about abuse are not public, or just like how there won't be trailers for R-rated movies before a children's movie. Is it censorship to hide clips of people fighting etc. from kids who could be scared by it? You could compare it to my argument about people relapsing.

I agree with censorship being bad. In Sweden, where I live, almost everything is a public document which can be read. Salaries, court cases, government meetings, names. Anything that's not strictly private, like medical records and banking information. It's just as transparent as it should be. Media have no restrictions either, and can publish anything. I don't see how banning harmful advertisement is the same. 

And just as the transparency exists, for some people that have a hidden identity, or a high risk job, that information won't be available. And so it should be, to protect them. People's lives are more important than making money. And in a transparent democracy I believe this type of ban would work, but perhaps not in a more restricted country."	1	False

Widening the meaning of symptoms can cause initial inaccuracies in self diagnosis. But let’s take Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD. Both share similar symptoms. If I had a friend on Facebook talking about their difficulties with the symptoms they experienced because of their Autism, but I recognized some thing’s similar in myself, I might think “shit, am I autistic?” I would go to a psych doctor and get evaluated. The doctor would probably end up disagreeing with my self diagnosis and end up diagnosing me correctly. So even in that case, initial incorrect self diagnosis can still lead to someone getting the help they need. 

I do think there are bigger bogeymen in this than incorrect initial self diagnosis and in my opinion that would be the lack of access to healthcare many have to seek professional help, and the stigma that still exists to be treated for mental health. I think these are much bigger barriers to people being properly diagnosed and treated than misdiagnosing themselves online. Sure, misdiagnosing yourself could be a pretty big issue, but only if the person doesn’t have the healthcare coverage to get properly diagnosed or if the stigma they face from family or peers pressures them to not pursue accurate diagnosis and treatment."	3	False

They would, consider someone who swipes right on 70% of Hispanic women but only 5% of White women, for a ratio of 14:1. For every 15 matches they make, 1 is White. This person's dating pool becomes much more efficient if they use the filter, incentivizing them to use it. On a non-filtered app they only see 15 people they like (14 Hispanic 1 White) for every 40 people they're shown. If they filtered it to only show Hispanics, they'd see 28 people they like for every 40 people they're shown. The number of matches they get skyrockets, but at what cost? Increasing the segregation of the city. 

You might think, ""That's negligible because the chance of them getting with that 1 White person out of 15 potential partners is very small."" It becomes more apparent when you scale it up. What happens when we get 15 people like this? That's 1 interracial relationship prevented solely because of the app's filter. 1500 people? That's 100 interracial relationships prevented by the app. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for segregation, I definitely see that becoming an end result, but what about the locations that are already highly segregated by race? I think those places would benefit from a racial filter due to the reasoning I have in my post, i.e., that people won't have to go through swathes of profiles which do not want to date them based on race. 

Any non-zero increase to the amount of segregation does more harm than any good done by increasing the dating app's efficiency, full stop. Having to go through more profiles on a dating app is an inconvenience infinitely less harmful than making the real-life city more segregated."	9	False

Also, a man wearing a dress could be considered not dressing appropriately in front of clients, whereas a woman wearing that same outfit would be completely appropriate (the situation becomes more ambiguous if the person is transsexual). I agree with the OP that it should be up to congress to determine the issue of protections based on sexuality (I personally am strongly in favor of gay rights), and it is a bit murkier if transsexuals would already be protected under the sex non-discrimination, so this should also be codified by congress as well in my opinion.

Kind of, it is.  My underlying point is that those of us who are cultured to Celsius find it intuitive while those cultured to Fahrenheit find it intuitive.

I disingenuously claim some preferential point of reference since I and my entire generation of Canadians have lived under both systems. For us Celsius is more intuitive. Making a case based on what's ""human relevant"" or ""intuitive"" is a bit of a mugs game. For evidence I cite my real lived experience. Arguing with me that I am less human than someone who prefers Fahrenheit doesn't seem very logical either. (I know you're not doing that but it is an included implication).

Edit: I never said the system is ""centred on frostbite"" but made passing references. Originally it was scaled as 0 °C for the freezing point of water and 100 °C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure. But as part of a continuing effort to establish Standardized International Units rooted in some constant of nature, in the case of temperature the Boltzmann constant. If one is seriously trying to construct a purely logical/rational case, then it is difficult to do better than hooking one's wagon to a natural constant.

Also, what's the point about acres and 66?  I mean do Americans seriously still use furlongs?  We use acres in agriculture up here. No one would break an acre down into chains and furlongs. Or even into 4,840 square yards. They'd cite fractional acres, as in a half acre or a quarter acre. Smaller than that and you're talking a garden. 640 acres makes a section or one square mile. And we don't get into dividing by 66. Because, yes, a half acre is more intuitive than 2,420 square yards. At least for some of us. I suppose if you work in hundreds of yards every day maybe you'd prefer to use the whole numbers rather than the fractions, but I'm half crazy now so calling my participation here quits :)"	3	False

See [here](https://justice.gc.ca/eng/cons/voy/part1_context.html)

&gt; The harm [of voyeurism] can be assessed as the breach of a right to privacy that citizens enjoy in a free and democratic society; alternatively, voyeurism can be conceptualized as a sexual offence.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The sexual aspect of the offence arises from one or two sources (and in any given case, both may be operative): the purpose for which the observation is made (e.g. sexual arousal of the voyeur) or, alternatively, the nature of the subject observed (e.g. viewing or recording the victim's sexual organs or the victim engaged in explicit sexual activity). The policy justification for prohibiting voyeurism in this context is that it prevents a private citizen from sexually exploiting another private citizen. The sexual exploitation occurs the moment that the voyeur observes or records the victim, even if the victim is not aware of it.

You also write:

&gt; There is no harm done with fantasizing

I disagree. A harm is anything that prevents us from achieving certain goods, like life, freedom, knowledge, health, friendships, etc. Fantasizing is harmful because it prevents us from fully respecting the person we're fantasizing about, and so it harms our relationships with others. Just as it's disrespectful to use the image of someone's body for sexual purposes without their consent, it's also disrespectful to do so in one's imagination. 

To clarify my point, imagine two relationships, one where both people truly respect each other, and one where all external actions are the same, but one person is only *pretending* to respect the other person. In fact, this person habitually sexually fantasizes about the other person. Which relationship is better? I think it's obvious that the first one is. The second one is worse because there's an element of hypocrisy and falsity involved. One person thinks the other respects him, but that's just not true. His respect is a sham, and so to a significant extent, so is their relationship.

Edit: With respect to policing, I never argued that sexual fantasizing should be illegal."	1	False

This will be driven home if you ever go somewhere tipping is not the norm.  One holiday in France was proof enough for me- even outside of Paris and in nice restaurants, service was terrible.  They were constantly understaffed and they didn't really care that much about ensuring a good experience.  Tipping is definitely an imperfect system and the objections you bring up are valid, but at the end of the day, it works.

Think of it this way.  Eating out is a luxury, and it's not just about the food.  It's an experience of which the food is only a part.  This is why it's different from retail- even if the cashier at the store is not overly friendly, you still get the full value of the thing you bought. Poor service can ruin a night out and dramatically reduce the value you take out of that experience.  Great service can also dramatically enhance the value of the experience.  Being a server may not require a lot of education, but it's not easy either.  It is physically demanding and can be emotionally draining- not everyone can do it, and fewer can be good at it.  It's in my interests as someone going for a luxury experience to have that experience be as good as possible.  And as a bonus, if it's not I actually get to pay less!  Considering the small difference in actual cost compared to the two systems, tipping provides better incentives for a better experience, and if it does result in slightly higher final totals, that to me is worth it since eating out is a luxury in the first place."	1	False

Like one commenter said, believing that we shouldn't kill people because of their sexuality, or I would add, any reason other than self defense, should be something we hold so dearly it's part of our identity. 

I want to add something that I think is important. I am a Christian. If that were to change, it would fundamentally change who I am. I make choices in the light of my beliefs. I am who I am because I am a Christian. I don't see a problem with that. Now, I shouldn't hold every theological belief I have as part of my identity. If my identity was tied to whether or not grace was irresistible, or if we are predestined or have free will, there would be a problem. I have opinions on those, and I am willing to change them. 

Going specifically towards your issue, and politics, I would still say that some opinions should be held that dearly and others shouldn't. I firmly believe that taxes should be low and the market should be free. If I see enough evidence that another system would work better, then I could change my mind on that. On the other hand, and this may not be a popular opinion, abortion is an issue where my identity would have to change for my view to change. I believe people are made in the image of God. I believe God knows us before we are formed in our mother's womb. I believe life is sacred and should not be taken. Because of all that, I also believe that abortion is morally wrong. I believe that it should not be allowed any more than murder should be allowed. That is a belief of mine that will not change.

He followed through on withdrawing from Iraq, he greatly scaled down our presence in Afghanistan, and implemented a landmark Iran deal which Iran still abides by despite Trump pulling out.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Obama didn't accomplish stuff. I like Obama, I think he was generally a pretty great president.

&gt; I largely dispute the notion that somehow Democrats and Republicans are the exact same. There are clear policy differences between the two parties. To say otherwise is simply false. The Democrats are the ones pursuing climate change reform. The Democrats are the ones pursuing election reform. The fact that we can't get mass overhauls quickly is simply a reflection of the fact that Democrats aren't a dictatorship that can rule by fiat.

Yes, Democrats and Republicans are different. Democrats generally are a party of rational people, while Republicans much less so, but Dems still tackle needed-change too slowly to be effective. Democrats offer lots of promises to tackle climate change, but climate change is a problem that pretty much needs a solution within the next decade. We can't wait until the 2040 deadlines to do something about it. Same thing with things like paid paternity and maternity leave, affordable housing, etc. A lot of centre democrats are smart and have good positions on issues, and while I trust them not to burn down the country, I don't exactly think they're making it that much better in a timely manner.

&gt; You want to critique politicians for not getting more massive overhauls done more quickly? Let's actually look at Bernie Sanders then. How do you expect him to make all these changes with what will arguably be a Republican Senate in 2020? Bernie hasn't even accomplished that much policy change while being in the Senate. Ideas are great. I agree with many of his. But it seems disingenuous to critique Democrats as a whole for not making changes fast enough and then praise a man who has made very little actual policy change in his lifetime as a politician.

Interesting point, but ultimately given how Obama's presidency went I don't think a Republican congress and Democratic presidency are going to get along regardless of who's running the show. Also Andrew Yang's positions are a little more palatable to Republicans I think than Bernie's. 

&gt; I think this needs elaboration. What do you feel are conservative points of their's that they take up?

At least according to what I can find, Cory Booker isn't really too good on control (I know I said Yang wasn't huge on gun control either, but I think he strikes a better middle ground), doesn't support nuclear, supports the Patriot Act, against parts of Obama's plan for denuclearizing Iran, and voted against withdrawing support for intervention in Yemen. Kamala Harris isn't conservative, just more inline with the sort of Obama's slower methods. It's not that they're hugely conservative, just more on the conservative end of the Democratic spectrum.

Someone who is trying for a good and noble goal might end up with bad results, and someone with terrible motives might end up with good results. The actions the beliefs lead to is not the only criteria to judge them, perhaps not even a good one.

Oh yeah, I get that. There’s even the example of a person trying to murder someone (say by running them over), but they only put them in the hospital and while they’re in the hospital, the doctors do an exam and find a tumor that would have killed them if they came in just one day later. And there’s the example of trying to save someone and in doing so, you accidentally kill them. My point wasn’t really about what actions may occur, it’s about what actions are intended to occur, which would eventually occur given the right opportunity.

&gt;Now we can imagine a society composed completely of those other white people who agree with him like you proposed. In that case within the context of that society it would be OK for them to keep the Mexicans out of their society. They of course wouldn't be Americans at that point, and while the racism that motivates the belief would still be immoral the expression of that by simply keeping to themselves would be one of the least objectionable possible.

If it’s immoral to avoid someone due to racist views, wouldn’t that mean that they are morally obligated to associate with them? If someone doesn’t want to have sex with someone due to their racist views, is that avoidance of sex immoral, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that they are morally obligated to have sex with them (assuming they would have anyway if they weren’t racist)? Of course, I don’t mean forcing them to, unless you consider a moral obligation as a type of force. To me, going off what were you saying, it wouldn’t be a moral obligation, and avoiding sex with them, even due to racist views, wouldn’t be immoral. It’s just that those racist views themselves are immoral, well moreso because they can lead to immoral acts.

&gt;Within the context of our modern society

I guess then, assuming you also live in the US, is our society, at least in this matter, the moral standard for other societies to live by? Pointing out our society is a matter of legality, but perhaps not the utmost morality.

&gt;it isn't legal to refuse service of a business to someone of a race you dislike. However it is perfectly legal to not invite them to dinner, or associate with them in your free time, or date them. In fact people have very broad power to choose who they will and will not do such things with for any reason they choose.

Yeah this seems to be a matter of where we are allowed autonomy and where we aren’t. 

&gt;Now being racist is in my view immoral, in the sense that holding such a prejudice is wrong. But holding a wrong view doesn't justify other people to compensate for it by force; a Mexican doesn't get to sneak into dinner disguised as a white person just because that person is racist. It doesn't suddenly become OK to misrepresent yourself when dating because they are racist and you think they shouldn't be.

Yeah I get that, but certainly there are cases where it is ok to lie if no other options exist, such as the Nazi example. What about the example of a gay person applying for jobs that don’t hire gays and every job asks the interviewee if they are gay to which they are required to answer?

&gt;And that is for a trait that we can both agree is immoral! It should be even more clear when it is something like dating someone who has cheated before. Is not wanting to date a person who has cheated in the past immoral?

I think it’s immoral to judge someone unfairly. But it depends on what they’re being judged for, what they wouldn’t be getting or what they would be getting for being judged. 

&gt;Let us take a step back. Can we agree that lying about something morally neutral in order to qualify for a romantic relationship is immoral? Suppose they only want to date someone who is a natural blond, or who has a Marine Biology degree, or who has visited Paris. Just some arbitrary criteria with no particular moral weight on which they are hinging their decision to date or not. If you haven't been to Paris it is a deal breaker, is it OK to lie?

I suppose since these are trivial things, then yes. I think it’s fine for someone to choose someone they’d have similar interests with like Paris, and someone they find visually appealing like blonde hair. My issue is more with judging someone not as one they wouldn’t connect with, but as one they deem inferior as a person, or even just as a partner. This is like my example with the former criminal that no company will hire. If they are a changed person, then at some point I’d have to consider it immoral for them not be hired due to their past.

&gt;Now if you agree with me up to this point then the challenge is to explain why you judging their criteria as being immoral would change your right to influence it. You disagree that it is a reasonable criteria in both cases, so what about it being an immoral belief on their part gives you the right to override their will?

Yeah I see your point, and I understand my use of the rapist example. However I’m still not sure where the line is drawn on overriding someone’s will. Would you interfere with someone’s will in order to stop them from killing themselves? Say, they were in the middle of hanging themselves, they just stepped off the chair right as you were walking in the door. And say this is someone you care deeply about. Would you grab them, thereby directly interfering with a choice they made? I don’t buy the excuse that they weren’t in the right mindset. They consciously came to that decision themselves. And considering your motive is likely due to you caring about them, that you don’t want to lose them, then you’d be doing it for your own personal benefit, sort of like lying to someone you care about so as not to lose them."	1	False

Let's first not delve into more philosophical/rational/logical reasons. It should be pretty obvious that ""happiness"" is a much more important factor. If you're happy, if you enjoy living, why would you stop even if it is meaningless?

Second, if life is meaningless or pointless (because everything is just random chance) then death is too. *Everything* is meaningless or rather ""meaningvoid"".

Anyway, ""meaning"" is complete and utter bullshit. It's just something we made up. It's no more real than unicorns. Not only does it not exist, its existence isn't even testable yet we go so far as to measure it and consider some more accurate than others. Nothing is any more meaningless than it is meaningful, meaning isn't an attribute of anything at all. Things are no more ""meaningful"" than they are supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

Finally, look at anything that didn't develop the fleeting, unsubstantiated concept of meaning. Animals, plants, rocks, black holes and star dust. It all keeps on spinning and existing. Existing is simply the only possibility in the universe, if you don't exist you're not in it and vice versa. Your ""consciousness"" allows you to cease existing if you so desire, but doing so because there is no meaning is ludicrous. If you weren't ""meant"" to be, you wouldn't. You wouldn't be debating this question, you'd just kill yourself. 

Being and existing is, in a way, how it's ""meant"" to be. If you insist on having or defining meaning, that's what it is, the meaning of life is to live, the meaning of existence is to exist. After all, once you stop, the concept of meaning disappears with you. 

So yeah, you're nothing in an infinite sea of infinite nothings. You're a tiny speck of dust on a tiny planet, immeasurably huge for you, in a tiny galaxy, immeasurably huge for you, one of billions. If atoms had atoms and the universe was one you wouldn't even be an atom's atom's atom. It's been 15 billion years so far and your life is going to be a laughably tiny fraction of that, but the 15 billion years is a laughably tiny fraction of how long the universe will ""live"". Even if you do affect the fate of the universe in some minor butterfly effect kind of way, at the end of the road it's all going to be for nothing, it's all going to be dead. There will be no one to see it, experience it or be affected by it when heat death occurs. You, me and everyone are so incredibly insignificant in every possible way that our insignificant brains can't even imagine it. So, it takes an amazingly self important species to be bothered by that, to be upset we're not *something*. To delude ourselves with stories and drive ourselves insane by questions like ""why we are we here?"" and ""what's the meaning of life?"". You're here because it just so happened that you are. Don't worry, you soon won't be and you might as well never have existed. So fucking what? Seriously, so fucking what?

1. **Consideration.** This is the amount of money you put on the table, or risk, for the gambling occurence. This is satisfied by the cost of a Loot Box. If loot boxes were free, or did not cost money but rather had in-gameplay unlocks, there would be no consideration and the lootcrates would not be gambling.

2. **Chance.** This is the use of some series of rules to allow variable outcomes. If you are buying a loot box with a 100% chance of containing known contents, there is no chance and it would not be gambling. But because loot boxes contain variability, chance exists.

3. **Prize.** A prize is some object which has value and is won in the game of chance. This is where Battlefront II gets into some murky water and you say it doesn't qualify, however it does: People pay large quantities of money to get in-game cosmetics like knifes in CS:GO or hats in DOTA 2: These items have value because people are willing to pay for them, and often pay hundreds of dollars to acquire them.

With Battlefront II, you can [buy and sell](https://www.playerauctions.com/sell-battlefront-2-account) accounts which contain various levels of loot. This makes the lootboxes have a degree of gambling to them: If you roll a loot box that has a powerful, sought after prize, you have something of some monetary value which you could sell if you wanted to. The fact that EA doesn't facilitate these resales is no more relevent than a Casino not facilitating the resales of a car won as a prize: The car itself qualifies, as do the contents of loot crates.

Thus, all three basic elements of gambling are fulfilled by Battlefront II's Lootboxes.

Edit: Something I would like to point our here is that much of the moral outrage directed at EA for SWBF2 is not directed at Valve for Dota2 or CS:GO because the precise nature of the in-game content and lootboxes. Firstly, SWBF2 content unlocks grant a competitive advantage: If you unlock some hero, you are more powerful and can lead your team to victory more frequently than someone who does not pay. In contrast, you can spend thousands of dollars on knifes, guns and hats in Dota2 or CS:GO and it won't make you a better player at all: It will simply make you a more visible player. That being said, paid loot boxes in all of these examples qualify as gambling under these definitions. In these areas, game choice architecture is probably of major importance to making a determination to what should be allowed, and should not be allowed: Can you offer the sale of a loot box with a guaranteed 1 of 8 ""legendary"" prizes, where buying 8 guarantees one of each? Is it okay to offer a non-stacking % chance to also win an ""arcane"" prize on top? **These still qualify as gambling.** But there are loopholes some companies use to get around these: By offering a free entry method, you can undercut **consideration.** No casino lets you fill out a form to play a free hand of Blackjack, but Samsung and countless other sweepstakes which require some consideration (say, 10 Samsung Pay Points) to win some prize (say, 8 million Samsung Pay Points) also have a [free entry method](https://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/rewards-instant-win-official-rules-8-million-points/). They don't have to make this method easy, but it must be free and must give you a chance of winning the same prize as the paid-entry method. This does not, as yet, exist for any of the games with lootboxes I have mentioned heretofore."	3	False

For example, your assumption that there are only 2 possible reasons we haven't met aliens is really unimaginative  and limited.

No, it doesn't.

Also the biggest problem with your argument is that it's paradoxical. You specifically mention finding more advanced life, complex organisms, etc. 

What if these complex organisms were civilizations? How would that mean civilizations are rare? If we found 500 of them, why would that mean we're doomed? Remember, the more we find the more doomed we are. Why are we doomed if they're okay? What if 90% of them are space-capable?

The big point you make is that if we find any kind of life on Mars, that means that across the universe, every single civilization dies somehow before being able to travel through space like it's a physical Law. What if aliens are have interstellar capabilities and are ignoring us, like you said is possible? Why would we still be doomed then? Again it just crumbles here.

EMTs, surgeons, and combat medics often make decisions whether or not a patient is in critical condition or not. Combat medics and surgeons prioritize who receives treatment based on their condition; if an individual's condition is critical, they will receive aid prior to a soldier with a flesh wound. Identifying which wounds have the potential to be fatal if not given proper treatment is not an extremely difficult task for a trained medical professional.

Debilitating pain is just that - debilitating. If a soldier is unable to perform basic tasks and is screaming due to the fact that his internal organs are spread out across the ground next to him for example, the medic would be able to determine that the patient is overcome with incredible pain. Medics can use general intuition in determining whether an individual is experiencing great pain or whether the individual is experiencing a manageable level of pain.

Again, the combat medic would decide whether the soldier is sound enough to satisfy criterion 3.

1. Libertarians believe that Rights come from ethics.

2. The libertarian framework was created to express the values they believe would create a maximally ""moral"" society.

3. Among these are the Rights to Property, Life, a Fair Trial, Free Speech, etc.

4. These Rights exist because Libertarians believe they will maximize freedom and thus morality. 

5. With each Right comes government *laws* to enforce Rights. Each of these laws works to *restrict freedom*. In the state of nature, everyone can murder. In the state of governance, murder will be punished. In the state of nature, everyone can steal. In the state of governance, theft will be punished. Each law punishes the violation of Rights and thus morality. 

6. With each Right comes limitations to those Rights. The Right to free speech is limited by fraud and libel. The Right to Property is limited by taxes. The state also has the ability to take away certain rights as punishment.

7. In modern society, we have come to realize that the Right to be *treated fairly in the Free Market* helps make a more moral society. This Right stipulates that you cannot refuse trade against an individual solely for reasons of sex or race. We shall call this *antidiscrimination*. 

8. *Some* Libertarians, such as Ron Paul and many mainstream American branches, claim they to support the Right outlined in #7 on a personal level. They claim that refusing to trade with minorities is immoral.
From Paul:
&gt;I have always made it clear, and will continue to do so, that my message is based on the rights of all people to be treated equally. Any type of racism or anti-Semitism is incompatible with my philosophy.

9. If the Libertarians from #8 were sincere in their beliefs, because of #1 &amp; #2, a Libertarian that advocates for antidiscrimination must necessarily support Civil Rights in the fashion of the law from 1964. 

10. However, Libertarians from #8 do not support Civil Rights Act of 1964. They do not support it because it limits the Right to free Association. 

11. However, Libertarians make plenty of other exceptions to Rights when they believe it will result in a superior moral or practical outcome, ie #6. 

12. Thus, these Libertarians actually believe the Right to discriminate on the basis of race is completely legitimate. 

13. Libertarians from #8 have no other issue that they see as both immoral but legal (please name some for me!).

14. Arguments that a free market will necessarily lead to a world without racism are ridiculous (ie Ron Paul). If the free market will lead to utopia, why do you bother explicitly banning murder and theft? 

15. Thus, #8 Libertarians that purportedly believe that economic racism or sexism is immoral are hypocrites or liars. They say one thing but actually believe something else. The true Libertarian position on racism is that it's completely OK to practice, that racism is not morally significant or particularly harmful.

There's an argument that not all trans people necessarily feel dysphoria in the first place, which I agree with, but that's not even necessary to make this argument.

A trans people will feel gender dysphoria prior to transitioning. Then after transitioning, they will no longer feel gender dysphoria, because their perceivable sex traits align with their neurological gender identity. 

So at that point, they no longer suffer from gender dysphoria, but they're still trans. If being trans is synonymous with gender dysphoria (which reactionaries try to imply) that would mean transitioning isn't a valid treatment, because transitioning doesn't cure you of ""being trans"". But that's because it's not supposed to. Because ""Being trans"" itself does not fit the criteria for a mental disorder. Gender dysphoria does, which is why it's treated. But to reactionaries like Shapiro, the problem isn't that trans people are mentally unhealthy, the problem is they're trans.

1) There were many systemic problems in apartheid RSA, such as declining gold production, cumulative effects of sanctions, low level of education &amp; professional skills of the majority of the population and lack of infrastructure in the homelands.

2) When ANC came into power, it was a big party, the euphoria of coming into power, and gaining access to the assets and power of the state. From this came the famous BEE deals and a flooding of capital towards well placed individuals. It reminds me of a sharing of the loot of a pirate ship, the closer to the action you were in the struggle, the better placed you were for the rewards of what opportunities could come through government (jobs, contracts and legislative windfall)

3) I believe that NM was a great philospher and spiritual leader of the movement towards freedom, he cared of the heart of the situation and ensuring a peaceful outcome for us, because we were very close to civil war, and it would have sucked for all of SA if that went down. Unfortunately NM lacked the practical leadership of how to achieve this. In fact, as a once staunch communist, in 1994 he went with a seemingly passive approach of adopting the IMF/WTO approach. This approach neglected the systemic problems of the economy, education levels, infrastructure and other important drivers of a country. As a result, the country relied upon the trickle-down effect of income driven by government spending on ill-trained BEE contractors that were 'serendipitously' placed. It has been a hard road of many losses for the taxpayer as many funds were embezzled from national and provincial treasuries. This behaviour seems to be an outcome of the ""my time has come"" attitude of once-poor majority, with a new rich minority being created. These were funds that were meant for building the nation!

4) The reason for this mis-management is simple. The summary expulsion of skilled whites out of government institutions. As a result of the loss of these individuals who KNOW how to run a government, covering the project management lifecycle, the government no longer had the human capital to effectively implement most policy and/or project. In fact, South Africans readily recognize that the only state institution that remained fully functional was SARS. What we have seen is a style of promotion based of black first, skills second, transformation an imperative and implementation as a it will get done, eventually. To run an organization like a govt requires quite a few skills and attitudes which have to be learned. For the past 20 years we have effectively been training these skills and attitudes from scratch. All while the needs of the country as time passes remain relatively un-met.

5) I will note that NM is responsible for allowing the policy of chasing out skilled white workers in government, he kept some white ministers in his cabinet, but he did not do enough to open a welcoming hand and leverage the skills. For instance, Transnet offered packages to most white workers, which most took, and as a result, our train network lacked the skills to run it effectively and it imploded to a large extent. Its, partly why we have so many trucks on the highways today.

6) NM has done nothing to comment on the running of government. He has turned in to a stone idol that does nothing but enjoy his golden days. As the grandfather of the ANC he has a moral objective to speak out against the ill actions of his movement. His movement has instead mutated and does as it wishes while holding him up as an flaming symbol for its relevancy and authority. He is responsible for giving the ANC the power and legitimacy to continue fucking up for the same 20 year old reasons. If I were him, I would publicly rebuke the ANC leadership over its actions, and apologise to the nation for what he failed to do, and facilitate a new understanding and phase of nation building 20 years after the first attempt.

They had a lot of trouble communicating, and had a lot of strained relationships with friends and family. Instead of confronting their problems, they just delved deeper into studying. For many of them, studying was a sort of escape from the real world and the problems in it, into the easy and engaging world of abstractions.

For someone who apparently studied science, you're putting a pretty big assumption of causation here.

What do I mean by that? You're assuming that intellectual pursuits leads to emotional issues, leads to social underdevelopment and so on. However, there are at least two other equally plausible ways of interpreting that information:

1. Correlation without causation. People could be more naturally predisposed to social and emotional issues AND to intellectual pursuits, possibly for the same reasons, without the one being responsible for the other

2. Reverse causation. Rather than Intellectual pursuits -&gt; emotional difficulties -&gt; social difficulties -&gt; Intellectual pursuits, it could be that either the emotional or social difficulties are the root cause and intellectual pursuits are the coping mechanism. 

&gt; The intellectual fields promote the mindset that you should suppress the more basic instincts and make decisions according to reason. I believe that a result of this and of the constant focus on intellectual development, the emotional part of a lot of intellectuals is atrophied to the point of being hardly there at all or damaged in some way.

Except here's the thing... there are ALWAYS people who have emotional and social issues, often starting long before any intellectual pursuit. I had serious issues with social things long before I got interested in History or Political science or any of the other intellectual pursuits that I spend so much of my time on. ""Atrophied"" assumes something that was once there by no longer is. I can't speak for all introverts (for obvious reasons, we don't exactly have meet-ups), but the ones I know for the most part aren't incapable of the interaction, it simply isn't something that brings them much fulfillment. It seems odd to me to look at people doing what they find fulfilling and saying that THAT is what has damaged them, rather than saying that that is what their greater passion is and it simply appeals more strongly to those who do not fare well in emotional or social spheres.

It's unavoidable due to the soft nature of the science. However it has been shown to correlate highly with job success, and one paper disputing it doesn't invalidate all the evidence gathered beforehand.

Also, I would argue STEM and creativity are not mutually exclusive. In fact they're highly linked. Speaking as someone who likes math, I feel it's a very creative subject. But that's getting a little too personal.

As for the source, [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence) Wikipedia article gives the general picture in the second to first paragraph, and the studies linked should give the exact numbers.

As for the last sentence, it's because STEM is hard. No other way to put it. It attracts some of the smartest people in the world and I've seen friends I consider to be highly intelligent struggling with it. IQ tests attempt to measure abstract reasoning skills and pattern recognition among other things, and these are exactly the things that are needed in large amounts in STEM. There is also some numerical evidence - the average IQ of an undergraduate is 115, and that of a PhD holder is 124. Given that many STEM jobs require specialised training, it seems to follow that higher IQ people would be more suited for the job. However I admit this is not rigorous proof. Obtaining rigorous proof would involve tracking the performance of people of varying IQ levels in STEM which seems highly unethical and probably hasn't been done before."	0	False

Another poster asked me this question

&gt;What if the treatment and surgery failed and all he would have left in his last three months on earth was factual physical and psychological hell? Would you still have done everything to stop him? Would you have said ""You keep on suffering because I couldn't live with the guilt of not stopping you""?

Obviously, I didn't know how things would turn out at the time. Only now do I have the benefit of hindsight. But things turning out this way was a very real possibility. 

So let's look at a different situation. Let's say I see someone walk into traffic, very obviously trying to kill themselves, and they get hit by a car. They're lying on the ground, and their legs are very clearly mangled beyond repair. I can see that they're breathing, but they're bleeding badly, and if they survive, I'm very certain they will live whatever remains of their life with a disability. Let's say I also have the training necessary to keep them alive until paramedics arrive and take them to get the care they need to recover. The person is unconscious, so they can't tell me what they want.

What do I do? Let them bleed to death in the street? Kill them quickly so they don't suffer? Or do I do whatever I can to stabilize them? 

I don't know what the right answer is in that situation, but I know what I would do. "	2	False

Recent conventional wisdom is actually that the NBA the last few seasons has been at the absolute peak of its popularity (*edit* or, at least, more popular than it has been at any point since Jordan's second retirement). E.g., articles from 

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2018/04/25/the-2017-18-season-was-great-for-the-nba/#2cf661ab2ecbl):

&gt; The recently concluded NBA regular season has been perhaps the most successful since the league began in 1946. Television ratings are up, attendance set another record, fans are subscribing to the league's streaming service, sales of merchandise are up and the value of an average franchise is at an all-time high.

[The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1051829/2019/06/28/litan-you-may-think-the-nba-cant-get-any-more-popular-it-can-with-an-economists-radical-idea-on-star-stacking/)

&gt; The NBA is at the top of its game. It’s hard to think of a time when the league and its players have been more popular and more part of Americana – yes, even more so than during the MJ or Magic and Larry eras.

&gt; Adam Silver is widely viewed as a strong, successful commissioner, having handled some difficult tests – such as Donald Sterling’s history of racist remarks that led the commissioner to force him to sell the Clippers — with aplomb. The NBA is working on going even more global. The league games are already widely watched around the world, while the world has come to the NBA, with more foreign players in the league than ever before. The countdown to where the superstar NBA free agents — KD, Klay, Kyrie, Kemba — “take their talents” at the start of the free agency period on Sunday has generated huge interest.

[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/martin-rogers/2018/10/15/nba-america-fans-favorite-pastime/1652952002/)

&gt; According to a Twitter study earlier this year, the NBA was the most discussed sports league in 2018, LeBron James was the most talked about athlete and the Cleveland Cavaliers held the distinction of being the most Tweeted-about team. Expect only one of those things to change when the next set of figures rolls in.

&gt; As the new NBA season prepares to tip off, so too does America’s true sporting pastime.

The recent boom in interest in the league has coincided with the rise of all the trends that you bemoan. I'd submit that unless you think the game is being played very differently in the 2019-2020 season than it was in 2017-2018 or 2018-2019, your argument that people don't like the recent changes to the game isn't particularly strong. 

Personally, I'm a decade older than you and have been watching basketball since the early 90s myself, and I love watching it right now (and I fucking hated watching that Pistons team). Some of the most fun I had watching basketball was during the Steve Nash Suns years, which was a precursor to the high-pace, shooting-heavy game that has come to dominate today. You may not like ""math,"" but math suggests teams most efficiently score points through a combination of three-point shooting and dunking, both of which are fun (for me) to watch, and both of which are facilitated by a faster-paced game *edit* with more ball movement. I find this style of game more fun to watch than slow, ISO-heavy possessions. The NBA's rise in popularity during this period suggests others feel the same way.

I agree with you that West Coast Imbalance is a bad explanation, because it doesn't fit what we know about the recent popularity of the league; but by the same token, pretending like the type of basketball that has taken hold the last few years must explain a couple of months of soft performance seems like bad use of evidence.

I also think it's a little silly to write off the absence of major stars as an explainer for the league's diminished popularity so far this season. The NBA has always been a very top-heavy, star-driven league when it comes to popularity. Prolonged absences of [2 of the top 3 guys, (and 3 of the top 10) on this list](https://store.nba.com/top-selling-jerseys/x-145027+z-93281429-1493771407) is obviously going to have an impact on fan interest.

That said, I think it's hard to know what specifically drives ratings down at any given time. Maybe the China thing is hurting the NBA. Maybe the vast re-alignment of team strength in the NBA this offseason (decline of GSW, decline of SAS, rise of LAL/LAC, rise of DAL) takes some getting used to and hurts ratings. Who knows. But I think pinning it on evolutions in the game that have been going on for a while and have coincided with huge league success is not particularly convincing."	2	False

All of the labeling of ""unsound, dishonest, and dangerous to a free society"" apply to Senator Hawley just as easily here.

For example, when he says: ""No, I don't think so."" He is intentionally playing a semantic game with ""man"". He knows she means gender. He intentionally uses it as ""sex"" without explaining. If he didn't want a snarky reply, he should have answered in a more forthright way.

And I think it's completely likely that Senator Hawley does not actually care about people representing as a different gender, but he wants votes from a base that gets motivated about it. That sounds dishonest to me.

And ""dangerous to a free society."" Why choose this? I mean, dial up any Tucker Carlson episode and the danger is looking way higher. This exchange is milquetoast by comparison. But even lensed in at this conversation, she's not behaving any worse than he is.

Firstly, NYC did do prep rations for hurricane Sandy to reduce the damage (sandbags, sealing subways, that sort of thing). Was it easy? That’s a subjective question. A better question is, was  the expense of dealing with the hurricane worth the trade-off of building next to a body of water. 

Given that NYC has benefited as a trading port, immigration hub, and population center basically because of it’s location next to water for hundreds of years; the answer to that is yes.

Say your city makes a 100,000 dollars a year in 1800 by being next to a trade route (which is primarily waterways). Repairing damage from hurricanes/floods costs $10,000. Thus it makes economic sense even if you have storm surge or flash floods. 

Your position, is that you could just as easily have built away from the body of water (river/ocean) and been safe; but you would have been less prosperous. Plus without sources of water, you have a problem with clean drinking water and flushing waste. The river Themes was a sewer for London for a long long time. 

The argument of “you just didn’t have to build near X” could be applied to any natural disaster. For example:

Earthquakes aren’t a natural disaster, all you had to do was not built on a fault line.

VVP had the same thing, and so do the Sweden Democrats, where all other parties have pre-committed not to coalition with them.  If the other parties steadfastly refuse to bring you into government, getting 15-20% just does not give you actual political power, and as long as you can't break that boycott and/or start getting so big that you can do things like form a majority government, it does not translate to political power."	2	False

I will not attempt to prove to you that memorisation is the 'subject skill', or most useful skill, only that in many areas it is nonetheless a necessary one, required before more complex knowledge can be understood or analysed. 

&amp;nbsp;
**Memorisation for Language Comprehension**

Let's take a simple example from language/English courses;  in order to make ourselves understood we have to learn, and essentially memorise, proper syntax, spelling and conjugation.  While anyone *could* look up every word and grammar check every sentence/paragraph, someone who has 'memorised' this information is able to communicate more clearly and effectively.  Better still, that communication can occur in real time, as there is no need to painfully check and recheck the message whether incoming or outgoing. 

&amp;nbsp;
**Memorisation for Scientific Understanding**

Now, let me share a similar example from a chemistry classroom.  At the beginning of a student's studies in Chemistry (and several other fields of science), they are required to memorised many of the atomic symbols and numbers for the elements on the periodic table.  Soon afterwards students learn naming (and writing) conventions for commonly found ions and chemical components.  Naturally, knowing the nomenclature and having this information ready to hand does not make one a chemist alone, but it does represent a vital skill set.   Without this, our hypothetical chemistry student would have to stop to look up every single element in a chemical compound;  even the analysis of a simple chemical reaction would become a complex, draining task.  Again, the memorised knowledge enables more rapid communication and comprehension of information.  


&amp;nbsp;
**Back to the Real World**

Returning to your 'real life' criteria, communication (or information uptake) is a vital everyday activity in most fields of work or study.   Likewise, most jobs require the employee to have at his/her command a requisite skill-set and knowledge-base - many of them under considerable time pressure.  In this respect, exams that require a certain amount of memorisation do accurately reflect some real life situations.  "	4	False

I think you actually *have to* solve this issue first before moving to other reasons for abortion for two reasons:

1)Wouldn't reason dictate that we should err on the side of caution if you don't know if the fetus is a person? It would be tremendously amoral IMO to say that you might be killing someone but it doesn't matter because it's hard to decide and just sweep that under the rug and move on to other criteria. 

2)You say we should take into account what is best for the fetus, but if you haven't decided that fetus=person then there is no real reason you should care about that. The decision of the mother(and possibly the father) would be the only real important aspect in that case. What's best for the fetus only would come into play if you consider it a person, so you have to decide that first.

I think most of your problems here relate to the fact that you give too much importance to what appears **visually**, rather than what truly makes a person who they are - their psyche/mind/soul. People who give too much importance to visual-ness or physicality often have problems in assessing someone's wealth, class, politics, personal views, religion and more importantly character. This is not just bad for others, it is bad for YOU as well, because your instincts are wrong and can fail you.

Both Hitler and Genghis Khan committed genocides despite belonging to different races. Both Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr believed in non-violent resistance despite being of different races. Both Stalin and Mao believed in communism. Most Filipinos, Mexicans and Irish identify as Catholics, while Turkish, Bangladeshis, Nigerians and Indonesians identify as Muslim.

Similarly, both Gandhi and King wore different clothes. Malala Yosufai wears a headscarf/hijab, and fights for women's rights. Both Sikhs and Muslims (two very different religions) wear turbans and have beards. Indonesians, Filipinos and Japanese have different religions despite appearing similar to outsiders.

Appearances regarding race, gender and clothing don't matter much, and basing one's instinct on them is bad for others and yourself. Of course a flamboyant gay man wearing fishnet stockings and a turban-wearing brown sikh man may be very uncomfortable around each other, but that doesn't mean they can't sit side-by-side on a bus.

The reality is it hasn't changed from originally being a white supremacy flag to something more innocent today, the white supremacists are the ones that hijacked it.  I'm not familiar with the history of the swastika pre-Nazi, but the Nazi flag was a purely political symbol from the rise of Hitler until the fall of the third reich.  An analogous comparison between the Confederates and the Germans would be the [Balkenkreuz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Regulation_WW_II_Upperwing_Balkenkreuz.png), because the that was a wehrmacht symbol and not a pro genocide political statement."	3	False

And I don’t know how else I’m supposed to support my idea that if a company had a particular business model prior to their regulations, why would they do something different than what they did before once those regulations are gone. That’s like saying I was selling lemonade on my street corner and letting my customers use extra sugar, napkins, straws and whatever they wanted or needed for no extra charge and then all of a sudden my Home Owners Association said I couldn’t charge extra for napkins, sugar, straws if I wanted to do that. Then we get a new HOA committee. They remove those restrictions. Why would I change to charging for the napkins? Please don’t give me the more profits response, that’s such a horrible answer.

&gt;Literally every group must be equally represented in every position of power, or else there will be equality. 

I'm sure you meant *in*equality here. 

___

I think some of the misunderstanding comes from the word ""minority"" itself. Given the literal/dictionary meaning of the word, it makes sense that people would find it confusing. That makes it more confusing is that, on a global scale, white men are actually a small portion of the global population despite everything else. So, I will agree that the word ""minority"" is probably not the best especially in this instance given how women tend to outnumber men for biological and social reasons.

I would also argue that this is beside the point. Words definitions are not set by the dictionary and any linguist would tell you to burn the dictionary since language is organic and not set in stone. This is something we do out of convenience and rightfully so. Still, it is important to remember that the definitions can be bent. If we use ""minority"" to describe someone whose interests are not represented in choices made at high levels in government and private companies then that will become its new definition.

Is this confusing and impractical? Yes. Regardless, this is how language works. Whether or not ""minority"" is the correct word to use is irrelevant beyond outreach (which is important, more important than feminists seem to think), the problem still stands. That the interests of those in positions of power mean that white men are often favoured at the expense of others. At the very least, people should at least have their interests represented in positions of power by people who don't have any conflicts in that interest. 

I'd like to address your second point:

&gt; I'm just not getting these points:

&gt; ...

&gt;If Group A is in power, they will do things that benefit Group A; They are not capable of doing things to benefit Group B or any other group.

It's true that a hypothetical Group A will do things to benefit Group B. The problem is that given a conflict of interest you should expect them choose a result which is in their favour. That is the problem. Further to this, given the disparity of experience between things like gender and race, even if Group A was trying its hardest to be considerate of Group B they might make changes which Group B doesn't even want or see fit. Think of White people who are overly considerate of things like race to the point where people of that race think the action is absurd.

Hence, the easiest away to get around these two problems is just to simply include these people in the decision-making processes. That's just democratic after all. It is not without problems but it is the best we have been able to come up with so far.

Now, your argument then finishes by pointing to a slippery slope. That somehow if we started being considerate of people who lack power and try to represent them this would see no end and that we can't accommodate for everyone's needs even if we tried. That may or may not be true. However, we can still try to do more. In the same way that I can never write the perfect response to change your view, that I'll never be able to play a perfect game of chess, in the same way that we will never reach utopia, we still need to make attempts to *try*. 

Perhaps over months of trying to change people's opinion, I'll get better at it and perhaps one day we'll be able to represent people whose voices aren't necessarily being heard without massive protest and organisation into movements to perturb the system because they do not have the power to change anything without that Group A.

Suppose that we have a superintelligence with near-infinite rhetorical brilliance. The superintelligence plays a game with interested humans. First, it takes the hundred or so most controversial topics, chooses two opposing positions on each, writes the positions down on pieces of paper, and then puts them in a jar. Then it chooses one position at random and tries to convince the human of that position. We observe that in a hundred such games, every human player has left 100% convinced of the position the superintelligence drew from the jar. Now it’s your turn to play the game. The superintelligence picks a position from the jar. It argues for the position. The argument is supremely convincing. After hearing it, you are more sure that the position is true than you have ever been of anything in your life; there’s so much evidence in favor that it is absolutely knock-down obvious. Should you believe the position?

&gt;The inside view tells you yes; upon evaluating the argument, you find it clearly true. The outside view tells you no; judging from the superintelligence’s past successes, it could have convinced you equally well of the opposite position. If you are smart, you will precommit to never changing your mind at all based on anything the superintelligence says. You will just shut it out of the community of entities capable of persuading you through argument.

An active shooter poses a potentially lethal threat to those around them, and while the cops should try to take them alive, they are perfectly justified in shooting that person to protect others.  After all, the shooter is violating his victim's rights, so if anything the cops would be protecting constitutional rights.

I’m simply reading the amendment. Nowhere does it say that “if a person is violating the life liberty or property of others w no due process, the government can do the same to that person”. This ain’t Hammurabi’s code. Again, I personally agree that cops should be able to shoot an active shooter. But an objective reading of the 5th amendment shows that this is unconstitutional. 

&gt; By this logic we should never use force ever during the pursuit of criminals.  You are essentially saying that the government should let violent criminals get away if they can't be arrested peacefully because that violates their right to due process and/or protections against cruel and unusual punishment.

When two rights are in conflict, we must determine which right has supremacy.  In such cases, we generally say that _negative_ rights (the right to not have things done to you) are superior to _positive_ rights (the right to have others do things for you).

In the case of the woman, her _negative_ right to body autonomy is in conflict with the fetus's _positive_ right to use her body for gestation.  The only resolution is to violate one party's rights in favor of the other's, and as I have mentioned, we tend to give negative rights before positive ones - particularly when it comes to medical decisions.  This is true in nearly any other case you can put forward; a man with O- blood is not compelled to donate (preservation of his negative right), despite the fact that said blood may save the lives of countless others (their positive right to healthcare).  A parent with a compatible kidney is able to say no to donation (their negative rights), despite the fact that that kidney may save the life of their child (their positive right).

Perhaps in some far out future, we will have the technology where both sets of rights can be preserved - perhaps some artificial womb technology will be invented where the fetus can be given the care it requires (and thus preserve its positive rights) while the woman can have the fetus removed from her body at the same time (and thus preserve her negative rights).  Until such time as that technology is invented, however, we must ultimately decide who's rights will be supreme.

Lobbyists are not always donors.  Donors directly to a campaign are only individuals by law.  If you're talking about corporate donations to parties or PACs, that's a different issue entirely.

Campaigns are expensive not because they accept a lot of money in donations, but because campaign operations cost a lot of money.  As it stands, campaigns do not have enough money to do what they want or need.

Indeed, one popular solution to the puppy mill conundrum is to not give them any money, and to instead adopt a puppy (providing there is one available). A less popular but also effective solution at reducing the net harm from puppy mills, as a consumer in a market economy, would be to scour puppy mills and purchase a puppy from one with *good* conditions for the animals (and make it known the good conditions are a large factor in your decision to purchase from them), and make it known to those with *bad* conditions for the animals that those conditions are why you are declining to purchase their product. Puppy mills do not operate at the scale where they can easily disregard the opinions (and lack of purchase) of a consumer, especially since there are a lot of consumers who would almost assuredly be willing to do this if they understood how markets worked.

Under what you're suggesting, one would find a puppy mill with the most deplorable conditions, and purchase *because* the conditions are deplorable. In a market economy, this is you saying that you find puppy mills with deplorable conditions to be acceptable. Even if you voice your displeasure verbally, you've voted with your dollars and said that the conditions are not a reason you'll fail to purchase. In fact, bad conditions in this case actually spur on the purchase, meaning if everyone in a market behaved like this there would be a market incentive to running a puppy mill with deplorable conditions for the animals.

Your solution seeks to reduce average short term animal suffering, at the cost of increasing average long term animal suffering. This makes it, ethically speaking, a bad solution. The other solutions (purchasing based on good conditions or adopting) do increase average short term animal suffering, but reduce average long term animal suffering. The long term benefit outweighs any short term harms, because otherwise those short term harms would perpetuate in the long term; you get a net reduction in harm so long as you pick a sufficiently large time period to consider the long term. The least ethical choice is to buy a puppy from a mill with the most deplorable conditions you can find, and that choice is probably even less ethical than not obtaining a puppy at all.

A similar analogy can be made with animal slaughter for food, due to the suffering of those animals. There's the option of going vegetarian. There's also the option of only eating meat from animals that were ethically raised and humanely slaughtered and supporting artificial meat (when that becomes a commercial reality). Both options are *much* better than the alternatives."	6	False

&gt; I'm not an economics expert but from what I know about supply and demand, once the supply of workers goes up through immigration the demand decreases and thus the wages will also go down. 

While supply and demand has some effect on wages, [this report shows](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1153.pdf) that this is actually a negligible factor compared to internal practices and other employees' wages in a company. A company has a budget and has an idea of how much they want to pay an employee. They also have other employees at that pay scale. They can't just reduce an existing employee's wages. They may be able to pay a new hire less, but even then that person will figure out they're getting shafted and ask for more. 

&gt; The Native Americans were unable to control their borders and ultimately were largely displaced by the settlers. 

The Native Americans were also mostly wiped out by diseases they were not immune to and had a huge technological disadvantage. Nothing of the sort is happening today with immigration. We can't compare a scenario from 400 years ago to today. 

I feel like in the immigration discussion we never discuss the positives. It's always about the negatives. There are TONS of positives. Most notably, these are people who actually WANT to live in your country. That means they [commit less crime](https://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/jtf/JTF_ImmigrantsCrimeJTF.pdf) because they don't want to be deported. They [work harder (more hours)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2165079916686358) when self-employed and are often *overqualified* for jobs because they don't get their credentials recognized or just plain discrimination. 

Meanwhile, most of them do all of this without the institutional support given to natural born citizens. They have less access to credit, less access to social benefits, and STILL [tend to attain more education](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7043/1/wp287.pdf) than natural born citizens.

&gt;Some rights are also given as a human right like ability to vote, own property, have healthcare and many others.

Although healthcare is considered a human right in the UN's declaration, it isn't really considered a right in the US-- ""The United States, Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey are the only member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that do not recognize universal health care as a basic human right. Our Constitution and the Bill of Rights do not guarantee access to health care."" [Source](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(19)35806-5/fulltext)

You could argue that not having healthcare often doesn't hurt people immediately-- not being able to see dentists, for instance, might not hurt you right away but could harm your teeth in the long run. 

If pensions could be denied for reasons like not having kids, then it could become more extreme. For instance, the government might say that you only are able to have access to healthcare/a dentist/birth control if you have a job. 

&gt;Other than it is not a temporary solution, which is enough ground to think about the alternatives, I have personally an issue with moral aspect of it. Not immigration itself, but on relying on it to bolster a population of a country. That just implies you are accepting that people would live in poverty in some other country, possibly living there entire childhood, only just to emigrate to your country. You are indeed helping them, but what if they will be developed enough to get their of demographic crisis? You now do not have new migrants and the issue is there once again. Do you even want to help other countries if the implication is they will stop immigrating to your country?

When we think about population replacement, we often think about four different things: birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration. I was curious if you'd thought about other ways to tackle an aging population. Immigration is just one idea, and it might be logistically easier than making pensions reliant on children (you have to deal with poverty, income levels, abuse and exploitation, etc).

&gt;Do you even want to help other countries if the implication is they will stop immigrating to your country?

Not all immigrants or emigrants are impoverished (immigration takes a lot of money), and I doubt that it will ever stop. Even if all countries were equal (all had the same laws, economies, etc), people would still immigrate to other countries for a variety of reasons (ex: if they wanted to be closer to their family members, etc). 

It also isn't a temporary solution-- the UN report on the US that I cited earlier notes that:

&gt;""Accordingly, the total population of the United States is projected to increase continuously from 267 million in 1995 to 349 million in 2050 (the results of the 1998 United Nations projections are shown in the annex tables). By 2050, out of this total population of 349 million, 59 million, or 16.8 per cent, would be post-1995 immigrants or their descendants.""

so the population would end up increasing."	3	False

You don't get to just choose who adopts you. It was something where like just 16 or so years ago only 30% of Americans believed gays should be able to marry one another; so imagine how it looked like for trans people.

The gays and the trans were marginalized under similar circumstances.

Really, virtually the only thing that religious people all have in common is a belief in some kind of supernatural higher power. 

It's hard to describe how that affects someone's thinking, because there are a lot of ways that it can, and with that comes changes in the way the people live their earthly lives. If you think about it, just the fact that *this isn't all there is* is a real shift of paradigm from the way a secular person lives their life.

And that... I guess that's part of my point. If you don't legitimately have that faith, I'm not really sure how you're going to live it. And if you don't live in your faith, I'm not sure what you teach your daughter will be a good approximation of whatever religion you choose.

Which itself raises a great question. How do you even choose a religion? Religion as an intellectual choice or strategy is a bit... unusual, if not sacrilegious.

Great! Let's consider a movie like this:

* You buy the ticket.

* You enter the theater and get seated.

* You see the previews.

* After the previews, the movie starts.

* The movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes of the color blue. The entire projection screen is solid blue for the entire time. That is the movie.

* After 1 hour and 30 minutes of the solid color blue, the movie ends. The lights come up. You can leave.

Would you recommend this ""movie""?

If paintings have come so far that crap like a ""painting"" of solid blue are now considered art, then perhaps the medium has been exhausted, and no longer has stories to tell. When all the story that remains to be told in this medium is meta-story - paintings *about* painting - well, maybe there *is* no more story.

Move on to other media that hasn't exhausted all its content yet. Perhaps the movies."	32	False

They don't apply in the example you provided, but IMO they're worth thinking about if you want to talk about immigrants and language in general.

2. This is a situation that is unique to the US- What about expat communities in other countries? While language learning is often valued, I'm certain that you could find Westerners living in South Asia who are there primarily to take advantage of low costs of living, and don't make much of an effort to learn the language; What of expats who don't bother to adapt to the culture's norms and customs and expect to be catered to by locals?

She sees that your grandma has daughters and signals this to the reader. The reader says: *''Good question, but I see here that you have a sick daughter''*. This is a pretty good guess, since almost no people are perfectly healthy. ""Sick"" is a really broad term. It can be a cold, it can be depression, it can be pregnancy morning sickness, it can be mental or physical disabilities etc. This is an especially good guess if your grandma has multiple daughters since it's even likelier that it will fit one of them.

I think the biggest weak points of your argument are your objections to hold periods and background checks.  For the hold period, it is just really counterintuitive that we should be more concerned about not being able to defend ourselves during a relatively small window of time (the hold period) than we are concerned about how the *entire system* prevents nutjobs from getting their hands on guns.  We should be willing to accept that very small risk if it means making a *huge* systemic improvement.

When it comes to implementing the background checks and eliminating unregulated individual transfers, again, there is a huge disparity between your concern and what's actually at stake.  If Timmy and his grandpa need to fill out some paperwork before Timmy officially owns grandpa's rifle, we should be willing to accept that very minor inconvenience for the greater good.  Also, I don't see why it is hard to imagine implementing these regulations.  We already do it with vehicles; you can't legally own a vehicle without it being registered and identified, and you can't sell or give away a vehicle without updating the registration.  There's no reason why we can't do the same thing with guns.

Unless you just don't think the hassle is worth it – and this is what it really comes down to.  Do you really care enough about gun violence that you are willing to budge even a little bit on your own personal sense of protection, or your personal hobby, whichever it is?  If the answer is ""no"", we're better off if you just say ""no, it isn't worth it"", rather than pretending like the problem is with the solutions being proposed.  You can't have a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, and if gun violence isn't really any problem from your perspective, we should at least be clear on that much.

The first is that HAES and Fat Acceptance shouldn’t be judged by their worst and most vocal proponents. You’ll find crazies in every movement. The basic tenant of both is that fat people are just as worthy as thin. And that we shouldn’t judge people based on their looks. I think (hope) most of us can get behind that.

The second is that health is not a binary, yes-or-no thing. Let’s say you are 200 lb and 5’4. You are obese. If health was box, you wouldn’t fit into it. (edit: pun not intended!). But let’s say you were 400 lb two years ago and you have drastically improved your diet and your levels of activity, losing 200 lbs and a host of vascular/endocrine problems. On a continuum of health, you are certainly healthier. You might be in the best shape of your adult life. And yet society would take one look at you and still consider you unhealthy. Or let’s say you are 300 lbs and decide you can’t diet because reasons. But a FA or HAES proponent inspired you to walk 10,000 steps everyday and add a salad with each lunch. You are still 300 but way healthier than you were. If we look at health more subjectively and on a case-by-case basis, more people are likely to live happier,  fuller and -yes- healthier lives.

It’s not necessarily about ignoring that being overweight/fat is unhealthy so much as supporting people as important and worthy regardless of how much space they take up."	38	False

I'm pretty sure the COVID vaccine is going to be more of a regular vaccine like the flu than a one and done like MMR. We've already got a few variants of COVID floating around. It's entirely possible that variants arise that the vaccines don't affect.

If that happens, we're almost back to square one in terms of herd immunity. So I think it's going to be one of those viruses they closely monitor and adapt vaccines for.

That's the world where the vaccine passport would come into play. A year from now if that future plays out, it's going to be important to help prevent the outbreak of a variant turning into another pandemic.

And as an aside, it's not like we haven't had vaccine passports for decades. It's just they've been limited to travelling to/from different countries. This is just an iteration of that idea on a domestic level."	2	False

Ridding of the slips essentially forces bank users to adapt the technology they may or may not want to use.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine I don't use a banking app. And I don't know very much about technology so I have no idea that a bank teller is supposed to electronically enter information when I make a deposit. I go to the bank, make a deposit for $1000. The bank teller never enters a single thing in electronically (If you do nothing, there are no mistakes to track, it as if nothing ever happened, countering your point of tracking electronic changes to specific users). They go into a back room to ""make the deposit"", and come out and tell me to sign the screen, I sign the screen, the bank teller gets a confirmation window on their end and clicks ""Cancel"" instead of submit, oops. I leave thinking my $1000 has been deposited, but it was put into the wrong deposit box/teller sneakily messed with it when putting it in the box in the back room to avoid the cameras, something as sinister as you can think of. Later I come back, check my balance, its $1000 short, I say ""I deposited $1000 with Jane Doe last week"". Ooh looks like there's no record of a deposit on your account, it never went through. Do you have any proof of the deposit? Nope.

This is the kind of think you must think of. Is it unlikely? Yes. Would it be very coincidental? Yes. Would a required signing of a paper slip at deposit solve the issue? Yes. This is a common tactic used in computer programming to find bugs.

My reasoning is that when you lessen your cognitive skills with specific drugs, you become more likely to endanger others and put the public at risk. If we have criminal laws against putting the public at risk (i.e. radically speeding or street racing), then there's no reason not to apply them to drugs.

You can imprison people for engaging in risky activities, but you can't imprison people for the possibility they might engage in a risky activity. If a person locks themselves in a room werewolf style and does a bunch of drugs, then it should be legal. They have no possibility of endangering others. If a person takes a bunch of drugs and then drives, wanders into traffic, or otherwise puts other people at risk, then they should be imprisoned. But the key thing here is that it is the risky activity that should be illegal. To ban a drug is to say that taking a drug is inherently a risky activity to others. That means there is no possibility of using it in a way that doesn't risk hurting others. I can't think of a single drug like that.

There are a lot of other arguments against drugs, but since you listed this specific one, I am responding about this specific one."	6	False

And I'm going to be honest, I can't help but feel like that is a totally reasonable ask for Twitch to make.

It's not equitable for streamers. Currently, 99% of streamers make $2.50 per sub with the exception of streamers who make a higher split, but those same streamers are probably in the .01%.

Ads are forced. This is a form of control over content basically, because streamers used to have the option to run ads at their own peril. Now, they MUST do it even if it's not good for their numbers.

The last major revenue source is promoted content like banner ads. This was the highest share of revenue split because it cut Twitch out of the equation and did a brand deal with the individual and not the platform. Nothing is prohibiting Twitch from monetizing the other two ways, but this is essentially taking brand deals that were in the 7k-10k range and hacking them down to probably $1500 at most.



>You can still have links to the sponsor, you can still talk about the sponsor, you can still show off the sponsored products or play the sponsored game, and you can still have that corner logo of the sponsor.

Because if they changed the status quo of any of these things the blowback would be double or triple what it's going to be based on yesterday's announcement. Not because Twitch is being benevolent.

>You just can't have banners that take up like the whole bottom quarter of the screen or run literal video ads on stream. Both of which most people don't even like on the first place because people don't even like ads.

People dislike specific types of ads. That's what makes the entire streamer culture profitable. Streamers are essentially the ultimate form of social proof, like asking a friend if they actually like a product based on their specific use case. This is different from shitty pre-roll and midroll ads that may not even be relevant to you even if you are one of the few people who selects ad relevance options.



>The one argument I keep seeing is that it will harm eSports and large tournaments since they rely on banner ads and video ads. And to that, I just don't understand why they can't just convert to the small logo in the corner? Or just have a bot occasionally post the link to the sponsor in the chat? If the sponsor isn't offering those kinds of ads, then why aren't people mad at the sponsors instead? Like, gatekeeping the kinds of ads you allow for your sponsorships sounds mad controlling to me, and I certainly would be pissed.

They aren't mad at Sponsors because Sponsors aren't creating the terrible business environment. The entire Issue is that Twitch has been under threat by youtube since youtube started experimenting with livestreaming. Twitch isn't profitable despite being 15 years old (including Justiv.tv days) and being owned by Amazon. Right now, Twitch streamers are looking for reasons TO STAY ON TWITCH. Twitch is not giving them those reasons.

1.)All of Twitch's functionality except for bits and I think community emojis  are available on youtube live. Even then, super chatting is a comparable and arguably superior feature.

2.)Youtube content can be converted into monteized vods. Twitch only has a pay-per view option where they can disable vods for non-subs and that's it.

3.)Youtube is ASTRONOMCIALLY larger than Twitch. Youtube has 1.5 Billion daily users compared to Twitch's 7-10 Million. 

4.)My personal favorite. You can rewind streams live. Twitch has been in the streaming game for longer than Youtube has and somehow they haven't been able to add basic rewind functionality for live streaming. It's a joke.

5.)Youtube is so large and in so much command of the market, they don't try to fuck with people that don't want to be advertised to. I have about a half a dozen adblockers targeted at just Twitch that have been routinely patched out for the last 2-3 years pretty much every 3 months on the nose. I've been running Adblock and Sponsorblock on youtube for 13 and 8 years respectively and not once has youtube ever made it nessescary to add additional measures. It's a better environment for streamers.



> because Twitch is asking sponsors to not be the central focus of a stream.

This is not what is happening. Twitch is trying to protect it's bottom line over the streamers by forcing advertisers to use Twitch as a middleman because they can't turn a profit. So they are basically doing everything in their power to become profitable and they just demonstrated that they don't care about the quality of the product so long as they are acting in service to becoming profitable. It has nothing to do with the focus of a stream. Twitch doesn't care who makes it or who doesn't.



Ultimately what is reasonable is relative to the environment you exist in. For example it's not reasonable to expect high speed internet in a country that can barely provide power infrastructure to its buildings.


It's not reasonable for Twitch to act this way, when they no longer have the legitimate power to do so. Streamers want a reason to stay on Twitch. Not the other way around.

Youtube is larger and superior in 95% of scenarios.

Kick gives better revenue splits for subs (95% to the content creator vs 50%) AND doesn't have garbage anti-adblocker policy.

Rumble is built upon dissolving the censorship in livestreaming spaces and provides a space for edgy content creators to exist in the face of Twitch's highly preferential treatment to their top earners and absolute horrid treatment to anyone outside the top 95% of twitch streamers.

You don't get to be this awful when you have legitimate competition staring you down. THATS what's not reasonable."	11	False

Ayn Rand to me sounded more like she had an axe to grind about people and society, she used her intellect to justify convincing selfish assholes to be even bigger selfish assholes. She just never seemed like she got over whatever it was bothering her, and used that as a way to justify her own actions that caused her own sadness. It was a big case of denial to me. Intellect to me is to go against primal nature, instead of doing what a lot of people do, rationalize their anger and convince themselves it's okay to be this way, to let the madness grasp you and linger in it as a form of mental masturbation. When others read this who don't know any better, they hold the author to high esteem, and it begins the cycle again. 

To give a better bead on my way of thinking about all this, my principle isn't black and white. I love Camus, the person and his writing. The thing is, he talked about scary existential topics that most people are afraid to think of, but the way he reasoned it all had heart and a great way to soak in the horribleness of it all. 

As for Heath Ledger and movies, that's a different subject for me. When it comes to Heath Ledger I think that was just an honest accident. Movies in themselves, oddly, I don't worry about this as much, with a few exceptions. 

Even when it comes to music, let's just say I don't listen to Nirvana anymore because after understanding where that music came from, and it's meaning, was from a man whom I respect and feel sorry for but the music doesn't mean anything to me anymore like it did when I was younger. 

All I'm saying is it really depends.

Nietzsche is another good example, even though he was a mess. His view points went against what I would think he really wanted to do... Which was most likely kill himself. Instead, he cared about the reader, and himself, as well as others. 

Ernest Hemingway was a good writer, but Egotistical and full of himself. I'm sure he communicated his stories with vigor, and was on point. But, he didn't try to change anything, he relished in it. Rolled around in it like a playboy. 

I'm not saying most of the Authors aren't smart, or on point, but I question their intentions and what that puts in the mind of myself.

I believe that more moral behaviour has remained constantly high, while immoral behaviour is low and dropping. In Western society the immoral beliefs are nuanced more and more.

While things such as love thy neighbour, and the punishment of sins will always remain.

Basically (I believe), people shape religion to their morals, and still benefit off the anticipation of divine reward/punishment. It does not matter what the bible says. After all, I think only a low percentage of Christians knows what the bible really says.

I believe it is very possible to make an argument as to why religion promotes immoral behaviour from an outside point of view.

That said, I have no idea how many people are allergic to the ingredients of NotMilk as opposed to dairy milk, which is a common allergen.

If ""healthy"" is too ambiguous to lock down, perhaps it's possible to focus on whether or not it's a good *alternative* to milk. But yet again, it's very subjective. NotMilk is a good alternative for people who are: counting calories, watching their cholesterol, need more fiber/calcium/iron. It's not a good alternative for people who are: watching their sodium intake, need more calories/protein/Vitamin B12/Vitamin A/Riboflavin/Phosphorus/Magnesium/Zinc.

So I'm not really sure if your view *can* be changed, because it's entirely subjective and unique to each individual (in this case, you). If you were deathly allergic to pea protein, NotMilk would be a very unhealthy alternative to milk. If you were desperately trying to manage your cholesterol, NotMilk would be a healthy alternative.

You become a Pokemon master by training Pokemon and beating gyms. Part of that process is getting to know every Pokemon and what better way to do than to ""catch 'em all""?

Lets apply this logic to something else. If you know everything there is to know about strawberries, blueberries and bananas, you're a strawberry, blueberry and banana master, not a fruit master. If you know everything about scoring goals in soccer (football) but nothing about how to defend, you're an offensive master, not a soccer/football master.

But there is nothing that would cause me to lose weight that I like. Boxing, MMA, and martial arts didn't work at all. Have you any suggestions?

For me, swimming has always worked the best.  Even when I am in horrible shape, I enjoy being able to get in the water and gliding through it.  I would check to see if there is a local [Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_swimming) swimming practice near you because they are great at provide motivation, instruction, and working with you are whatever level you currently are at.  If your current swimming proficiency isn't good enough to do a Masters practice, then you can see if there are adult swim lessons available.  If nothing else, being a strong swimmer might prove useful in an emergency so even if you don't lose any weight or get in any better shape, you can still walk away feeling like you got some benefit out of your time.

Similarly, biking and kayaking have also always sat well with me.  While I don't enjoy them as much as swimming, they produce a similar feeling of gliding and they give opportunities to see more scenery than having your face in a pool.  They do involve more equipment and the right terrain, but if you have access to a decent biking trail or a lake, then this is something you can do fairly regularly.

Nature hikes are also great for me.  By my standards, they aren't super active but they are very pleasant and enjoyable, to the point that I am currently trying to get a job leading them full time.  For someone who is just starting on trying to be more active, they can provide enough movement to get the ball rolling.  It is then not too difficult to increase the distance you cover or the difficulty of the trails if you want to push yourself further.

I've seen a lot of people use team sports like soccer or basketball to great success.  For many people, the camaraderie of the people they play with provides a strong motivator to keep coming back.  Even if you don't play on an actual team and just join regular pickup games, this can be very effective.  Personally, I have gotten this feeling the best from LARPing and if you have a decent group nearby you can make it a regular activity that keeps you just as active as any sport.  I did, however, approach LARPing from a martial artist background and so if martial arts didn't work for you LARPing might not either (unless you can get super into the roleplaying side).

I do know a lot of people who enjoy running, but I am assuming you have already tried it.  It is usually the first thing people try with fitness because of the lack of equipment or facilities needed and the high visibility of other people doing it.  However, the more overweight you are to begin with the tougher it is on your joints and if you have bad for it will never feel good.  It took me years to get comfortable with it and even then it was only because I started doing triathlons to prove that my swimming was better than family member's running.

I should also make note of the fact that no matter how many workouts I list, it will never be comprehensive.  There are thousands of possible activities out there and there is no way I could list them all.  What I will say is that if you have no idea what you are doing and just trying to get started and motivated, having some sort of instruction is crucial.  Look at your local community center, colleges, and/or gyms to see what kind of fitness classes they teach.  You will get far more out of it if you have some sort of coach to help you and the class listings might have something that will inspire you.  It could be that something that I would give a hard pass to (like a dancing class) might be something that just clicks for you.

&gt;As for food, I think I'm just going to fast and live off of water from now on. As I said, I only eat 1200-1500 calories a day and I stay the same weight. Intermittent fasting (eating one meal a day and skipping food the next day, so that I eat a meal every two days) is probably the only thing that may potentially work as far as dieting goes.

While intermittent fasting can work, from what I have seen it doesn't more often than not.  You will make yourself hungry enough that you will pig out on the days you let yourself eat and net no result.  There is also the problem that on fast days you will be so lethargic that being active at all will be difficult.  Even if you don't plan to workout that day, you will find yourself burning less Calories in your daily routine as you instinctively avoid anything remotely active.  Instead, what I usually see recommended is to go the opposite direction.  Eat many meals, but keep them all very small to the point that you might just think of them as a snack.  6 meals of 200 Calories spread throughout the day will leave you more satisfied and full of energy than a single 1200 Calories meal.  

And like I said before, just cutting out sugary drink should make a huge difference.  You are taking in a lot of Calories that way even by your estimates and I suspect that you are drinking more than your estimates reflect.  Cutting out soda and juice completely should make a massive difference."	1	False

Mitigation. Do you really think that 1 month in jail is equal to one year in jail? Because that's how laws are written. There is maximum punishment (one year) and minimum punishment (fine) for a crime and then there are mitigating circumstances where court can find correct punishment on that range.

Then judge can use digression to decide where on that spectrum the punishment will fall so it fits the crime. Judge only gives one option because only one option is right for that crime. If the criminal gets to choose they will always pick the lowest punishment."	1	False

I doubt even the law could pin the deaths or suicides of people who lost their savings onto someone who wanted to make a quick buck. I'm not saying that petty theft and massive fraud are on the same scale, but the intent attached with the fraud is purely monetary, sometimes with no concern of the consequences that it could bring to others, but then it becomes a question of whether to hold the criminal responsible under intent or neglect, and I would lean to the latter. Do financial criminals value someone's life less than a murderer does? Is greed a worse quality to have than hate? I ask myself these questions as I write this response, too.

Handguns have been acknowledged as the most common and practical self-defense firearm, which pretty much precludes a ban.  Hunting is not as strong a justification as self-defense, but in many areas people do rely on hunting for supplemental income/subsistence, alternatives like bows or crossbows present issues for older and younger people as well as a more dramatic skill gate, and anything significantly impacts hunting will probably raise aboriginal rights/treaty issues as well.  Shotguns and rifles do have a lot of overlap, but there are plenty of times where one or the other is clearly the preferred tool.  Shotguns are the only reasonable option for many kinds of bird hunting, whereas rifles are generally preferred for most big game hunting (i.e. moose, elk, not deer) as well as pest control.

Even without invoking the second amendment right, this provides a strong set of justifications for preserving pistols (self-defense), shotguns (bird hunting), and rifles (hunting).  However, so-called ""assault weapons"" (let's assume a typical AR-15 build with a standard magazine) don't neatly occupy any of these areas.  They're generally impractical for self-defense carry, and they don't overlap shotguns' unique niche.  They're more suited to home defense than traditional rifles (probably their strongest distinguishing advantage), but still very rarely used compared to handguns, and while they're perfectly *good* for hunting they're not definitively *better* for it than ""traditional"" hunting rifles.  Admittedly, much of this depends heavily on where the line for ""assault weapon"" is drawn - there are good arguments for semi-automatic fire, suppressors and pistol grips based on follow-up shots, hearing protection/awareness and ergonomics respectively, but few hunters would be severely impacted by the loss of detachable standard-capacity magazines.  

As a result, you can ban a pretty broad swath of ""assault weapons"" while *mostly* avoiding the few things the average person won't tolerate the government screwing around with.  The second amendment may be a right rather than a need, but the former have always been easier to abrogate than the latter.

The strongest argument *against* an AWB (setting aside constitutional avenues) is that there's no decent justification *for* one.  Sure, the arguments for their preservation are weaker than those for other types of firearm, but the arguments for their prohibition are weaker still.  For someone whose goal is to eventually ban all (or virtually all) firearms rather than strike some sort of balance, however, banning anything is a win because they want to ban everything.  There's no need to be choosy about your piece of cake if you mean to walk off with the whole thing, you just grab whatever's convenient and leave the rest for later."	27	False

I wish they would keep the leisurely exercise or marathon training to places which simulate it better.  For example, why not stick to the bike paths.  There is one that is designed for cyclists and stretches for several miles.

If cyclists are in-fact more in danger, then we should create laws which protect them better without unreasonably depriving them.  If they are not commuting, then they do not need to be in the highly congested roadway.

The NHS isn't a disaster it is just critically under funded especially after the financial crash and austerity. It has served to make healthcare cheaper (iirc it is currently operating at about 1/3rd of current US spending per capita and is around $2000 less than healthcare systems on the continent) and more accessible as was it's original vision. it has overseen a significant improvement in the health outcomes of Britain improving on a huge number of metrics.

Also notably it has survived unlike less universal programmes which have died like BR (you were asking for a comparison so look at other non universal systems from the same period and see how they're doing now). 

&gt;I’m inclined to cite the NHS as an example of why it’s important to have competition.

How? the UK also does have competition in private healthcare (still pay tax for the NHS though) but the NHS has mostly succeeded in decommodifying healthcare and improving outcomes.

It has enabled a huge number of people to gain access to healthcare that was impossible before allowing for early treatment (the first cut was based on the initial service going over budget as was expected as it was dealing with the backlog of health problems that weren't handled under the previous system and the service would have returned to lower prices soon after) and its huge popularity among all political leanings is a sign of it's effectiveness.

Since we agree that papers and exams are actually not particularly good at determining whether someone has actually grasped the material and not just crammed some memorization or type up some bullcrap, why is it unfair for professors to gauge a small percentage of a students grade on seeing whether they *participated* in the classroom?

Yes, you can make up for some degree of missed classes with increased studying. But that is not easy for a professor to evaluate in general and especially for a classroom of many students. So, the compromise is that instead of your entire grade being contingent on your classroom performance, some small part of it is weighed on participation. This is the prerogative of the professor and their judgment, since they are the most qualified to decide and are vetted by the university and given the authority by the university to make these decisions.

&gt;I do not see how that reflects poorly on me. Students who attend class aren't necessarily grasping the material..

I've never been in a class where a student who performed spectacularly on tests got a worse grade than a student who failed tests but went to every class, so I don't think that this argument has a lot of weight for saying that the policy is really unfair to anyone. It's really not that big of a problem proportional to the utility it provides to a professor and the prerogative of that professor.

&gt;How much of a voice do you think students should have in university regulations? After all, students are paying for tuition.

Not to the extent that they can override core university policy and multiple professors. The university may listen to students, but there is no guaranteed recourse for students who want to override professor policies. Professors go through a far more intensive process of vetting than students do. 

Students pay for and earn the **privilege** to have the **opportunity** to earn a degree from a university. Just because one pays the university does not entitle one to a degree or leverage over the university. 

We pay for a  *chance* to be awarded a degree contingent on our performance in requirements set by universities and professors. The university makes the independent decisions and evaluation to regulate what requirements it has to *award* a degree to its students.

If this seems unfair at the undergraduate level, most graduate programs will seem far more unfair. At the graduate level, students go through far more grueling programs and requirements, including even more extraneous requirements than participation, including grading and TAing far lesser courses to receive their degree. Additionally, an individual professor/advisor has *far* more arbitrary influence on the complete outcome of years of a graduate student's life. Weighing attendance as a small 10% portion of a grade is a negligible concern in comparison."	2	False

&gt;It seems like you're just frustrated that rather than getting caught up fighting an unwinnable battle (convincing a field of individuals that they are wrong from within that field, on their terms), he is instead just communicating directly to the government, the media and individuals. Are you suggesting that the government, media and public shouldn't be able to encounter intellectual arguments that weren't vetted by the field who took claim to that issue (especially when that issue is the validity of the field itself)? That's sounds like an intellectually dangerous world to me.

I kind of regret using Peterson as an example, so let me just use John and refer to the disciplines as X (which he is an expert in), and Y (a discipline in which he self-studied).

John has a PhD in X. Mary has no PhD. Both self-studied about topic Y. Both John and Mary have equally good ideas. But John's PhD in topic X grants him credibility which allows him to go on news programs and talk shows and talk about topic Y. Mary has no PhD so she can barely get her foot in the door to get her equally valid points heard. This is basically the crux of my disapproval. John's PhD in an unrelated field shouldn't let him get more publicity about an unrelated topic, if as you and many others are suggesting, we simply judge the ideas by their own merit. 

&gt;So, the reason why you see him speaking with the public rather than academics is that he's speaking to directly impact voters and law, rather than for the sake of theories. In that context, saying he shouldn't argue that stance publicly, is equivalent to saying that teacher shouldn't be allowed to argue about political stances on abortion or a police officer shouldn't be allowed to argue their stance on climate policy. This would unravel our democracy.

I think this misrepresents my point of view. No one's saying that you shouldn't be able to voice your dissent against policies. In fact at the very beginning this argument wouldn't have applied to him. If I remember correctly he was basically worried about the downstream effects of that bill and policing language and all that, and how that would affect the way he addressed students in the lecture. I'm not against that. 

I'm against his views against post-modernism and the humanities, which has nothing to do with voting. 

It's quotes like this said with such contempt and confidence for a field that he has self-studied in that drove me to do this CMV. Not to mention he also uses the derogatory ""social justice warrior"" term to refer to individuals who study post-modernism, which isn't how academics discourse:

&gt;*In a YouTube video from July, Peterson said he’d been working with a programmer to produce a website that would enable people to upload course descriptions and then determine “the degree to which the description is postmodern.”*

&gt;*“Then you can decide for yourself whether you want to take that and become a social justice warrior, if that is what you think your education should be about, or if you should avoid that like the plague that it truly is.”*

**********

&gt;Calling somebody a ""pop scientist"" is just another ad hominem attack. Why not engage with the arguments themselves instead of trying to find every way to discredit a person from speaking their arguments and setting arbitrary bars they have to meet? What defines a pop scientist? Is a scientist not allowed to be popular? Are they not allowed to advocate their theory? Are they not allowed to engage with the public? Are they not allowed to receive an income for doing their research and communications? Many of these things apply to many scientists and professors.

Pop scientist just means he is a scientist that has taken on celebrity status - didn't think it was too insulting but rather a description of literally what has happened. Peterson has basically become world-wide famous. As for ""why not engage the arguments"" see back to Mary and John example. 

&gt;(Also, to be fair, his job was at risk because of people who didn't agree with his personal beliefs, so the patreon account was in the context of fearing that he might be fired.)

So why not make the account after getting fired. Seems like he has a vested interest to engage in more ""juicy"" confrontations. He himself admitted that his patreon account receives a surge after every protest. He's basically earning as much as UofT pays him just from his patreon. 

&gt;Engaging only at conferences, instead of also in public means that the you fail to convince the public of your field, which in cases like this sort of undermines the whole practical value of the field.

Once again I think you're misrepresenting what I said. I believe I said he should network and form collaborations with experts in the humanities at conferences. He is more than welcome to present his collaborated research on the news. Researchers present their findings to the public all the time. 

&gt;Again this just sounds like gatekeeping. You're upset that a person is so easily conveying their arguments so you want them to have to do it in a context that, virtually by definition, won't accept them.

I'm sure he could have found some post-modernist critics who are also in the field of humanities. I'm sure. There is no shortage of post-modernist literary or social critics in humanities. He would have found acceptance if he put in the hours to network.

&gt;He's making arguments about the laws we are presently passing and the social actions we are presently taking.

Like I said earlier, if it is about policy hurrah to him. If it is about how post-modernism creates SJWs then that's where the criticism comes in. 

&gt;So, while your appeals to ""science"" make it sound like he's disagreeing with something that is so rigorous you can't disagree with it, like gravity, instead he's disagreeing with things that are fundamentally subjective, like how we should approach gender.

But you would also have to agree that just because something is subjective doesn't mean that everyone's opinion (while everyone is entitled to one) is equally valid. There's a reason why literary critics aren't your random Joe off the street. Like a judge in the courtroom, it takes training and experience to be able to form an opinion that means something substantive. 

&gt;In the end, you keep grasping for any ad hominem attacks you can find in order to prevent his thoughts from being spoken unless the field he's disagreeing with approves of them. I think this in an untenable position for a society with intellectual ideals. The crux of intellectual progress is separating arguments from the people who speak them and the mode of delivery.

You pointed out the one time I called him a pop-scientist and the only reason I called him that is because he has taken on a celebrity status. I didn't mean to use it derogatorily. But I wouldn't call it ""keep grasping for any ad hominem attacks"".

&gt;you can find in order to prevent his thoughts from being spoken unless the field he's disagreeing with approves of them

This statement makes no sense. Plenty of members in the humanities that despise post-modernism and have studied it as well.

As a teenager? Not much. You have all these hormones raging which gives you a bunch of energy and desire, but you don't have the experience or resources to do a whole lot. In our modern world to contribute significantly to society requires a lot of education, resources, and no small amount of luck. The time where hormones and bashing stuff with a rock would establish your value in the world is long past, but our bodies don't know that yet.

Your best bet is to find something you are passionate about and devote yourself to that. The common theme behind people who stand out in the world is a passion for what they do.

But also, statistically speaking, most people aren't going to stand out. But that doesn't mean you won't change the world. Look at SpaceX, do you think Elon Musk built those rockets himself? No, he is standing out but the reality is that thousands of workers, engineers, designers, physicists, programmers, etc. all made it happen. Musk is just some eccentric billionaire who bankrolled the concept, and he got rich getting in early with online banking. There was no plan from his teens!

There is a quote from Isaac Newton where he says ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."" What he accomplished was based on the great work of those before him. These days the things we pursue require us all to lift together.

Fair enough. I would put forward the material concerns as primary as well as some cultural ones where poverty is seen as a personal failing so people don't like to talk up about that. There are also broader shifts in the economy and the industrial sector has been shrinking and most people into making youtube videos are relatively young. 

&gt; And again, I'm not saying that the white collar struggle isn't as real as the blue collar one (corporate exploitation of the salary exemption is a huge concern, one the blue collar folks don't have to deal with), just that it's a different experience altogether.

Why? they're both workers and have similar material interests. They both serve the same role as workers who have their surplus labour to benefit capitalists. Solidarity across a constructed divide is a necessary part of building a mass movement.

But I think the it ends there. Not that you can't do more, of course you're invited to do more, and it would be nice of you, but the more work it takes, the lesser the obligation. So like, if you call an ambulance, the cost is low considering you're saving a life, but if when you got there, you were asked to take care of the person till they got a bit better, such as giving them food and stuff, most would nope out, which I think is mostly justified"	1	False

No. ""Flattening Gaza"" is not required to give Israel a decisive victory in this conflict.

It is a purposeful effort to keep them in those conditions where mostly young people live. People who have never been allowed to even step foot out of gaza.

Hamas has millions of people living in peasant like conditions in Gaza. It's the militancy of Hamas that has closed both the Israeli *and* Egyptian borders around Gaza, not some attempt by the Israeli government to keep the people living there in such conditions. 

Just look at West Bank, which is also part of Palestine. The Jordanian border remains open and goods and people flow more freely between Palestine and Israel / Jordan.

Correct, but we aren't talking about ""obliterating the people who live in Gaza"". We're talking about obliterating Hamas, which will cause an unknown number of Palestinian and Israeli civilians to die in the process.

Just no. That isn't what they're designed to do. They are designed to transfer as much of their kinetic energy as possible (in order to create a large temporary cavity you're confusing with hydrostatic shock) into the human body while penetrating deep enough to reach the vital organs and expand enough to do as much cutting damage as possible.

Most 9mm or .45acp rounds will completely penetrate a human body. 

And it's very important to consider that not even close to 100% of the energy from a .50bmg round will be transferred to the human body, while a much larger proportion of the energy of a 9mm, .45acp, or 5.56 (and likely larger number of ft-lbs than the .50bmg, though I have no hard evidence for this) will be transferred by the bullet to the human body, because of the extreme velocity and momentum involved. The .50bmg that is in use by the military and anyone overzealous enough to use such a round for self defense does not use it because it delivers its energy efficiently. It is solely an extreme long-range cartridge for use over 5.56 or .308Win.

&gt; If you were shot by a .50bmg round it really wouldn't matter where you were shot

Again, no. If I'm shot in the chest by a .50bmg, I will not explode. That shit only happens in bad action movies and video games.

There is a very good graphic that was put together by a redditor on the overpenetration of 9mm and other pistol cartridges vs. 5.56x45mm and .223Rem in walls. It included compelling arguments as to why the AR15 is a much better choice for home defense than a 9mm or .45acp pistol. I could have sworn there was one similar that compared terminal ballistics in a human body, but I'll just link what I can find from the cursory search I did. There are many more sources, and probably better ones. But I think this proves the point well enough.

I grew up in a very similar situation as the one you described, my mother was severely abused by my father and despite overwhelming evidence against him, including an assault charge, he was granted full custody and I did not see my mother ever again after I was a child.   


I thought about suicide at several points throughout my life because of the horrible circumstances I had been dealt at birth but it's for that very reason that I am so adamantly against abortions that cite this reason as a ""concern for the child's wellbeing"" because circumstances **can** change but death is a **permanent** choice.   


I was kicked out the minute I turned 18 and I managed to go on to make a very happy life for myself despite everything and I am so happy that my mother didn't abort me despite being a teenage pregnancy because I'm so grateful for the life I was given, the chance I was given to truly experience everything the world has to offer.

I understand not everyone's story will happen like mine did, they might not get their happily ever after but don't they deserve the chance to at least try?

I believe fully implementing the social programs I listed in my original answer would solve many of the mental health problems and domestic abuse issues seen in modern society. What is the primary cause of mental health issues? Trauma. If we eliminate the circumstances surrounding the toxic environments that breed trauma such as by eliminating financial concerns, providing free mental health counseling, etc. then we'd get to the point where situations like yours and mine would be an exceedingly rare minority.

I don't have an answer on how to hold men accountable for their role in pregnancy because frankly I think it's an impossible problem. They don't hold the choice on whether or not to have the abortion and therefore lack any real accountability in the decision either way. However, I do believe there should be criminal / civil charges for men who force women to have abortions they don't want, which is a significant problem among wealthy married men having affairs."	1	False

So why would we use a term that leads to erroneous assumptions? I'll never need to know any of these things based on gender, so I can gather them as I need them. Gender is not a useful way to obtain this info.

&gt;Whether I like it or not, I've been raised as a male, I've been treated as this thing called ""male"" by every figure in my life from my parents to my schoolfriends, and I've grown up consuming media which reinforces to me what being a male is.

I'm arguing for a world where we don't use gender. So this wouldn't have been the case.

&gt;They have meaning and usage because - sadly - our society operates by them and through them. We can't ignore them. Only when our media ignores them, our education system ignores them, and everyone in society ignores them should sociologists ignore them. They still shape the way we behave and think

I have conceded (I think elsewhere) that this argument of mine does require a bit of what if, because it relies on a premise that this just happens and doesn't deal with the problems of actually implementing it. So ∆ for you for highlighting this in such detail.

&gt;Biology alone just doesn't tell us much. The statistical fact that in the UK if you're male you're more likely to commit suicide than if you're female is useful data. We need that data. The statistical fact that if you're male you're more likely to have a penis isn't quite so useful. Our constructions of gender and race may have been born out of our understanding of biology, but if we want to understand human trends we need to look at the social side of classification

This is also related to the above delta, as I have conceded too that there are also points when gender isn't entirely useless, but I do believe it doesn't need to be used here. Where is the difference in saying male sex or male gender sees more suicide?"	2	False

It's a catch 22, if you have a robust police and judiciary that can effectively catch, sentence, and keep people imprisoned, you don't need the death penalty to prevent them hurting more people. If you have a weak police and judiciary that can be bought or intimidated by serious criminals, you should not give the government more power to kill by judicial decree, since the corruption will mean it is ineffective against the most serious outlaws anyway and it may be used to further outlaw goals.

Also, currently the death penalty is only used against people who are found guilty of the most serious offenses and therefore pose the most serious threat to society. The US Federal laws for capital punishment require you to be found guilty of [espionage, treason, or murder] (http://deathpenalty.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004927) to give out the death penalty.

Imagine you run a restaurant, part of your job is to get completed orders out as fast as you can without interfering with quality. As a restaurant owner, call-ins are a blessing to you because they keep your workers busy, they take stress away from seating inside, and they keep your lines more manageable. Someone calls in, their food is being prepared, a line begins to form at your register. The call-in order is now ready. When that customer arrives, they automatically go to the front and pay. You have now just make your line less croweded and provided an incentive of customer service for that person to place future call ahead orders, which in turn makes your daily operation go alot more smoothly. Why would you as an owner make a customer with cash in hand and their food ready, wait behind everyone who is just now making their orders or getting seated? its counter productive to your business. And if you do make them wait, they have less of reason to call ahead which just makes your rushs more complex to manage. Plus when you give them their food as soon as they arrive, it isnt sitting out, so its closer to the original quality you as an owner should demand and your customers deserve.	4	False

If you have 1,000 in rent and you make 10 units, you are paying 100 dollars in fixed costs per unit. By increasing production you will lower your fixed cost per unit. For instance, 1,000 rent but you make 100 units. You now pay 10 dollars per unit. You have effectively lowered your fixed cost per unit by 90 dollars.

This is true of average fixed cost in general, though. Average fixed cost is fixed cost divided by quantity of output produced, the slope of AFC falls continuously downward. And as you hire more workers to produce more output, your variable costs increase - your total costs increase.

Quantity of output produced by a firm is determined more so by marginal cost, which is a change in total cost divided by a change in quantity. 

Just because average fixed cost is decreasing, this doesn’t mean that profit is increasing. Minimum wage increasing would increase the variable costs, and increase the total cost.

If we only use fixed cost to determine the quantity of output produced, then profit maximization would be achieved through producing as many units as possible.

Like I said before, profit maximization isn’t important in the grand scheme, but to claim that a minimum wage increase would result in profit maximization because producing more units results in lower average fixed costs is incorrect. 

&gt; In regards to increase in demand, normally an increase in pay does not increase demand. But we are talking about a special group that gets the increase. We are taking about the part of society that cannot cover basic necessities with the wage they possess. In this particular instance, demand will increase in every market due to new demand.

An increase in disposable income, or an increase in new customers because more people could afford goods, would shift the demand curve to the right. However, the supply curve would be shifted to the left because firms would be willing and able to produce less with the changing costs of production.

However, an increase in disposable income that wasn’t the result of an increase in minimum wage would shift the demand curve right without shifting the supply curve left. An increase in disposable income that doesn’t effect marginal cost, nor quantity of output a firm produces, would be things like welfare, or universal basic income.

Increasing minimum wage is not profit maximizing. But it doesn’t need to be. The justification for increasing minimum wage reaches beyond microeconomics, so it’s odd to try to use microeconomics to justify increasing minimum wage."	3	False

&gt;The submissions to /r/nosleep[2] are similarly not true, but they're fun. Why shouldn't that kind of thing be rewarded?

You seem to be talking a lot without addressing any of my points I'm making, because I very clearly talked about rewards in my previous post. The reward changes in each subreddit, but in many text-based subreddits (This one included) the reward is simply sharing content you're passionate about with other like-minded people and/or having great discussion. If you start adding ulterior motives then people will be less interested in making their content quality and more interested in making their content appealing to get a quick point reward.

If I'm talking with a friend about a videogame I really enjoy I don't need him to hand me $10 bucks if he thought what I said had value for me to feel rewarded. The reward itself is in having the discussion with someone who shares a passion with you.

&gt;Text based subs aren't just /r/ChangeMyView[3] and /r/TIFU[4] . Why shouldn't the clever people at /r/shittyaskscience[5] get recognition?

When did I ever claim this? Do you want me to use every subreddit across the entirety of Reddit in my argument? They were examples that I knew would be fairly relatable and gave a good contrast to demonstrate my point.

&gt;I just don't see the problem with providing recognition for them.

I think the problem is you assume that good posts will be made and then get recognition, when the system you propose would much more heavily lean towards people making posts with the sole intent to get this ""recognition"". For less serious subs this wouldn't be *too* much of an issue, but for more serious subs it could very well be a death sentence.

&gt;Forbidding them via rules, or relying on the community to downvote them.

For the former, that takes mod enforcement. Rules don't magically enforce themselves, and I very specifically covered the strain it would have on moderators - who are quite human most of the time. While auto-moderator exists, and I'm sure it's a useful tool, it's not a replacement for moderators and it still requires supervision from a human.

For the latter, you yourself said that defaults lack quality. This is mainly because there is no bar to enter any community. So a bunch of people passionate about the idea of the subreddit who support it in the early iterations soon become a minority when it becomes popular. The casual browsers then upvote/downvote impulsively with little thought or care (And often don't leave comments or contribute) and therefore dictate how well content does in these communities. Meanwhile those who were passionate for the original idea and focus of the community are no longer relevant.

&gt;Considering this system works in every other sub that is not text-exclusive, why shouldn't it work for text-exclusive subs?

Well, you're making the assumption it actually works. You yourself talked about ""defaults"" as if they were a bad thing. I wouldn't consider /r/funny to be working, would you?"	5	False

How long should the Socratic method be used for it to be considered a pillar? I would argue it has survived even more than some of Newtons theories.

I understand your point, and I acknowledge the substantial impact of the Socratic method. It undeniably plays a foundational role in the development of Western philosophy and education. But, it's essential to distinguish between methods of thought or argumentation and insights into the fundamental workings of the universe. Both are significant, but they influence different aspects of human experience.

> Also, I would argue something being subject to change does not negate its influence. Plato’s and Aristoteles influences are both full of depth and wide spread in our modern world the same way as the three you mentioned. And they act as cornerstones in many of our rhetoric, governance, educational systems, and more.

That's a fair point. Influence can manifest in many ways, and the significance of an idea isn't diminished simply because it's subject to change or reinterpretation. Societal and philosophical concepts can profoundly shape our understanding of the world and ourselves, which is no less important than understanding the physical workings of the universe.

> With your original post removed, I only have the title to go off, but in the instance of examine/quantifying influence, the medium and the message are both important.

I agree that in certain contexts, the medium can be as influential as the message. The ability to disseminate information widely and effectively can have profound impacts, as exemplified by Gutenberg's invention.

> As an example, if you have 1000 different boxed lunches being delivered to a group of hungry people and all of the lunches are on a single truck. It makes sense to say that the truck isn't going to address the hunger of the people in itself. It is merely the medium by which the actual food is getting there. But it’s value is still high. Without the truck in this instance, the people don't get their food and the influence of the food is never felt.

But, while the dissemination of ideas undoubtedly increases their impact, I argue that the intrinsic value of the ideas themselves is what truly drives their influence. In the case of the boxed lunches and the truck, without the meals (the ideas), the truck (the dissemination medium) would serve no purpose. But if the truck were absent, the meals could still be consumed and fulfill their function. In this case, the meals can be compared to ideas that can influence even when not widely disseminated, and the truck can be seen as the medium that amplifies this influence. The value of the truck (Gutenberg's printing press) is dependent on the value of the cargo it carries (ideas of thinkers like Newton, Einstein, and Darwin).

That being said, the value and impact of a medium or an idea aren't always easy to compare directly, as they often serve different roles and functions in society. Both are essential pieces of the puzzle of human progress and influence."	1	False

Now I’m going to address everything you brought up, plus a few other topics in the thread, and I’m going to explain why all of your points show either that WC is great, or Hitler is less great. 

First, let me mention two qualities in a great leader: integrity and resilience. Integrity is that you stick to your guns. You know what you stand for and you don’t flip flop. Obviously, that’s something you want in a leader. If they just followed public opinion, you might as well have direct democracy or poling agencies in charge. Both WC and Hitler have this. Secondly, you want resilience. A great leader doesn’t despair when things aren’t going their way. I’d say this is where WC pulls ahead. Hitler loses major points for his suicide instead of standing trial. A resilient leader would suck it up when they start losing. Hitler should have gone to Nuremberg, taken the stand, and given the world the finger. Tell them exactly what he believes about the world. He would have had the best lawyers in Germany helping him, and even if he’s not going to be innocent, it’s the ultimate platform to engrave his vision. Instead he chickened out. If WC had been captured by Hitler and put on trial for crimes against the white race, I promise he would have whipped out his English sausage and told Hitler to polish his knob. 

Now on to your topics:

&gt;WC is clearly a big shot, but if you get voted out of office how awesome can you really be?

See the point about resilience. He didn’t kill himself when he got voted out. He got right back on the horse and got voted in again 6 years later. He served for 10 years as prime minster (not that much shorter than Hitlers’s 11 as Fuhrer), plus even more time as Father of the House of Commons, and various other positions such as first lord of the admiralty. So he had lot more time in office than Hitler did. I can’t see how having a longer track record makes you less great. 

&gt;He was the leader of a dying empire with its glory days long past, Germany at the time had never succeeded so much.

Cleary it was a dying empire that kicked Germany’s ass. And Germany had never succeeded so much, until they started losing. You know. They succeeded until they lost. And I can’t thin of any metric by which Germany was better off after Hitler compared to before, that England wasn’t superior on after WC. 

And if your argument is, ‘leaders of young upstart nations are great leaders’ you still don’t get to Hitler as the greatest since Napoleon. Jefferson was a contemporary of Napoleon the 3rd when he made the Louisiana Purchase, and that was a pretty big win. That more than doubled the size of the US, and cost pennies. Clearly Jefferson was a greater leader. 

How about President Polk and winning the Mexican American war? That’s a big chunk of land too. And America got ot keep it. 

Or President McKinley? He made the American Empire by kicking down the dying Spanish Empire. Blammo got some Cuba, some Philippines, and other sundry properties. But again, he’s a winner and got to keep everything. Unlike Hitler. 

We’ve also got Ho Chi Minh and Ton Duc Thang who unified Vietnam (and again, won unlike Hitler). Vietnam had never been so great, and America  dying empire with glory days long past (but again these two won, Hitler didn’t). 

&gt;And the only reason he won WW2 was because Britain only contributed to 1/3 of the effort, the rest was the Soviets and the US. 

What a good point. That actually helps me. Because it shows how WC is great and Hitler isn’t. Let’s think about this one. Why did the Soviets fight the Germans? Because Hitler attacked them.  You mentioned what a good negotiator Hitler was (yet he didn’t set up the Moltov-Ribbentrop Pact). Instead he broke a good thing that he had going and brought the USSR into the war. To his detriment. Really shot himself in the foot there. And according to you [It’s because it would have hurt his feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/f2j2k1/cmv_adolf_hitler_is_the_greatest_politician_since/fhd5mg3/)

Great leaders suck it up and deal with hurt feelings. I’m sure Churchill felt hurt about somethings he did. But he did them anyway. Hitler’s not some teenage girl. 

Now why did the US come into things? Two reasons. One was German U-boats sinking US shipping of course (Hitler’s decision), and the other was Churchill traveling over to the US and telling FDR that Hitler came first. Think about that. Why di the US, who was attacked by Japan, decide to make Japan target #2? Because Churchill convinced FDR that’s why. That’s some great negotiating. Think about it. IT’s like if, after 9-11 GWB had convinced congress that Al Qaeda (the group that actually attacked us) was target #2, and that target number 1 should be North Korea (a totally different country). That’s great negotiating. Look at the Allies Hitler made. Italy. Period. Japan was nominally on the same side but they provided no aid, no help, they might as well been on a different planet. 
&gt;Yeah there were German protesters against Hitler, but not a revolt or a coup. It is super hard to not get college students to complain about you.

There couldn’t be a revolt or a coup because Hitler killed them off. That’s not a great leader. That’s a coward who acts like a teenage girl. Getting his friends to beat them up because they said mean things about him. You totally neglected Hitler’s thin skin and disproportionate response. Totally ungreat. 

&gt;What did you mean a bout plagiarism of Henry Ford? Ford did not invent anti-semitism.

So, you’ve mentioned that we can count all the underlings of extension of the great leader. That’s fine, Then we have to realize that Ford published [The International Jew]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Jew#Influence_on_Nazi_anti-Semitism) and ran a weekly newspaper about how evil Jews were. Hitler even calls out Ford in Mein Kampf. He’s really just channeling ford. He reprinted Ford’s newspaper for propaganda. Do you think he was paying royalties? 

Also, can we point out the lack of negating there? If Hitler had hooked up with Ford, gotten him to run Volkswagon, can you imagine how much more efficient they would have been? That would have impacted the Americans and helped the Germans. Ford would have stuck with just one Panzer (probably the 4) and Germany wouldn’t have gotten into a tank death spiral. 

&gt;The way I see it German success in WW2 hinges on two events…and a diplomatic white peace with the UK in 1940…Can you agree it’s possible either of those two events could have happened?

Not possible, because WC. WC was the reason for that lack of peace. If the UK had some limp wristed less-great leader, they might have caved. Or maybe WC would have committed suicide during the bombing because QQ he was so sad. But instead he sacked up and the UK followed him to victory. If Hitler had any idea of how the UK felt, he would have realized peace was not going to be possible.

Heck, if he studied history, he would have realized the UK would have gotten into the war when he invaded Belgium. You know, like WW1. It had happened before! Germany invades Belgium (who is the UK’s bottom) and the UK gets bloodlusted and fucks Germany sideways with a cigar. It’s not like Hitler had any reason to think the same thing wouldn’t happen again. 

&gt;To give up Czechoslovakia and then fight like hell for... pride in an empire that’ll be gone in 20 years Is super inconsistent and arbitrary.

See above. Not a great move on Hitler’s part, and yet it was great move for WC to get the Empire to go balls deep into the continent. WC got kiwis from New Zealand to fight. That’s the other side of the world. That’s a great leader. 

Lastly, a great leader has empathy. And I don’t mean the kind of weak, ‘I feel your pain’ kind of empathy. I mean the ability to think like their opponents. Churchill had it. He could think like FDR, like Stalin, like Hitler. Hitler couldn’t think like Churchill. And you said it several times yourself, Hitler couldn’t realize he was going to get a bloodlusted UK.

No, but it will make *a single decision.* Right now, developers are forced to deal with every decision that every browser vendor makes.

Hrm. Recommendations. You need to be exposed to some good detective stories if you're to know what Batman's about.

**Blade Runner:** The movie. I don't know if the book is good. Blade Runner definetively isn't about detectives, but the main character is a very good detective kind of character. Also he's a normal person fighting about super-powered individuals.

**Watchmen:** Rorschach is the protagonist of sorts. I doubt very much you won't like him, and he's like a cynic version of Batman. If you like Rorschach, there's a part of you who likes Batman.

**Batman: Year One:** Ok, sorry, I'm out of detective fiction. Seems I'm not specialist in it. But if you're going to judge Bats you need to know the books where he was best portrayed, not George Clooney junk.  If you want a very good story about Batman as a person without superpowers, a person that can bleed and can't do too much unrealistic maneuvers, about an urban adventurer, you read this book and tell me what you think of Batman.

**The Dark Night Returns:** You thought it is unrealistic a man without superpowers can fight crime? What about an old man without superpowers? Yes, Batman's premise is unrealistic, and it's even worse in this book because now Batman is back to action after years of retirement. And yet, it doesn't feel unrealistic. It feels gritty, and hard, and painful, but this guy's willpower feels so real you start believing it is really physically possible he does all that he's doing. This isn't the ""detective Batman"" nor the ""adventurer Batman"": that's the crime-fighter, the super hero Batman here.

Really, do check out those. I promise you won't regret. Even if you don't start liking Batman you'll know a bit more of comics, which are a wonderful media.

About realism and super heroes: this is a really fascinating subject and I've already erased 2 unnecessary walls of text about it. I consider Batman the most unrealistic of heroes. But in nutshell, superheroes do not exist in the same dimension of modern (I mean, post-Renaissence) literature. They belong with the kind of stories were meaning, happenings and pace are too powerful to be stopped by logic: myth. Whenever you think Batman doesn't make sense, remember that Greek and Norse mythology and fairytales don't always explains crazy stuff with magic: sometimes they just doesn't explain anything! It's a different literature genre from what we're used to. Western civilization forgot about myth for about 400 years and comic book heroes are myths coming back to Western culture."	4	False

Ah, but that's sort of a trick of the industry. A lot of the technical skill in music today is in the *production*. Sure, the composition may be simplistic, but it's about how the finished product, tone alterations, gain matching, track syncing and all sounds. 


Besides, classical composition is overrated. It's formulas that, once memorized, can be used to write tons of simultaneous lines. Most people were just copying somebody before them. Our entire set of Western music theory could literally be called ""Mozart's Tips &amp; Tricks Vol. 8"" and be pretty accurate. Now *that* dude was insanely good.


Okay okay, I get what you're saying. But this comes down to the idea of ""taste"", which is a poor man's stand-in for ""the lack of objective truth"". Basically, you're going to have to narrow judgments down to ""is it most efficient for what it does"" or ""is it producing maximum happiness"". To both of these, modern pop music is obviously just a stage in the life of pop media, but it epitomizes accessibility and maximization of aural quality, which are both pretty ""good"" standards for a mass audio product.

If there is a singular being which creates literally everything else in existence, then that being is, by definition, the only standard to which the rest of existence can be held, because nothing else exists.

Though you only used the term ""perfect"" in your question, you seem to be meaning moral perfection specifically. In which case: on what grounds do you base your idea of morality? There are only a few options. 

One: there is an ultimate moral standard which is above God, against which someone could judge God's actions. This seems to be the view you're taking. But in the Abrahamic traditions, nothing exists other than God and what God creates, for lots of philosophical reasons that tie into why they believe God exists at all. 

Two: the ultimate moral standard is defined by God's actions - ie, whatever God does is morally good by definition. This is basically the view of the Abrahamic faiths. That is: our conception of ""perfection"" is based in the nature of God. We think compassion and love and justice are good because God is compassionate and loving and just. 

Three: there is no ultimate moral standard at all - in which case the whole conversation becomes nonsensical because neither perfection nor mistakes exist.

Your question implies that a standard of perfection exists - however you'd define it. The important question to ask is where that standard comes from. If God is the standard, he is perfect; if God is not the standard, you're no longer talking about the Abrahamic God. You cannot separate the *existence* of god or gods in any religion from the *nature* of the god or gods they believe in. Every religion is built on a particular understanding of what the universe is and how it functions - and that determines how they conceive of the Divine (including whether or not a personal God even exists - ie Hinduism or Buddhism, in which everything is part of the Divine). For the Abrahamic God to be the ultimate creator of literally all of existence necessarily means there is no standard of perfection beyond him with which he can be judged; he IS the only standard.

But i don't think you understand the specific push behind the slogan ""no person is illegal."" As far as i understand, the push behind that is in terms of a mental understanding and a naming. Many people are chafed by the phrase ""illegals"" not becauee they disagree that the person lacks legal status, but because it takes one tiny aspect of a person and community, an aspect they likely aren't particularly proud of or pleased with themselves, and literally turns that into a name to define them. 

It would be just as easy to refer to people who regularly and without remorse break the speed limit (basically all of us) and collectively calling those people ""illegals"" or anyone who smokes pot (many) and calling them illegals.

We don't in those cases those cases though. We think of them as people who do actions, not as a stereotype of that one action.

In other words ""no person is illegal"" is basically saying that the action may put that person in violationnof the law and there may be consequences, but to poit at a family and basically say ""hey illegals, how you doing today"" is dehumanizing.

Now, there is likely a fairly large overlap between people that support that campaign and who also think deportation is actually unjust, but they are two separate ideas, and one can acccept the empathy of the one while not accepting the position of the other.

That unpaid labour built the wealth of the United States when it was a young country and allowed it to thrive.

If you become very restricted in terms of sexual relationships, but, for example, had sexually abundant teens, then the gross body count fails to differentiate this situation from somebody that has a middle life experimentation period after a single sex partner.

I guess that there’s still a small chance that something could slip past undetected. I can’t deny that, but you also must remember that it’s a very, very small chance. Every time you get in a car you’re probably risking the chance of ruining your life a lot more than the chances of having a baby with an undetectable disorder. That’s not to say that I don’t understand wanting to avoid the risk, but let’s keep things in perspective. No one, not even the richest most powerful man who ever lived, can guarantee that their life will never be ruined with 100% certainty. Risk simply exists in the world and we have to deal with it an assess it. 

So if you regularly get in cars and ride around (as I suspect you do), then it seems that you’re willing to take even larger risks. Of course, the reward is also relevant so you’ll need to consider that. But still, if you find yourself regularly engaging in tasks riskier than ones you go to great lengths to avoid, then maybe you should take some time to really think through why you avoid them and whether it’s an appropriate response or not based on what you want out of life.

Hell, we share 70% of DNA with sea worms! And I wouldn't exactly say that we're 70% similar.

Sure.  But presumably what you care about are things like intelligence and longevity?  Or something else?  For basically anything observable, your specific family history is *much* more relevant than race.  Like let's say you're concerned about diabetes type II.  Sure, it's highly genetic.  Sure, some races are much more prone to it - African-Americans get it far more often than white people.  But if you are African-American with no parents/grandparents/aunts/uncles with diabetes type II you are at low risk, and if you are white with two uncles with diabetes type II you are at high risk.  Race is a good proxy if you lack family history.  If you know your family history, then race is irrelevant.  Likewise, let's say you are wondering about whether your kids will have high IQ.  There is no genetic test available (and certainly no ancestry-based guess) that comes close to simply writing down your IQ and possibly averaging it with some immediate family members.  Your/your immediate family's IQ tells your intelligence genes.  Not perfectly, but way better than any genetic test out there.

&gt;but I think a foreign ancestry would show in the phenotype, wouldn't it?

Depends how much, and on random chance.  But for instance, most Native Americans look white.  And any white person who says ""my ancestors came over on the Mayflower"" - no matter how pale and blond - has at minimum Pocahontas as an ancestor, and generally many other Native American ancestors their family didn't bother to remember.  Probably some black ancestors too.  Genghis Khan is likely the ancestor of every human you will ever meet.  And in general, there's been a lot more racial mixing throughout history than is ever recorded, because people have long been travelling and intermingling."	1	False

Because of it's content a lot of rap is unable to be played on the radio; thus a lot of rap played on today's radio is written for the radio, which diminishes a lot of the artistic value.

I believe the best way to break into rap is by starting at when it became popular. Arguably the two greatest rappers to ever live was The Notorious B.I.G. (AKA: Biggie Smalls, Biggie, B.I.G., Big Poppa) and Tupac (AKA: 2Pac, Pac, Makaveli) I recommend listening to at least their greatest hits albums.

The reason why I like rap is because similar to poetry. The person preforming the work puts a lot of their heart into it, and it gives you a very vivid experience to relate to in some way. There will always be songs where rappers [brag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZom_gVfuw) about their current amazing life. But with those songs come much more [introspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GygEAcFFMVs) content as well. Tupac has plenty of songs about being a [gangster,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SReL0Z5kkkY) [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfXwmDGJAB8)[ has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1ZvUDvLDY)[ just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRWUs0KtB-I)[ as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-ELnDPmI8w)[ many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkJA6SYwa94) songs on the current issues of his life and time.

Now that you have a super brief background on a small section of the genre it might be easier why someone would respect rappers such as [Kanye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZXlnJ5o63g), and [Kendrick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjlFqgRbICY) as an artist."	19	False

It has nothing to do with market economies. Markets and socialism can coexist. It can be accurately stated that, if, through long fighting, unions force the gradual and eventually completely secession of ownership of the means of production from the control of a few shareholders, to a point where all shares in every company are commonly shared by society, that would be socialism. They would use financial instruments that were invented under capitalism as the vehicle of ownership, and so long as there are further plans in place by government to ensure that unequal ownership never again begins to occur, and that ownership is constantly redistributed from the people who already own a share of the pie, to the new people who own nothing yet, because they are young, and to make sure that the share of ownership of those who die are equally redistributed to society, then that society would both be socialistic in effect and in practice, constantly preserving its state of social ownership. This would not necessarily demand equal compensation for all. Because some people do, in fact, have more useful skills, those people would be able to leverage their skills for higher salaries. The point, however, is that they would have to bargain not with a board of directors made up of a few rich shareholders, but with the employees of the company at large, and with the other broad ownership held by the rest of society, or the proxies who are representing them. Because they are arguing with such a broader coalition of people, they would likely earn a far lower salary than the extreme that CEOs now earn, and have incentives that are far less centered around maximizing the profits of the company in the short term, and more centered around long term utility for their employees and larger society. Maybe we will nationalize all companies in the long term, or maybe we will retain the company model, but with broader social ownership of those companies. But all that matters at the end of the day is: does the average person have a share in the decisions made as to how the means of production will behave? If yes, then we are living under socialism, if not, we are living under capitalism.	2	False

IP allows the creator of [whatever] to retain exclusive rights to that whatever for a certain amount of time, a state-sanctioned monopoly if you will. This allows the creator to profit from their work and it means others can't profit from that work unless the creator says so. 

I think we can all agree that this is good for the creator, that's what the laws are made for, but this isn't necessarily best for society. He may have had the initial incentive to create app, but he doesn't have the incentive to improve on the app afterwards. He can then coast and profit from the same app for however long he has protection to do so.

This is where it can be bad for consumers or society. If we didn't have IP, he would have to continuously improve his product to stay ahead of the competition. Or else, someone will come along and improve upon his product, and promptly put him out of business. In either scenario, we as consumers get a better product, because everyone involved has the incentive to continuously improve or fall behind.

And since anyone can build off the ideas of anyone else, they can build off of it in any direction they choose. If the developer created a Rock and retains exclusive rights to the development of Rock and similar products, he will be the only provider of Rock. Without IP, anyone will be able to take Rock and build improve upon it in anyway they choose. 

The creator may decide ""I want to make Rock heavier!"" If you're a consumer that wants rock heavier, that's great! If you don't, well, you're shit out of luck because nobody else can make Rocks. But without IP, another company may immediately begin competing with Creator to make the best heavy Rock. Or another company may come along and make Rock lighter. Or another company may come along and make Rock sparkly. Or another company comes along and makes the cheapest Rock possible, undercutting the rest. Maybe a larger company comes along and makes feature-rich Rocks with rocket propulsion that the creator isn't capable of. Anyone can come along and make Rock into what they think it should be. These companies doing this may put the creator out of business, but we as consumers have more choices than we possibly can.

Whether you prefer IP or no IP depends on which you put more stock in, the creator deserving an reliable income from their creation or the progress society gains from constant competitive forces. "	1	False

Why does the universe require a creator? While we do appear to be the only complex life forms within our galaxy, one single galaxy is a pretty small sample size.

It all comes down to basic compounds found abundantly through the universe, and those compounds ability to form basic self replicating RNA sequences.

They represent groups of States. For instance, you can see on [this map](http://www.fedbar.org/Image-Library/Public/Map-of-US-District-Courts-2000px.png) how the circuit courts are distributed. I was actually wrong, it isn't 2 circuit courts. Rather, four Circuit Courts have all found assault weapon bans to be constitutional. Namely, the Second, Seventh, District of Columbia, and most recently Fourth. The 4th Circuit decision can be found here: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/14-1945/14-1945-2017-02-21.html

Edit: Turns out I was actually wrong, it's 5 Circuit Courts. Apparently, the 9th Circuit also accepted the constitutionality of a ban on ceratin firearms.

The funny thing about this whole scenario is that because there is consensus among a bunch of Circuit Court's, the law of the land is essentially that assault weapons are not constitutionally protected. The Supreme Court won't hear any appeals from these cases because there's no disagreement between the Circuits. They would hear an appeal if a different circuit found that assault weapons were constitutionally protected. However, for that to happen a State in a deep red circuit would have to ban assault weapons, which they will never do. So, in a strange irony, the fact that deep red states won't ban assault weapons guarantees that assault weapon's bans will never be challenged in the Supreme Court."	2	False

It *is* a phobia after all, which is by definition irrational.

Childhood fears also often stay with us, so no matter what the reason is, if children are inclined to find clowns scary, that ought to be a significant and valid reason for society’s interest in them. (The fear tends to turn into hate.) Horror lets us explore and rediscover our fears, and children are especially drawn to them. [This list](https://m.imdb.com/list/ls074643412/?page=1) on IMBb has more than just a few movies about killer clowns, with at least one from as early as the 1960s. I’ll give it to you that it seems to be a new trend, though it probably started around the 70s, and not 6 years ago. Either way, there must be a reason why there is so much material about them. (There also must be books and stories. IT is 30 years old even though the movie is recent.) 

I don’t know what the reason is, but I never liked clowns. I *hated* the McDonalds mascot. I remember a kid who cried at a birthday party because there was a clown. Their manic joy made me feel uneasy, and whenever my mom took me to the circus, I dreaded the clown’s act. I felt relieved when he chose someone else from the crowd for his trick, as I couldn’t handle it. Was it maybe social anxiety and their pushiness, that they oozed crazy and thus were unpredictable, their ridiculous makeup and colors and hair? They just don’t scream “mentally stable,” especially to children who don’t always realize that it is a costume. (On a somewhat related note, most clowns I saw were male, and I didn’t mind the female ones.) 

Anyway, you got me to do a small (*small*) amount of research. I think [this article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/why-are-we-so-scared-of-clowns/) is pretty good. Some main points:

1. Jesters were originally for adult entertainment and “were often linked to death and dark truths.” “Clowns have always been associated with danger and fear, because they push logic up to its breaking point.” 

2. Something you mentioned in relation to children’s fear: “The uncanny explains a lot of horror tropes, where you look at something and it’s not quite right—like a human face that’s decomposing. It’s recognisable, but just enough away from normal to scare you.”

Fun(!) fact: “In fact, clowns in the Middle Ages, if they didn’t make the king laugh, they paid a pretty steep price. A lot of the jesters were mutilated to make them smile all the time. They would have the muscles cut that enabled the mouth to frown.”

3. “Jean-Gaspard Deburau, who dressed as a clown called Pierrot, killed a boy in 1836 by hitting him with his walking stick.” 

4. “We’ve come to question the sexual motivation of somebody dressing as a clown, of grown men who choose to dress in a full clown costume.” 

I also think [satyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr) are kind of related. They were “comically hideous,” often drawn with an erect and exaggerated penis, known to attempt to rape women, as lovers of music and dance, and tricksters. “In classical Athens, satyrs made up the chorus in a genre of play known as a ‘satyr play,’ which was a parody of tragedy and was known for its bawdy and obscene humor.” “Though superficially ridiculous, satyrs were also thought to possess useful knowledge, if they could be coaxed into revealing it.” “Starting in late antiquity, Christian writers began to portray satyrs and fauns as dark, evil, and demonic.”"	3	False

He doesn’t need to call his show is “news.”

Funny you bring up Tucker because honestly he stands out to me as today's biggest example of this problem. And I don't want to ban Tucker from the air, as much as I disagree with him and think he's a vile human being. Freedom of speech and whatnot. 

But I do think that if you were watching the Tucker Carlson Opinion Show with a FOX Opinion logo down in the corner, you'd heap way more grains of salt on it and be more skeptical of what you hear. 

>Also, even if a news channel does a good job at only giving facts and not commentary, they can still be biased in the selection of which facts they share and which they don’t.

100% Agree. There can always be a selection bias at play.

So I really like this and must say I had not really given the profit motive much consideration in my formulations of this view.

Amy wants to marry Fred, but no one else wants to; Amy needs to get a divorce (from the entire marriage group) if she wants to marry Fred.

Charlie and David chose each other as their primary partners. When either of them die, the other receives any applicable death benefits. Only one ""package"" of benefits will be given out, and to one person.

Beth chose Eliza as her primary. Eliza is the only person who can make medical decisions for Beth. However, everyone in the marriage can visit Eliza in the hospital.

Eliza chose Amy for her primary. Amy chose David. David could potentially get two packages in the event of a tragedy where both Amy and Charlie die, but no entity is on the hook for doling out double the support.

&gt;And how would this work for divorce, alimony, child support or child custody?

Can you say specifically what the problem is? How would assets be split? If they don't have a prenup and can't come to an amicable decision, they'd get a lawyer.

Maybe Amy decides to leave the marriage. Amy wasn't working because between their income they all decided it would be better to have her at home. Like a two-person divorce with a stay-at-home mother, the court will probably rule that Amy is entitled to some compensation in the divorce. It would probably be a smaller fraction than if Amy was leaving only one partner because there are four incomes to pull from.

I can tell you with certainty that what you're talking about would be very expensive.

I say this as someone who absolutely believes in Housing First - it's critical for people to have stable, long-term housing before they can really address the factors that caused them to be homeless in the first place. But where I work, in Louisville, there's an estimated shortage of 30,000 affordable units for people who make 30% of the average median income (https://louisvilleky.gov/government/housing/housing-needs-assessment). It would take a lot of dollars and a lot of time just to build that many units. And once we did, guess what happens to the cities that decide to do this - people flock there, because housing is free. The problem grows and grows.

I will also tell you that there are some people who just cannot be helped - people who will destroy the housing they reside in, circumvent the rules, or otherwise create large, expensive problems for any landlord they have. Until they choose to use the mental health assistance offered to them, there's nothing anyone can do to change their behavior. Those people are the ones who don't succeed even with a housing program covering 100% of their rent. There is no affordable housing solution for them; even if you put them in a group shelter setting, they cause problems with other residents. I don't say this as a moral judgment on them - they're doing the best they can with the tools they know how to use - but it is part of this work that you have to accept that not everyone can be helped.

All you could do for them is continue to throw individual, government-owned housing units at them, and all they will do is continuously prove to everyone else on that program that there's no reason to abide by the rules, because there are no real consequences for breaking them. It's not sustainable.

Now I would say that incentivizing landowners to rent out affordable units, combined with expanding funding to Section 8 and other housing programs, could do something incredible at reducing the problem. But it's not as simple as just giving people housing - they need extra support to be able to succeed, and the programs need to be able to terminate people if necessary."	2	False

Netflix achieved critical mass and used it to kill the video rental industry. Digital camera companies like Canon and Nikon achieved critical mass and used it to kill Kodak. This is especially the case with Amazon because not only are they killing old industries, they are completely reinventing the global economy. 

When the printing press was invented, it completely changed the world. When the factory was invented, it did the same. Amazon is one of a handful of companies that is dramatically changing the nature of the economy. Humans who are alive today are fortunate and unfortunate enough to live at a time of dramatic change. I don't think that people who made their money by owning land should have been able to dictate how the world ran once factories took over. I don't think that oil companies and factory owners should be able to dictate how the world runs now that we've moved to a service economy. And I don't think that people in the service economy should be able to dictate how the world works now that we've moved into a technological economy.

Things are changing so fast that it takes significant education and foresight to be on top of it. I think I'm bright, but I don't think I'm able to really anticipate and contribute to what is happening. I'm used to a world where you work 8 hours and get paid by the hour. Or you work by the year and get paid by the year. Now we are in a world where not only can one person with robots replace everyone, if we add one extra human into the mix, it slows everything down. If you've ever taken a toll road with an [E-ZPass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-ZPass) vs. taken one where you have to stop and hand your money to a toll booth operator, you understand how one human can slow things down vs. a computer. I don't have the foresight to vote on it because I'm used to working as a toll booth operator, and all I can see is that if I support the E-ZPass, I lose my job.

But the twist is that even though I've lost my job, everything I want to buy is much cheaper. So I can do very little and still fulfil my basic needs. I'm poorer compared to a Jeff Bezos, but I'm much better off than my ancestors. I have phones, computers, the internet, microwaves, heat, AC, showers, toilets, comfortable beds, tasty fruits and spices. If I can't afford a car, I can afford to get around with an Uber. The average working class American has a higher standard of living than the richest man on Earth a century or two ago. So I get to be richer than Cornelius Vanderbilt, but the tradeoff is that I have to be poorer than Jeff Bezos. I can live with that.

I think Jeff Bezos and a handful of other people (e.g., Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Gabe Newell, Steve Jobs when he was alive) see the world from a different perspective as me. They aren't afraid for their day to day livelihoods. They have the skills to look at the Earth with a bit of distance. They can see all the technological innovation that is coming down the pipeline and adjust their views accordingly. Meanwhile, I thought the iPad and the Tesla Model S were stupid ideas when I first heard of them. It's not that they are the smartest people on Earth. Luck had a great deal to do with their position. But someone has to be in that position and direct the rest of us, so why not them?

I suppose we vote for them with our spending money as opposed to our actual votes. But I don't know if I trust any of the politicians alive today to really plan for this new world economy. Trump, Sanders, Warren all come out saying they know better, but their logic is mostly take from the bad people and give to the good people (as they define it.) They aren't saying they will create new wealth (which I've gotten used to over the past 200 years of rapid economic growth and gains in the standard of living for everyone). The politicians I tend to respect are the ones that propose ideas that help others do great things. Obama, Merkel, Trudeau, Macron, etc. all take this perspective. It's not about taking money from innovative people who are helping humanity and redistributing it to their voter base. It's about buying more lottery tickets so there are more innovative people around the world (e.g., by welcoming immigrants, spending more on education, etc.). But then it's about sitting back and letting those people do cool things.

So to go back to your original question, if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't give it to charity. I think humanity would be better off if I donated it to Elon Musk (who is already a billionaire) to build better batteries so that solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other relatively green power sources were more cost-effective. I think humanity would be better off if I gave the money to Jeff Bezos so he could continue to find more cost effective ways to sell things to people while using fewer resources. Their innovations multiply wealth for humanity by finding ways to extract move value out of a given amount of oil, steel or any other resource. I'm willing to be relatively poor today, if it means that everyone alive in 100 years is better off. So even though it hurts my ego and I'm extremely skeptical of them, I begrudgingly admit that they are probably better at moving society forward than I am. So I tolerate their wealth, power, and influence.

As a final point, something that makes me feel better is that even though they control a ton of money, I don't think they are hoarding it. They aren't swimming in a Scrooge McDuck vault of gold coins. Their wealth is invested in a bunch of innovative ideas that can help humanity. If they invest in something stupid (e.g., WeWork) they lose a ton of money and can't invest as much in the future. While they are alive, they are only consuming a tiny fraction of their wealth. (Even if Bezos eats caviar and champagne every day, he's still living on far less than 1% of his net worth). That means while he's alive, he might burn though a billion dollars. But the other 99 billion (or whatever it is) is going to pass on to some other human. And even if he gives it all to his kids, if they aren't brilliant investors or innovators too, they'll [lose their money ASAP.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-90-of-rich-people-squander-their-fortunes-2017-04-23) In this way, the people with the most merit in society roughly end up with the most money."	2	False

To my mind, being convicted of hate speech for mocking antisemitism is pure injustice.  No reasonable person can watch that video ***in its entirety*** and consider it supportive of antisemitic ideas.  No one who supports an idea describes its adherents as ""the least cute thing I can think of"".

And once someone actually employs their brain cells long enough to recognize the blatant anti-antisemitism in the video, the entire rest of the conversation falls away.

His dulled face immediately turned to a smile and he said ""Ah Assad the son of a bitch."" in German and we started talking about general conflicts in the Middle Eastern region.

This led me to strongly believe that people, Syrian or not, simply fkn hate Assad. Trying to make people follow him will be a tougher challenge than forcing down democracy."	2	False

1. No, in parenthesis I know that it wasn't her fault at the time, it was mainly our mom always giving her extra stuff because she was still hungry. As she gets older and can start making food decisions on her own, like ordering things or choosing what stuff to eat, I see it as laziness. I don't want to see it as laziness, but I can't seem to CMV.
2. I think she definitely has depression, but I just see her eating and such as emotional. Like it makes her feel better, but I don't think it's a mental illness (i/e: impossible to stop), just helpful. But I'm starting to see your point.
3. Her and I rarely talked, there are no other siblings. She would tattle on me and such, I would make fun of her. I'm older. I mean, it's possible, but I never thought I had much of an effect over it. Now we're very close, and from this conversation we've recently had I've started wondering and feeling bad. It's very possible but I hope not, it's been years and in between that and how we are now, both of us seemed equally disinterested with the other.
4. That's probably the strongest point. I just thought she really liked food, but from how she was talking it's almost like she actually hates it. She likes to cook and bake, and (for the most part) seems happier whenever she's eating, so I can't rule out her just liking food a lot and wanting to eat more of it. Like overindulging.

If you hang a hat on a rack, it becomes a hat rack. The rack is the same, but the use is a social construct. If you believe a hat rack is a hat rack, and then refuse to use it as a coat rack, that's a problem. If someone points out to you that it can be used for both purposes, that's a good thing.

In the same way, people try to use genetics to define race. They think that being white and being Asian are two completely different things. But if you point out that the are almost identical at the genetic level, and that the only difference is your perception (aka a social construct) it opens up a lot more options in your life.

The hat rack isn't mislabeled as a hat rack. When you put a hat on it, it is a hat rack. But you can easily relatable it as a coat rack and you would be just as correct. Once you realize that you can store belts on it and call it a belt rack. Or you can store ties on it and call it a tie rack.

So not only is pointing out that race is a social construct useful, it also is practical because it opens up one's options in life. It's not silly or counterproductive because it naturally lends itself to decreased competition and increased cooperation between people."	1	False

I haven't really spent much time thinking about the child being excluded (other than the things my parents told me - that excluding makes the other person sad or hurts their feelings). 

I invite you to look at the other side, the ""excluder's"" side of the story. Children exclude for many reasons, especially if the other child has annoying habits. However, excluding the student is not going to make them go away. They will still be in the same class and attend recess together. I believe caregivers encourage their child to include others because it teaches the potential ""excluder"" how to be patient, kind, and open minded. For example, in elementary school I did not like the boy who sat next to me only because I found him annoying. He talked during class and clicked his pen insistently. Since then, I have had to deal with many people who speak when they are not supposed and, yes, those kids grow up to continue clicking their pens. If I had just ignored this boy like I wanted to, I would not have learned to be patient. I'll admit that I was not the one to invite this boy into my play group. The teacher liked to pair us together because we balanced each other out - the super nerd and the class clown. Makes sense. It kept any one group from getting too rowdy. What I didn't realize is that I learned more during playtime than I would have if I had gotten to choose my playmates. I had to be patient when the boy refused to play by the rules. I had to be kind when he would make a joke I didn't find funny. I even eventually started to like the boy. He added pizzaz to our play group. I learned to rewrite some of the rules and be flexible. Had I not been put in playgroup with this boy I would have taken the easy route and been stuck in my ways for longer. I think that the ""excluder"" learns from including others, just like they learn from sharing with others. 

I do see exclusion as bullying because there is an alternative to this solution. Although the ""excluder"" was not trying to be malicious, it can have unintended consequences such as encouraging others to exclude the other child. Kids tend to copy one another because they are trying to fit in. They don't want to be left behind or excluded because they started hanging out with the kid that people found annoying. Another unintended consequence is hurting the other child. Some people take rejection better than others, but it is best to not take the chance of hurting another when you can take another path. In this case, the other path would be inclusion, open-mindedness, and growth."	5	False

I asked about jellyfish because they have a nervous system that allows them to react to stimuli, but no brain or consciousness to speak of. 

The reason I ask is because when I think about what gives life value, I feel it's consciousness that give life value. A human is definitely conscious. This is why we allow people who are in a permanent vegetative state to be taken off life support - they're effectively dead. There's no more consciousness. 

With very primitive creatures like insects, while they have a simple brain and some level of awareness they don't have nearly the capacity for thought that we do. I don't think it's a binary thing either. It's a spectrum. That's why we value human lives over animal lives when it comes down to it.

The reason why I don't think we SHOULD come together under a new title (egalitarianism seems like the best option) is that we'll lose too much momentum--feminism is a really big deal.

Also, perhaps the only reason that many pedophiles do control their self is due to the 'icy demonisation' of them. A kleptomaniac will often steal despite the knowledge it is illegal, as it is not 'that bad' a crime, whereas no one would doubt the seriousness of child abuse.

And as for pedophiles not necessarily having committed a crime, OP's relevant edit was made after I posted my original comment. Nevertheless, my ""cold, heartless"" comment is, at heart, a brutally pragmatic one. When you talk about making sweeping changes to an entire legal system, you need cold generalities rather than specific and tailored examples.

As I have said previously, please consider the alternate options. Obviously imprisoning someone for thoughtcrime would be a terrible thing to do, but what options do we have? The recent gay equality debates have made the point that you cannot ""cure"" someone of their sexuality, so the only options available are careful monitoring of pedophiles (already done, at least in the UK), imprisonment in an asylum or treating them like any other citizen. 

Of course, treating a pedophile as an average citizen is the morally superior choice, as the others would be punishing someone for things outside their control. However, can the government knowingly expose the public to someone who has an incredibly high chance, for reasons not of their own, of committing a serious assault? 

The only viable option I can see is the harsh demonisation already present in society, as a method of dissuasion at the cost of reduced confession. Your points about a society that helps them find safe releases, etc, is very worthy, but I cannot think of ways this could be achieved. It may be my own short-sightedness, but I see no better option than what we do now.

Almost all are. And I am sure we can do better on that.

&gt;You’re perfectly content getting it wrong 2% of the time and killing 1/50 innocents, a far higher death rate than anything else.

Not true. Not true *at all*. So not true it is borderline disingenuous. HUGE difference between 1 out of 50 innocent people on death row, and killing 1 out of 50 innocent people. Killing 1 out of 50 innocent people would be snuffing out 6.2 million people. If 1 in 25 people on death row are innocent, and 1 in 4 of them are actually killed, that means 1 in 100 death row inmates are put to death while innocent, assuming innocent people are exonerated at the same rate as guilty (which, if we are being honest, i would expect innocent people to be exonerated at a higher rate).

So not only are you using deceptive phrasing, you are blatantly getting the numbers wrong. But tell you what, i will 100% answer that question, if you answer the two at the end of this post.

Most studies estimate the rate of wrongful conviction between 2.3 and 5%. I mean, yes, we put a lot of guilty people away, but are you *ok* with up to 10,000 innocent people being put in jail? How many would you be ok with in the pursuit of keeping the peace?

Here is the issue. When we are looking for standards of conviction, errors always happen. Always. It is a human system with human people. We can choose whether those errors result in more innocent people convicted... or more guilty people free. Which side do we err on?

So, here's the real questions. **Are you ok with these wrongful convictions? Would you accept 5% of the murderers that are currently convicted to have been found innocent and released back in to make that happen?** Because that's what's on Death row. Currently, 13 people are on the Federal Death Row list. 11 of them have murder in their listed offenses (some of which include kidnqpping and rape). The other 2? Hate Crimes (Dylann Roof, known for shooting up a Charleston Church) and terrorism (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, known for the Boston Marathon Bombing). 

I have your answer, friend. All you gotta do is answer those 2 questions. Simple yes or no questions. **Are you ok with 5% of all future killers going free to drop those innocents down to 0? Or are you ok with those innocent people having their freedom stripped from them?**"	1	False

We had a bull market for years before this and they should of been prepared. As another redditor pointed out, the renter and buyer pools are different because not everyone can afford to buy a house or will stay in an area long enough to warrant buying. The lack of availability of houses for sale affects the buyer market and drives home prices up. Higher prices mean higher mortgages which leads to higher rent. I am of the belief that mortgage cost is the prime deciding factor for rent cost. I think that if more people outright owned their home (rather than taking out debt) then rent costs would plummet. I do agree that new home construction should be the long term solution. There’s also international buyers who grab properties and leave the lots empty. Not sure what the exact motivation is there.

Because it was my understanding that a certain subset of intellectual property theft is criminal, and that you think it should all be civil.

&gt;All you have to do is criminalize the appropriation of trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government/entity.

Right, and this is what 18 USC 1831 does. Which you agreed with. One of the elements is the theft of intellectual property. 

&gt;Similarly, you don't have to criminalize the ownership of guns to make a law that more harshly punishes armed robbery than un-armed robbery.


But the other element is based on the actor. Not the action. So, I don’t understand how this is relevant. 

&gt;To take the gun example further:

As I said, you tend to avoid physical object analogies for this CMV, so I’d really rather not. Why not talk about the example I’m giving of 18 USC 1831? 

&gt;gun ownership should not be criminalized, your equivalent argument would be to bring up the armed robbery example as something that rightly criminalizes gun ownership.

No, my argument is that criminality depends on what type of actor it is. So that would be like saying ‘it should be illegal for children to buy tobacco’ 

&gt;However, I don't see that as a legitimate example, since it doesn't actually criminalize the ownership or even the use of guns, but only the use of the gun for a specific purpose.

Why don’t you point to the statue you feel is legitimate? I did a search to try and find criminal statues for IP theft, I presented my findings, and you agreed with my position:

&gt;Yes, I think it should be a crime, but you don't need to criminalize trade secrets for that statute to be a crime.

I think you should point to the specific statue you think criminalizes IP theft that you don’t think is relevant, because I brought one and you agreed with it.

To be blunt, socialism and communism don't seem to be taught well in many public schools (they certainly weren't to me), which has led to quite a few myths about how they operate that aren't rooted in actual socialist philosophy. In particular, I want to focus in on this core section of your argument:

&gt; Even if there was a successful socialist revolution, and the means of production were seized equally among the proletarian population, it wouldn’t remain in such a state for very long. After a while, someone would want a bigger piece of the pie, and before long, someone would get it.

The thing is, socialist theory **isn't** about making society completely equal. Quite to the contrary, competition is not only ok under socialism, it's expected! The difference in between socialism and capitalism comes down to how the benefits of that competition are allocated. In capitalism the value produced by members of society is disproportionately directed into the hands of a small, but economically powerful, owning class. In a socialist society, people are rewarded by society in a manner directly proportional to the benefit they provide to society, with that value being decided collectively. A factory manager in a socialist society would make more than an assembly line worker, but the difference between their income would be far more reasonable than what you see in a capitalist society. 

Adding to this, a socialist society is actually geared around the premise that every citizen can and should try to provide as much value to the collective, and thus receive as much of a reward, as possible. Socialists believe that society's resources should be collectively pooled in order to give everyone an equal starting point in society, allowing them to distinguish themselves on the basis of their own natural talents. Many socialist theorists would argue that a capitalist system inherently benefits those born into positions of privilege and disadvantages those born into positions of socioeconomic struggle, thus creating an inefficient system for fostering a person's natural abilities. Someone born into a poor family might posses a degree of talent far greater than their peer born to a wealthy family, but never achieve the same degree of success due to the uphill battle they face affording basic necessities and finding the resources to foster their talents. By working towards a classless society, in which all are provided the same opportunities, you avoid this pitfall."	1	False

I'm liberal and I'm a critic of both of those things. Being a critic of them really says nothing about how I vote.

No worries. I'll try to explain a little more clearly. 

Alt-right is a political movement based on ideals of nationalism, traditionalism, and conservatism. Because of those ideas, they are critical of ideas/movements that go against that - hence the criticism of feminism, Islam, and Gender Identity. 

A liberal might value individual freedoms. Thus a liberal might be critical for different reasons. Another example: I'm pro-women's rights and critical of Islam because I find it culturally limits women's rights. My criticism is not because I want to maintain our Christian heritage. 

The result is the same but the reason for the criticism may be different. Also, knowing where ones values lies helps understand why they may support or oppose something.  

&gt; Sure. But seeing as that's the case, why bother using it? Why not just use the actual term you mean?

I might want to address the big broad group. For example, as a voting population. I would likely talk about them as a statistical population. If I want to address the dumb ass Alt-Righters that held tiki torches with Richard Spencer, I will surely use the term Neo-Nazi and speak more specifically. The saying, ""All dogs are animals but not all animals are dogs"" come to mind. People do use the terms interchangeably, which I find it is incorrect.

You raise an interesting counter-argument re environment constituting a category of factors that an individual has no choice in. One reply would be that we limit rights in a categorical fashion. There is no practical way to construct a rule that could take into account the environmental nuances that lead particular individuals to have a strong preference for incestuous sex.

Another reply would be  that, while the individual does not have a choice over her environment, *someone* does. Limiting the rights of some people that may have been exposed to toxic environments expresses a societal value regarding the undesirability and, in certain cases, illegality, of those toxic environments.

I would agree that these answers entail various kinds of unfairness in a variety of tragic situations. But life is tragic, and the standard of justification for a particular law is not perfect fairness. 

Although a lot of good points are being raised, and accuracy would demand tweaks to certain aspects of my argument, the core idea that ""we don't ban relationships b/w people with known congenital genetic defects because we feel it is *less* justifiable to limit the rights of people by virtue of something they had no choice in"" stands. That doesn't mean that we should *never* limit the rights of people by virtue of something they had no choice in.

Yes, but mere species alone doesn't seem to be morally relevant enough to warrant a difference in personhood. It doesn't make sense to point to one specific gene, and go, ""That right there is what makes this chimp a person!"" Or if the species difference is more nuanced, for example by different mating times which prevent interbreeding, it wouldn't make sense at all to attribute personhood to mating time.


&gt;You can justify genocide based on the metrics for personhood...

One way to avoid this is to take the view that there are multiple capacities that contribute to personhood in various ways. There is no one capacity which immediately grants personhood. This is plausible for a variety of reasons. For instance, the ability to feel pain may grant you the right not to be inflicted pain unnecessarily. The ability to be aware that you are alive grants you the right not to be killed. 


What this means is that it wouldn't be wrong *per se* to inflict pain on someone with analgesia, because that's actually impossible. It still would be wrong to kill them, however, because they are still self-aware.

I'm sure you'd also agree sometimes you may feel hungry for salty foods, other times heartier full calorie meals.

I once went to a conference on diabetes where a leading endocrinologist in the region gave a presentation asking us to reframe obesity as a disease caused by dysregulation of the systems controlling the biological phenomenon of hunger.

He argued (with evidence) that people who suffer from this dysregulation appear in one of two ways: severely overweight, or not, but the people who weren't overweight live a life of constant suffering due to always experiencing hunger, and just opting to ignore those impulses to avoid people like you from judging them as lazy.

I don't know if such a dysregulation actually exists or not. It seems reasonable. He also posited that acquiring this dysregulation is likely from our eating habits we had while we were developing.

But point being, I think your view assumes everyone experiences the phenomenon of hunger equally. I challenge you to consider, what if that's not the case?

Sure, obese people could get skinny. But their mind might just crank the hunger on them, tell their body they're absolutely starving. Maybe you can't understand such impulses because you've never been through them.

(This endocrinologist recommended indefinite pharmacologic treatment to correct the dysregulation. The problem with many people taking ""diet pills"" is they often just take them to lose weight and then stop taking them when they are at their goal. The evidence actually supports indefinite use of these medications. If the hypothesis that there is messed up systems controlling hunger are the cause, the indefinite use of medications makes sense.)

(Lastly, keep in mind we likely don't know more about obesity from a neuroscientific perspective because of the stigma and chalking it up to laziness we all put on it. If we reframe the concept as a disease with a physiological cause, rather than something someone should feel ashamed of, we might make big strides as a society to actually solving the problem you're identifying. It seems like shame is an ineffective approach though, no?)"	1820	False

I agree with that, but it does little if you're unhappy with your country's policies. Although I do think many people, especially in the US, would be much happier if they did move to different areas.

&gt; On a national level it's not as difficult as you think to move to another country if you're from one of these countries, as far as immigration laws go.

You're kidding right? Obviously it's pretty easy to move within the EU, but it's nearly impossible for an American to move to Europe (UK is being flooded by immigrants from eastern Europe and they let hardly let any non EU nationals in, Spain especially but also France and Italy have shit economy right now and don't want non EU nationals, Germany is pretty easy if you have a STEM degree and some experience but if you have any other degree you're SOL, eastern Europe is also do able with a STEM degree but same as Germany other degrees SOL, Australia and Canada are a little easier and are open to a more variety of people, and getting a visa in the US is insanely difficult).

I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying it's very very difficult and it is impossible if you're not a skilled worker and don't have at least a BA.

&gt; Sure finding a job before you go would be great, but not necessary.

In most cases it is necessary in order to be able to legally stay in the country. In many countries you can't go there and look for work and then apply for a work visa. As an example, it is illegal for an American to go to the UK and look for a job. Even if they fly back to the US to apply for a work visa it will most likely be denied and you will be banned for a few years from the entire EU.

Things have changed in the past 10 years are so or you can't base your information on visas off of what the older generation has done because the rules they had were so different. What your parents did (assuming they didn't come due to family connections or the green card lottery or something) would be illegal now."	1	False

The first issue you are talking about comes up occasionally, but I fail to understand why occasionally putting in `list` is a massive issue - but having lazy evaluation for `range` and `map` is extremely useful in large datasets, and a heck of a lot of people are using large dataset these days...

Now we have generator objects, I rarely use `map` anyway, as it's much less flexible and somewhat harder to reason about.

As for reduce - how often do you use it in regular coding?  Even before Python 3, the answer was ""not so often"".  It was stupid to have it in two places in Python 2 (`itertools` and a default function), and Python 3 fixed it.  Is it _really_ a dealbreaker to have to write `from functools import reduce` occasionally?

You probably know this already, but significance levels are often used in one-tailed or two-tailed tests for a particular null hypothesis, and can be used for one sample or multiple samples.

For convenience, let me just give an explanation using a two-tailed, one sample test. When you reduce the significance level, it also means that considering all other factors to be equal (pop. mean, pop. SD and number of samples), the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean needs to be a lot higher with a 1% significance level versus a 5% significance level.

The trade off for a lower significance level is that you run a higher risk of having a Type II error - i.e. not rejecting the null when you should have rejected it. It could genuinely be that if you were to take ALL the statistics from the population that gave you the sample mean, it's actually different from the supposed population mean that you're comparing to. But because you made the requirement so strict, you don't reject the null hypothesis when you actually should have.

It's all about trying to find a balance between committing Type I and Type II errors, and the correct conclusions as well."	26	False

That's incorrect. Are you familiar with the WBC, for an easy example? If opinions were regulated by US law, then every instance of every expression of every opinion is a potential lawsuit (or rather, lawsuits), which is very much NOT the case.

Anyone can express an opinion online - it's not the opinion alone that must be considered. Take the case of the #KillAllWhiteMen hashtag that you keep mentioning:

* If I tweet that I'm in line at the DMV, and a white guy in front of me in line farts, including the #KillAllWhiteMen hashtag facetiously, is that inciting violence?
* If I tweet that the #KillAllWhiteMen hashtag is, in fact, inciting violence, is my tweet inciting violence because it includes the hashtag?

Is it worth investigating every instance of the use of #KillAllWhiteMen, to ensure that it isn't being used to incite violence? I couldn't say. I can say that however worth it that investigation may be, it is *far more worth* investigating hashtags when they are *far more likely* to incite violence.

*Actual violence* is a very obvious and very easy place to start that investigation, since it's exactly the thing that these policies and/or laws are designed to prevent or mitigate. And *actual* violence has *actually* happened in the case of Gab. Additionally, as mentioned by others, Gab 

Why wouldn't Facebook and Twitter be automatically suspect, in this case? A laundry list of reasons, many or all of which are context - i.e. Facebook and Twitter weren't founded in response to founders having been banned from other online communities for engaging in hateful speech. Facebook and Twitter have a proven track record of taking actual steps to reduce the incidence of the incitement of violence (however ineffective you might judge those steps to be/have been), and Gab simply did not (and/or does not?) have a rule stating that incitement of violence is forbidden.

But to finally address the heart of your question - companies absolutely have a moral right to ban and/or refuse to do business with a company that they perceive to be supporting and/or harboring murderers. They don't *need* a moral right in order to do this, by the way, but that wasn't what you were asking.

Companies don't have a moral obligation *not* to do business with communities that harbor and/or spawn mass murderers, either. However, there's a point past which even the *most* ignorant executive must acknowledge that because doing business with someone constitutes a tacit acknowledgement and acceptance of their public business practices and affiliations, the choice to continue to do business with the given community or company would constitute a public implication of approval."	3	False

David was born a boy, but after a circumcision gone wrong he was raised a girl.  As he aged, he grew increasingly unsatisfied with his gender and once he became a teenager his parents told him the truth-that he was, in fact, born a boy.  He underwent hormonal treatments and surgeries but ultimately ended up committing suicide.

There are sometimes problems with our [sex chromosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome_disorders)

In my Biological Psychology class, we learned about an interesting case where some people in a particular village the Dominican Republic have ambiguous genitalia and are raised at girls-but once they reach puberty they begin to develop as men and indeed start to date women.  These individuals are nicknamed [guevedoces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-alpha-reductase_deficiency) 

So how do we determine gender?  By genes?  Gonands?  Genitals?  The Brain?  It isn't as easy as whether you have a vagina or penis and to classify gender without considering all factors would be an oversimplification.  You just have to have some empathy-some people feel truly uncomfortable being the gender they were born.  People commit suicide over that.  When I was younger I used to be a huge tomboy and I truly felt really awkward and weird wearing girl's clothing.  I never thought of myself as a boy, but even now I don't like to wear dresses and such.  People wouldn't undergo sex change operations just for fun-they cost a huge amount of money and the surgery itself is obviously invasive.

There has been a general move recently to do away with words in instructions when trying to convey what a thing does, or how to convey an action.  And this makes sense when telling someone to screw parts together; a diagram with a screw and screwdriver don't need translations for whoever is being told what to do.  

On the other hand you have people like me who just can't figure out what a little rectangle with a few short horizontal lines and an arrow pointing somewhere means.  This may seem trivial, nonsensical, or unbelievable but its true.  I have to sit there for moments remembering what I'm trying to do and try to relate with what the icons I'm looking at are trying to convey to me as their function. If they'd just leave things where they were I could eventually memorize what they do based on location, like typing.  But they don't

The new Reddit interface is a perfect example.  I've got a jagged arrow pointing up and to the right, three very short lines with an arrow pointing upwards in the middle of them, a little black box with either a Greek alpha, α, or perhaps oc, and various other things I won't bore you with.  

The point is none of them make intuitive sense to me and I wish someone would use CSD In Linux to actually *tell me in words* what everything did!  

I know that in the great scheme of things I'm irrelevant, and my problem with icons seems unlikely at best.  But CSD seems to be made for what I need.  In your own examples you linked, I got the magnifying lens and the X down.  Although literal me wants to think the lens means enlarge I now know it's always going to be 'Search', and the X is always going to close a thing.  But those other symbols?  I totally need text to tell me something's going to re-arrange the directory to show me more information.  And I had to think about it to get that meaning.  I had to relate large dots and lines to file icons and filenames on the screen and then decide they were indicating how the screen in front of me would change by clicking there.

So I understand your point about CSD, especially because changing the organization and location of icons makes it harder to know where I need to click.

The case you cited is an exception that allows the veil to be pierced if it is used to avoid an existing obligation as opposed to shielding future risks (e.g. developing a new division as a subsidiary entity). I see no social good associated with multiple layers of limited liability however, and maintain that corporate persons should not be able to shield themselves from liabilities arising from related corporate persons.

I think you could readily achieve this goal with regulation. However, you likely should remember divisions exist for many valid reasons. A parent company like Mitsubishi. They have electronics, cars, heavy equipment etc. It makes sense to have divisions dedicated to product types. Sometimes, these are separated for specific regulatory reasons."	1	False

But it's important to note that although a lot of these are quite esoteric, upstream energy/oil and gas companies (with the notable exception of Ryanair).

They are ultimately extracting resources to be used by the 7.5 billion of us that inhabit the planet.

What we really need as a holistic approach to understanding how we as a species use energy. The food we consumer, our travel, electricity, heating, fashion. You name it. It is all part of one big system set up to full fill our apparent needs.

But luckily there are some quick wins. Cutting down on meat consumption, electric vehicles, less plane travel, renewable energy to power houses. These individual actions will have massive effects.

I would agree with you that this needs to be done at the top. With a regulatory framework imposed on countries around the world (a carbon tax seems most realistic).

But this change needs to come at both ends. I think it's dangerous when people push the narrative it's all the fault of far off, evil corporations. Yes it's true their greed is driving this. But their money ultimately comes from us as consumers, driving demand for their products.

People need to be honest with themselves that their lives will change. If energy companies pay a carbon tax, it's likely they will pass this cost onto the consumers. They are greedy, but their margins aren't infinite, so it won't all come from their profit.

We need to be ready for this as a society. Hopefully with alternatives that are more affordable - and cleaner. And not see this as some far off problem to do with corporations that operate in a vacuum.

Your CMV is about what you think ""should"" happen. Banning the legal institution of marriage won't happen any time soon either, but this is what you asked to discuss.

&gt; Most of the time a marriage contract is entered on the basis that the relationship will last forever. This is not informed consent.

Are you seriously suggesting that most of the time, people who get married are unaware that divorce is a possibility? That's a tremendous stretch -- divorce is a very well known fact of life. People enter all sorts of contracts *hoping* that they will last forever, but that doesn't mean they are unaware of the possibility that it won't.

&gt; But this is no longer the case in many marriages. Those laws should only apply to couples with kids.

Kids are only one possible piece of the equation. There's laundry, dishes, home repair, cooking, cleaning, yardwork, financial bookkeeping, all sorts of things that go into it. Earning income is also only one piece of that equation. It's entirely up to the partners how to split these responsibilities, and if the higher income earner doesn't want to agree to give what is standardly expected, they are able and welcome to negotiate a pre-nuptial agreement.

It sort of is, in that there would be much higher inflation during recessions when there would be a lot of pressure for prices to fall.  Sumner actually gives an example of this in the beginning of the paper I linked.

&gt;Also, why should this NGDP target be independent of real considerations? At the very least, for example, GDP obviously depends on the population. A country with a fast growing population naturally has faster GDP growth than one in which the population grows more slowly or even declines. I don't see why it would make sense to automatically put a break on the country whose population is growing faster.

It doesn't need to be the same target in every country.  China for instance has been having breakneck growth for the past couple decades, and a 4% NGDP target would be far too low for them.  OTOH, a good target for China (say, 10%) would be wildly inflationary in Germany.^1  The target would be fixed in the short run of a few years, but might get moved now and then depending on circumstances.

For example, it would be equality to give men as long a maternity leave as women, but why do we not give men a long maternity leave?

They should. Or: at least one parent out of each family should get long parental leave, so they can do most of the care-taking.

&gt; Another example: equality would have everyone have the same opportunity for any job as others on the same level. Why do some jobs still attract more men than women while some jobs attract more women than men? That’s not equality!

You first define equality based on opportunity, and then you measure it based on *equality of outcome*.

Those are two very different concepts of equality. If some jobs attract more women than men, it doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't have the same *equality of opportunity*.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_of_outcome

&gt; The point here is, that equality is not the gold standard. For example, the sex divide. People of the two sexes are fundamentally different and as such need to be catered to according to their needs and not on the basis of equality. 

Equality of opportunity *can* probably reach your gold standard, because it doesn't necessitate that all differences in outcome count as evidence for inequality."	25	False

So with that goal in mind, lets look at your 3 reasonings:

1. Just because all women are different does not mean there are not trends. Women in certain cultures are socialized in certain ways and often share a lot of similar experiences. If you completely miss or misrepresent those experiences, you will damage immersion for a good amount of readers.

2. Interactions with women are good to help, but they can only give you so much. Most women act differently when not around any men, or when not around anyone at all. And you cannot read minds. Reading what women actually write about themselves and their experiences can help give a much more well rounded view on writing them.

3. This seems to be the big one. If you don't care about writing realistic female characters, of course you shouldn't care about learning what realistic is. But I do think that this will hurt your writing more than you realize. Generally society has a male point of view as the default for most media. There has been a ton of books/movies/plays and so on that give the male perspective on women. So even if you find a woman's perspective on men interesting, most women are not likely to find the reverse something they are looking for. And honestly, I wouldn't find it interesting either, I've read enough of men writing women without understanding them for a lifetime.

I obviously don't know if this is something you actually struggle with, but it seems like at least trying some female authors will give you a much better perspective to say whether you actually need this help or not. Maybe you write women fine, and those authors won't tell you much that's new. Maybe you don't and this can be a wake up call. But it's going to be hard for you to say without ever trying to read them, so I'd say just go for it!

Plus, there's a lot of great undervalued female authors throughout history, so you might find some really great stories from it too."	1	False

Remember that money is not a good or service, but the value for which those things are exchanged. So while the bank considers $4 to be worth 100 times as much as 8 fenings, both of those are actually worth the same (equal to one watermelon) in their local region.

And now I'm very confused why you don't love Dumbledore as much as I do, haha. It's his desire to be good, and yet his cowardice and shame leading him to make the wrong choices that I find so fascinating. Sometimes I pity him, but mostly I really admire how much he tried, and he did a helluva lot better than any of us would do. He is my favorite character of all time.

The two things I still want to remark on is that I don't understand why you think he was still actively interested in the Hallows following Ariana's death. From what I can determine, Dumbledore had learned a difficult lesson about pursuing power, which seem to be very closely tied to his interest in the Hallows considering this line,

&gt; ""for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’""

. We know decades later he didn't go after the Elder Wand and we know even more decades after that he says he had long since stopped his search. While there is room to think he did, I think it's risky to assume he was actively pursuing them.

&gt; “So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?”

&gt; “Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself. [...] You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.""

The context seems to suggest that it was her death was that thing that changed his view. When Harry asks about Dumbledore borrowing the cloak all the way in 1981, Dumbledore uses what happened to Ariana in the early part of the century to explain it. It seems like a logical conclusion that he had stopped actively looking. Though I would agree that he was clearly still perhaps guiltily curious, just stopped actively pursuing them.

I also love that you say, ""he just didn't feel like boasting"". I agree. While he had already refused the post of Minister at this point, he still had every opportunity to seek power especially now he had the wand. But, just like you say, he didn't feel like it. He had gained humility, though not from anything honorable, but he had still gained it. I love that the result is good, but the journey is almost embarrassing. What a fascinating backstory.

&gt; He is too confidant, too self assured and in such could ruin everything.

I also disagree with this. I don't think he is has as much confidence in his plan as you suggest, but he went with the plan he thought best. Why should that mean he was brimming with confidence about it? Mostly, though, I think he trusted Harry. That is, Dumbledore didn't plan Godric's Hollow, didn't plan the battle, didn't plan Xenophilius Lovegood, didn't plan the Ministry. But he trusted that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had good judgement to make their own decisions. I think this is where we disagree. I realize Dumbledore controlled a lot, but I think fans have taken it to a level where anything that happens must then be a result of Dumbledore, but that is to easy, too convenient, and falls apart under scrutiny. Yes, he controlled a lot, but he didn't control everything, and he definitely didn't control Harry. I think he originally tried in PS and saw that he couldn't, then he tried again in OotP, and saw again that he couldn't. The theme of this series is about choice. ""it is our choices that make us who we truly are""."	1	False

You further gloss your narrow guilt-linked interpretation of ""YEWU,OAU"" with this caveat about the systematic problems in question:

So with all this there are a bunch of different options for the view you might want changed.

2. But perhaps you only mean it is *mostly* unhealthy and incorrect.

3. Or perhaps you mean it is unhealthy and incorrect *only* in the special set of cases you mention, where it is linked to systematic social problems, but it is unhealthy and incorrect in *all* of those.

4. Or perhaps, since the only ""unhealthy"" effect you mention is reinforcing in-group/out-group mentality, you meant to refer narrowly to all the cases where ""YEWU,OAU"" actually produces this undesirable psychological effect.

5. Or maybe you meant something else.

Can you clarify? Typically people with CMV's like these state their case in very broad terms but then backpedal. I want to address the view you actually hold."	4	False

Thus to oppose one law and not another because one is artificial is contradictory.  It's like saying ""I oppose this law because it's a law,"" which only makes sense if you are a complete anarchist.

2)  You can't simply apply the basic laws of supply-and-demand to humans the same way you can to consumer goods.  There's really few moral issues at stake as far as how much a pencil costs.  If the price of pencils goes way down to the point that manufacturers can't make a profit, some manufacturers will switch to other products (in turn, bringing the supply down, allowing the price to go up, and allowing others to stay in the business.)  However, if the price of human labor goes below what a human needs to survive, the human can't switch to being a tree or a rabbit.  There's a minimum that people need to survive regardless of what the supply and demand for labor currently is.

3)  The concerns about a higher minimum wage costing jobs is exaggerated.  Businesses generally don't give out jobs as charity.  If a place that has 10 minimum wage workers can make more money with 9 instead it would have already fired someone before any minimum wage increase happens.  In reality, just a small increase in price will usually make up for any minimum wage increases.  This is very possible because...

4)  Increasing minimum wage increases demand.  It's okay if McDonalds has to increase its Big Macs by 25 cents after a minimum wage jump because now more people have money to spend on Big Macs.

5)  Finally, consider that we also have welfare.  Shouldn't companies be required at the very least to pay enough so their workers aren't on welfare rolls as well?  McDonalds customers benefit from the fact that the employees aren't starving and looking like they sleep under a bridge, and the owners benefit $$$ as well.  Giving welfare to full-time workers is essentially just a subsidy to business.  I say let the customers and owners of a business be responsible for paying enough that their workers aren't miserable, barely surviving wrecks of human existence instead of making the taxpayer fill in the gap.  If you want a hamburger served by someone who has had a meal and a shower in the last week, I shouldn't have to pay for that.  That's on you.

People do not want to be treated that way; and that is exactly what you're ensuring by assuming that all of them are mentally impaired. Well they are non-mentally impaired enough to choose not to be treated that way, which means that they will not come forward for help.

  


I'm referring to the fact that most suicide attempts are heat of the moment decisions and not rational ones, as pointed out by years of studies into it. I've at no point made any judgements about the mental imparement of suicidal people, as all people are capable of irrational thought under hightened emotions and dispair. I mean, why would I sit here and call myself mentally impared?

  


&gt;That's kind of an insane way of thinking. If we universalised that line of thought, that means that we could just decide that a random person is liable for huge debts, because if they didn't do anything that would constitute being held liable for that debt, then that's all the more reason why they should be the one's legally liable! Can you not see how backwards that is?

  


Can you explain this part further? It seems like a huge leap to me, and I'm just not sure where you're getting it from.

  


&gt;If the answer is ""no, unless"" and the ""unless"" part isn't just demonstrating that they haven't done anything that would warrant being forced to remain alive, then that's indentured slavery.

  


You and I have different ideas about what constitutes slavery. Being alive, by its very nature, enforces responsibilities upon us, and I can see how that can feel like an injustice when you didn't ask for the responsibilities. But I don't see those responsibilities as equating to slavery. Something can be your responsibility without it being your fault. If you're working at a store and an earthquake causes bottles to fall off the shelves and spill on the floor, it's not your fault. Is it slavery if your boss tells you to clean the spill? Not if you're being paid correctly, because it's still your responsibility.

Your responsibilities in life are paid by the opportunity to make something out of that life that you will enjoy. If you're having difficulty paying that out, you should seek support, and if it's impossible, *then* you should ""quit"".

  


You might find that many of the ""responsibilities"" that seem most unjust are those imposed by society, to which I would agree that they should be changed. The ""responsibility"" of trying to make something out of life instead of jumping straight to unloading all responsibilities to those around you just doesn't seem like slavery to me."	1	False

Secondly, referring to women as locks erases all their agency, as well as libido. Women like and want sex, they don't just guard it and then ""reward"" men with it. It's nonsensical for there to be a gatekeeper to a mutual experience. 

Society created the social stigmas against women having sex because it was the ""best"" way for men to ensure that their children were biologically their own, to pass down their property. But if women really didn't want to have sex, and were naturally passive, there'd be no need to shame or fear a confidently libidinous woman, because she wouldn't exist. But the only real reason women were pushed into the role of gatekeepers is because of paternal uncertainty. We're long past any ""need"" for that, now, though. And, the further a culture is from stigmatized gender roles, the more proactive women become--as soon as women *have* the freedom to make moves and sleep around without risking their life or future, they do. Sure, in a manner a bit more discriminating than the stereotypical man (though plenty of men are picky, too), but the fact that it takes more time/skill for a woman to orgasm explains that fairly well.

The lock/key metaphor fails on all levels because it separates sex from the parties involved. After all, locks aren't used but to protect something else. But sex isn't some amorphous separated thing or good, it's a mutually enjoyable experience  (or should be). If I cook a meal with someone, and we both brought ingredients and both cooked, neither person is suddenly the ""gatekeeper"" of the other's meals, just because it happened in someone's kitchen; it's not like I'm not also eating the food, either.

An accent is an internally consistent way of speaking that a whole community learns. While it's true that three native speakers from Nyu Yawk, Bahston, and London might all speak differently, someone who randomly pronounced English sounds with syllables from all three accents jumbled together would be impossible for all of them to hear. (If I understand your point, you are trying to suggest that just as someone who learns English in Boston ends up with a Boston accent, someone who learns in Germany ends up with a German accent?)

I think it would be very unexpected if good accent-mimics weren't also good at learning the pronunciation of new languages. The gist of mimicking an accent is (1) hearing sounds that don't serve a semantic purpose in your language, (2) finding the mouth/tongue movement that reproduces or approximates that sound. It's exactly what you do when you learn to speak a new language. But, as you say, gifted accent mimics are rare.

So just to be clear - your current claim is that adults have *all* the unconscious tools that children have for language learning, plus additional conscious tools? And would you agree that any evidence that children have unconscious tools that adults don't is evidence agaisnt your view?"	1	False

The things you mention apply to all sorts of groups. Marxists, capitalists, christians, muslims, secularists, etc. All these groups have diverse ideas and are highly internally fractured, maybe even to the point that it could be described as fractal.

I'd even go so far as saying that the same labels can have multiple defining features e.g. A christian might be someone who accepts that Jesus is the son of god. A christian might be someone who follows the teaching of Jesus. A christian might be someone who accepts the nicean creed. Though there is some overlap of the three definitions, these definitions seem to cover everyone who calls themselves christian. 

That said, would you care to say what you think defines a feminist?"	8	False

1. You're absolutely correct, ""tragedy of the commons"", as well as other historical examples/thought experiments like ""the prisoner's dilemma"", ""the stag hunt"", ""the caterpillar game"", ""date night"" are all examples of collective action problems. The field that studies interactions described in these rigorous terms is called ""game theory"", and any interaction where how the actors would act if they could collectively commit to acting in a certain way is different from how they would otherwise act is a collective action problem.

2. Often these ""games"" are clearer if you define clearly what choices the ""players"" have and what the effects of each choice are, because as the effects of the players' change, the type of game may also change.

3. Just to be clear about the proportion between A and B in the thought experiment I gave, I was thinking about something similar to global warming, where my choices are (... a continuum between...) A: use no electricity or energy from greenhouse-gas increasing sources, and B: continue to live my normal lifestyle. In this example it's clear that when I choose A, I basically have to give up life as I know it; but when I choose B, I make a miniscule contribution to a problem that is hurting *eight billion people*, and if all eight billion people make that choice the climatic and sea-level changes will hurt us far more than the electricity helped. That is the kind of proportion between personal benefit and harm I'm talking about. I'm not trying to steer you away from the racial topic, just point out that if the basic structure is ""either I hire the white applicant or I hire the black applicant,"" there isn't much of a collective action aspect because the benefits and harms are so focused. 

3. In a case where there is one villain who is doing something *clearly* harmful, and the social challenge is for the other people to find some way to stop him, ""YEWU, OYAU"" is most reasonable when the A/B trade-off isn't directly relevant *either* to the evil villain, *or* to the choice of how to fight him, but instead to a much broader problem with a pay-off structure more similar to what I originally gave (high personal payoff, harms spread among a large group, possibly with a threshold effect that makes individual altruism worthless). Then the A/B choice would be about something unrelated to the racist business-owner, and the purpose of the campaign against him would be that *given* that we've all chosen B, and this has horrible consequences for minorities, we have to find ways to help the victims: finding a way to get everyone to choose A would be one path, but finding other problems that people are hurting the victims and solving them, first, is often a better idea. Basically, the fact that we all chose B gives us a responsibility for the welfare of the victims: the collective action problem, if we accept responsibility for the costs of B, is either to *mitigate* the harm (by getting people to chose A instead) or to *compensate* for the harm (by choosing other harms and taking a more active attitude towards them than we normally would).

4. Just some examples of social systemic problem that might have this ""concentrated benefits, diffuse harms"" quality: (i) A: live in a neighborhood with poor people and the problems associated with them. B: move to the suburbs and make the neighborhoods with poor people slightly more impoverished, intensifying their social problems. (ii) A: send your child to a public school with a high proportion of struggling poor kids. B: send your child to a selective private school or ritzy suburban public school, leaving the poor public schools with a higher concentration of poor students. (iii) A: support lenient criminal prosecutions and sentences, despite the higher risk of crime you will face. B: support tough-on-crime policies that send at-risk young people to jail for years, destroy their lives, and burden their families. ---- I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. If you think Americans face lots of A-or-B choices like this, you would conclude that black people have (collectively) payed a heavy price for choices that seemed necessary to individual white people. Very few people will vote to get robbed more often or sacrifice their child's education so he can have a positive influence on his classmates. But the aggregate results of these choices have been terrible. So some sort of collective action solution is necessary, and there will be no way to reverse the problems unless the people making the B-choices get on board with some plan for either compensation or mitigation; saying ""it's really not my problem"" is simply saying that you take no responsibility for the consequences of the B-type choices you've made, and that you are satisfied with the resulting suffering. 

6. (Note that I'm not making any claims about how much suffering these choices have caused, that's not really relevant here. Maybe you think segregation and long prison terms have actually been good for black people, whatever, but in that case your problem is with the *social analysis* the activist is making, not with *their framing of the problem as YEWU,OAU.*)"	2	False

I’m not sure what you believe about white privilege or widespread systemic racism against minorities , but most people who use the term Karen tend to believe in both. With that in mind, you can see why using Karen is inherently not the same as attacking a race that is currently oppressed in our society (from the user’s viewpoint). Although both may be stereotyping a race negatively, in the eyes of those who use Karen, there is a clear difference.	3	True

But consent is present in both cases. In both cases, one voluntarily consents to plugging into the patient. The only difference is one second (the time at which the child dies). So both the outcomes for the child and the tacit responsibility of the agent is identical. As a reminder, we are considering the two cases of where you plug into your infant child before he dies vs immediately after he dies.

""Tacit responsibility"" is not the same thing as ""consent."" Consent can be revoked at any time; Voluntary responsibility cannot because, well, it is a *responsibility*. Like if you sign up as a paramedic you can't just decide not to do your job because you're lazy one Saturday morning.

I'm saying that providing for a living person with the blood transfusion is ""consent,"" but creating a dependent living person and then connecting the tubes requires an unspoken ""responsibility."" Because bringing someone to life only to watch them starve is immoral, you have an *obligation* to satisfy the dependency.

&gt;But it wouldn't be an example of giving sperm cells more rights than living persons.

But it isn't a right given to a sperm cell, it's a right given to *a person who is derived from a sperm cell.* *Otherwise, ejaculation would be equivalent to mass murder.*

I am not giving rights to dead bodies, I am giving rights to people who are revived from dead bodies.

&gt;doesn't matter how long, 1 day, 1 month, 1 year, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you think the doctor should not have the right to revive the patient unless he is willing to perform the blood transfusions in the future?

The time period actually matters a lot. In the case of conception/abortion, the time period is 0 since the fetus never gets the chance to have a waking moment in this world. But in your analogy with the doctor, presumably, the pleasure/util gained by the extra time the patient spends with family and friends in the real world would be worth the cost. There is a significant difference between reviving someone who will die immediately and reviving someone who will die after 10 extra years of life. Where to draw this arbitrary line is another moral question entirely, but it should be abundantly clear that the line must be above 0."	1	False

But, since the vast majority of our military spending isn't being spent on or for our military, we could easily cut it by 10 or more (some estimates would suggest we could maintain our current military superiority on 50% of our current budget).

Well, yeah, and that would be great.  I'm all for cutting the runaway military budget, perhaps reinvesting it in other areas (NSF please) or just giving tax breaks.  But it's not a feasible way to raise enough money to fund UBI.

&gt;And that's a sizable chunk right there.

If we cut it in half that's around 1,000 right there.  Poverty line is around 20,000, so we're like 5% of the way there.  That's a start, but i wouldn't say that's a ""sizeable chunk"".

&gt;Add in some tax changes (like stop subsidizing sub-standard businesses)

The largest subsidy i know of is agriculture and that's, what, 10 billion a year?  Thirty bucks per person?

&gt;some land ownership changes (seriously, why the fuck does a Church worth 80 billion dollars of profit need to be tax free and own 70% of the land in an entire state... again tax free?)

And how much taxes are you planning on getting from an 80 billion dollar business?  I'll be generous and say that that kind of tax reform will get 80 billion bucks--around $250 per person.

So we're up to less than $2,000 bucks...

&gt;And those are just a few sections I can think of off the top of my head... hell, this one just popped into mind, we can save tens of millions of dollars per year that are literally being wasted if we quit pulling that stupid drug testing for welfare programs that are becoming so popular.

Lets say you buy a $300k house and have $60k in equity in it between down payment and payments you have made (i.e you owe $240k).  There is a $500k house you want to buy.  

Case 1:  House have fallen by 33%.  You can sell your house for $200k, but will immediately have to come up with $40k out of pocket just to be able to sell the house.  That former $500k house now cost $330k, but if we say you need 10% for the  loan, you now have to come up with another $33k to move.  

So the impact of moving in this case:  You in essence pay $370k for the new house (because it cost you $40k to get out of your old home) and you needed $77k in cash to do so.

Case 2:  House prices have risen by 33%.  Your house is now worth $400k.  When you sell it, you get $160k in cash ($100k from price increase and $60k in the equity you had).  The house you want to buy now cost $666k requiring a minimum 10% down payment of $66k.  You have the choice of either pocketing the other $100k (hopefully to invest) or you could put it towards your house reducing what you owe back to the original $500k.

So in the deflation case, you need $77k out of pocket to move (but you would get a lower monthly payment).  In the inflation case, you pocket $100k from moving (but would have a higher monthly payment).  You could put that $100k towards the house to make the monthly payments much closer in cost.  

So from the pure ability to move without saving excessive amounts of cash first, you need house prices to go up.  In the deflation case, it would actually be better to be a first time home buyer than to currently own a home because you have to pay to get out of your current house.  This scenario is further amplified by the current (last decade) of record low interest rates.  

Zooming out a bit, you also have to consider what would make home prices fall.  There is the chance of a bubble (like 2008) when it is just hype and over inventory, but more generally if we look at a [chart over time](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS) we see that almost exclusively the only time house prices fall is in recessions (the grey bars on the chart).  

Which makes sense if you think about it:  if the economy is going good and most people have jobs and their pay is creeping up, the prices of houses should naturally increase (both inflation in the cost of any house and the increase in the ability of the population to buy better houses).  If the price of houses are going down, it means people are either scared to move (job uncertainty) or can't afford to pay more for a house (high unemployment, wage stagnation).

So from the macro economic perspective, falling house prices would indicate a problem with the economy."	790	False

Thinking about the classic ""white girl wearing Indian headdress"" kind of thing. Obviously this is nowhere near as bad as ICE detaining immigrants, but it's still meaningfully bad. It doesn't deserve media attention, but it does deserve someone saying something to the person. 

On harm: I like to think about the harm of such minor cultural appropriations as sort of like the harm a giant corporation does to a small artist when it takes their work without permission and uses it to promote their product. It's an asymmetric power relation in which the more powerful side gains the benefits (artistic or cultural) of the less powerful side, without reciprocity.

Before I married my wife, we discussed the topic and agreed to have a prenup made. After discussing it with a couple of different firms, it quickly became apparent that the whole exercise was going to cost the better part of 8,000 dollars. 

As I was the only partner with assets, and the only one who could expect inheritance, I had to do a cost benefit analysis:

*    Most prenups are only viable for ten years.

*    Most of a prenup's financial stipulations are unenforceable if you have children (almost certain) and she wins custody in the event of divorce (likely).

*    My wife is a Brazilian national, and her presence in the US is contingent on marriage to me until she is granted citizenship (which takes about three years). 

*    Divorcing prior to three years of marriage would make it very difficult for a partner to claim significant financial support or a large portion of your assets.

Yes and no. While the concept of magic goes back basically forever, the modern understanding of 'Witch' (largely female, clandestine spell caster) is far more recent, mostly being codified in the book 'witches' hammer' in 1486.

There where never any ties to old pagan practices, since by the late 1400s, paganism was a distant memory in most of Europe. The last of the major victories of Christianity over pagans where over three centuries earlier.

It's important to remember witches where completely fictional. The people accused where completely innocent.

It was a made up group, invented to confiscate the property of the unpopular. Therefore it was deliberately made to be as over the top evil as possible, hence the associations with satanism.

If they where an actual group of pagans, they would not need to invent anything. Heresy was a crime. 

&gt;The imagery of Satan/the devil that early Christians developed was very intentional. They wanted to convert as many pagans as possible to Christianity mostly to gain more control over kingdoms/territories and the people of those respective areas.

Christianity spread to most of western Europe during the latter days of the roman empire. There where few to no kingdoms to deal with. At first it was a religion popular among the under classes of the empire, eventually picked up by the upper classes who basically ordered everyone else to convert.

By the time the western Roman empire fell, all of the relevant bits of Europe where already almost entirely Christian.

The devil was already well established by this point.

&gt;For example: if a pagan black smith held on to his pagan beliefs, people of that society that were Christian would not do business with this particular black smith and his business and life would be destroyed. So to save *his* business he *would* likely convert to Christianity.

You should keep in mind that feudalism was much more colectivist than we are used to today. Outside of a few larger cities, you didn't really get to chose who you worked with. You where tied to the land, your lord decided who did what and what your religion was.

&gt;So the devil looks the way he does because of the pagan’s deities. The most commonly used deities to rebrand as the devil were the “Horned God” and “Pan”.

Just no. Modern depictions of the devil sometimes have goat like features, but medieval ones almost never do. There is zero link between pan and the devil, either in appearance or aspects.

And why on earth would they model their central bad guy on a minor Greek nature god?

&gt;any scenario 

But now you acknowledge exceptions:

&gt;So yeah, I didn't mention this specifically but there are plenty of extreme examples where it'd be reasonable to make an exception.

Maybe your view is more about it generally being a wrong action, but that exceptions exist? Has your view changed?

&gt;Is this New Jersey turnpike area very busy? It seems similar to I-90 in Eastern WA to me, in that yes the exits are spaced far apart, but it's also extremely easy to make lane changes without impacting traffic since it is never 'bumper to bumper' in those areas.

I can’t comment on the everyday traffic on the turnpike. However, it seems like if you had to slow down/cut in front  of a single person to make it from the wrong lane to the right lane, it would meet the situation of your OP. And I think it’s reasonable to inconvenience a single person mildly to make a turnpike exit (instead of waiting 20 miles). 

If you look at it from a utilitarian perspective, would you rather inconvenience yourself 15-20 minutes, or someone else for less than 1 minute? Do you multiple that time by the number of people in the car?

&gt; Next time, you'll remember to get in the correct lane ahead of time.

I mean if you are driving along, and a passenger (say a child) tells you they need to use a bathroom NOW, there’s no way you could have anticipated that (if they didn’t tell you earlier). Children aren’t really known for forethought, and telling them to wait another 20 min may be disastrous. Again, I can forgive people who make this decision, and don’t think it’s a virtue, but also not a morally incorrect choice.

Essentially, if a person were to go back in time and re-live a particular choice they made (or thought they made) they could not choose differently. I have read very few arguments where someone can effectively prove that they would have the ability to make different choices then the ones they already made. Basically, if all of the factors that influenced you to make a choice are held constant when you go back in time, you will make the exact choice. There's a quote that goes something like ""It takes a change to make a change.""

So, the paragraph above is me just agreeing with everything that's been said- that we are determined and have no free will. (I don't think that idea is necessarily a bad thing, but that's a different argument.) The view that OP needs to have changed is *not* related to free will, it's related to ethics/punishment. The two topics are related in that an opinion on one will affect an opinion on the other, but two people that both believe in determinism can have different ethical views. 

OP argues that people aren't responsible for their actions, which I'm going to assume means we shouldn't punish them for their actions (it's not their fault, right?). What /u/Kengede was arguing in the first post in this comment chain was that we need to pretend like people *can* control their actions in order to run a functioning society. Even if you don't believe in imprisonment (because people aren't responsible for the 'bad' stuff they do) we still have to have some form of law enforcement. To use /u/Kengede's example, a murderer might be the product of their upbringing, and using OP's line of thought they aren't responsible for their crimes (murder, whatever else they did). Even if we as a society choose not to blame the murderer, we still have to reform that person in order to ensure that they will not murder again. Perhaps the current prison systems (in the UK or America, wherever really) do not accomplish this goal of changing criminals into productive members of society. Fine, then we need to reform our punishment system. No matter what you think we should do with a murderer, I think everyone would agree that we need to do something in order for society to function (because society falls apart if there's no security of property or life a lack of  agreed upon and enforced rules).

Still using /u/Kengede's example, we may agree theoretically that a murderer is not responsible for his actions, but in practice we act like the murderer is responsible for their actions, and we take action accordingly. We may try to change the factors that influence the murderer's behavior, which coincides with our view that our actions are simply a result of our environment, but we as a society cannot choose a path of inaction, because that path leads to a dysfunctional society.

When he tells people the election is illegitimate because democrats and their dogs are voting 3x each, it means when Biden wins a large swath of the population won't accept him as a legitimate president. That has real effects.""

Now, can I take a minute to point out that [John Lewis made a very similar claim in 2016](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/01/13/politics/john-lewis-donald-trump-legitimate/index.html).  He claimed the 2016 election was not legitimate because of Russian hacking.  While Russia did intervene, that was largely in the form of releasing information.  There is no evidence they hacked enough voting booths to make Trump the winner.  John Lewis also said he was boycotting Trump's inauguration for this reason.  Furthermore, several democrats echoed Lewis' statements about the election, and a great deal more claimed they stood by him.  Not a single one condemned these remarks.  John Lewis was also a fairly well known democrat, so I suspect a lot of people heard these remarks.  I don't think large swaths of people were swayed by these remarks though.  It's not like it started this widespread movement where people questioned the legitimacy of the election.  There were some people who called the election illegitimate, but those people probably would have found some excuse for calling it illegitimate anyway.  

I think the same thing will happen if Trump loses and claims he lost simply due to voter fraud.  Most people will ignore it like they did when John Lewis said the same thing about the 2016 election.  Some will believe Trump and claim that it wasn't a fair election, but those people probably would have found some excuse anyway.  I don't think Trump will shift many people's perception on that issue.  

I should clarify that overall, I think John Lewis was a very good person.  I have tremendous respect for all the work he did fighting for civil rights in the 1960s.  I do believe, however, that he was wrong to make these comments about the election.  Everyone does something I disagree with though, and I think John Lewis is a good person. 

Now finally, you claim ""The democracy is already undermined. If the senate weren't terrified of him, or thought Pence could win an election they would have impeached him.""

Are you saying that you think that the senate thought he deserved to be impeached, but acquitted him anyway?  That isn't really true.  [There were some ok arguments put forward as to why what Trump did wasn't an impeachable offense](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/opinion/trump-impeachment-defense.html).  It was bad, what he did, but that doesn't make it impeachable.  This was likely the view help by many members of the senate."	1	False

2. I don’t really think the finances issue is really that easy. I feel like you actually need an in-depth view of what would happen if you were to split the debt up proportionally with all of the new countries. Like, do you actually have evidence that the threat of inflation and a debt crisis is all of a sudden not an issue?

3. Something like this could only become a thing if the new countries operate the same as the United States. If the states are no longer states and it’s just one individual country California would not have the ability to ban guns by itself. Creating a white ethno state would still be a problem, people of color exist in the south and I really don’t believe any country should push for genocide. Rewriting the constitution isn’t easy, so.

4. Canada is actually larger than the United States, it just has a smaller population. So are you basing it off of population or landmass? And again, you need evidence to support that smaller countries inherently do better than larger ones.

Edit:  

You commented that all 50 states are still partially controlled by the federal government. Even if the states were broken up into smaller countries there’s still no reason to suggest that the current governing model in the United States wouldn’t carry over to the smaller countries.

It's not really my intention to make a slippery slope argument, and I don't think that a 10000% meat tax is a plausible consequence of a soda tax, but I want to point out the logical problems with supporting a regressive tax to limit consumption of ""things we don't think are good.""

If you're a politician with 10% or 15% of the vote, and the candidate who would best beat you in a head-to-head is the Condorcet winner, then I'd expect that your voters would want you to give your votes to that Condorcet winner by a majority margin, putting political pressure on you to do so.)

But if capitalism is the specific system of free markets, ownership of land and production by individuals, and potential ownership of private (as opposed to personal) property, capitalism is no more ""the"" natural state of humanity than any other economic system.

You're basically treating capitalism as ""existence of markets or trade.""  But the technical definition even at a cursory level involves private ownership of those markets and industries.

So, for example, the existence of trade in hunter/gatherer societies would not really be capitalism because there was no private ownership of the land/animals/whatever which people used to create their tradeable goods.

The gold and salt mines of Mansa Musa were not capitalist (despite there being a *huge* market for it), since they were state owned and operated.

&gt;The silk road that crossed Eurasia was essentially a free market

The market for sale?  Potentially (though you seem to be underestimating just how much restriction on trade was instituted at various times) but you're ignoring that the actual silk production was wholly state-run and considered a national security secret.

Under your definition, communism (which still involves the trade of personal property, and even markets for goods produced under publicly-owned means of production) is still capitalism.  At which point the term capitalism just describes the existence of trade, rather than anything more specific about the nature of ownership which is the definition of capitalism.

Capitalism isn't about whether good produced in a factory are sold, it's about who owns the factory."	206	False

The patients were incredible pain, and the doctor told them that if they started taking these legal drugs, then the pain would go away, and there would be no addiction.

In 50 years, Russia went from being a powerful European state, nearly collapsing due to internal and external pressure, changing its entire societal structure completely, twice, and then becoming one of only two world superpowers that controlled half of Europe.

I'm of course talking about years 1900-1950, when Russia lost a war against Japan, lost a war against Germany, had two successful revolutions and a civil war and a few genocides, won a war against Germany the second time, and then conquered whole of Eastern Europe while at it.

Fifty years ago in Europe, we had hippies. Beatles was still existing. Colour TV was a new thing.

There's no reason one cannot both invest in some things, and donate to other projects.  Note also that investment doesn't by itself generally actually increase by much the amount of new carbon neutral power made- that would happen primarily if no one else was going to invest in the way you invested, otherwise the marginal difference is small.

Everybody Solar works by buying solar panels for non-profits; this has included museums and homeless shelters. So if one thinks money should go to homeless shelters, then Everybody Solar is actually a great option. In general, donating to cancer research is a terrible way of donating that has any substantial effect; the marginal number of lives saved per more cancer research is tiny because we have so much money going towards it now (and if you believed in the same logic about investing in power and not donating here you could just invest in pharmaceutical companies but apparently you don't).

I have to start up by saying, yes, it is Android fandom/bandwagon. I'd disagree with the term circlejerk because I don't really get off when someone says they like android as much as I get upset when someone claims the iPhone is a superior product. 

&gt;the many commenters on YouTube

Almost all YouTube comments I see are intentional trolls or people trying to sound witty, I may be wrong if you're looking at very small channels, but YouTube comment section is not a good place to find discussion. Reddit frontpage isn't either (albeit slightly better than YT). 

&gt; CoD and BF

It's a bit different here with iPhone vs ""Android"" because iOS is exclusive to the iPhone whereas Android phones have multiple manufacturers. There are internal discussions to be had within what you believe is a group of ""circlejerkers"" as to whether the Galaxy is better than the Xperia, for example. iPhone ""fanboys"" are always spoonfed the next iteration and have no CHOICE in what they want, this is upsetting to me, this is why I personally use Android and get upset when people defend iPhone. 

----

That's a little preface up there; but to get to the point - 

iPhone ""fanboys"" blindly follow their brand regardless of what Apple does to them. They're usually paying for brand name as opposed to quality/power. $749 is the price of the phone if you do not have an upgrade or a new contract. That's about the same approx cost as the Sony Xperia Z3. Let us compare the phones to see what you get. 

**Camera**  
iPhone 6p - 8 MP / 1.2 MP (Front)  
Z3 - 20.7 MP / 2.2 MP (Front)  

**Battery**  
iPhone 6p - 2,915mAh ""Non-removable Li-Po battery"" (unsure, had to google, wasn't listed on GSMArena)   
Z3 - Non-removable Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery

**Processor**  
iPhone 6p - Dual-core 1.4 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based)  
Z3 - Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400  

**RAM**  
iPhone 6p - 2GB  
Z3 - 3GB  

**Screen**  
iPhone 6p - 5.5"" multitouch 16M colors 1080p  
Z3 - 5.2"" multitouch 16M colors 1080p  

**Storage**
iPhone 6p - 16/64/128 GB with no expansion.   
Z3 - 16/32 GB with MicroSD expansion up to 128GB  

**Alerts/Ringtones**  
iPhone 6p - Vibration, proprietary ringtones  
Z3 - Vibration, mp3 ringtones  

There are other features which differ, such as the Z3 supporting Java while iPhones don't but that stops being major selling points. One ""major"" one for me is how data is transferred. I used to have an iPod and having to use iTunes to add new songs is WAY more annoying than just dragging and dropping into my music folder. That is personal preference, and I can see how some users may find iTunes to be a GOOD thing. 

I was getting all of my specs from here:[ iPhone 6 Plus](http://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_6_plus-6665.php) / [Xperia Z3](http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z3-6539.php) and the ""Popularity"" and ""Voting Results"" show what I mean. iPhones are brand name products which are sold for ""status"". It's not like I was comparing the iPhone to a ""cheap"" alternative either. Sony is notoriously expensive for their TVs, Phones, and such too. It's a brand-name within the ""android side"" so to speak, but it's also forced to compete with other Android devices, and cannot cut too many corners. 

[This video](http://youtu.be/ZsxQxS0AdBY) of Beats by Dre (which was on Reddit maybe like last week) explains how iPhones (beats) are versus say, the Xperia line (audio technicas).

---

So to re-iterate my point. The iPhone ""Fanboys"" are always defending their phone like it's an amazing piece of technology, that is where the problems lie. It's not, it's a very sub-par piece of technology filled with proprietary requirements (like their charger, and iTunes). It should be seen as a ""brand name"" phone. It's a fashion accessory which you show off to people who don't know anything other than what advertising has forced down their throats. It's not ""wrong"" to go with iPhones, but it's ""wrong"" to defend the product as a superior piece of technology iPhone users say that new android phones are too big, and then they get the 6 plus and say it's ""good"" they're all over the place like politicians. I personally feel that the Android users you run into MIGHT be circlejerky at times, but overall, it's users who are knowledgeable looking at people who are ignorant (yet blissful), and those knowledgeable users are being told by said ignorant users that their advanced technology is worse than the iPhone. It's not intentionally circlejerky if the Android users are ""right"", they're not going out for upvotes or karma or whatever. They're trying to educate but they suck at educating (I know I do)."	2	False

Fortunately for us he is good, and we discern our moral compass by him. I think your position of questioning God comes from the disbelief in him existing, or at least being a good God.

This is exactly my point. You say we're fortunate that God is good since he has power over us. I agree that if he has power over us, it's better if he's good, but how do we know he's good? Many people in this thread have said that the reason God sometimes seems to do things that are wrong is that we as human beings can't fully comprehend goodness. However, if I can't comprehend goodness, how do I know I'm not worshipping a God that's evil, as you propose he isn't but could potentially be.

&gt;Why worship a God who does things that seems to some to be wrong? Because he is the judge, creator and father of his creation. What your asking is why have faith in God even though it may not be convenient, easy or you disagree. The answer is because he says so. You may not like that, but it is what he says. And IF God exists, IF God will judge you and IF he has the authority to do so, perhaps it is time to seek out more information about what he will judge you by.

Except I wouldn't want to worship an evil god. If I lived under a ruthless and evil dictator, should I obey him just because he has full power over me? I think not. That may have awful consequences, but that doesn't make it wrong to disobey. Even if the dictator says he gets to define what's right because he can enforce it, he doesn't. Some things are objectively right or wrong. Why should that not also be true with God?"	1	False

You can get pneumonia without getting the flu - it's any sort of inflammation of the tiny air sacs of the lungs. Mustard gas does this, as does excessively dry air, irritants, allergens or simply weird chemical reactions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia

I know someone that had it after having gotten over the flu as an infant - they had no fever (at the time, they got over it), but they nearly drowned in their own pus just the same.

&gt;I never said that at all.

You were the one that used the word 'hypocrite'. As soon as you say that word, you get all of the baggage that comes along with it.

I'm assuming that you don't see it that way. I think you see your argument as being particularly narrow:

1) Someone says anti-vaxxers are bad for weakening herd immunity.

2) Same person doesn't get vaccinated.

3) Same person is a ***hypocrite***.

However, it's that word that's an issue. It's incredibly loaded.

Idiot? Sure. 

Ignorant? Definitely.

Apathetic? Almost completely.

Lazy? No problem with that assertion.

But ***hypocritical***?

There are grades of argumentation and words have meaning. Calling someone a hypocrite is a logically higher bar than calling someone an idiot - you're not just arguing that they have an opinion on something, but their behavior is in direct contrast to their opinion.

Many, particularly myself, believe that as soon as you use the word ""hypocrite"", you're putting a ridiculously high burden of proof on yourself to prove the person's behavior is one thing that is in meaningful contrast to their opinion.

Particularly once you start to consider what someone *could* do as part of their behavior. "	3	False

I've performed self-sabotaging actions that screwed up my academic and family life for several years, fully cognizant of the wrongness of my actions and despising myself for it. In this scenario, I knew that pursuing my only happiness was wrong, but simply did not care. While my punishments were pretty crummy, those I've offended have never responded by dunking me in boiling oil for the rest of eternity. They  still made a human response to a human action. 

So, rather than a loving father, God becomes a more judgy version of Cthulhu. Unknowable, but with a vicious morality and the capacity to cause infinite pain. 

At that point, I'd argue that we step beyond the realm of ""reprehensible"" and into a realm that I'd say is beyond good and evil, but in a ""gun-to-my-head-I'd-say-'evil'"" manner. I wouldn't say that Cthulhu was reprehensible, but I'm certainly glad that his eponymous story ends with him being struck down by a boat. I would argue that this turns God not into a reprehensible entity in the same way that a murderer is reprehensible to me, but more in a manner that cancer or smallpox is reprehensible to a caveman. Unknowable, horrifying, and, in some manner, evil. 

Alternatively, we end up with the small-minded narcissist from Preacher. An infinitely powerful and intelligent entity, but one that still throws a tantrum like a 5-year-old at the slightest provocation.

Basic summary is a student was expelled from his college for posts he made on Facebook that made other students uncomfortable. He sued, citing his 1st amendment rights, and lost. They sought an appeal at SCOTUS but were denied. So, given SCOTUS' reluctance to hear the case, it's established law that a public college can expel students for comments they make on Facebook that make other students uncomfortable. It's not a stretch to then say that racist comments made on whatever social media this woman used can also result in expulsion without a violation of the 1st amendment.

In Nordic countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Norway, we try to accommodate (mostly) Muslim immigrants. I can agree with you, that most of OUR immigrants are regular people who left their homecountry to escape concepts such as Sharia law. Unfortunately, unlike the US, we have a tendency to be extremely lenient regarding crime stemming from social housing projects where most of the inhabitants happen to be of Muslim descent. 

We fine criminals for beating people up. In Denmark, rape gets you 3-4 years, same goes for murder (believe it or not, that's not exaggerating, a guy got out of prison after 1½ years for beating a stranger to death in Copenhagen). Our politicians don't like to talk about the fact that most violent crime is caused by immigrant gangs, and throwing people out is appearantly not an option. This neglect is especially a big problem in Sweden.

I've been spit on twice and I've had my life threatened several times for no other reason that I was white and happened to be in an area with a lot of immigrants. Several of my friends have been beaten up for no reason (not a mugging), and the courts don't hit down hard on this type of crime.

Since lawmakers don't really want to speak on the subject, people are starting to get frustrated. The thing is, regular immigrants are just looked at as regular people. It's the bad apples that stand out and ruin it for the rest of them. I believe that the deeds of a few Muslim immigrants are the cause of increasing racism in some social circles, too.

I realize that OP is upset about the cultural change, and while I only partially agree with him, I think that the criminal effect that immigration has on Nordic countries is what upsets most people. 

So that's where our situation differs from the US'. In the US, it's ""work hard and play by the rules or get out"".

Well then what is the goal of transition?  What is the end goal of the LGBT movement as a whole?

I mean to that all I can say is if it ain't broke, why the hell ""fix"" it?

Not to mention that's essentially the same thing as telling me that gender doesn't exist at all, in which case is telling me that transgender, agender, gender fluid, etc. all don't exist and that only agender exists.  By those standards, theoretically, humankind should be able to [sexually &amp; socially] adapt quite easily to the removal of all genitals at birth and the reproduction of babies purely through scientific means, that genitals literally mean nothing but aesthetics and sexual pleasure now that we have the means of reproduction without them.  I draw this conclusion on the basis that you're implying that both biological sex and gender is nurture, and that if we were to collectively stop gendering people at birth, the reality of a gender-less world could exist.  I know that's a rather extreme conclusion to draw, but can you please explain to me why it's incorrect if it is?  If it's not incorrect, I'm sorry but that pertains to the discussion that transgender does not exist, and that's off-topic from the discussion I'm trying to have.  What I'm trying to figure out is how transgender could exist simultaneously with all/some non-binary genders.  I'm going to have to ask you politely to either explain why transgender does exist in this equation, or to not further that side of discussion at all.  Thanks for understanding

""There's evidence of a third gender in many native american tribes,""

Are you referring to Two Spirit?  Because Two Spirit is just the transgender experience made spiritual, and is just stating that because I am a transman, I have experienced life through a woman's eyes and have some sort of innate spiritual wisdom in regards to both the male and and female experience that cis people just don't have.  It is not, at the core, it's own gender identity entirely.

""pseudo-non-binary, pseudo-trans gender""

Pseudo as in ""not genuine"" you mean?  I was really hoping for stronger evidence than that.  I'd go through the other cultures in the source link but I don't want to waste your time if you get the point.  I can if you'd like me to, though, just let me know if that would help c:

""I also think its important to note that not all transgender people are trans-sexual. Some identify as the opposite gender but are perfectly content in their current body without modification.""

I get that.  I'm one of those transpeople, at least when it comes to bottom surgery as it is now.  You really have to keep in mind the reasons for this though; it's not necessarily ""I would rather have a vagina and identify as male"" but rather ""the surgical option to turn my vagina into a penis is less favorable to me than just keeping my penis now, since technology isn't perfect."" (or penis to vagina in a transwoman's case).  So I really don't think it's appropriate to assume that a lack of desire to go under the knife suddenly means that someone wouldn't rather be born with/given the correct genitals provided a less dangerous/scary and equally practical means was offered (i.e. a hypothetical ""magic cis pill"" that makes a trans person's body correlate with their gender identity).  This is a pretty loaded response, honestly.

""There are a lot of people who present in nonbinary ways.""

I'll have to give the list a look-see, thank you c:  I can't say that simply seeing this has changed my mind, but it's interesting to see it like this.  Part of the problem that I have with this list is that, and mind you this is at a glance, none of these people have done anything or have expressed a desire to do anything to their physical bodies to express this non-binary gender, which would convince me far more that this is a very valid experience (i.e. getting a surgery or at least seeking a surgical option to be more genitally ambiguous, to appear genderless, etc.).  The things they appear to have done are all fashion-based, purely ""trendy"" and can be taken off at any given time.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, however!

Also I can't help but notice that I don't see any older celebs?  Celebs from the early 80's, or pop culture icons from even earlier?  These are all just recent people.  Is this just an incomplete list?  If it is, can you give me some people that aren't on the list that are much older?"	1	False

Someone who intends to use the animal as feed/bait presumably doesn't care much about its pedigree or socialization, so they would buy at the minimum price. Someone looking for a pet might care about those things so would be willing to pay a little more for an animal who has already lived with humans. From this perspective, re-homing fees wouldn't reduce the abuse of animals in general, but they would be effective for ensuring that particular animal is not abused, which is often what the owners care the most about.	1	False

While poly relationships are a-ok, there are more problems to consider than for an issue like legalising homosexuality, for instance, and it's not just hard. It is *impossible* with the current legal framework. An acceptable alternative is not possible either, with our current conception of property rights.
The reasons polygamy is not legal are many and complex, but I'll give you a few basic examples of the incredible difficulty with legalising it. It is far more complicated than merely 'consenting adults should be able to do what they want.' That argument may work for gay marriage, but it does not work for polygamy.
The reason gay marriage is totally unlike polygamy is that it, like heterosexual marriage, is between two people. Marriage is a complex web of legal obligations and rights. Our society has, over a long period of time, developed a series of norms around this two-person union. Let's assume for a moment, that if we're talking about equal rights, polygamy applies equally to both sexes (i.e. men can have multiple wives, and women can have multiple husbands. I'll just call both forms polygamy for simplicity). The addition of other parties to the marriage contract creates issues for the following:


**Basic familial relationships and legal responsibility.**


- Let's say there's a man with three wives. Two of those wives have at least one other husband of their own. All three wives have at least one child from each husband. The additional husbands also have other wives of their own. Firstly, before reliable paternity tests, how would we, with certainty, determine the biological father of each of the children? Who will raise the children and be legally responsible for them? Will they all live in an enormous communal house? What about the wives other husbands, and their additional wives? How is custody arranged so that children grow up in a stable environment? Sure, couples can draw up a contract for this, but what happens in a breach of contract scenario? Courts will not enforce a contract where specific performance would amount to 'servitude', particularly as the court could not feasibly enforce a relationship contract day-to-day.


**Taxation, property and insurance issues:**

- Firstly, marriage generally results in shared property which is the product of the marriage, and is divided in the event of legal separation. How do we determine marital assets between a husband and wife who separate, and have other husbands and wives? What legal claim to those separate marriages have? Do husbands A and B have claim to a part of Wife W's estate when she divorces husband C? What about Husband C's other wives, Z and X? What happens to any children and their custody?


- Let's say Wife W and Husband C decide to apply for a housing loan. Turns out Wife Z of Husband C and Husband A of Wife W have substantial debts already, secured by marital assets. Are their debts assessed in determining W and C's financial position? If not, why not? As spouses, the loans are secured by their assets too.


- When calculating dependants for taxation purposes and the like, who is the legal parent of each child if there are multiple spouses? Can they co-parent, or is it similar to now, where there are two legal parents? How does that affect calculating dependents? What happens in the event of payment of a death benefit? Let's say husband C dies without a will. Wife W has two other husbands, A and B. Wife Z has one other husband, but wife X does not. Wife X did not work and was a dependant spouse. Does this affect the claims of the other wives, who have other husbands and are arguably less in need of a portion of the estate? Is it divided equally?


- Let's say you're a child of one of these marriages applying for financial aid to go to college. Your parent's financial positions are used to assess your need. How do we work out their position, when each of your parents have other spouses? So now we have to assess the assets of your mother's marriage to your father, and then any shared property from your mothers other 2 marriages, and your father's other marriage. Even if we could work out the proportions of the assets, can you imagine how expensive it would be to assess the eligibility of every student for financial aid?


- Spousal rights. [Here is a list of benefits as a spouse in the United States. It is fucking enormous.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States#Rights_and_benefits) How do we extend many of those benefits to additional spouses? Can you imagine the cost of veteran's disability if every serviceman had three or four wives and they were paid on a pro-rata basis? What about insurance? Who is the next-of-kin in an emergency situation if you have two wives and have no specified? What if they disagree on a medical course of action while you are unable to give consent?


Basically, the web of legal rights and responsibilities is already complex enough. It would be a disaster to extend it further. That doesn't mean poly relationships cannot exist. It just means the legal framework for a marriage cannot be reconciled beyond basic contractual principles. We would have to dismantle the entire socio-economic and legal fabric and replace it with a system that we cannot even conceptualise at present in order to protect everyone's rights and interests."	254	False

Assuming that all violence is necessarily unethical begs the question.

&gt;Spanking does not teach a child that their action was wrong, it teaches them that their action displeases their caregiver. A logical understanding of morality and ethics is the only thing that can teach a child what is wrong.

It can also teach them to associate negative behaviors with unwanted consequences. Not all children understand the concepts of ethics as adults usually do right away, and even some children insist on committing wrong actions even though they're perfectly knowledgeable that it's unacceptable (as even some adults do). In such cases, spanking is used to instill discipline to deter the child from the bad behavior until they can understand why it is wrong and (hopefully) choose not to do it."	0	False

Fair enough!

&gt;in the special case of a crime boss getting executed i would argue that this could have two different effects! \[...\]

A judge's sentencing decision should not depend on anything but the facts pertinent to the defendant and his own crime(s). It *certainly* should not be held hostage to threats of retaliation by other people -- this is why retaliation is taken so seriously in criminal law. If I get arrested for murder, and my wife says ""you'd better let him go, or else I'm going to murder someone too!"" you wouldn't expect the police to turn around and say ""Wow, better let him go then. She sounds serious!"" That would be a ridiculous subversion of how the system works.

So it doesn't matter what the boss' followers say or threaten to do -- they should be held accountable for their own actions, as individuals. All that should matter for determining the boss' sentence is what makes sense for the boss himself, and what sentence will yield the best outcome for him as an individual.

&gt;this goes for innocent people as well!

Yes it does, but you are reverting to your prior argument, which I addressed! I acknowledge that in some cases, there is significant risk of innocent people being sentenced to death, and IMO, we should be cautious of applying the death sentence in these scenarios. However, there are other scenarios where the risk of sentencing an innocent person are so close to zero that this risk is negligible, such as in my first example (with the cameras).

&gt;i really don't see how executing a crime boss would help reduce crime!

In the example I gave, it reduces the risk of more crime by removing the possibility that he can use his power to get his sentence shortened by criminal means in the future and then continue re-offending once free. It reduces the risk of crime *by him* as an individual.

&gt;if we keep him alive and make him cooperate with the police to bring other criminals down that are ""his enemies"" and than do the same to them and go on like this forever more crimes would be stopped and more judgement would be imparted!

But what if he doesn't cooperate? What if he'd rather try to use bribery and extortion to get his sentence reduced than act as a witness/informant for police (which could get him killed anyway)? Remember, this is a guy who committed a heinous, violent crime, threatened to do it again, shows no sign of remorse, and you're 100% sure he is guilty. In that circumstance, wouldn't it be best to sentence him to death?"	1	False

Nevertheless, just like I can't say welfare was caused by X, you also cannot claim a casual relationship. Casual relationships are extremely hard to prove in any social sciences like psychology and sociology. More importantly, I have yet to see any data supporting your claim that welfare makes people lose interest or makes them more inclined to forego a decent paying job, high school diploma, etc.

What? I never said welfare makes people lose interest or makes them more inclined to forego a decent paying job, high school diploma, etc.

Anyway, the point I'm making is that your first point that ""Welfare is not as cracked up as some people will have you believe"" is no evidence against the claim that welfare played a causal role in increased single-parent household rate. So your first point doesn't do anything to support your argument or discredit the opposing argument.

&gt; Below, you'll see two census tracts straight from the US census. These tracts cover poverty and SNAP usage.

&gt; Here is the census tract for the US snap usage, all states. https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_S2201&amp;prodType=table

&gt; Note how 12% of white Americans (28,424,685) and 26% of blacks (10,111,248).

I'm not sure what you were trying to say here.

&gt; https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF

&gt; This data shows that there are 53,460 White households using SNAPS and 110,519 Black households.

Ummm...what? The link does not show that. These numbers are not mentioned anywhere in the chart you linked. It says that there are 8,401,788 White households using food stamps/SNAPS compared to 3,710,380 Black households. I'm not sure where these numbers are coming from.

&gt; As we saw in the previous data, there are more blacks in poverty,

Wait...what? You didn't post any data showing that.

&gt; so the higher black household SNAP number makes sense; however, the higher black usage by household is not greater than the difference between blacks in poverty and whites in poverty (2.8). The ratio between blacks and whites using SNAP is only 2.0. This data suggests that being white makes a person more likely to use SNAP than black culture/blackness. Or if nothing else, refutes your previous hypothesis (or the OP, I forget) regarding race and welfare usage.

Given that none of the numbers you mentioned could be found in the links you gave, I'm just going to ignore this for now.

&gt; When did I ever say ""this proves""? In fact, I never even claimed ""this is a casual relationship"" between X and Y. I've said it is ""very likely"" or correlates. 

You said ""The result of such policing tactics? ohh yea lots of black men being arrested and a lot of single mothers."" This is a causal claim, and it suffers from the very fallacy you accused the OP of comitting. Saying Y is the result of X is to say that X caused Y.


&gt; Considering the high incarceration rate of black men (1/3 at a period in time), it is very likely that there were fathers arrested.

(1) The 1/3 figure is based on data from the [early 2000s](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf), when violent crime was much higher. [Crime](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm) has decreased dramatically since then. So the 1/3 figure is no longer accurate. (2) Only [16% of Blacks](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p14.pdf) are in state prisons are incarcerated because of drug offenses. Less than 4% are due to mere possession (see Appendix Table 4). Any causal relation between drug arrests and single-parent households would be minor, at best.

&gt; Lastly, If you're gonna Nirvana fallacy me and say ""hey, there is always the possibility that Y caused it and not X,"" I'll never be able to counter your points because NO social issue can be explicitly proven by data. All we can do is provide data and sources that support are hypothesis. You've even admitted that my data regarding crime supports my argument, however you argue that it is not prove a casual relationship and is therefore invalid or less invalid.

I'm using the same standards of criticism that you levied against the OP. If the ""correlation =/= causation"" response is appropriate against the OP, then it's just as appropriate against your argument. If you want to argue about which data best supports which hypothesis, then we can do that too.

And I frankly do not see how you can advocate research like the medical type, be an exception when technological research as a whole hinges so much on anything that relies on electricity and engineering.

The earliest technology mankind had, was fire. Mankind could just have stuck to hunting and such, but we didn't. We couldn't. We realized how technology does indeed make life better.

&gt; And if you can give me one example how better smartphones or faster internet or faster cars s helping hungry children in America,Africa 

Information is more available than ever before. Sure, you may have to filter biased sources and etc., but it is easy to find contradicting views and sources with credibility. You can teach yourself a lot of things just because of the internet. A rich entrepreneur who has lived only within his own bubble, may be touched by a story he reads on some random newspaper. Knowing humanity, you can't expect this to happen at any notably high rate, but it does happen nonetheless.

Knowledge of what happens around the world, compels plenty of people to donate to good causes. The internet's single powerful uses are search and distribution of information. Have you considered just how important the internet is, for exchange of ideas and innovation?

I don't know to what extent you would consider technology to be sufficiently developed, but that discussion is one of arbitrary arguments. Agriculture now is far better than it was 100 years ago. Technological progress is a direct result of scientific research (through engineering), and it in turn enhances scientific research, most notably through superior instruments being developed.

Arguments against technological progress is just backwards. No technological stage in human history is particularly satisfying compared to what we have now (who would want to live 100 years in the past? I doubt people would want to throw away their smartphones now that they're used to them; pretty sure non-physical work is often preferred over physical, not to mention the ease of travel and communication nowadays), and anything post-industrial age is known to be unsustainable. Our very own age is inherently unsustainable.

When we use it, we revert to purely instinct and emotion-based reasoning, doing things just because they feel good (i.e. overeating, indulging in too much internet activity/video games, failing to stop destroying the environment because that would mean we'd be inconvenienced personally). The decision doesn't even go through the conscious process.

While you are correct about the fact that we tend not to apply objective reasoning to the consumption of technological products and services, I would challenge your assumption that this behavior is hard-coded. I think you may be assuming this behavior is fundamental to our biology rather than a consequence of our culture. Consider overeating for an example. People will readily consume more calories than they ought to, and even more than they know they ought to.  But that is driven at least in substantial part by the efforts of effective product marketing, intentionally addictive food additives, and an economic system that actively incentives this sort of psychological exploitation of customers.

In fact, I would contend that most of the examples you’re pointing out here are actually caused more by cultural features like capitalism or top-down hierarchies more than they are caused by our actual biology. Humans are capable of applying reason in most situations if they’re trained to do so. Our failure to engage in that training—in fact our active exploitation of these features of human psychology to increase consumption for profit—is more of a cultural issue than a biological issue.

Our ability to apply reason to develop these technologies and processes means we’re biologically capable of applying reason to basically any problem we choose. But most people have been culturally tuned not to apply their reason to anything but what their employer tells them to apply it to—and to actively turn their reason off when it comes to things like consuming products, following religions, voting for politicians, etc. 

We can actually address cultural issues more easily than we can address biological issues."	6	False

It’s a racist word, it has a racist history and it’s highly offensive. As faggot would be to LGBTQ+ (some are also claiming to reclaim this word as it fees empowering). When black communities use the term they are taking charge of a derogatory slur to change it’s meaning. You can see it in some feminist movements with the word “slut”, for instance. When
 you take a word that was used for centuries to make people like you feel inferior and use it like it’s nothing it turns into a shield, the meaning of the word is changed as you take control of it, so it’s traumatic aspects begin to fade. Regardless, racism is real and ever present. People from other races have no trauma coming from the n word and have no historical (non racist) reasons to use it. A lot of white people still use that word as an offense, it still has a bad connotation that’s quite present in our daily lives. 
I believe you cannot think in utopias. The word is not and should not be colorblind, because you have to give different treatment to people to asses their different needs. It’s just like the confusion around feminism: Women have different bodies, brains, hormones. We are different. We have to be treated different to have the same opportunities. That’s why there’s female and male football teams, for instance. That does not mean we should be treated as inferior people, it just means nature made us different and society has to act to made the world equal despite that. 
So, the thing is, white people have different backgrounds than black people, they were not raised saying this word with a good meaning (actually, the opposite is true), and have no reason to use as a form of empowerment. When you say it you brand yourself as a racist because:
1. Either you use with the pure intention of it being a racial slur, something that to this day is used to make say black people are less than human
2. You have heard POC’s opinions about the word, what is means to them. They have repeatedly said it is offensive to use it as a white person, even if you hear POC saying it, and you refused to listen. It’s a simple and unnecessary disregard to such a historically charged conflict, which implies that you, being on the opressor’s side, disregards the oppressed’s  opinion on something that should be their decision as it is their history, their suffering."	3	False

I'm not going to say there aren't any inequities that need to be hammered out, because as a historically gendered institution, there are still remnants of that, plenty of which affect men.  But, on the whole, today, we treat marriage as a community of interests, and this means risk for everybody in an incredibly deferential court situation *if* you even end up going to court at all.

I'm not going to dive into specifics further than that because it's so jurisdiction specific, and I've had the conversation so many times, that I'm not terribly interested in having it again.  I'm pointing it out simply because, while marriage can certainly be an intimidating leap, I don't think there's any reason to be 'terrified' of it for legal reasons, especially when a lot of comments about those bad situations are blatant karma-whorings playing off of reddit's self-cultivated fears.

I generally used to think that the sole reason to get married was for tax benefits.  I'll get to those more specifically later, but my experience  in law thus far has changed my mind.  I suppose it helps that I've gotten older and found someone with whom I can see myself spending the rest of my life, but I'll try to keep that bias to a minimum.

The primary benefit of getting married is *control* over the contours of your relationship and the rights associated with it.  Marriage creates various presumptions:

- If you die without a will, your wife gets your stuff and vice versa under standard intestacy statutes.

- In many states, a child born in wedlock is presumptively the husband's.  I know reddit frets over paternity but there are actually many men out there who would like to have a role in their children's lives and this presumption makes it easier for married men.  Obviously there are wrinkles in this for men who father the children of a married woman but that's a whole separate discussion.

- If you are seriously injured and in the hospital, your spouse has presumptive visitation rights and is typically the person they will defer to for decision-making without any other legal document to override that presumption.  Without properly executed healthcare proxies, durable powers of attorney, or whatever other documents might suit your situation, your girlfriend's wishes will probably be overridden by your next-of-kin.  We saw (and still see) this happen all the time with unmarried gay couples.

- One can avail himself to a prenup.  Again, I know everybody likes to think these don't work, and they're more malleable than your standard contract because they're not really arms-length deals, but usually so long as you follow the rules (ex. no duress, both represented by lawyers, etc), they are mostly enforceable, particularly the economic clauses.  Even if a condition changes so substantially as to render enforcement of that clause unenforceable, it will usually only void that single clause.  One of the prenups I drafted controlled everything from waiving ERISA benefits to passively and actively earned income on trust assets inherited by one spouse to what constituted marital property when moving across states.  Finally, even if we assume the worst case scenario, prenups at least have the advantage of memorializing the intent of the parties at the outset of marriage, before things go sour, which is presumably when its enforcement would kick in, if it goes sour at all.

- A lot of people enter into cohabitation with the intent to keep everything separate so that, in the event of a break-up, it's easy to split without concern about losing assets.  However, in my experience, as time moves on, cohabiting often end up commingling assets as a matter of course.  Sometimes we run into issues of joint bank accounts, where people will actually have a legal right to what's in the account, and sometimes it just becomes this fact-specific interrogation as to who bought what and when.  Realistically, cohabitation is almost never as neat as the cohabitors intend it to be in the outset, and because we very rarely see couples availing themselves to the documents mentioned in this post, it can get just as messy - if not messier - as a divorce, particularly if there are children involved.

- As has been mentioned, marital status is one of *the biggest* vehicles in estate planning.  The marital deduction is huge.  Gifts between spouses are given preferential gift and estate tax treatment.  Your exemptions for both of those double.  The list goes on.

- There are some testimonial [privileges](http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyx9kowUbA1qcm16uo1_500.jpg) that apply to married couples, though ideally this [won't carry much weight](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyx9kowUbA1qcm16uo2_500.jpg) because I'd like to think you're not looking to do anything that will end with you in court.

- Many of the above problems can be mitigated by executing separate legal documents.  You can assert paternity rights without getting married.  You can create a will without getting married.  You can create a healthcare proxy without getting married.  You can have an advantageous estate plan without getting married, even if you can't take advantage of things like the marital deduction which give you an outrageous advantage over unmarried couples.  You can create a cohabitation agreement (like a prenup without the 'nup') without getting married.  But it becomes very costly to create executing legal documents for every possible contingency, and even harder to anticipate which contingencies will occur in the first place.  There are literally [1,000s of rights](http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf) associated with marital status at the federal level alone and it's a huge logistical and financial pain in the butt to try and micromanage and coordinate them.

- The landscape of the law is changing.  We're seeing cohabitation happening *a lot* and, because of that, the courts are trying to address them in an equitable fashion, particularly ending a long-term cohabitation.  Palimony, for example, is available in California, and while it's not near majority rule yet, with the increasing amount of people cohabiting, it's entirely possible that palimony can become 'a thing' down the road.  It's not just young people, either.  Lots of seniors live together after their first spouses die.  With broad swaths of the population opting not to get married, we're seeing a gradual shift towards giving partners a sort of 'quasi-right' to the things traditionally reserved for married couples.  I don't want to overemphasize this because the change is slow, but I think we'll see some shift in our lifetimes and it's worth bearing in mind when making long-term plans.

- Finally, speaking of super old people, married couples get benefits from Social Security and pension plans under ERISA (which you can opt out of at age 35 and put into a prenup -- see how specific they can be?)  The longer you're married, the more beneficial they tend to be, but they often have a threshold length of marriage before you qualify.  To maximize your collection, with come caveats, it can be advantageous to get married sooner rather than later.

**tl;dr:**  Getting married gives you a lot more control over your situation, your financials, and rights commonly associated with marriage and families (even if you don't actually intend to start a family.)  In contrast, we're in a changing landscape with growing cohabitation, where you sort of have this tension between courts wanting to impose marriage-like rights and responsibilities on couples but the tedious and costly process of having to execute a plethora of legal documents to come close to the scheme that marriage presumptively creates and can later be tailored to your situation.  This might not be enough to tip the scale for you, personally, but I think it shows why there are plenty of good reasons for people (including men-people) in Western society to *consider* tying the knot, as opposed to 'not many' good reasons.

Furthermore, I would imagine the costs of enforcing such a system would outweigh the gains.

I prefer to solve these kind of problems in a different way. Rather than the carrot or the stick method, why don't you try and make good behavior easier on people. For example: rather than mandating that everyone stop eating fast food, why not work with food producers to lower the cost of healthy food. In the United States obesity is largely a poverty issue: it's way cheaper and quicker to feed a family of 5 at McDonalds than it is to cook up three square healthy meals a day. So rather than punishing people who don't have the time and resources to maintain a healthy lifestyle, why not make a healthy lifestyle more readily achievable. The government could invest (more) in public fitness centers where people can go an work out for free.

While there will still always be people who mooch off the system and make poor decisions, I find it more effective to either reward good behavior or make good behavior easier to carry out.

I could go with the axiom that the world is NOT worth living for, and that everything needs to be destroyed. Is there a reason why rationally that is not a good axiom, or that the axiom that life's worth living and we should protect it?

Well technically speaking. Axioms are atomic statements that cannot be further divided. Things like ""I think therefore I'm"", ""1 is a natural number, etc...""

But not to be a dick and dodge your question. Let's say ""The world is not worth living for, and needs to be destroyed"" is yours  axiom.

Okay then. Let's go to step 2 and compare it with reality. Well in reality you see that most people live, as if the world is worth living. They are not trying to destroy it at every turn. People have natural revulsion to destroying stuff, and suicide, etc...

So your axiom ""world is not worth living for"" doesn't model reality as well as the axiom ""world is worth living for"". So regardless which is true, if any. My axiom will be better at predicting reality, than yours. Or rather any rational brick I will build off that axiom, will be more useful in reality than yours. Now mind you, it doesn't speak about the truth of an axiom in any way. It merely speaks whether an axiom is useful or not.

&gt; if your axiom is reason, but how can you check that your axiom of reason is a good one without recurring to it? 

You can't. Axioms are self-evident things. A statements that are atomic, and cannot be reasoned out further, because if you tried, you would necessary had to refer to the given axiom. All you can do is check whether it being self-evident is sound.

I repeat, whether it's sound. Not whether it's true.

&gt;You could say it works, but how do you know it works? Observation is just not enough, as you need to infer(reason) something out of the observation data.

Must you? Even the simplest life forms, without any kind of brain capacity, or reason use reality to do stuff that works. Whether you like it or not. Reality is the only thing that matters to us. In very real, non-philosophical pragmatic way.

The thing is. Rationality was never meant to be infallable. The entire point of using reason, is to put a big disclaimer in front saying. Assuming this is true - This is also true.

&gt;but you could have other tools that are also a guarantee if you do some checks as you do with reason, and that can give you knowledge reason(thought of as conscious reason, the kind of reason that can be explained) alone can't.

Well we use reason, because it works when modeled on reality. Which is the only thing that matters to us. If there are other methodologies that work better, we will use those. But at this point, there simply aren't any. Modern science replaced outdated religions and philosophies for example.

&gt;I'm thinking something else: for every failure within logic that leads you to a 'wrong' conclusion under that logic, with a certain starting axiom you could have a 'right' logic that leads you to that 'wrong'(wrong under the other person's axiom and logic) conclusion, so why would something ever even be considered as wrong?

Because we as society. Decided at defining the label wrong. You really won't find here some divine reason why the things we do are considered right, while others wrong. There isn't one. Reality simply is. We a humans, live in it, and develop mechanisms for living in it. One of them is to define things as good, bad, etc....

First, I want to point out I'm talking about people who already believe that causing unnecessary suffering to dogs is bad. We could start at a baseline further back and ask if unnecessary human suffering is bad, but we don't have to, as OP's post is about people who care about dog suffering and not caring about other animals. 

&gt; but even if logic tells us that a dog suffering and a cow suffering are both bad, that logic doesn't tell us how bad, that they should be the same badness or different badness

If one came to the conclusion that causing dogs to suffer unnecessarily is bad then they would need to have a logical reason that the same does not apply to other animals. How bad does treatment have to be before it's considered wrong can be determined once we know what it is about dogs that make them wrong to hurt. 

&gt; You keep dancing around these types of questions like ""why is dog suffering bad?"" without answering them and without others answering them, and you should admit that there is no logical answer.

I'm interested in hearing the logic people use to argue that hurting dogs unnecessarily is wrong but not other animals. I want to know what trait other animals possess that makes them less morally relevant.

&gt; Weighing one moral wrong against another is an extremely personal decision that can't be gotten to through logic

Interestingly, I have a neutered male now that has started trying to have sex with everything (pillows, my legs at night, etc), but that's neither here nor there.

Unaltered male cats will try to mate with unaltered females, of course, and fight other unaltered male cats for them. The former will occur regardless, in terms of other unaltered cats that are within roaming range. The latter will, to an extent (just without your cat), but here, the argument is trickier. I would say that if your cat is fighting other unaltered male _pets_ over mates, then the owners of those pets have ""opted in"" to the possibility by not neutering their pets. If your pet is fighting other strays, those are definitely fights that wouldn't occur if the cat was neutered. I can't argue that there's more violence when a male cat goes un-neutered, and that's not great, no matter how much ""opting in"" is going on. I will have to think farther on this; will report back. This might be the demonstrable guaranteed effect of neutering that I'm looking for.

In terms of being territorial, that's is not necessarily a negative. I have had neutered cats that I can't let outside anymore, because they don't even control the territory of my back yard, and I can't be sure they won't get bullied if I'm not supervising them.

If, for example, there is robust government aid for single mothers, then clearly the government is fulfilling the role I mentioned before, stepping in where the father is absent. 

My opinion, and the opinion of many people in this thread, will be that the child's mere existence imposes a responsibility on *someone* to try to raise them well, and that generally a single parent would struggle to raise a child well. In many present societies, there isn't a robust alternative to two parents working together to raise their children; what public and communal support exists (if any) is not enough.

If, within the system you describe, no one exists to help single parents raise their children, then many people in this thread would probably say that the society is failing in its collective responsibility for these children - whether that responsibility is through community support, government programs, or forcing the absent parent to at least financially support the child.

The key is that the child's existence imposes a responsibility *on society* to at least try to raise the child well, and for now most societies primarily shift that responsibility onto the parents and then the immediate family and then the extended family of that child. As I said before, that doesn't have to be the case, but it generally is. 

It sounds like you are proposing that a parent should be able to reject the responsibility, regardless of if anyone or anything is in place to pick up that responsibility, and *that* is where I expect most of the pushback is really coming from. Without specifying what kind of society exists outside of this decision for a parent to abandon their responsibility, people will assume that you're referring to a society like the one they live in, one which probably doesn't have a real replacement for an absent parent, and therefore one where a parent not fulfilling their responsibility means that the child will necessarily be much worse off."	4	False

They aren't overworked, they aren't afraid to take vacation, and as small as it is compared to the other ones, a mid-day meal is treated as a meal and not some quick food and back to work.
&gt; 

But what do *American* workers want?

Does the American worker want more hours and more pay, because the American worker values purchasing power, or do they perhaps want those ""European"" things?

I mean, there are a lot of reasons for this statistic (geographic, political, etc.), but the average American household owns a lot more cars, more electronics, and a much bigger house and lot than the average European household.

I'd also point out that even geographically speaking, that has an influence on everything. The average European has a much easier time visiting another nation/different culture, and so a vacation-focused work policy may mean a lot more to the average European where travel costs are negligible.

Meanwhile, the average American has a much harder time traveling to another country for a vacation - for them, the *option* made by increased purchasing power to travel OR do other things is what they crave.

Even the disparity in urbanization matters.

You say the average European can go get a meal. The average European also lives in a far more dense and urban environment than the average American. Imagine a worker at a factory in a suburb or rural area - their only option might be fast food! Also, similar to in the big cities in America, the more densely populated European homes there may not have the same facilities to cook at home that a suburban house in an urban sprawl in America has - thus, *eating out* may be the *damn-near-necessary* option whereas bringing a pre-made home-cooked meal may be the *option* American workers want.

Long story short - there's a lot of cultural, geographic, political, and other factors that come into play on what the American worker *prefers* over what the average European worker does. 

Not every culture places the same value on vacation time versus the ability to buy a second car."	77	False

In all seriousness (this is not related to one or two) I am still pro choice.

I think the issue is deeper than a lot of people want to admit, and it's something that could cause a lot more damage than some states banning abortion.

The right literally hears 'child murder/infanticide'. Meanwhile, the left hears 'a somewhat normal medical procedure to remove unwanted biowaste material'. Well, you can see how those two things don't exactly line up. Yet neither side is willing to budge. 

I see the same thing on both the left and the right. A bunch of old cronies who have been in the business for too long and they need to be replaced with new blood. Primary your respresentatives.

The hypervisibility of white people and what they appropriate in a white supremacist society. Cultural appropriation seeks to change the cultural context of a piece of culture made and fostered by people of color. White people wearing headdresses not only reduces Native Americans and their culture to an article of adornment, it also changes what that article of adornment is supposed to mean to those who see it. Because of the headdress' commercialization by appropriative capitalist forces, popular culture no longer sees the Native Headdress as something to be respected and are not knowledgeable about its history; it's literally *just* another article of clothing. In terms of blackface, this is all too true. Black face was used to exclude people of African descent from participating in performing art forms that they had pioneered only to lead the way for white hypervisibility when white artists performed in blackface.

I think that makes sense of everything we're both saying, though I'm still suspecting that you mean something more impactful in saying ""judge""

Because if ""judge"" just means ""believe a negative evaluative statement"" and this includes evaluating whether they hit on the truth, your title reduces to:

""CMV: You shouldn't refrain from believing someone believes something false/wrong merely because they believe it."" 

Because if there is no ""blaming"" in that sense involved in a judgment, it's just believing the proposition *that* they are wrong. 

At least I would retain the word ""judge"" when applied to individuals to things for which they are responsible. And if you do something bad and you are responsible, then I think it is definitional that you are properly subject to blame.

So, being responsible for doing something bad =&gt; being blameworthy for doing it.

Being properly subject to judgment, when applied to individuals =&gt; the individual is responsible for what is being judged.

You can *evaluate* someone without considering responsibility, but *judgment* comes with responsibility assignment, and responsibility assignment comes with being properly subject to praise and blame.

Then if they see someone else with those features, they rank them as being more attractive. So if a woman says ""I wish I had your nose"" they are saying they find certain subjective characteristics attractive, but in an envious way. They don't want to have sex with someone with that nose, they want that nose. There was an episode of the show Friends with this idea as a plotline.

The same thing applies to men. There's an episode of Entourage where Johnny Drama wants bigger calves. So he notices it in every man he sees. This is especially the case in bodybuilding circles where men compare physical aesthetics all the time. And it's not just muscles, it can refer to any number of things from hair to eye color to even the way another man's penis looks. If a bald man wished he had hair, and appreciates a full head of hair in another man, that's not gay. If a blue eyed man is glad he doesn't have a more common eye color and appreciates it in other men too, that's not gay. If a man with a small, circumcised penis wishes he had a larger, uncircumcised penis, that's not gay. This is a common enough idea that the creators of South Park named their movie Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut (plus, they got to sneak the joke in past the censors.)

Wanting a physical feature that another man has, or appreciating that you both share a given physical feature both are ways that men rank the attractiveness of other men. Baldness, eye color, and penis size/shape are not connected to overall health. They are just some subjective features that men appreciate in other men, along with many others. It ties back to one of the oldest descriptions of James Bond: ""Every man wants to be James Bond and every woman wants to be with him."" It wasn't that men wanted to be with him.

Taken to the extreme, these preferences cause a lot of problems. Women become anorexic trying to look like fashion models. Men start doing steroids to build muscles like actors and bodybuilders. Older people get plastic surgery to look younger. Racial minorities change their hair or lighten their skin to look more like white women. Aesthetic preferences are tied to culture as much as they are to instincts or sexuality. 

Ultimately, I don't think that men having aesthetic preferences in other men is necessarily a symbol of latent homosexual attraction. If there is truth to the idea that everyone is a little bit gay, it has to be related to the desire to have sex with another man, not just an appreciation for a given physical characteristic."	1	False

If you have a rad cool new idea, and work on developing it, you should be able to reap the rewards. And society benefits from that system.

If every billion dollar company could mass-produce every unique invention or idea someone had, then people wouldn't put time or effort into the idea.

Patents take a long time to get approved, but patent-pending shares roughly the same purpose.

Patents, in their 20 year lifetime, are almost always used if their patented use is practical. If you're an inventor that has a grass roots new idea, you'll develop it. If not, you'll sell it to a bigger company and cash out. This simultaneously encourages innovation and allows big companies to expand and develop on patented ideas like you say. There are some rare exceptions where people take out a patent and then do literally nothing with it, but that's about as common as people making millions of dollars and burying it in their coffin.

Open sourcing is a route that people take, but it shouldn't be a requirement. Only allowing a narrow, less monetizable route, offers less incentive for innovation.

What really slows down technological process is to remove incentives for new innovative ideas. If any new idea that you worked out and implemented wasn't really yours, you wouldn't take the effort.

You are absolutely right about anti-Americanism among the people of Palestine, but the general public doesn't sit at the negotiating table, their representatives/leaders do, and this is not always a bad thing. Public opinion is sometimes ignorant and always fickle, and can be quite counter-productive when trying to come to some agreement. A politician's job is to walk the fine line between *representing* their people and *doing what they think gets the actual best outcome* for them. (Sometimes they really suck balls at their job, but that's beside the point)

For the last few decades, presidential administrations have decided that the practical considerations for the peace process should outweigh the ideological views of the general public, and it's hard to find fault in their reasoning. Without these compromises, the US may no longer be seen as an acceptable mediator - and if that happens, negotiations may end completely. There is no other mediator waiting in the wings to take over. The votes in congress may have *some* meaningful impact on *some* foreign policy, but they are largely token measures to ensure Americans that yes, we are still allies with Israel. If we're going to get anything done, our diplomats have to check those considerations at the door. 

This simple fact explains a lot about the current uproar over Trump's decision. The bottom line is that it is a big hunk of red meat for his American voting base, and Israeli conservatives love it... but those are ideological and political gains which are very likely to send the peace process *backwards* not forwards."	21	False

I'm not looking for relatable.  I don't have issues relating to intelligence squared.  I'm looking for informative.

And there has been no movement to get rid of it. Why would it change if nobody is interested in changing it. The people are capable of changing the system, regardless of whether they do or not, it conforms to democratic principles.  

 &gt;The Philippines, Monroe Doctrine, Panama Canal, Afghanistan, Iraq...

The phillipines were part of a peace treaty and then released. 

As for the Panama canal, are you suggesting that the United States' support for an independence movement was imperialistic? 

Neither Afghanistan or Iraq are US colonies and troops are there with the permission of the current regimes. 

&gt;The Monroe doctrine was imperialistic because it essentially claimed the Americas as United States territory, although we did not take control of the governments.

No it didn't. It claimed the Americas as the US sphere of influence, to say it claimed the Americas as US territory is asinine to say the least. 

&gt;Most Latin American countries today look upon the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine with great anger.

Look up the good neighbor policy.

Your definition of imperialism is so broad it includes pretty much any diplomacy between two countries where there is not equal leverage. The Philippines are the only evidence provided that indicate any sort of imperialism and even then, show no wide US support for imperialist ideals or that the US engaged in widespread imperialism. 

&gt;My point is that if the United States lost its role as top dog in the world, it would turn more internal and probably would see rapid and great change to the government.

Except that you keep changing this claim and with each new claim comes with less and less evidence. First it was the US would have suffered a coup if not for Americans believing that American is the leader of the world, then it was that the government would have changed a lot in the past century if not for this view, now it is if the US falls as a superpower, there will be a great and rapid change internally (Whatever that means).

For that, I must explain why morality exists. When we humans stopped hunting and gathering and decided to  farm and settle in one place, we became a society. There were things we didn’t want like murder, because it is detrimental. 

But animals are not part of society, so they don’t get a say in how we treat them. It benefits us humans to think of animals as resources that don’t have rights, so we can utilize them to our maximum benefit. Humans conquered the planet with their superior intelligence and technology, we can now use our dominance over nature to our benefit.

Most morality comes from emotion, which is not logic and facts, so we should only have morals justified logically. I do have logical arguments for why humans have rights (ask me and I will explain). There are no logical arguments for why animals have rights. Factory farming is the most efficient way to produce meat. It makes meat affordable to the masses. The greatest economic benefit comes from treating our animals like inanimate objects.

I told my first two girlfriends that I loved them within the first couple weeks of dating.

After my second relationship ended (2.5 years), I realized I'd been unhappy since about the 6 month mark. I had noticed problems, tried to address them, and then kept thinking ""If I feel this same way in a few months, we should break up.""

Finally I realized that I'd been thinking those things for years and nothing had changed, even with me bringing up those same issues over and over.

Now I approach relationships entirely differently.

I first look for someone I want to keep going on dates with. Not a girlfriend, but someone I enjoy hanging out with every week or two.

If that works, I see if I want to incorporate them into my life, introduce them to my friends and such.

If that goes well, then I move towards more serious things.

Since that bad breakup, I've seen maybe 15-20 girls. Most have only been a date or two, a couple have lasted a few months, but never met my friends.

Now I've finally found someone I've been with for over a year. If I had the pressure to make sure it was true love or a ""real relationship"" from the beginning, I don't think it would have worked.

Instead we built trust over time, started officially dating after four months, and have slowly become more a part of each other's lives.

I have no fear now that it will end because I know that we both have wanted to be in each stage of the relationship so far.

If it ends, which seems statistically likely to happen at some point, I know it will be because our priorities changed and we want different things.

Sure, it would be heartbreaking, but I'd rather find a relationship with a new person who wants to be with me than stay in a relationship with someone who is losing interest."	1	False

Er... but they won't just be 'firing up Windows'. The software still needs to be compiled for ARM or be on an emulator compiled for ARM, whether you're running Windows or Linux. At that point, once it's been packaged, the Windows install side is not too much different from the Linux side. Usually it comes down to running make on a source directory or apt-get/yum to install some package. Not much harder than installing/compiling a program on Windows. It might not be as educational (in, learning how to use basic Linux commands), but that's not necessarily what some people want. 

My point was, there's not a whole bunch stopping people from using the pi as a gaming computer with the RPI1 Tons of people already do. The makers aren't going to go away just because it can run Windows. If Windows becomes the *only* thing it can run, then I would agree. If MS starts being pushy, I feel that RPI would drop them before anything happens. Otherwise, I see competitors popping up to replace it.

Can't speak for you of course since you're dutch, but for me as an English person, Hepburn is a very close match to the sounds I'm hearing, while most of the differences present in Kunrei are nonsensical. You can tell me that ""syozi"" is right all you want, but that ain't what I'm hearing, and if you asked me to write down what I was hearing, I'd write shoji. Kunrei straight up doesn't make sense to my English brain. 

Hepburn allows fu to be written as both fu and hu, which is what fu *is*. The Japanese f/h sound is another of the r/l cases where the sound lies pretty much on the boundary between h and f for an English brain, which means that slight variations in how it's pronounced can make it sound like a solid f or a solid h, same as r and l. For the record, that linked clip I hear hu, but I also hear distinct undertones of an f in there which is actually pretty unusual. This one must be lying right on the boundary, or maybe wobbling across it. If that guy said it slightly differently, it'd be a fu. 

Of course you are right that Japanese has been shifting over time, however, Hepburn has been too. The 'dictionary' form of it may not have caught up yet, but the people who are using Hepburn practically are using it differently. I see hu written as hu pretty frequently, and a *lot* of ms before b, p and m. Kunrei sucks, but Hepburn is somewhat inaccurate too, even for what English people hear, and English people are simply changing Hepburn to make it more useful.

I'd be interested in hearing from people who have actually lost friends to suicide, to see if they'd prefer never to have known that friend in the first place. They might be able to provide some insightful perspectives.

Off site, everyone just writes out the equations in text in whatever language. From there it became very easy to learn math. I stopped using wikipedia for math completely, and instead used stack overflow, answers.com, random blog posts, and sometimes wolfram alpha.

&gt;Hence my view that math on Wikipedia could be done better.

Like other users have pointed out, there's always tradeoffs involved in something like this.  If you try to make pages more accessible, they're going to get significantly longer, and harder for people familiar with the field to read.  The more accessible you try to make them, the worse this problem gets.  Unfortunately, it's simply impossible to write an article that's helpful to someone who wants an introduction to the fundamentals of a concept *and* that gives a rigorous description of the concept and its implications.  (Well, there *is* a way to do it, but at that point, you're writing a textbook.  That's not what Wikipedia is for; Wikipedia is for summaries.)

Going back to latex equations, I don't even want to imagine what the page for [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations#Formulation_in_SI_units_convention) would look like if the standard integral and differential forms were replaced with text.  To a physics undergraduate, the standard MEs are easy to read, since multivariable calculus is a prerequisite for that level of E&amp;M.  On the other hand, the closest text equivalent of Gauss' law of magnetism in the integral form would be something like this:

&gt;[2D surface integral over a closed surface omega] **B** [3d vector dot product] [infinitesimal 2D surface element dS times the unit normal vector at that point on the surface omega] = 0

Even experienced physicists would do a double-take at this version, and the easiest and fastest way for me to familiarize myself with the equation would be to get out a piece of paper and translate it into standard notation.  And that's the simplest of the four MEs in integral form!  A text-only version of Ampere's law would be at least three times longer.

Funnily enough, the first comment on the answer to the SO question you linked is someone remarking on the difficulty of reading equations in text form.

&gt;We need a way in SO to make nice formulas! – Beska Feb 24 '09 at 21:19

&gt;yes... latex support, essentially --has been mentioned many times. – nlucaroni Feb 24 '09 at 21:31

Wikipedia's goal isn't to provide an accessible, layperson-friendly explanation of every concept it covers.  It's more concerned about providing a clear, accurate, and succinct summary of each concept.  When it comes to math, those two goals are fundamentally incompatible, and Wikipedia has adopted the second while letting other websites (SO, Khan Academy, etc) handle the first."	3	False

I definitely agree that Carrie and Dar are the most morally compromised characters on the show (and Saul is not far behind, to be honest). But, what is interesting is that I think they are compromised in different ways. 

Dar seems to be more sinister than Carrie because of the Haqqani deal, his treasonous acts WRT the conspiracy, his involvement in removing Franny from Carrie's home, and, if we take this as canon, his sexual abuse of Quinn as a minor and continued manipulation of him through adulthood. However, Dar does have his positives. I personally think that, in a weird way, he is a patriot and he did care deeply for Quinn. What makes him different from Carrie is that he is an old player in the game, and he doesn't show remorse for his actions.

So, like you say, Carrie has her issues as well--and I agree that she was confronted with all of the ""blood on her hands"" in ""Super Powers."" I also think that she puts her missions first, and it's not always necessarily because she is altruistic and desires to put the good of the majority or the collective first. She loves being right and winning the game. You can see it on the smile on her face whenever she thinks she has won. This season, for example, she went to great lengths to defend a relative stranger, Sekou Bah. But, you could also say that she went that far because she wanted to win the case and be right--plus, she screwed up the situation and caused Sekou's plea deal to get scrapped, so she felt that she had to ""win"" again. Yes, one could say that she puts herself out there to defend people from terrorists. But, does she really do what she does for the greater good, or is she addicted to the game? I think this is a central question that the show is presenting us with.

Regarding why Carrie left the CIA, I think that she was upset by what happened in Islamabad, and particularly how she changed when she became the ""drone queen."" Interestingly, she may have been most like Dar in season 4, because she seduced and manipulated a young person (although he wasn't legally a minor, he might as well have been). But, it did seem that she showed remorse about this to a small extent, like when she was crying while she slept with him that one time. After her time in Islamabad, her sister, Maggie, mentioned to Quinn that she had never seen Carrie this shaken. Plus, it didn't help that she felt completely betrayed and disillusioned by Saul when she saw that he and Dar had made that deal with Haqqani. So, I think she wanted to believe that she could leave the CIA life behind and be a good person. But, she can't. As mentioned before, even when she was working for the Fair Trial Project, it didn't take her long to revert back to her old tricks and ""apply pressure"" to get what she wanted. She told Saul that she had promised herself that things would be different this time, but they're not because, to some extent, she keeps seeking the danger. Dar told her to ""stand down,"" and she refused.

In the upcoming seasons, I think Carrie will realize that, like Quinn, she will never have a real life or a real love--those are for normal people, and she can't live passively. No matter how much she tries to fight it, she wants the danger, the chase, and the vengeance. In the end, I believe that she is supposed to be a morally ambiguous heroine, while Dar is a morally ambiguous villain. But, they are alike in a lot of ways."	2	False

Racism, in an academic/activist setting, means the systemic inequalities facing groups based on race (this is why people say reverse-racism does not exist in the USA; we do not have policies that harm white people solely for their whiteness). This isn't totally relevant to your post, I just thought I'd put it here in case people read this. 

You are absolutely right that racism is a social construct. Most people who are anti-racist already firmly believe that. But to act like we can all just move on and pretend that everyone understands that isn't very productive. We, at least in part, have to engage people's current belief system and change that. 

There is a fundamental difference between how people of different races are treated by institutions. Race may be a social construct that is not based in biological fact (there is more genetic differences within races than between races), but as you said, racism does exist. That's why people continue to use the concept of race. 

I agree that eliminating racism needs to involve understanding that race is something we made up, but how can we understand racism without talking about race? How else can we talk about how people of color have vastly different experiences than white people due to their race? "	17	False

They are aligned but they operate independently. Every chapter of BLM operates independently of the other, which you seem to understand. The BLM organization isn't the central command base for all the local organizers. But in terms of policy goals, they are generally aligned. They are organizing for social justice and racial equity as outlined.  

This I find very difficult to believe is the case in reality. You gave me links of individual people behind the movement and their books and think tanks, but when it comes to protests and their tangible effects, I see a massive mismatch.   

&gt; Who is calling who a racist, though? It's not the job of BLM organizers to stop random people on the internet from calling people racists, lol. 65% of Americans support the movement, so you're saying that out of a hundred million people, some will call you a racist? Yes.  

That's less BLM leadership issue here as much as how BLM is tackled by media and as a subject of popular discussion.  

&gt; Did you miss where I said these issues disproportionately affect black people? I should add that the effects are disproportionate and unique, since they often stem from racial identity. If having a black sounding name makes a person more likely to go to jail than a person with a different name for the same crime, shouldn't that be mentioned?
Black LGBT folks experience racism and discrimination in a unique way that intersects with both their identities. You're just saying they shouldn't advocate for the policies that would be most helpful to them based on their unique experience. Why don't you want them to do that? Why is that a bad strategy?
Cis white LGBT folks have different set of needs than LGBT folks of color because they are different populations.

Perhaps I find issues like LGBT or migration or such more effective when tackled above racial divides, especially as in some cases surely, other minorities or nationalities may be more deeply impacted by said issue than black people but that doesn't mean we should tackle the issue under their banner.  

&gt; Local BLM organizers DO NOT cheer on the riots. Do you know what goes into setting up a protest? They literally have to work with the police department, lol. If they are cheering on riots, then their career is over. Any good organizer is explicitly concerned with the safety of the people in attendance.  
Do you realize slandering protest movements by the actions of a few members of the public who attended them has been used to slander basically every protest movement in history? These arguments were used against the civil rights movement. They set an impossible standard for protesters to meet.  
Maybe people are calling you a racist because you're unwittingly using arguments that were first used by racist to slander movements for racial equity? I'm NOT calling you a racist rn, just pointing out that you could be triggering someone with your language. Maybe you're dog whistling without realizing it.

Say that to Chicago BLM or the black nationalists in the BLM ranks.

Do you feel like I'm discrediting the movement by saying the above is not okay and the the BLM is not be about... this? Is it much to expect the leadership of BLM org to crack down on the local chapter and bring it to responsibility and set a better example? Do you feel the BLM *movement* does not lose credibility and positive impact each time BLM leadership is seemingly silent on such matters?   

&gt; Anybody can start a local group on Facebook, call it a BLM group and begin organizing. From your original post, I assumed you understood that the protest movement is aligned with BLM the organization, but operates independently.

This isn’t a speculation, you can scrutinize anything from art and literature to legislation and policy and it would lead you to that conclusion. It’s also important to interrogate your viewpoint by expanding how women are treated globally not only how you perceive women to be treated in your immediate vicinity. You have entire countries where women are second class (Afghanistan and Iran). Objectification may seem harmless in how you’ve described it but it’s a symptom of a greater problem. When you divorce someone from their full humanity and place so much value on their appearance you rob them of dignity. When so much emphasis is places on a woman’s appearance, it means that she has less value if she ages, if she is disabled, if she isn’t beautiful. Objectification in its essence is the opposite of humanization. Women are owed the dignity of their humanity just as equally as men do.	20	False

Now that might well be correct, but it's quite difficult to argue with unless I know:

* Exactly what your definition for the terms is.
* What your problem with people conflating them is.

So maybe you could give a definition of the things as you mean them, and an example of someone conflating the two and why it's bad?

As an example of how it's confusing: usually ethnicity is very much tied up with heritage. For instance, here's how wikipedia defines ethnicity:

&gt; An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other, usually on the basis of presumed similarities such as a common language, ancestry, history, society, culture, nation or social treatment within their residing area.

So the phrase ""ethnically identify with their heritage"" doesn't make much sense go me.

Currently we have about fifteen million assault rifles already sold that no one’s coming to take away. Think of that as the potencial black market supply.

This isn’t supply though. The “supply” in supply and demand comes from the amount of a good up for sale at any one given moment. If a gun enthusiast has a stockpile of grandfathered weapons that aren’t for sale, they aren’t considered as supply. The vast majority of the supply of firearms comes from gun shops selling new firearms. Take this away and the supply plummets immediately. Sure there are still tons in circulation, but this actually feeds into my argument. The argument I’m countering says the net result is gun enthusiasts can’t get get weapons, so they don’t have any, while criminals still get them on the black market unabaited. This is just false. The vast quantity of guns in circulation would stay in circulation. These guns are in the hands of gun enthusiasts. So the net result is actually the opposite: gun enthusiasts get to keep their weapons, while criminals are unable to buy them. 

&gt;	I think it’s worth making a distinction between mass shooters and other criminals, because if some other criminal needs an assault rifle to commit a crime, there’s a reason beyond killing as many people as possible, the reason being that he needs the rifle to make comitting a specific crime easier. I think its safe to presume there’s money in the crime. If that kind of criminal needs an assault rifle, he’ll get one.

That’s all well and good, and certainly correct. However, this is a win for the weapons ban. If a criminal would have spent $400 on a weapon and now spends $4,000, that’s a win. That will stop a significant fraction of criminals who are not big enough yet to afford $4000. In the crime world, you need money to make money. Even if you are big time enough to afford it in a technical sense, dumping extra money on something tangential like a gun sets you back big time if the cost of the gun is high."	1	False

I don't believe this to be the case, and I don't think most religious people believe that to be the case either.

For instance, I don't think that the doctrinal differences between Roman Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church (or Shiite and Suni Muslim sects) are that important for someone in your position. Most religions believe that while they have the correct truth about God (or the Gods, or divinity or whatever), that there are aspects of truth to other religions as well. So that means that it's possible for you to find God through one of these ""wrong"" religions, even if one of the other religions that you didn't chose is correct. If God exists, it's almost certainly better to have a partially correct understanding of him than not to try at all for fear of getting it wrong (or at the very least, it's not worse).

So to that end, more important than the actual doctrines of each religion is the practices and community of their participants. It doesn't matter which religion you end up picking, but you're not going to feel connected to it if you don't practice it, and to practice it, you need to physically be able to, and usually have a community of people to practice it with.

It's actually quite demoralizing. That's one of the problems with people today in general, they discount the voice of people whose ""voice"" doesn't sound as aesthetically pleasing to them, as they would prefer - that's unfortunate because that's when we miss out on experiences in life that we are not customary to having.

What I was trying to say(poorly) was that I don't think OP is doing this or would do this. I agree with this in general though.

&gt; Basically, only when a situation is presented to you in such a way that pleases you is it deemed legitimate?

Pleases, makes sense, or changes my view.  I understand why we would throw white people out from talking about black issues because I agree there is no way to accurately communicate life experiences. I don't see how white people can decide not to be racist, recognize their subconscious racism, approve of affirmative action, etc unless if the information is presented to them well. This is reasonable?

&gt; Where he lands is the same place everyone else lands, his opinion about something that he has no experience holds no value to no one but him - I say the same thing to black people who have opinions on white people. It's as simple as that. Once people start to grasp that concept, we can move forward. We can't tell other people who they can/not feel. I can't tell him how to feel. However, there are truths in this matter, and the truth is that you cannot be more of an expert on my life than me - if that makes any sense. The same goes for me toward any/everyone else.

Yes, I agree. I think OP's opinion can matter a lot more when we consider he will influence his peers(and as we have said people tend to associate with people like them in modern day America) and massively influence any children he has. Their is value in convincing him for that reason. Where do we go once we acknowledge that individual opinions on life experiences that people haven't had don't matter? Does each class of race/gender decide how to improve their status in society and then tell the rest of society what needs to change?

&gt; It's not about what the people you see everyday and how they may present to you the ""black culture"". However, if we are telling the truth, it's about the way the black culture is presented in the media, and in every other way. Moreover, I rarely hear anyone explicitly say that the black culture is ""broken"" - but, what do you see when you watch tv, or check things that are related to being black on the internet? It's not white, and by that very fact, it's non-normative and/or broken. What do people try to do to things that are broken? They try to fix it. You can even see this within things that are presented to the black community by other people who are black. The extremes in which certain aspects of the black community will portray itself in order to appear as though it's contrary to everything that is white is baffling to me. It's not a one-sided thing. It's just... fascinating. If you honestly believe this is a problem only seen in the places I've been in the US - and I've been to many places - then, I'm not sure what you're seeing that I'm not. Now, that's not to say that it's all bad, and that there is all negativity. However, there's a huge force of negativity. And just because our last president was black doesn't mean that we've reach the pinnacle by which suddenly black people and the black culture are seen in a completely positive light either. We have a long way to go before this happens.

Fair enough. I don't think I've been exposed enough to what you're talking about - I live around mega liberal people and I avoid television/main stream sources. I'm sure there is a well supported thesis out there that society views black people and culture as broken and tries to fix it."	1	False

First: As it is, there are lots of ways for individuals to commit suicide should they so choose, though not all of them are pretty and/or painless. Suicide by gun is a fairly easy alternative (at least for those in the USA), yet I can think of no laws that say that an individual who is clinically depressed cannot purchase a firearm. Would it not be more appropriate to offer these individuals a more humane option, and perhaps introduce them into an environment where they would be more likely to receive assistance with a mental illness than pushing them towards far messier alternatives that offer no such chance to be introduced to a support system?

Second: Who is to say that those who are clinically depressed do not have a right to suicide? Clinical depression is a medical condition, though it may not have the same painful and debilitating *physical* symptoms as something like cancer, who are we to say that that individual is not experiencing such mental anguish that their quality of life is akin to that of an individual with severe physical illness? Why shouldn't individuals with crippling, untreatable mental illnesses (as is the case with some who are clinically depressed) not have the same option?

&gt;No one here is complaining. We are the shining example of why there is no ""real life"" reason to complain about mail in voting.

For one thing, you can actually think about the subject for a while before you cast your vote. You can go debate it with your friends first. You can have it translated to English :)  
&gt;  
&gt;In theory you \*could\* do these things without mail in, but *without mail in ballots* I have never met anyone outside the politician business who found all the info on the ballot prior to voting. It just is not an easy task.   
&gt;

Not to be crass, but if the mother decides to have an abortion, the problem essentially solves itself.

However, if she decides to give birth, then we suddenly have an infant child who did not ask to exist, cannot provide for itself, and needs to be taken care of by someone.In the event that a single mother is not able to financially support an infant child, we basically have three options:⁠

1. The father subsidizes the child's needs through child support⁠
2. The taxpayer subsidizes the child's needs through welfare, public housing, etc.
3. ⁠No one subsidizes the child's need, and it starves to death in the street. 

Now, we have to decide which of these three options makes the most sense. I hope we can agree that infant children shouldn't starve on the streets due to the mistakes of their parents, so Option 3's out. And if you believe a father bears no responsibility for an unwanted child, then the random taxpayer certainly bears no responsibility, so Option 2's out as well. That leaves Option 1: the father pays child support. Now, is the perfect solution in an ideal world? Maybe, maybe not. But out of three existing options, it is the most viable."	1622	False

This post isn't really about me, but I'll use myself as an example. I have thought about doing management before because I like working with people, maybe even more than working with code. But I don't like the idea of being on the hook for other people's work. I wouldn't be opposed that responsibility IF there was significantly more compensation (like exec-level salaries, or at least a nice yearly bonus). If I am accepting more risk on behalf of the company the shouldn't I get paid more?

My view is that the compensation is not nearly enough for the risk involved. That and the fact that layoffs usually hit middle management hardest gives the impression that execs don't look to managers to add value to a project (which is a shame because I believe they really DO add a lot of value), but to act as ""fall guys"" when it hits the fan.

&amp;#x200B;

[GDP growth in China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263616/gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth-rate-in-china/)\--while still impressive and indicative of a more vibrant national economy--has been declining in recent years. While China will probably show good economic growth for decades, it's unlikely to return to its levels of growth in the 1990s or 2000s. Meanwhile, its [GDP per capita (2010 USD)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?end=2018&amp;locations=CN&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;start=1986), while continuously growing, is still leagues below many of the European and American democracies, and [the rate of growth for China's per capita GDP is also stagnating](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2018&amp;locations=CN&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;start=1986). China is also a highly unequal country, with a [high Gini coefficient and staggering increase in Gini coefficient](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18127.ashx) (the Gini coefficient is related to inequlaity; higher Gini coefficient means more economic stratification). What does all of this information tell us? China, while having experienced massive economic growth in the past decades, is unable to sustain previous rates of growth. At the same time, this money is largely benefiting the elites in China, with fewer of the material benefits of this growth reaching the population at large. Europeans and Americans are still generally much richer than Chinese people, allowing them to better sustain a consumer economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

China has no shortage of looming crises, either. The One-Child Policy was in effect from the 1980s to 2015, and the Two-Child Policy is currently in effect. I want to be clear that the primary victims of the One-Child Policy were the women who were sterilized, who were forced to have abortions, and who had the government violate their rights to reproductive privacy, as were the girls who were killed at birth or denied citizenship. The One-Child Policy is a horrendous stain on Chinese history. That said, there are numerous effects of the policy related to China's future.

&amp;#x200B;

The One-Child Policy was--in short--an unmitigated disaster that echoes into the present. Most obvious of its effects is the gender imbalance in China: [there's a California's worth more men than women in China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/too-many-men/), or 112 men ages 15-29 for every 100 women of the same age group. If you consider that older men will also try to find wives, that figure changes to 280 men ages 15-49 for every 100 women ages 15-29. And the worst is projected for the 2030s. I can't fully convey how much of a crisis this imbalance is, especially for a partly agrarian society that is organized around marriage and the family unit. Aside from the epidemic of despair among elder bachelors in China and horrific surge in human trafficking within and without the country, there are concrete economic externalities of this situation. Because of the intense competition, men and their families are saving money to invest in real estate to attract brides; [China's gross national savings rate has risen to around 50%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS?end=2018&amp;locations=CN-AE&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;start=1986) as the gender imbalance increased. Dowries (paid by the groom's family to the bride's in China) have also increased between 272% and 550% from 1994 to 2013. This requirement for such massive savings is simply incompatible with a healthy consumer economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The total fertility rate has fallen below the 2.1 required to maintain population size. The Chinese government hoped that allowing families to have an additional child would improve fertility rates, but [this has not materialized.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/china-birth-rate-2019.html) Since birth rates are falling as life expectancy increases, then China will develop a population with too few young people to support retirees; this is especially concerning considering China's culture of filial piety, as older adults rely on their families for support, rather than the underdeveloped social safety net. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences also predicts that--with current trends--the state pension fund risks insolvency in 15 years. With more pensioners than taxpayers and already low consumer spending, it will be difficult to foster the continuous growth needed for China to become the global juggernaut you fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, China will almost certainly experience a catastrophic bust as its social changes, heavy-handed policies, and low incomes at the bottom of society intersect in the 2030s and 2040s. While I doubt this would lead to the country's demise, I think it would avert a shift to a global order headed by China."	187	False

In turn: 

&gt; the President does not have dictatorial control over the government.

I agree, and I do not believe that the threat to the status quo presented by a Sanders presidency is grounded in the pure political power granted to the office of the president, but rather, the ability to effectively use the bully pulpit to change the national conversation. There are SO many issues about which a majority of both democrats and republicans agree, yet the political class refuses to implement. A two-party system is a political duopoly; a brief review of monopolistic theory reveals the dangers of this arrangement, and we see all the outcomes economists would predict playing out in the political economy of the country. 

Because Sanders threatens to put front-and-center issues that the duopoly has up until this point agreed to stay quiet on (many of which are issues a significant majority of the country believes should be addressed), he need not exercise the specific powers of the office to have an impact. 

&gt; the President's power to effectuate his agenda can be more limited than you realize

Perhaps it isn't clear from my CMV, but my cynicism is rather acute, so I hope you believe me when I say that I am painfully aware of the President's limited ability to exercise even legitimate power if other branches of government want to make it difficult to do so. 

I also want to say that I appreciate that this is a different point than your first (he doesn't have ultimate power v. the power he does have is subject to further checks). However, as I stated above, the point is less about the specific powers endowed to the office, and more about the ability to use the bully pulpit to change the national dialogue and address those things that ""the people"" want changed but ""the powerful"" do not.

So this is what I do (law), and I don't know how productive it is going to be to get into the precise contours of the 5th Amendment/Takings Clause/Taxing Authority in this conversation, but I want to be responsive. Apologies...I hate lawyers, too. 

As a threshold point, you should know that the IRS and its taxing authority is not implicated by the takings clause under Brushaber. 

Further, while recent takings/exaction/judicial takings jurisprudence has called into question certain powers of state and federal governments, it is not an impediment to many of the regulations that (i) Sanders advocates and (ii) would be devastating to the establishment.

If you can imagine such a Venn diagram, can we perhaps agree that while SOME of the policies situated in the over-lapping portion would face judicial/statutory obstacles, it is also true that others would not?

&gt; We’re 10x closer to mars than the asteroid belt.

The distance from Earth to Mars or an asteroid can change by a huge amount depending on where the Earth and the object are in their orbit, so I'm using the average distance from the Sun because that changes less. At it's closest approach, Mars would be 0.3 AU away from the Earth, but that's in a perfect situation, so that closest approach can be anywhere between 0.3 and 0.6 AU from the Earth, depending whether Mars is closer to its apoapsis or its periapsis when it is closest to the Earth. Objects in the asteroid belt have different orbits, but if we assume that one is orbiting at 2.2 AU, its closest approach to the Earth will be 1.2 AU. The relative difference in distance from the Earth is smaller at other parts of the orbit, but at its closest the asteroid will only be 2-4 times as far away from the Earth as Mars.

I also am not suggesting moving large asteroids closer to the Sun, or even building habitats on them. I'm talking about using materials from the asteroid to build free-floating rotating habitats. You can then move them closer to the sun using rocket engines using either hydrogen and oxygen made from water ice in the asteroid, or possibly an ion engine if one can be designed that can use oxygen instead of a noble gas."	3	False

I think it depends on how we define individuality, or how individual one wants to be. It can definitely reach very toxic levels though, which result in cases such as demanding to be treated by specific pronouns under penalty of being charged (which obviously is something I don't agree with, we're probably both on the same page here).

I understand your point: toxicity will happen regardless of existing concepts. The reason why I think it's an issue, despite of toxicity happening or not, is due to the importance I feel that is being placed on these models. Something such as not being a real man/woman if you don't practice said things (which falls in the realm of toxic masculinity/femininity, which could not be a reality if the notions weren't there in the first place), thinking of yourself as someone of a different gender, being a factor for atractiveness or desirability... would you still say that it is merely a craze and a misuse of these terms, rather than their existence that is actually problematic?

I wouldn't want to be a man in Rwanda for example. So many men were killed during the genocide there that 70 percent of the population is women. It would be more accurate to call it a gendercide - since men were the primary victims of the violence.

I wouldn't want to be a man in Darfur. While the horrible situation there was reported as ""A Policy of Rape"", where women were reportedly being raped whenever they went out to gather supplies, the reason why women kept going out is important. To quote one of the women: ""It’s simple. When the men go out, they’re killed. The women are only raped.""

Almost any place where women undergo violence and repression, men are just killed as a matter of policy. There's a reason why women outnumber men in every country on Earth except China and India.

&gt; You could marry an old rich fat ugly woman for money too, you know.

I don't think this is a live option for most men.

There's a reason that male strippers' primary clientele are gay men, and not women. Male and female sexuality manifest in slightly different ways, that make men the primary consumers of certain kinds of sexual content.

* Nearly 1 in 4 men in the U.S. experienced some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime.

To which, I'll present these points.

* If you had a choice to kill 10 murderers and an innocent person by flipping a switch simultaneously, would you think that it's ethical for you to do so? Orr would you simply lock them up for the time being? Sacrifices are so easy to make when you're not the lamb, and quite frankly it's disgusting to ask others to pay the price. Taking innocent lives is inherent in any system mortal men can make.
* The idea of life behind bars is that exoneration is possible...you cannot bring someone back from the dead.
* Differentiating between levels of certainty is redundant. We already assume the person is guilty when we hand out a guilty verdict. There is no concept of ""Very certain"" and ""somewhat certain"", since all standards operate by ""beyond reasonable doubt"", but this still hasn't worked perfectly. What do you propose in terms of level of guilt differentiation that wouldn't add additional complexities to the legal system that could likely be exploited by zealous prosecutors and defense teams alike?
* I'll also add this, but while the death sentence can bring peace to a victim, ultimately counseling doesn't try to rely on the idea of justice, karmic or otherwise, as a certainty. Real life is unfair. We have to get used to that. We should be happy when it does, but point is, we can't rely on ""*fairness*"" for an acceptable level of mental healthiness."	1	False

You mention how institutions are still transitioning from Lincoln's time. I'd say that economies based around slavery are distinct from the capitalist system, so some of our institutions still carry baggage from having existed in an entirely different economic system? 

At the same time, if you look at the household as an economic entity, you can see how these systems on the micro-level have transformed from, say the ""traditional 1950s household"" until now. I could see how support for these old systems, even at the very micro-level, could relate to individual support for both Trump *and* Putin *and* Saudi Arabia.

In general, I don't think people really understand cause-and-effect relationships in government. Like, I don't think people realize how the decisions of law-makers impact their own personal lives. The average person probably has a very vague understanding of how Congress works and that's about it. You often presidents championed for their legislative achievements. This only makes sense in instances where they used their platform to directly promote legislation.

So it makes sense that most people don't understand whether local changes are technological, legislative or environmental in nature.

I mentioned in a different comment about choices (the suburbanite that commutes to work instead of living closer):  This bigger issue here is that while, yes, you can convince people to reduce their demand, you can't actually convince to make **different life choices that will permanently reduce their demand** unless you're 1) really, super clear about what choices need to be made, and 2) keep up the pressure all the time, on everyone, without relenting, and 3) remove everyone's internal desire to do the things they're currently doing that pollute.

The question matters: Unlike the student, an economics PhD can give me a pretty good analysis of the economic literature/methods involved, etc. A student would just be talking. 

We can trust experts too much, namely on questions that they are not competent to answer. An economist offering stock tips is not going to consistently be reliable. As a further complication, economists in academia are more conservative than average! What do I do with that? There are ideological splits across fields, in different departments, and even within departments. 

Expert testimony is valuable and critical - but the political views of experts are not themselves an indicator of the inferiority of conservative views.

Anti-discrimination provisions attach to gender reassignment status, which is very broadly defined as beginning with declaring an intent to do so and does not require medical interventions. (This exists in part to extend the protections to transgender children, who cannot have anything but a social transition prior to adolescence, but also applies to adults.) In short, protections are effectively based on self-ID.

However, those protections are not absolute. The law already provides for exceptions where *the exception is a proportionate means to achieve a legitimate aim*. These exceptions exist independently of a gender recognition certificate, but must meet the legitimacy and proportionality requirements, which are generally construed in a narrow fashion. But, for example, single sex spaces and services involving nudity or intimate care already allow for the necessary exceptions. Women's sports usually have rules based on medical transition status or testosterone levels for trans women. In contrast, for public bathrooms with individual stalls, it would be next to impossible to justify an exception.

The important part is that ""biological sex"" by itself is not a useful criterion here (nevermind that there is no universally useful definition of biological sex, especially once you take intersex people into account). For example, you will have a harder time meeting the legitimacy and proportionality requirements when it comes to post-op trans people than when it comes to pre-op trans people. This is not to say that there is no room for such exceptions, but they are harder to justify (examples may include intimate medical care). It is also not the case that services must make exceptions; they are simply allowed to do so.

The reason why ""biological sex"" does not enter into the picture is that exceptions to anti-discrimination provisions are generally kept as narrow as possible. We have plenty of bad experiences with anti-racism provisions that were cleverly circumvented through indirect discrimination, for example, and legislators have no interest in repeating that experience.

You can find an explanation of the relevant provisions of the Equality Act [here](https://fairplayforwomen.com/equality-act-2010_womens-rights/). Note that this is a TERF website, so there should be no pro-trans bias to be found (a fair bit of transphobic language, however).

In the case of Karen White, this was a mistaken assessment, as the prison service admitted. Unfortunately, prisons are strictly binary, while prisoners are not. You cannot just send a trans woman to a male prison without potentially [causing her harm](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/a-transgender-woman-talks-about-life-in-a-male-prison/news-story/a6da09f95a36857eeee95f16028b06eb) (caution: mass rape, suicide). There is no easy solution to this issue, so each case has to be assessed individually. The case by itself is unrelated to your thesis, as the relevant assessments already happen in the UK.

In the case of Jessica Yaniv, this is an obvious case of vexatious litigation. Which is unfortunate, but in principle a cis man could bring a similar case, claiming he was discriminated against because of his sex. In fact, [MRAs have discussed that possibility before](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5ovy97/isnt_it_illegal_to_refuse_service_based_on_gender/).

In practice though, waxing services can deny service in such cases, simply because it's an entirely different procedure for male genitals that they are usually not trained in. (Part of the reason why the Yaniv case is still alive is probably because there were additional issues, such as one service not wanting to visit a ""man's house"" for religious reasons.)

(Also, Yaniv is a Canadian case, where the laws are similar, but different.)"	2	False

Not at all.  I'm not making a point except that your point is illogical. Again,  you suggest transgender people ought to be referred to as their identified gender because some transgender people pass,  therefore ""that's how the word is used."" But by the same rationale, if our perception of someone who doesn't pass is that they are their natal gender, we ought to refer to them by the gender we perceive them as."	1	False

* Alderaan was a whole planet and Leia's homeworld. That's about it -- you don't learn more about this until the prequels, the EU, and so on.
* The Force wasn't exactly more explained in the sequels.

And the rest really didn't need an explanation:

* Greedo was a throwaway character, he's a vehicle for Han to be a ruthless brigand.
* Luke's real father was just there as an explanation for why Luke is special. As far as we know, he's an orphan, but he's avenged his father by killing Vader (probably).

Mexican cartels do not produce all drugs. To claim so is wildly ignorant. 

&gt; Mexico, does not have a high drug consumption rate, so it mostly produces it with the intent to export. 

Mexico does not produce anything. The cartels do.

&gt; Even if Mexico had the political will among it's people to legalize things like marijuana

[The Mexican government has pursued a radically different drug policy in recent years, eliminating jail time for small amounts of several drugs for personal consumption](http://tijuana.usconsulate.gov/drug_fact_sheet.pdf)

&gt; We have a clear understanding that the huge amount of consumption in the United States directly affects drug operations in Mexico.

Why are these drug operations? Why do cartels run them?

&gt; There are other legal recreational drugs that do not carry these problems like alcohol and nicotine.

Alcohol kills thousands of people. Cigarettes kill millions of people. You are claiming that it is morally wrong to use an arbitrary set of drugs because of the harm they cause, then you endorse the use of drugs that ruin and end millions of lives, often painfully. How do you reconcile that?

&gt; So I see no excuse for how one could participate in this market and believe themselves to be an ethical person.

There is really no way you can participate in the food market and believe to be an ethical person. Or the clothes market. Or the car market. Why are you singling out drugs?

Having read your post, it's fairly apparent that you are relatively unfamiliar with this situation and are picking it at an arbitrary point. So I'll ask you this question. Why do the cartels cause such destruction? Are they destructive because people want drugs, or are they destructive because the U.S. government is carrying out its own personal vendetta against drugs?

If the studies above have modified your view such that you now agree that friendships are useful for *some people*, you might consider awarding a delta by editing your comment above and adding !\_delta (without the underscore).

And per the links above, the vast majority of evidence suggests that relationships are hugely beneficial for people, so you might not want to be so quick to assume that they won't be beneficial for you too. Indeed, you are on here talking to people and posting, which shows that you are seeking out at least some kinds of social contact (which suggests that you have a pretty normal desire for connection). 

If you are physically isolating yourself from others, consider also that that can be a sign of depression. Depression has a tendency to make people think in ways that make their depression much worse, and that discourages them from making changes in their life that would actually help get rid of their depression (like making friends, seeking out social connections).

Think of depression as a bad roommate that's living rent free in your head. It doesn't want to leave, so it tells you ""finding roommates is hard"", ""other people are awful"", ""reaching out to people and asking them if they want to be your roommates makes you look weak"". Depression is likely affecting the way you see the world to prevent you from kicking it out.

Practical steps that help with depression can be found [here](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/who-does-it-affect/men/taking-action), and that site has loads of other resources that can help.

The r/MensLib sub also has some pretty good discussions about this issue, as social isolation is a common issue men face.

You might also find this article [helpful](https://www.cracked.com/blog/15-things-socially-awkward-people-need-to-know/). It explains why socializing is so necessary (and addresses some of the most common reasons people resist doing it).

As it says, one of the biggest mistake the socially awkward make is in the assumption that everyone else finds it easy. But actually, socializing is a learned skill. It takes time and practice for everyone, and the reason the vast majority of people invest the time and practice into developing their social skills is because it's worth it."	2	False

Arguably mathematics may also be supernatural since it is not empirical.

&gt;That's not faith. Faith is a belief in something without evidence and or evidence to the contrary. Acceptance of Science doesn't require faith because you have a reasonable expectation based on evidence that its findings are true or likely true. You have nothing of the sort of religious claims.

Bajakajian held that forfeiture of the entire amount of money in question in a reporting violation was an excessive fine for 8th amendment purposes. Some people with high incomes would almost certainly face fines which would meet the ""grossly disproportionate"" standard set in Bajakajian. There isn't a ton of caselaw on the excessive fines clause though. To my knowledge, an income based fine law has never been set (and discovering the defendant's income could be exceedingly difficult in a criminal proceeding).

That's an interesting reading of the case, but it seems the majority was interested in proportionality between the gravity of the crime and the burden of the punishment.

&gt; Plus income and property taxes are attached to income and property that can be disgorged, so it's much less common to be totally unable to pay than it is with a fine.

Maybe for income taxes. For property taxes, the only alternative to paying the tax may, for some people, be to sell the property; which is surely more onerous than not commiting a crime (or other municipal offense).

Regardless, I don't view the burden of payment as an important element either of the fairness of the tax or the justification for a tax-enforcement scheme. On that view sales taxes would be most fair because there is no (easy) way to incur a tax liability you can't pay; but in fact sales taxes are one of the most regressive ways to raise money. You say escalating penalties are unconstitutional, but it's not clear to me how a government is supposed to enforce penalty X if they cannot enforce an additional penalty, Y, on those who refuse to comply with X, and a third penalty, Z, on those who try to evade both X and Y. I have not yet read your linked case, but if it were as clear-cut as you say, I doubt the system of additional second-order penalties to force compliance with first-order penalties would be the universal solution to maintaining rule of law.

&gt; We're talking about tickets, not rape and murder. Tinted windows or rolling through a stop sign do not have the same welfare loss to society as rape and murder, and arguably may not have much of any welfare loss.

Well, again: what *are* we talking about? Your post says *municipalities* should not control their own finances because, inter alia, it so awful to use criminal fines as a source of revenue that no municipality should ever have cause to do so. But you keep making arguments that could only prove, at best, that *Ferguson* should not control its own finances because the way *Ferguson* raises money with fines is corrupt. Why does it matter what laws Ferguson was making money off? If your city has laws against tinted windows and you don't think that is good law, you should support repeal of the law. If you think tinted windows are genuinely a nuisance, fines in proportion to the nuisance are in order. "	1	False

The only problem becomes the economic system. While we're still relying on a system where money exists there needs to be a constant flow of money. Without money, there's no tax, no tax means no socialist state... it's really circular logic, but unfortunately it is how our society works. By moving from a labour and resource based economy to an arts and services based economy we can easily remove menial jobs though automation but we'd need to increase art consumption in order to stablise the economy, which is actually really easily done as people naturally want to consume media. More leisure based work, ie. media and tourism, would be the only reliable growth industry outside of white collar work; so more musicians, writers, games developers, artists etc.

In reality, it's hard to really balance the system largely because all currency based economic systems are inherently flawed. The strength of an economy effectively isn't in the wealth of it's people, but the speed in which the people can repeatedly spend the money and earn the money back. It's why light bulbs break, it's why apple releases a new iPhone that's almost identical to the last one ever 6-9 months, and why companies like IKEA pushed for changes in interia fashion to encourage people to thow out their old sofas. Perceived obsolescence and designed obsolescence made the economy richer... it's insane, currency systems effectively make the most wasteful countries the richest countries; but that's what I get for studying economics, I'm now one of the sad fucks that realises that it makes no goddamn sense.

Both - people voted for Trump for *all* sorts of reasons (which is why simplistic, monocausal narratives - whether ""whitelash"" stories from the left or ""repudiating progressivism"" from the right - are not helpful). It's true that peoples' reasons probably depended on their socioeconomic situation: poor rural whites in Michigan voted for Trump for different reasons than did middle class suburbanites in Ohio. But they also voted for Trump for the same reasons. For most people, it's unlikely that the decision was determined by any single issue.

My best guess, and this is speaking in very broad terms, is that poorer, more rural, and more unemployed whites probably voted Trump for reasons of identity politics (which is not as disgusting a thing as it's being characterized: people voted their interest). They felt economically and culturally disenfranchised, ignored and mocked, and asserted themselves (*not* against - or at least not only against - ""black America"", but against other elements of America that they feel - perhaps rightly - are responsible for their condition: rich, coastal whites especially).

But plenty of people who are economically well-off, culturally respected, and socially privileged voted for Trump as well. I don't think that upper middle class white women voted for Trump along identity politics lines. If anything, this demographic was probably more disgusted with identity politics, which has been far more rampant on the left than on the right. The concerns of this group are not so surprising, since they tend to be concerns associated with the bourgeois everywhere: security, economic liberalism (property, lower taxes, etc.), law and order.

Rightly or wrongly, a large portion of America feels as though the left does not take issues of national security seriously, that they are being economically pillaged to pay for unnecessary spending, and that the left is guilty of tolerating lawlessness. This last point is most strongly seen in the case of Hillary Clinton (since a lot of people think that she was allowed to ""get away with murder""), but I think this also has a lot to do with prevailing reactions to BLM rioting. It's not that huge chunks of the (upper) middle class white population are self-consciously racist (though no doubt some are), and I would guess that a significant number are even open to the possibility that reforming the criminal justice system is important. But when people (and I have in mind particularly middle class people, who tend to value 'order' and stability) see rioting on TV, see police being shot for political reasons, and see voters being dragged through the streets and beaten, they freak out. Worse, to a lot of people, it seems like the left is either not taking this seriously (e.g. Obama lecturing a police department about racial tensions during the funeral of a cop who had just been shot) or is approving of these actions (if you have friends who identify as strong leftists, then you have probably seen people posting approving messages about rioting, killing cops - ACAB -, and so on; even moreso after Trump's election).

This second group of concerns is mostly a rejection of identity politics, since it's identity politics which is motivating a lot of the excesses of leftist activism. To a lot of mild-mannered, bourgeois conservatives, it looks like the left has gone nuts (e.g. on my college campus, people were hanging and burning effigies of Trump, painting campus landmarks with death threats against Republicans, holding candlelight vigils at night to mourn Clinton's martyrdom, demanding classes and exams be cancelled, etc.), and it looks like political and legal institutions are standing by or nodding in approval.

You might not agree with this analysis - you might think that these fears are overblown or that what people are afraid about is actually justified. But these *are* the fears that motivate a large portion of the US population (I didn't support or vote for Trump, but I'll admit that the post-electoral rioting has made me *substantially* more sympathetic to Trump). For educated middle class whites, ""economic and racial anxiety"" was not the principal motivation for voting for Trump: the country looks like it's collapsing into chaos, and leftist radicals (in particular, *identity politics* leftist radicals - not so much orthodox Marxists or anything like that) seem responsible."	24	False

When you put a number to something, you can track progress.

Let's say an organization is committed to having a 50/50 split of male and female employees at or above a certain pay grade. Let's say that organization also wants to encourage more visible minorities to hold senior leadership positions within five years.

I'm just going to have to clarify a couple of things and if I change the definitions you have already provided, it's only because those definitions may be accurate but aren't sufficient.

The widely accepted definition of terrorism as a tactic, within political theory is:
&gt;The use of violence or the threat of violence to achieve a political goal or goals.

So the ""the state of fear and submission"" that you mention is (along with actual violence) simply the **means** to achieve political **ends**.

You say that:

&gt;[Muslims/Sikhs/Arabs] are now being attacked one way or the other (or being met with suspicion) by their countrymen to the terrorists delight.

You're right that this is happening and is indeed in the interests of the terrorists as division will lead to more citizens of Western countries turning to militant jihad (look up 'Jihadi John'). But it is a tactic, a tool, it's not the prize.

Now, about those ends. Let's talk in the context of Al Q'aeda and Daesh/ISIS. Al Q'aeda's specific, codified political goals was the cessation of American military presence in the holy land, specifically in reference to the US military bases in relatively close proximity to Mecca and Medina. Have Al Q'aeda achieved this? Absolutely not, the organisation is in shambles and the accolade of internationally condemned global jihad has been given to ISIS.

Their explicit goal is the creation of a global caliphate. ISIS do not yet have a global caliphate and, especially since the attacks on Paris/the Russian jet, there has been renewed public support for their total destruction. ISIS are actually doing quite well, they control a region larger than the United Kingdom, produce 30-40k barrels of oil per day and have ~10m citizens within their 'state' - but they haven't **won**, and hopefully won't win.

Also, other kinds of whole-class power swaps wouldn't change a class's role very much. If we swapped the power sets of fighter and warlord, then the fighter would still be a defender and the warlord would still be a leader.

You are correct in that roles primarily work as a ""you aren't stepping on any toes"" feature, but given that they also exist in the rules (for instance, there are feats that require ""striker role"" or ""controller role""), I still feel the controller role should have been made more distinct from the others."	2	False

&gt; Dynamic Electoral Vote Counts - Assign Electoral Votes after each census according to population, with no fixed number of Electoral Votes. Essentially you could have every 100 or 1000 people equal 1 electoral vote. This removes the issue of a vote in California not being worth the same as one in a smaller state.

&gt; Popular Electoral Vote Assignment - Assign electoral votes as a percentage of the vote, rather than the winner-take-all system. That way every vote counts, and states like New York, where the Rural areas are almost entirely Republican, but always go blue thanks to the cities, vote reflecting their own inner diversity.

make your system nearly identical to popular vote. If every electoral vote represents the same number of citizens and they are apportioned in each state based on popular vote it will be roughly equivalent to just doing a popular vote. The number of electoral votes awarded can be represented by dividing the popular vote by a constant. The only change would be in the remainder, which would have to be rounded. This rounding would probably be roughly random. Since we are dividing the popular vote by a constant it won't matter in terms of finding who got the max. "	3	False

1) this study only concludes that high school boys grade 12 are leaning conservatively (2 times more likely then to identify as liberal), high school girls grade 12 are solidly trending towards liberalism. 
So when you say kids, you really mean the male population of that age demographic, not “kids” as in all kids. Also of those boys 2/5 answered “I don’t know” or “none of the above”  and another 1/5 answered moderate when asked about political orientation and that the chart used to show the disparity between boys identifying as liberal verses conservative omitted any boy that identified as moderate. So the data pool used in this chat only contains boys that either identified as conservative or liberal plotted against one another, and not the entire population of male students asked the question. 

So yes of the male students who answered either liberal or conservative, those students were 2x more likely to say conservative, but that doesn’t really show an accurate representation of the entire population or male students or both male and female students (where female students under the same condition of removing anyone who did not say conservative or liberal were almost 2x as likely to say they identify as liberal). 

2) the article you shared actually is critical of your view/and the way in which the information in the study it reviews was disseminated and is being used to support the “kids are leaning right” agenda in numerous places and comes to the conclusion that both female and male students in grade 12 were more likely to identify as not having a political orientation more that any other answer. 

3) while the article does discuss why these trends trend the way they do, it doesn’t not actually discuss social media or shortened attention spans or the MTF as cause of the “rise” of general student and specifically male student grade 12 conservatism. 

I do get where your coming from about the catchy buzz words on tik tok, but actually conservative spokes models market conservative values better to men because the conservative agenda, on some level, appeals to a male demographic more then other demographics and conservatives know this. The people you discussed other students talking about are know for having in your face punchy tag lines about why they’re conservative values work for you, and those people have loud opinions about why their position is correct and others are incorrect, but people watching those types of videos are not just watching 30 second clips on tik tok, they are watching more longer videos on other sites too. 

Summary: 
Female students, when they do identify as liberal or conservative, are 2x times more likely to identify as liberal (this excludes anyone identifies as moderate/idk/none). There is less about female students in this article or I’d go more in depth. 

And of the male students who answered this survey, 2/5 answered idk/none, 1/5 answered moderate. Which means of the remaining 2/5 of students that answered liberal or conservative, these male students were 2x times more likely to awnser conservative (which really isn’t that many students). 

The reason I spent so much time going over this is I think your view is a little naive,  there are always going to be people consuming hard alt-right information, and conservatives know that male students are an easier market for them because male ideologies can align with conservative ideologies. But to hold the view that all the kids these days are leaning right because of tik tok just isn’t accurate, and the date you used to draw a conclusion (outside of anecdotal which is totally valid just not measurable) has been manipulated to make it seem like a larger trend is happening then it is. 

Because you wanted your view changed, I hope this is a relief."	1	False

I can't make a $100 piece of nonsense and demand you pay me for it. I can only sell things that people want. How many people want it and how many they are willing to buy is half of what determines the price. How much work and resources and logistics goes into getting it to those people is the other half. So, at some point the buyers and sellers agree on how many will be sold, which then sets the price for those things.

The second a person decides not to buy one then the store is left with an extra one, and they'll discount it until it moves. They will then turn around to the producer and tell them to ship them one less next time, to avoid losing money. The producer then cuts production by one in order to not lose money.

If, on the other hand, someone decides to take one more then the store ends up alarmed. They had a stock out! They missed a sale! They go and bump up the order to the supplier to make sure that they don't miss out again. The supplier then pumps up production, maybe even going so far as to hire new people or even build a new plant.

All of this happens in aggregate. If one person decides to get one more and another one less then thing balances out. If people, collectively, decide they want more carrots and less beef then the prices change and farmers will end up planting more carrots and pasturing fewer cattle which would bring things back into alignment after a growing season's lag time.

Under ""normal"" circumstances people, or ""consumers"" decide who makes how much where and when at the store. When you decide to buy toilet paper then that information is converted into a number that tells shops and distributors and paper mills a loggers what to do.

Why do they jump when you say jump? Because that's how they make the most money. They could ignore *THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE* if they want. They could persistently ask too much money and not sell all that many... but they would make less money than people who sell at the Market Price ^TM.

So, how do we decide how much food to make versus how many college educations versus houses versus backrubs? Well, people collectively decide how much they want and use money to ration it. Suppliers listen because if they don't then they get less money than their peers who do.

Naturally, there are some ways to break this. If you don't have peers you can do pretty much whatever you want. This is why Monopolies and Monopsonies are bad. Pollution and ""externalities"" (read: things that should be factored into the price but aren't) means that suppliers are being told wrong numbers. Insufficient information, repression, and poor quality regulation also twist it. Proper regulation, easier and more accurate information, and social equality makes it work better.

Sending and receiving this information, organizing workers, acquiring the necessary tools, predicting future trends, and establishing plans to deal with eventualities isn't doing nothing. They are doing a ton of work that's hard to see, and requires a bit of specialized knowledge of their industry, politics, and some advanced math. They also, usually, make it possible to do the stuff in the first place by getting the plan together, acquiring the necessary resources, and attracting people to make it all go. It's not unreasonable that they get paid for that work.

But, and this is essential, if they make too many tables then they are buying too much wood and too many nails and way too much wood varnish and are employing too many people. But, and this is key, *they can't sell all of the tables at whatever price they want*. They can only sell as many tables as consumers want. If they make too many tables they need to lower the price until they can sell all the tables, or they are stuck warehousing an ever increasing amount of tables. The greedy people would *never* do this. Because it loses them money to make too many. They could make *so much more money* if they only made as many as it takes to maximize the equation ""Revenue = Price x Quantity"". Higher Quantity means Lower Price. Lower Quantity means Higher Price. At some point this is the greatest, and that's the point at which everyone who wants a table gets a table.

But, wait, what about labor? Well, labor works the same way, only backwards. People can do any number of things to work. But, if literally everyone decided that they wanted to carve birdhouses that wouldn't work. There is money to be made in not-birdhouses. So makers and distributors and retailers start offering money above what a freelance birdhouse maker gets to convince people to do things like accounting and auto manufacturing and waste water treatment. The harder it is to get someone who can do a good job the higher the price you have to pay them. The easier it is then the less you have to pay them. Those people who just really want to make birdhouses will make birdhouses regardless, but that's alright. If the average person does the thing that pays them the most then everything that needs to get done will get done.

Nothing else we've tried has ever worked half as well at ensuring that people get what they want and do all the things that need to be done. Is there a better mix out there? Absolutely. But, abandoning the system without having a better alternative is silly and self-defeating.

Finally, about your food thing:

The [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/faqs.htm) says only 31% is wasted now, and of that only 21.4% ever reaches a landfill. The rest is composted.

But, think about it this way. If you only plant enough for each person to have 2,000 calories a day then people are going to starve. During the growing season some areas will have drought and others will have floods. Bugs and animals will eat some of it. When you harvest it some will be damage or spoiled and rats will get at it. When you ship it to stores some trucks won't make it and the cargo will spoil. At the store some people will just not be home or will change what they want and some will spoil. At home some will be eaten and some will be leftover and just be deemed inferior to alternatives and will spoil. Some would be spilled or expire unprepared. These things are inevitable. So, rather than make people starve because some central planner failed to account for all the various failure points and wild animals we produce significantly more than we need, exactly in line with what we collectively think we will use.

TL;DR: Greedos have little control, because they are too busy making sure the rest of us get what we collectively want."	2	False

You're confusing open book with a way of searching for anything you need. I also think you're vastly underestimating how much time actually looking something up takes. Open book testing is solely so you don't have to cram your head full of possibly useful details, you still need to know the basics before you can answer anything. 

I'll agree that with primary work, demonstrating knowledge is important, so that you can be sure that children are building that basic knowledge, but past that, more varied subjects are less important to know word for word. You don't need to know every detail of America's rise as taught by a text book. Are those dates really useful knowledge to spend learning? Is it better for a child to spend the week they have to revise for a history exam practising their argument and analytical skills, or learning 100 dates off by heart? The open book only reduces the need for rote learning, you still need the knowledge of the subject itself to pass.

As I said earlier, the time it takes to look something up is also huge. You can flick through and find a date, but there's no way you could blag an exam with no knowledge of America by only writing what you've found in a book in that exam time. "	4	False

If it's winter in Minnesota, 50 degrees feels extremely warm. The same temperature means different things based on the environment. So if you live in an area where you have the option of the vegan restaurant and choose to go to Taco Bell, you are doing more harm by giving money to Taco Bell. If you live in a place where every food option from Taco Bell to the local grocery store all support factory farming, then it makes no difference what you eat. There is a base level of cruelty in all your actions, no matter what. The best you can do is order a vegan option at one of those places.

Furthermore, ""responsibly raised meat"" is still killing an animal in the prime of its life just for the taste of it. If someone was going to execute me or torture and execute me, obviously the torture/execute option is worse. But it's not that much worse in my opinion. 99% of the horribleness is the being killed part alone. Responsibly raised meat still involves killing a human thing, and is significantly worse than getting a killer to not kill an animal.

It's kind of like the movie the Pianist, which is about the Holocaust. The Nazis worked the Polished Jews like crazy, then they executed them. Eventually, there were so many Jews in one place that they just executed most of them right away. This latter option was slightly better than being worked and then killed, but both were almost equally bad. In the movie (and real life), a Nazi officer spares one guy. He executed many people. He was still a cog in a system of violence. But he's still praised as a hero for showing some humanity just one time. So the people who spare Jews from labor and torture, but still executed them are considered just as bad, or depending on sadistic they were, even worse than the people who demanded forced labor before execution. Meanwhile, a person who was evil 99% of the time, was a central part of supporting evil, but did the right thing one time is considered a hero. ""Responsibly raised meat"" fits in the former category, and the vegan at Taco bell (even if they order a vegan meal just one time after a lifetime of eating meat, and go back to eating meat afterwards) is still a better person. For at least one moment, the Nazi officer recognized the humanity in a Jew, and the human recognized the humanity in the animal.

As a final argument, the economics of voting with your dollars is not an all or nothing affair. Companies respond to what their consumers want. And the existence of vegans forces companies to change what they do, even if their practices are broadly the same. So companies factory farm, then vegans show up, they start to see a new market, they invest in things like Beyond Burgers, and slowly shift away from factory farming. That's the nature of innovation. It happened a few years ago when CVS stopped selling cigarettes, once their most profitable product. It wasn't an overnight process. They made a larger and larger percentage of their money from health products and a smaller and smaller piece from cigarettes. They deemphasized cigarettes in their stores and promoted healthy goods. They reached a point where they had health conscious customers and investors who didn't take them seriously as a health brand because they sold cigarettes. So they finally got rid of them. The same thing is happening in fast food. It's just vegans buying bean burritos today, but then it'll be people buying Beyond Burgers, and people like yourself who care about ""responsibly raised meats,"" and ""all-natural"" type people who want food like at Chipotle, and green type people who care about the environment, and pretty soon these groups will combine to represent a large enough market that it forces fast food chains to abandon factory farmed meat, even though it's currently their most profitable product. It's slow, but nothing happens overnight."	6	False

But... why? That doesn't resonate with me. To me, ""here are some things to do to be healthier,"" and ""this is what your body should look like"" are fairly independent messages. In fact, there is an enormous range of body shapes and sizes that a person can have while maintaining a healthy and fulfilling life. I know many active, healthy people--people who weight lift, who cycle, who teach fitness classes--who have larger bodies. 

Reflecting on my own experiences, I'm much more likely to take steps towards self-improvement when I feel supported, and when I feel like I can set my own goals because there is a range of successful outcomes.

The conversation that immediately comes to mind (from CMV, of course) was one in which it was said that fathers do not want to be the sole provider for their children and that's why most residential parents are women. That's a universal claim and my anecdote proves it to be untrue. It was backed by the sole statistic that X% of residential parents are the mothers. At the time I fit into the greater statistical probability (at the time my son's mother had residential custody) but my anecdote shows that statistic alone is not enough evidence to prove that even most fathers don't want residential custody of their children.

Because it's a hot button issue I feel the need to warn potential readers that we're not here to discuss anything regarding child custody (anyone reading this can feel free to create a separate CMV,  I guarantee I'll jump on it if I see it).

This applies both to people who may be perceived as more righteous, as well as people who are seen as evil.

My opinion is currently as follows: 

Female only sports leagues are by their very definition a restriction on who can participate. The point is to create an opportunity, especially at the collegiate and above level where Title 9 involved funding, where women can compete on a somewhat level playing ground. 

So you have to come up with some categorization to say ""this person qualifies to compete and this person does not"".

Using sex assigned at birth = female is a readily available universal standard. Trying to formulate ""x nanomoles of testosterone per liter and y years of hormone treatment"" can ""follow science""to some extent but we know that testosterone levels afford different amounts of benefit in different sports and even in different events in the same sport. So the ""fairest"" designation is probably sex assigned at birth = female. 

That said, i totally get all the social arguments in favor of letting kids play with the gender they associate with. And i think we should do so up through high school. Once scholarships and sponsorships are on they line, as well as the full effect of puberty being universally present, I'm ok with drawing more exclusionary line. 

It may not seem fair, but life isn't fair. I also didn't think Oscar Pistorius should have been allowed to compete in the ""regular"" Olympics rather than the Paralympics. Some women are generic freaks and dominate their sport for decades (Williams sisters in tennis). That's just the randomness of the luck of the genetic draw.

Would my method upset some trans people and their advocates? yes, probably. I'm ok with it through high school but feel like no matter what you do, you're being unfair to someone and so I'm unfortunately pushed to be unfair to the smallest group possible, which is the group of trans women who would wish to compete at the collegiate level and above."	1	False

I think part of the frustration is that many of these young men see double standards. A lot of people would call a man fatphobic for not wanting to date an overweight woman, but wouldn't say anything to a woman not wanting to date a short man.

Further, another major part of it is that for men, even now there's still the perception that if a man can't find a mate, they're a failure of a person. Married men make *significantly* more than single men and are more likely to be considered for promotions and the like - and if a man hasn't been in a serious relationship by 30 most women will consider him defective.

The opposite is not true. There's the stereotype of ""strong independent woman who doesn't need a man"" for a reason - women remain single and do their own thing are celebrated, as are women who find a husband to settle down with. Women largely don't have to deal with the baggage of not being able to find a mate anymore."	1	False

Consider that suffering can be as easily defined as the absence of a desired state as it can the presence of a undesirable state; suffering therefore is what allows for a diversity of experiences. To be without suffering is to be perfect and complete, something that man is not. Is it suffering, for example, for a stone to erode away before the waters of a river? One can say that the stone does not know that it is eroding, or one can say that the erosion is itself how the stone comprehends such a thing. If there is no ""proper"" form of the stone, then there can be no deviation from such a form; likewise with humans, if there is no ""state absent of all suffering"" then there can be no improper suffering.

The easiest counter to this is to say that god should have made man such that he is perfect and complete, prefers only one thing, and then is immersed for eternity in that one thing in a state of inexhaustible ecstasy. Indeed, this is a suitable enough description of paradise; why should man ever find himself elsewhere? The usual answer here is that if man was purely a creature of paradise, then he would not be man - he would be an angel or comparable supernatural creature, born as they must always be. Man, however, is man, and his nature is not to be born complete with the knowledge of absolute truth, but to be born incomplete and move towards completeness through the faculty of free will. The possibility of movement or development requires the possibility of occupying both desirable and undesirable states, and thus, the possibility of pain.

This is demonstrated in how Jesus is said to have surrendered his godhood when he came to earth as the redeemer of man, and this in turn is what produced his plea *Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani* - My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?. The idea was that in order to actually redeem humanity, Christ had to become man, before he was to be assumed back into heaven again."	4	False

&gt;In theory. But is that really the best or fairest option? Does it adequately address the health needs beyond coverage?

Like you stated, in theory or legislatively it is possible.  It is important to imagine that M4A functionally is not similar to insurance in that each person pays according to their income, not their level of service.  To that end it is not ""insurance,"" but rather a tiered payment system.

&gt;Okay, but my needs are different than yours. For example, I haven't had to use my insurance. By your definition, am I overinsured?  If I don't take coverage for something exceptionally rare that I end up with, am I underinsured?

I would argue that the ability of insurance to cover needs such as healthcare cannot exceed 100%.  You may be overpaying, in our current system, but your healthcare needs are either being met or not.

What M4A is helping is to get more people's healthcare needs met, not to make each person pay less, though certainly many would if they are lower income.

In M4A, your coverage is not differentiated, so no person has ""too much coverage.""  Rather, each person pays a different amount, based on their ability, for the same coverage.

&gt;Sure, but we have large pools now. The problem is not the pools, it's misplaced expectations. Drugs are expensive.

I say this especially in relation to education, where I think resources should go to developing students’ many interests equally. If programs for these are equally developed I believe scholarships from colleges will follow, and naturally create a more diverse student body in terms of pursuit.

Right now sports within universities and high school are stuck within an endless cycle of supply and demand. Lots of people care about sports. Therefore colleges want to be better at sports for advertising, so they give huge scholarships to good athletes. That makes high schools encourage sports way more than other programs to get higher college acceptance rates. That means more children are encouraged to do sports by their parents from a very young age, generally not for exercise reasons (speaking from subjective experience). That means a large portion of the population is primed from an early age to care a lot about sports, and the cycle repeats again. The intrinsic issue is that the effects of this cycle on the budget allocation in education is strongly out-balancing other programs, which primes less and less of the population to care. I say “more intellectual” in relation to their more direct relations to education, and talk about “intellectualism” based on the ideals of a well rounded person, which would require knowledge of sports as much of other subjects.

I am also aware of other aspects of sports - I have a very athletically involved family, and watched their games, and saw a lot of the behind the scenes aspect. I still believe sports are more focused on physical aspects than others. The smooth motion of sports can be artful like a dance - in many way dance is a sport. There is overlap. So I agree with you there.

As a side note, you mention that many arts don’t require much physical exertion (while it’s irrelevant to your general argument, I just want to point out this interesting point), playing piano for several hours a day is equivalent in caloric intake to running several miles (about 1.5 miles on average per hour of playing). Dance takes even more. Again, I just think that’s interesting.

As for the watching experience, which I discussed with some other comments, I realize I was speaking from an outsiders view and would be able to better understand the variation of sports if I watched them more. Though I have been to my fair share of Super Bowl parties, I take that point. However, I would imaging that the variation in music is equally not apparent to an outsider. Perhaps if people were more diversely interested and exposed to subjects through breaking the budgetary cycles I described above, these would alleviated on both sides. People will always ultimately gravitate towards what they like, but non-sport interests are somewhat underrepresented, especially for children (I also don’t support forcing children to take piano lessons if they don’t show interest, for example).

I am actually in the process of designing a music appreciation website for children to be able to develop an interest in music. I support making such website for many topics to ultimately let children and people in general choose what they like. Right now many are pushed to sports heavily by their parents (as I was) due to the prevalence both of us described.

I understand my original post could seem elitist, but I think that is less from my own position and from the unclear and somewhat diminutive language I chose not so carefully to use.

Regardless, I am aware this opinion is wrong - that’s why I made the post in the first place. I just have a hard time justifying to myself why (specifically, how this overrepresentation in culture and education does not reflect badly on society)

&gt;A wife can't initiate divorce on her own and must instead get permission from a rabbi.

She doesn't need permission. A divorce is required to be mutual. Either side is able to refuse it. The man is responsible for getting a get (writ of divorce) written out and giving it to the woman, but she is under no obligation to accept it, and no divorce is final until she does. Neither one is allowed to remarry in a such a situation barring extreme circumstances.

&gt;In some circles women on their periods are considered unclean and can't touch the floor of the home.

This is just patently false. Generally, unrelated men and women do not touch each other at all in observant circles. During a women's menstrual cycle, a husband and wife do not touch each other. No one thinks she's dirty. It is prohibited for them to be together intimately during this time, and there are a number of additional restrictions to create physical distance to prevent slip ups.

The floor thing is just wrong. I assume what you got that from the verses that speak about temple purity, which are not in effect due to our lack of a temple. Either way, the floor was never involved in that.

&gt;Hell in some ultra-orthodox readings only men can fulfill the requirements of the law and therefore be jews

I'm not totally clear what you're saying here, but women are just as much Jews as men are. There are mitzvos (commandments) that are exclusive to men, just as there are mitzvos that are exclusive to women. There are a few other categories unrelated to sex. Point being, no one can fulfill all of the mitzvos, as they aren't all relevant to everyone.

&gt;women just have the religion of their family.

All Jews have the religion of their family. If you're born a Jew, you're a Jew and there's no getting out of it. What are you talking about?

""You"" weren't doing anything until you came into existence. The only way you can posit this is if you think there's no meaningful difference between consciousness and unconsciousness. I don't do anything when I sleep; I have every reason to expect that so little was happening to me before I was born that it doesn't make sense to refer to ""me"" as a thing at all.

&gt; That could happen again after you die, just like it happened the first time.

Well, not like it happened the first time. The first time it happened was a consequence of everything that happened in the universe prior and nothing else. If it happens again it'll have to be a consequence of all that *and everything that has happened since.* What's to say that this doesn't change the situation so that your new consciousness is a subjectively independent entity from your current existence?

Moreover, we know that something as simple as a spatial separation can separate consciousnesses as distinct: you are not your friends or coworkers. What makes you think that a temporal distinction would be any less fatal a barrier?

For the sake of argument, let's suppose that ""you"" is simply some identifiable pattern of your particular consciousness and that if this pattern were to manifest anywhere at any time, ""you"" would be experiencing consciousness from the perspective of that happening. What would ""you"" see if we made an atom-for-atom copy of you and moved you across the globe? Would your consciousness violate special relativity and exchange information at faster than the speed of light? Would we be able to detect the propagation of consciousness-waves or some other phenomena to explain how your experience functions?

It's more reasonable to assume that you are a happening that expires on your death and that your existence is as bounded in time as it is in space. Think of it this way: you are not a consciousness experiencing the particular reality of a being at a space in time — you *are nothing but* experiences that are happening at this space at this time. Once the thread connecting you to past memories and future experiences is severed, whatever follows will be effectively nothing like that which came before, from a subjective standpoint.

However the lecturer wants. Lecturer wants audience, that's the only reason the universities are keeping them, at least in my system. Just like youtuber and content creators.

* Maybe a lecturer is just super awesome at teaching this one lecture, maybe they designed it like a motivational speaker / stand up comedian / religious preacher, and they just repeat this one exact same lecture all the time, everyday. And it is just such a popular topic, the hall will always be filled with a new batch of people every time.

* Maybe some are trying to do a poll and try to gauge the current need or the next big thing, and thus schedule their lectures based on that. So it will be disjointed, but it is what people are looking for.

* Maybe some are into presenting very complex and complicated topic that will take hours to expound, and there will be devoted audience for that too. They will have regular schedule, maybe 3x a year. If a student miss it, well, they can join midways, or they can wait for the next round, nothing too different from what's going on right now.

* Maybe a huge topic is just extremely popular, that lecturer A would start covering that topic for 20 weeks straight starting January. Lecturer B, seeing an opportunity, starts cascading class for 20 weeks straight, but starting February. Lecturer C, starting March etc.

* I would expect that most people will just prefer not to come to lectures physically and just watch online. Lecturers would be paid accordingly.

* You mentioned removing large trees may negatively impact the environment and worsen climate change. This is an intuitive thought, however as a tree reaches maturity it actually begins to accumulate less and and less carbon from the atmosphere as time goes on. Young vigorous trees grow the most quickly, technically removing carbon faster from the atmosphere and doing the most to combat CO2 levels. This is why timber harvesting is actually a good thing. Harvesting fast growing pines removes carbon from the system (it ends up in our wood products) and also allows the space to be used again to remove even more carbon.

* Total forest cover in the US is actually on the rise, this is well documented.

I would suspect that members of BPT (i.e. POC) already have to engage white people's ideas about race and racism on a day to day basis. Thousands of black people have to listen to their well-meaning white friends' thoughts on the latest police brutality incident, or whether or not this celebrity was racist or not. The white people in these instances probably believe that they are providing good and helpful conversations, but think about how exhausting this must be for POC, who have to be representatives for their entire race/ethnicity every single day.

Perhaps the mods and members of BPT simply want a place to talk (and joke) about race issues with the guarantee that the people they're talking to understand their experience. And when so many forums in the world are dedicated to and led by white people, can you really blame POC for wanting spaces of their own?

I would recommend reading [this article ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/08/black-friends-educate-racism/) in its entirety, but I will excerpt 2 quotes from it here:

&gt;Asking black people in the United States to discuss race is asking them to relive every moment of pain, fear and outrage they have experienced

Saying that everyone, no matter how hard they work, will earn at least X amount. And since it's not possible to employ everyone at once, this necessitates a living wage to the unemployed. And those who have a reliable source of income without needing to work will not have an incentive to find work.

OK, so while that does not perfectly align, what you're describing is communism, not socialism.  So your understanding of ""socialism"" is actually communism. For simplicity's sake, if you were looking at a sliding scale, it would look a bit like this:

|Communism   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      |Socialism|                &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Capitalism|
:--|:-:|--:|

Socialism simply means that the free market can't run rampant, there are *some* rules and *some* controls and *some* things are managed/owned by the government (e.g. Health Care, Prisons, Postal Services, Media/Broadcasting). The US is on the very far end of the socialist spectrum (closest to capitalism), but it is, none-the-less, socialist to a degree.  

As a Canadian, I ***strongly*** support a socialist system. Things you'll see in socialist countries:

* The poorest people are still cared for. They are provided a minimum income (welfare/social assistance), subsidized housing, their tax bracket falls into the ""low to non-existent"", they receive a quality education and quality health care (which can include subsidized/free dental, eye care, prescription drugs) . 
* Many ""necessary"" services are provided/controlled by the gov't. Health Insurance, Auto Insurance, prisons/detention centres. Education --even post secondary-- is either free or heavily subsidized. 
* The rich are taxed at a higher rate, and there are many restrictions placed on the market/enterprises in the interest of protecting the environment, worker's rights, etc. 

Examples of more socialist countries include: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands.

Now ""controlled"" by the gov't doesn't necessarily mean that the service is carried out by government employees --there is often plenty of outsourcing-- but in the end, the oversight and budget are the responsibility of the government. Take Canada's health care system. While it is slightly different in each province, generally:

* Doctors run their own clinics as private contractors to the government. 
* There are services that are covered by government insurance, and there are others that are not. 
* The services covered by the government have a ""negotiated price"" because as a single payer insurance provider, the gov't has the power to negotiate pricing.  e.g. A cosmetic surgery clinic will have a patient receiving skin graphs for a burn (covered by the government) and another patient receiving a nose job (generally not covered by the government). One pays, the other doesn't, but the doctor is paid for both services."	17	False

I wouldn't call what we have in the US redistributive taxation. We have a progressive tax bracket, but money isn't being 'redistributed'.

The other arguments are horrible strawmen.

I believe some guns should be restricted **because they present a greater danger to the general public than they prevent.**  I'm anti death penalty because it **doesn't deter crime and costs more money than life inprisonment.**  If society as we know it collapses, my stances on these issues might change.

Also, consider that veggies and environmentalists care about how our current society affects the environment.  If soceity collapses, these problems might not exist anymore.  Many vegetarians are anti-factory farming, but have no qualms with hunting or fishing.  Same thing with environmentalists.

They also don't want to improve their situation, they don't send their kids to schools but make them beg instead, they don't allow their girls to get educated, they don't want to get some work (which could be fine enough if they didn't think stealing is a fine alternative.)

The Black Lives Matter movement, which is back in the headlines amid the nationwide protests, receives wide support.

2) Insurance companies design their plans to pay as little as possible, of course. None of this is hidden - it's just that no one believes they will need more insurance than they have until they suddenly need it, then they are screwed.

3) Hospitals will sometimes use resources that insurance carriers will not cover, (for example, not requesting a pre-claim inquiry). Sometimes there is bad communication, but sometimes people just get screwed.

I agree that there is a difference between the fields of the two groups, but just because something is insight into the fundamental workings of the universe is it more valuable than something that is instrumental in a large portion of the worlds interactions and learning? And to the greater point of this conversation, does that make it more influential purely on the merit of what is being studied/discovered? Also, while it is mostly in western culture, the Socratic method has also popped up in Eastern education, specifically law studies in Japan and Korea. 


I think the intrinsic value and influence are interesting concepts. I think theoretically that should be true. I just don’t know if in practicality that’s how things played out in human history. There are so many different factors that impact influence that intrinsic value is only one element of it. 


I agree that the truck in itself is not the holder of value for satiating hunger. Without books to publish, a printing press loses its influence but without a printing press the books have influence but on a smaller scale. However, the printing press/truck adds a value that the boxed lunches themselves are unable to on their own. The truck creates accessibility. If only 50 people can access the lunches that’s 950 people who are going to be hungry and 950 lunches that aren’t getting eaten. 

I also think we are slightly delving into a world of what could have been instead of what is. The topic is who three figures have had the most profound influence on humanity (Truthfully a topic I don’t think we can in earnest solve). Meaning we have to evaluate what has happened instead of what would be the case if it didn’t happen. With the Gutenberg invention, it is undeniable that the scope that any major researcher, educator, scholar, creative writer, etc. has been amplified because of this invention.

It sounds like what you're describing is changes in the world, e.g. technological advances, changing the outcomes of applied-ethical analysis. That doesn't mean the underlying normative-ethical theory being applied has changed.

OP seems to be relying on a theory of normative ethics that says that conformity to social consensus is the standard for measuring the rightness or wrongness of actions. In this view, if historical figure X owned slaves in the 1700s, then X was doing nothing wrong because the consensus in the 1700s leaned in favor of slavery.

My response is that OP's theory has the counterintuitive consequence that if historical figure Y advocated in the 1700s for the abolition of slavery, *perhaps leading directly to the development of our modern view that slavery is bad*, then Y was *wrong*, and perhaps we should e.g. tear down statues of Y. In the effort to avoid passing moral judgment on historical wrongdoers, OP has instead implicitly *inverted* such judgments in a way that seems obviously absurd.

It sounds like *your* point is that, analyzing historical circumstances in terms of some not-obviously-absurd theory of normative ethics (for example, the rule consequentialism you suggest), it could possibly turn out to be the case that, e.g., the heuristic ""owning slaves is OK"" actually did more good than bad in the position of historical slaveholder X, even though it would be unacceptable in modern circumstances, so X was literally doing the best they could at the time? (In this particular example I expect that that's unlikely to be true)

This isn't a relativistic view at all; we're taking rule consequentialism to be the correct theory of normative ethics at all times and in all societies, and it's just our applied ethics that work out differently due to local contingencies."	3	False

Logically this is addressed by asserting that God must have some good reason for not preventing all the evils he could. The argument is really about the plausibility of God permitting evils to take place for some other purpose.

Alvin Plantinga's treatment of free will as an example of a possible greater good is well respected among philosophers. Plantinga would argue that a world governed by an omnibenevolent god is the best possible world (although we might not think so at the time), given that human free will is an important quality of a good world, according to God's standards, and all other possible worlds must be worse in some important way, even if the present world contains a great deal of evil. This at least reduces the *logical* problem of evil to an *evidential* problem of evil.

You might not find this explanation plausible, but you haven't presented a logical paradox, just an interesting argument that requires Christians to do some explaining. The apparent paradox arises from differing definitions of 'omnibenevolent' -- perhaps there is something more to this quality than just minimizing or avoiding evil."	26	False

I've been cornered by groups of people to try to intimidate me into giving them my money or trying to hurt me in a mob mentality. I'd be lying if I said I've never been punched in the face for defending myself in these circumstances. Thankfully I've never been seriously injured from these times, but they are something I reflect on when I go in public within large groups since. I try to not have a bad attitude, but I am also on my guard and sometimes unfairly because of my past experiences though. 

In my opinion it's not necessarily a man vs women type of situation when large groups of people congregate, for whatever reason, troubling things sometimes happen. I think there are predatory individuals, of all sexes, that are sometimes drawn to places where a bunch of people are with a lax in security to do their ill will deeds. It's unfortunate for something to happen to anyone when they are made to feel intimidated or are assaulted in a place where they came to feel communion with their interests and joy from the surroundings. I think that making a community aware that people, trans, female, and male feel like there's this matter to be addressed when in mass populated public spaces is a good idea. Many eyes see many things, and I think most people are good. If festivals or concerts had signals for instance to make others aware when someone was being targeted in a negative way, that would help. To have more roving security forces would A. In a positive way: encourage more high fives and B. When necessary: make more negative situations dissipate before a fever pitch. 

Unfortunately, when in large groups of people it's better to have a crew of friends than can look out for each other than to rely on flying solo. I hate to say it like this but it's likely a reasonable idea to take a few self defense classes as well.

I've done several other CMVs that people will pick 1 of 5 points I've made to respond to and it makes it hard to change their view.

&gt; I'd have fought hard against that law, and would seek to have it repealed. In the meantime, I'll be crossing at the light.

Yeah, that is fine and makes sense, but says nothing about the people who were disproportionately punished and what should be done with them after the law is repealed.  Do you acknowledge that a law can have disproportionate punishments and that this would be a hypothetical example of one? 

&gt; I'm saying we shouldn't do that in this case because nothing about ""you decided you would be so pleased by using marijuana that you disregarded the law, and were punished under that law"" is unjust or disproportionate.

I don't understand this point. It sounds like you think it is IMPOSSIBLE for a law to be disproportionate. You could say the same thing about my jwalking example. Just because a well established law was followed in punishing them doesn't mean that punishment is automatically fair.  Disproportional punishment DO exist.  Do you think people who got life sentences for jwalking should receive at least some retroactive leniency?  If so, **where do you draw the line between things that should and should not some retroactive leniency**.  So far you've avoided giving any examples of anything that actually should receive retroactive leniency and also avoided making any judgement calls on the fairness of our current marijuana policies including things like the 3-strike rule.

I would understand your perspective if you felt that marijuana punishments were reasonable as is and might be on board for retroactive leniency if the punishments were more severe, but currently you seem to be arguing that the punishment is reasonable because it is the law.  You are making absolutely no room for an unreasonable law to exist, which is absolutely possible.

&gt; The same could be said for someone who had a DUI, wrecked their car but didn't hurt anyone else, and is not at present drunk.

I think your DUI example differs in several important regards:

* Just because nobody was injured doesn't mean their reckless actions didn't put people in danger.  Reckless actions that put other people in danger should be punished.  Society's retribution.
* Nobody is suggesting legalizing DUI so there is no reason why you might re-examine that person's punishment and not give them the punishment mandated by both past and current law.
* And the fact that this person isn't currently drunk isn't relevant, especially for a crime with such high levels of repeat offenses.
* Deterrence has already failed by the time you are punishing anybody.  That deterrence is both there for deterring their future potential offenses and future offenses of others.  If you simply didn't apply the punishment there would be no deterrence for others.  And deterring people from something that is no longer illegal isn't nearly as important as deterring something that is illegal and puts people in danger.  Sounds like you only want to deter people from willfully breaking the law because it is the law, which is a very draconian perspective and doesn't make room for the existence of possibly unjust laws.

The DUI perpetrator should absolutely get punished under the law and is fundamentally different than a marijuana offender in a post-legal world.

Keep in mind I'm not saying ALL legalized crimes should receive leanence.  As I've said before, marijuana dealers should still keep their punishments, but I believe that marijuana users should maybe receive some degree of leniency.  It most likely makes sense to make it clear what kind of leniency should be granted when the laws are passed that change the rules on marijuana, which would clear up any ambiguity and also ensure that we are, in fact, still punishing people exactly in line with the relevant laws.  But you don't think that should happen for marijuana specifically, but without ruling out the possibility that such retroactive leniency may be appropriate in other situations.  In which case, I think it is reasonable to ask: What situations would deserve retroactive leniency? And, if some situations do, what about marijuana specifically makes it not qualified for that retroactive leniency?  I refuse to accept that ""the law is the law"" and that no law can possibly be unjust and disproportionate.  Laws can be disproportionate."	3	False

Progressive movements have a structural problem that conservative movements don’t face—they are generally advocating for some new form of social or economic system, so they have to conceptualists and sell something that doesn’t actually exist.  

Conservative movements, on the other hand, are advocating for continuity or maybe a return to some idealized past.  It’s easier to imagine those worlds, even if they didn’t actually exist once you scratch a little at the nostalgia and rose tinted glasses.  

So “Make America Great Again” is a very easy idea to rally people around because people remember a time (or think they do) when working class people were upwardly mobile, crime was low, and America ran the world.

“Make the future great” is hard.  Great in what way?  Who are the winners and losers and how do I make sure I’m a winner?  Why should we believe you that your policy will actually work when no one has tried it before?  

So left leaning movements need to try to fill in those blanks.  And since the answers don’t exist yet, different people may have radically different ways of doing so, ways that are often incompatible with each other.   

Because the left is filling in the blanks, it’s also easy to fall into utopian traps.  Since there’s no way to test the idea against messy realities, it’s easy to convince yourself that *your* way will totally make everything better and that any compromise would simply be denying people the joy of that future.

None of which is to say that the left’s ideas are bad.  Just that to lean leftward is to join a political view that inherently tends to unrealistic utopian visions and circular firing squads. Meanwhile, real progress tends to come incrementally over long periods of time in ways that leave most everyone involved pretty unsatisfied.   

None of that may make you feel *better* about the left, but hopefully it helps to know that it’s not just you, it’s not a new problem, and really the best way to achieve anything is to figure out how to work despite those issues that worrying too much about railing against them."	172	False

That was the initial scope of things, but you've narrowed things way way down. Now it's ""this was to supplement private insurances and employer provided""... That's not free at all. Your employer pays for most of it, with most people paying a percent of the policy plus co-pay. We're on two totally different wavelengths. I'm sticking to the spirit of the question in your title. 

Testing alcohol and tobacco usage would require blood or urine samples. If you want to catch someone FRESHLY drunk, you could use a breathalyzer. And I know that you didn't say that drinking or smoking would be exclusionary behaviors, but you said they'd be factors in getting approved for the subsidy, or maybe that leads to a better bracket for the subsidy. There is very real economic reason to lie to this question, and unless you're going to build an entirely new bureaucracy around testing blood and urine for insurance, they can lie with impunity. You may say ""insurance companies already do this"", but they do this on the customer's dime for testing. If you're having the government pay for this, and you're requiring everyone to do it, and there's going to be some frequency of testing people over the years, this is going to cost a lot of money and take a lot of time. You're talking about building labs to run blood tests. It's the difference between hundreds of millions instead of just millions.

So those are my thoughts on my interpretation on how you asked the question. Going back to your narrower thoughts... ""This is for the gap of those who may not qualify for medicaid due to income but would be willing to take fitness tests and maintain their health to be insured""... that's a really niche group, everyone's going to fight and lobby to try and get qualified to be in this group, and the majority that would be left out would absolutely not stand for being left out of this. The vote for this would be gaggingly unpopular, the resources to get this operation off the ground would be staggering, and the project would not be worth anyone's time to implement considering how narrow the field that this would be covering. 

Should the government take a bigger role in the health and fitness of its citizens? Absolutely. It makes moral sense and it makes economic sense to work in a preventative capacity instead of having a focus on palliative for-profit care. But this isn't the way to go. There are bigger problems at play to the issue of healthcare. A lot of us don't have the time for excersize, the money to do it right, or even just the access to proper healthcare. If you think you have diabetes, but you don't have a job where you can afford the medication, why bring it up to the doctor? Best he can do is write it down into your medical history and you'll know, but you won't be able to do anything about it. Worst case, an insurer uses that info against you (sure it may be illegal to do that now, but the US has Trump in power and you literally never know what'll happen there. You guys came damn close to having pre-existing conditions come back last year. if you're smart and looking to the future, it's way too unknown what'll happen, so why take that chance?)"	7	False

Some instances of incest (most of them) can be inmoral, but it'll depend on the situation.

The things that can make incest inmoral, like most already mentioned, are: 

1) the relationship of power that may exist.

2) genetics: having children, or even risking having children, with a close relative is terribly wrong. Even when having protected sex, there's still a chance of pregnancy.

In the first case, it follows the same logic as to why it is wrong for a teacher to have sex with their students, even if the students are old enough to consent and are close to the teacher in age (like a 25 year old teacher, and an 19 year old student). In the same way that that is wrong, it's also wrong for an older sibling to have sex with the younger sibling, or even worse: a parent with their kids. 

For this same exact reason, it's also wrong for step siblings that have grown up together and one is older than the other to have a relationship. They share no blood, but it's still wrong. Or worse: a step parent and their step kid. It's just terribly wrong. Or even worse: and adoptive parent and their adoptive children.

As for the genetics and a possible incestuous pregnancy, it's self explanatory. It's just wrong. This is what makes a relationship of two cousins be wrong too. They may not have grown up together, but still share the same blood. So it'd be wrong for them to have a relationship.

Now ... Two gay cousins? In that case I see nothing wrong: they can't possibly have biological children together. Besides the uncomfortable situation at family reunions, which isn't their problem, I don't see an issue with that... Well, actually I do. I still think it's wrong in that case, cause the two of them are deciding to date each other and like I said, that's problematic for the rest of the family. I just don't think it's morally wrong. It's wrong in practice, but not morally wrong imo.

Also, if one of them is sterile and can't have children, it would be ok too.

Even the most famous incestuous relationship, Edipo... If he hadn't have found out his wife was his mom, and they couldn't have kids together, even that mom-son relationship would be ok in my eyes. If they find out, the dynamic changes and it becomes a problematic relationship, but if they never do, I see no issues. It's an incestuous relationship that's not morally wrong in any way cause they don't know they are related, so no weird power dynamics, and they can't have kids. Can you say that that relationship is morally wrong, or just wrong in any aspect of the word, not just morally? I don't think so.

TLDR: incest is not inherently wrong. But most incestuous relationship are. Each case should be analized differently based on the facts, and what makes the relationship problematic, rather than saying that every incestuous relationship is morally wrong."	1	False

We are simply *trained* not to apply that reason to certain categories of problems like overconsumption. As you point out above: We have the mental equipment, we choose not to use it. That’s distinctly different from “not being mentally equipped” to do it.

There basically nothing we can do about the biology people come pre-loaded with. But if you acknowledge that people *could* take steps to apply their reason more broadly than they do you are implicitly accepting that they have the capacity—the mental equipment—to do so.

In the same way that a person can carry a gun but never choose to use it, a person can have perfectly functional reasoning skills but choose not to apply them to their food selection. This is different from a person lacking the reasoning skills needed to select food rationally. I’m arguing that people do actually have the capacity and the skills to do it, they are simply conditioned not to use them in practice."	5	False

""It should be noted that Grinding is the core mechanic of many games, and some people enjoy it. For those people, this isn't a dark pattern. However, if Grinding is combined with other dark patterns, like Pay to Skip where you can spend money to skip parts of the grind, then this dark pattern can be amplified.

Another way this can be amplified is by combining it with the Wait to Play dark pattern. If you need to perform 10 tasks, but you only have enough energy to perform 5, now you have to put the game down and retain some Endowed Progress. This is a powerful urge to come back to the game later and complete your goal.""

Guilds/social obligations.

Ooh let's join this guild so i can do more content. oh no i'm kicked out for the guild because i can't contribute enough because i'm not paying money.  That's the game deliberately weaponizing peer pressure.

Many of these dark patterns are building blocks that become evil when combined with other stuff.  And that's what freemium games do all the darn TIME.

If you're the one making the choices, then you're still the one making the choices.

If you think deeper about it... it's a bit silly: Why would you ever want to make a choice that you don't want to make? That wouldn't make any logical sense, would it? Can that concept even *exist*... wanting something you don't want, or not wanting something you want? 

If you always interrupted the choices you want to make... wouldn't that mean you *don't* have free will, since you're now not allowed to choose what you want?

Worded differently: You're saying you don't have the ability to choose differently than what you are choosing?

But you're assigning the end goal of the socialist arm of the forum (which also controls the forum itself, and therefore the stated goals of the forum) to everyone within in. I'd bet good money that -most- people on r/antiwork are not actual socialists with socialist goals, which is why describing it as a ""movement"" is weird, because I don't think most participants on the subreddit are actually there for the original purpose of the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Labor reform as a movement has existed for a -very- long time and essentially embedded itself into the socialist sub (which is ironic because socialists often embed themselves into labor reform as well).

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 final thoughts:

A) I don't think your OP really captures the ""antiwork"" movement in an honest way, missing that most of the people posting about shitty bosses want labor reform and not socialism. Most of the people screen shotting their boss (i.e. the people you're complaining about) want better working conditions, not no work.

B) Your critique of the socialist goals falls short because your critique relies on capitalist assumptions of corporations and executives existing. Under anarcho-communism that wouldn't really be the case. Now, will anarcho-communism succeed in taking the nation by storm? Probably not, but issues like the people at the top of the hierarchy not understanding the problems of the little people or drops in production in a consumer economy aren't really problems in anarcho communism.

&amp;#x200B;

You're also making the assumption that the people with more information are acting in everyone's best interest.

There's no update to run and no system requirements to check. (Yes, the Xbox 360 (perhaps PS3 as well) will nag you like hell to update it, between 3 to 84 times before letting you play the game, but at least no special hardware requirements)

The requirements are really easy to look at online, sites like canyourunit can perform the test and rate your pc in seconds. So sure, while a console can always work, it's just as simple to check a pc game.

&gt;The controller gives a much better experience when playing RPG, racing, platformer, shooting games as well as others. The keyboard/mouse combo really is only great for strategy games.

The Keyboard/Mouse combo is supreme to the controller once you get used to it. The precision control of a mouse and keyboard has no comparison to a controller. You can see evidence of that [here.](http://www.rahulsood.com/2010/07/console-gamers-get-killed-against-pc.html)

&gt;Even if you have an iMac 27 inch screen with 2500xsomething resolution (I forgot what mine goes to, not currently at home), it's still MUCH more enjoyable to play on a 50 or 60 inch TV with a better sound system.

This is really subjective in my opinion. Some prefer TV while some prefer monitor, but a pc can work with either one and delivers better graphics than a console system and both console and PC have great headphone options and I prefer headphones so I don't think the sound system point applies to me personally.

&gt;It's more comfortable as well to be able to sit on the couch, with a controller that fits perfectly in your hand instead of having to either sit ""normally"" on a chair or if you try to slouch to get comfortable, it gets really awkward to use the keyboard/mouse.

I once again prefer sitting in a chair but I would alert you to one point. A lot of pc games are being made so that they have controller support now, so you could theoretically start using controllers and sit normally. Although a keyboard and mouse is really supreme.

&gt;PC gaming is just awkward. I personally just can't get used to it. Playing Fallout or Hitman on the Xbox feels a LOT better and more immersive than trying to aim with the mouse and using the keys. It feels wrong.

That is just personal preference. I was a console player for a while and then I switched to pc and while I had trouble like you said, but I eventually got used to it and I realized that pc gaming was better.

* Also, a couple of other points, PCs can be used as more than just a gaming station.

* PCs have great options for online stores and other things that deliver cheaper games with more options, e.g. mods etc. Look at [this](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/16236/) deal on steam. 

* PCs have a greater selection of games.

* PCs have better graphics capabilities and can play at higher resolutions.

* Downloaded games don't involve putting in a disc

* More hard drive space and more flexibility to upgrade

Edits:

* PC gaming has less kids.

* PC gaming multiplayer is free for most games outside of MMORPGS

* PC gaming has more serious players.

* PC communities are great, as are the modding communities.

More Edits:

* PCs can be used for plenty of other things other than gaming.

* Building a pc is a great learning experience

* You can upgrade your hardware.

* Easier video capture and it provides a platform to edit on

Based on your argument, you don't seem to understand technology, the Stone Age, history, human nature, ISIS, extremism, or nearly anything else you're talking about.

Let's start with ""technology."" You keep using that word. It does not mean what you seem to think it means. [Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) is essentially a fancy word for *tools and knowledge*, and shares a root with the word ""technique."" Technology can be a physical tool, like a hammer, or a knitting machine, or an airplane. Or it could be knowledge of a process or system, like how we synthesize ammonia or model an economy.

The ""Stone Age"" refers to when technology was primarily *made of stone*. We hadn't figured out how to refine metals yet, so we had tools made out of stones and wood and animal parts. Need to cut something? Use a sharp rock. Need to break open a nut? Use a blunt rock. So when we finally *did* figure out how to start making tools out of bronze and iron and steel, we were *no longer in the Stone Age.* Does that make sense to you?

You've made this absurd jump from technology to *ideology*, which have *absolutely nothing to do with one another.* Technology is necessarily based on natural laws like physics, chemistry and biology. Ideology, on the other hand, is really just based on *what people decide to believe*, which is heavily influenced by human nature.

Which brings us to the core of what you seem to be struggling with. Human nature is as flawed as it is unchanging; no matter what new technologies we develop, humanity will always be fighting with itself. Cavemen did it with stone-tipped spears, modern humans do it with guns and bombs. The difference in weapons is the difference in tech. To say that ""people are still killing one another"" is the result of technological stagnation is to misunderstand the fundamental role of technology in society."	16	False

Just because you are not a social norm, it doesn't mean you don't respect them. Also, facial tattoos do not mean someone is in a gang or has been in prison. That is close minded, however it is your choice to avoid them or not.

No matter what your appearance is you are also sending a message to society. Wearing Dockers and Polo's sends a message to society. So this is a moot point.

I had an ex-boyfriend who was a tattoo artist, he traveled the world and had many tattoo artists do work on him. Tattoos are an art form, and people like to showcase them. That is in fact the entire point of a tattoo in lieu of cultural tradition. They are inked on someone to be seen, I can't understand why you think because they are inked on someone's bicep opposed to their neck people want them to go unnoticed.

When it comes to men, this kind of thinking actually comes to me naturally. I always have some kind of inner monologue going through my head when I'm out and about, and thoughts like these are what I usually think about when I see other men.

With women, though, the first thing I think about is their sex. And I try to shake off those thoughts instead of dwelling on them, because I know it's not how I should be thinking.

&gt;3) You mention that you have never had any female friends, and that sex grosses you out; have you ever been in a romantic relationship?  If not, you may just be anxious around women, and it could be causing you to overthink this.

I haven't been in a romantic relationship, no. I don't know if I could even be in one considering my predicament.

I have social anxiety, and anxiety in general, so having anxiety around women on top of that wouldn't be impossible. But if that's really what it is, how could I work on fixing this?

Equally possible, maybe they're just very confident that their prices are some of (if not the) best prices you can find.

&gt;That's possible....but I doubt it in the vast majority of cases.

Think of it like a warranty.  You might say, ""Why would anyone be stupid enough to offer a warranty on their product? Why don't they just make a product that doesn't break?"" But that misses the point of the warranty.  The warranty doesn't just say, ""Hey, our product doesn't break!"" Anyone can *say* that. Talk is cheap. The warranty says ""We are so confident that our product doesn't break, we'll give you a brand new one if it does break!"" The message to the consumer is the important thing. Being forced to occasionally pay for some repair because the products aren't really *invincible*, just extremely well-made, is a small price to pay for such a valuable message, and it's one that people with crappy products *can't* afford to pay.

Same deal with price-matching. Anyone can *say* ""everyday low prices"" or ""no one offers the same value we do!"" But not every store can say ""we'll match our competitors' price on any product"", because then they would actually be selling many or most of their goods below cost and bleeding money. Only the stores that are actually set up to have rock-bottom costs and rock-bottom prices can offer that, because they know they won't have to actually honor it very often. Once again, it's a signal that is hard to imitate and well-worth paying for if once in a while someone finds a better deal somewhere else."	1	False

For most people, it's not a gnawing fear. I mean, for doomsday preppers, sure, but they already isolate and alienate themselves from everyone else anyway.

&gt;And once they inevitably die, the festering wound that remains will never heal. Nay, it will merely grow necrotic, rotting bits and parts of you, leaving you forever empty, forever lacking, forever at verge of tears when a memory surfaces - never to heal.

Rarely. Grief hurts, but it rarely festers as you describe. And it's rare for a person to consider the parting as grief enough to outweigh the pleasure of knowing the lost or the displeasure of solitude. In other words, ""it's better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.""

&gt;In a world without afterlife, the only moral choice is for each and every person to become a hermit, swear upon anti-natalism and spare future generations of having to suffer in an ephemeral world.

Only if your perception is so warped and skewed that you consider the grief of loss to be greater than the joy of presence and less than the pain of isolation. Most don't.

&gt;But in a world with afterlife? There is no such poison, no such necrotic wound. For you know that you will meet again.

So too is killing a sleeping man fine. As they feel no pain and they and their loved ones will be reunited. I know you say that your view on this won't change, but surely the fact that this view explicitly permits murder so long as it is timed and executed properly will give you pause.

It borders on Humpty-Dumptying words to fit meaning, rather than just picking the right word for the meaning. 

I disagree.  I think that it's the word that people currently use it will help people to understand what I'm after.  But I'm absolutely open to better words and terms, like ""Life Studies.""

&gt;The alternative is to understand--not believe, but understand--the many possible ways of addressing issues, approaching and answering questions, including the perspective that some things simply don't matter at all, such as ""what is the meaning of life?"" You could know many different answers to it, but also understand that the question may be a red herring.

Yes, I think philosophical conceits like these are exactly the kind of thing that people could get together to discuss and learn about WHILE building a community and raising positive awareness about atheism, agnosticism, and non-denominationalism.

&gt;As you go through life you'll have experiences and learnings that make you favor one over another, and change that favor several times. Losing faith in any particular one is unimportant, because you're not looking at it as if there was a switch in your head set to ""believe/not-believe"" and there's a man at the gates of heaven who will only let you in depending on the position of the switch when you die.

Yes, that's why our church deals in tools instead of doctrines.

&gt;So what does a church for atheists preach? Do they pick one answer for each of these questions and stick to them exclusively and immutably, or do they just point to the philosophy shelves at the library and say ""there ya' go, have at 'em""?

No, a church for atheism explores literature, science, poetry, personal experience, as well as thousands of valuable ideas from already existing religions and creeds.  There are no limits to the sources of knowledge that we can pull from in our pursuit of tools to help us commune with one another, assist our community, and help us resolve weighty life issues, even if temporarily.

&gt;Is it necessary to sit in pews and listen to a sermon? 

No, not at all.  Discussion groups probably work better.

&gt;Why not just put it in a blog post?

Internet discussion groups could work in some ways, but I think the internet is rarely successful at building strong, familial communes.  It's much better suited to the anonymous hatespeech common to reddit and 4chan.

&gt;Is it necessary to sing songs? I can sing on Karaoke nights (very badly).

Does singing Karaoke help you develop a sense of community or deal with deep life answers?  It might.

&gt;Is it necessary for the like-minded to come together in one place? If so, then that means an irish pub on Thames street in Baltimore is a ""church for atheists"" because they have a monthly meetup there. They occasionally even talk about atheism.

Yes.  I think that this is a first step towards exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not sure why this idea bothers you so much.  If they talked about atheism or ""life issues"" more regularly and worked to build community, then it would be almost exactly what I'm talking about.

This does exist in some places by the way.  My understanding is that the atheist community of Austin is very outgoing and organized and helpful.  It just isn't a common thing to find around the country.

&gt;We get out of our homes every day, several times a day, for many many reasons. Saying that we should have one place instead of 10 doesn't make any sense, because I can think about philosophy anywhere. I can read Dawkins in Starbucks, I can think about physics on the drive to work, I can check-out Harris and Hitchens at the same time that I check out Harry Potter.

You, you, you.  Sorry, but this screams stereotypical gen-Y specialness to me.  You can and should continue doing whatever you want, wherever you want.  But some of us value the idea of community, social support, and local outreach.  Some of us don't want to go it alone."	1	False

Gacha mechanics don't work that way. You're expected to pay somewhere north of 100 dollars for a chance at getting a random legendary/ultra rare/5 star etc. character.

It is designed to entice you to pay large amounts of money, and DEPENDS on the fact that you likely won't get what you want, which triggers the feeling of ""sunk costs"" and makes people likely to spend even more money on the hope of maybe getting the thing that they actually wanted to pay for.

It is not a rational transaction. Do you think that many of those people would pay that amount if you just directly set a price of $100 for a single character? I don't think so, even though that would be a BETTER deal than what people instead get for their $100. And that by itself shows the inherently abusive nature of the system.

Note that I'm speaking as someone who has at least 10+ years of experience playing various gacha games with various degrees of scumminess behind their business model. I think Genshin ranks somewhere in the lower middle in terms of abusive mechanics, since their high reliance on pity mechanics makes the Gacha surprisingly predictable and something you can plan around. So Genshin is not anywhere near the worst offender, but still carries many of the negative aspects that gacha games automatically bring to the table.

Meanwhile, all of the positive aspects are just as present in an F2P game with a direct shop rather than randomized loot, like League of Legends or the recent Pokemon Unite."	10	False

For misleading interpretations of data in news journals, sure, that would definitely catch their eye, but most of the manipulation that happens is a part from the numbers. 

All manipulation starts with numbers. Politicians massage the numbers to make a budget work. Oh, budget shortfall? If we predict growth at 3.5% instead of 2.5%, our numbers magically work! 

Data is how people avoid falling into manipulation. Trying to find a position on gun regulation? You can look at how gun ownership correlates to gun violence, or you can see how accessible guns are to violent criminals. You start with the research and form policy from that.

When you start without data, when you just say, ""GMO products are bad for health and evironment,"" you will always be open to manipulation. When you have data, when you understand the numbers and the science, you cannot be manipulated.

&gt; Math won't make a liberal that they're getting over-infuriated by a story about some official allegedly touching another woman's ass.

Data will. What is the ""allegedly""? What is the strength of the evidence? What is the history of both parties? This is classic science. Overreaction without data is unwarranted. Psychology isn't the answer; good, critical science is.

&gt;There are other psychological factors that affect you through the media like if we like dude in the frame (for whatever irrelevant reasons), and fail to fact check whenever an ""expert"" whom we have never met until now on the television speaks up.

It's indeed interesting to learn in social psychology the effects of experts on our thinking, or to spend time in philosophy debating fallacies. The question becomes at what cost? What does the school system need to give up to make philosophy and psychology critical parts of the education? Wouldn't that money be better spent bolstering science, which also forces a critical evaluation of data?

&gt; According to the Myers-Briggs personality statistics, a little more than only like 8% of the population (at least in the US) are classified in the Analyst group (the group in which the most ""intelligent"" or ""aware"" personality types are concentrated). Not everyone is as curious as us, which gives us the reason for education because without the requirement of going to school I doubt anyone would, paralleling the reason for having a psychology/computer science class.

MBTI is fortunately or unfortunately not [accurate](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28315137), but your point still stands that not everyone in the popular asks questions about accuracy in the media or the effects of bias on politics. The question then comes, why do you think that one psychology class or more computer science would have an effect on these people, particularly when those classes necessitate cutting other programs?"	5	False

This isn't true though.

Vegans absolutely LOVE to throw around the emissions of livestock.  But they drastically overstate the reality.  [Data from the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) suggests that all agriculture produces only 11% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US (which produces 20% of the world's beef) - and those greenhouse gasses are not just from livestock, but rather:

&gt; 11% of 2020 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.

They cite transportation as 27% of emissions - nearly triple that of agriculture.

And if you dig into the details on agriculture, you find that:

&gt; Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, produce methane (CH4) as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents over a quarter of the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.

Over a quarter of the 11%.  Or, less than one third of the 11% - or if we take the range of 1/4 to 1/3, that is 2.75 to about 3.5% of emissions - approximately 1/10th of the emissions for transportation.  Of course we can compare this with your link where they state that ""Food transport accounted for only 6% of emissions.""  They obviously came to some different conclusions about the % contribution of livestock - but this is largely because they factor in the land use, which is smaller for humans vs livestock - but I think one can make the argument that human use would go up drastically to account for removing meat from diets, so it isn't as simple as remove livestock and we remove the 16% of emissions accounted for in land use for animal feed.

There is a [whole different report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/) detailing how emissions from agriculture can be controlled, but some studies suggest that [livestock can become carbon neutral](https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/AN16438).  As well as papers suggesting that the total sum of [land use contributions from livestock can also become carbon neutral, or possibly even a carbon sink](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620346667?via%3Dihub).

And even if we decide that my (well, the EPA's) numbers are optimistic, there is still the fact that, unlike carbon from fossil fuels, [carbon from methane has a short half life - about 12 years](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane).  This is important.  Lets pretend in the world right now there is 0 livestock creating methane emissions.  And tomorrow we wake up, and all of our current day livestock is here.  For the next 12 years, emissions from methane will accumulate, resulting in warming - but after 12 years, assuming our livestock numbers have been maintained static, [they would stop contributing to additional warming](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-a-new-way-to-assess-global-warming-potential-of-short-lived-pollutants/)  (or https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/climate-metrics-under-ambitious-mitigation/ if you prefer the paper) - they will have reached an equilibrium at which their emissions are being cycled out of the atmosphere at the same rate they're going in.  This isn't true for CO2 emissions.  You cannot compare emissions from transportation 1:1 to emissions from livestock - so even in the event they are completely comparable in terms of emissions produced, the transportation emissions have a drastically higher contribution to warming."	1	False

In part, it's hard for us to fairly assess the level of risk, because he might arguably be the most qualified expert to judge how dangerous a situation actually is.

At some point, the real source of risk is simply the unknown. Nobody has successfully done [x] before. Any time you're attempting to do [x], there's a high risk of failure and negative consequences. But we also don't know it can be done until *somebody* does it successfully. Someone has to go first.

I think a lot of people view him rather heriocally because they believe he took those risks with good intentions. That it took courage, and allowed many of us to be able to understand our world better rather than fear it, and thus we should be grateful.

So when people approach with a callous attitude towards his loss, basically ""blaming"" him for his own death, it comes across as dismissive of the value of his choice to take those risks generally.

He was also an NBA all star every year that he played in the NBA, except for '59 (his first) and '70.

Strictly? No. We do have an infinite resource of energy available to use: The Sun. As you're probably aware, advancements in solar cell (and battery) technology are being made quickly.

You may also think that the population of the Earth will continue to increase forever. That's also not the case. Global population is projected to peak at 11-12 billion at the end of the century.

∆. I was not aware that the EU lacked that authority.

&gt;The EU absolutely cannot invade Morocco, Algeria, Russia, or anyone else. If the refugees coming are causus belli, then the nations to which they're coming can shoot the boats with guns. If they're not willing to do that, then no dice on forcing their neighbor states to take refugees via the use or threat of military force. Likewise, the EU treaties expressly state that the use of military force is governed by the national governments, not the EU. The EU cannot give a military order to a French soldier.

Can they legally shoot non-EU boats full of non-EU citizens without risking an incident with a non-EU neighbor?

&gt;EU member states are bound by treaties relating to refugees and can't flatly refuse them. They can hold hearings for each refugee to determine if they have a legitimate fear of persecution, but the truth of the matter is that ISIS is really nazi-like, and almost anyone fleeing an ISIS controlled area does meet the legal standard for being a refugee and entitled to protection in a country party to the Convention relating to the status of refugees. Japan's rejection rate would change in a hurry if a boatlift were coming out of North Korea.

∆. It looks like, although there are geopolitical issues in Northeast Asia, Japan is somewhat isolated from the refugee crises as it is far from North Africa and the Eurasian borderlands where so many refugees are coming from or through. I'd imagine that if Japan was turning back or, Amaterasu forbid, shooting boats full of North Koreans that its international image would take a hit, even if they were passing through South Korea (which was washing its hands of responsibility for them)."	1	False

That's a bit simplistic I think. I certainly won't argue that it is just the fault of feminists either though.
The truth is, both MRAs and Feminists have extremely unhelpful extremist elements in their midst that frankly need to be denounced by the mainstream of both sides. Feminists love to complain about Misogyny in the MRM, but ignore any misandry among their own, or even claim that it doesn't exist.

We agree here. This would stop being true if feminism and the MRM were working on the same side--the radical outliers on both sides could be more readily called out without it becoming a feminism vs. MRM thing. We could instead just dismiss them as outliers. So many people completely dismiss feminism or the MRM because of the outliers (and honestly the MRM has far worse problems with this--see r/mensrights, or the simple fact that people fucking hate the MRM). 

&gt;The fact is, it simply isn't a coincidence that the movement is called FEMinism.

Of course not--there were huge historical issues that went into that. At the time, it made sense. We can't just leave it there. We have to fix it.

&gt;And there are issues were feminist are not only not acting on men's issues, but actively oppose equality for men. 

Yep. We can address this two ways: 1) associate with the MRM and make this a men's vs. women's argument, or 2) associate with feminism and call this a misstep. Which it is. It's a massive fuckup.

Basically, I don't disagree with any of the problems you've brought up, but I think the solution to the problems is for feminists and MRAs to come together and work on common solutions, not to fight each other to the point where the public hates us all."	7	True

Considering the MLB has had consistently declining viewership over the last few decades I don't think they should be risking this because they assume that fans might be ok with it.

&gt;2) On the other hand, there does exist a subset of fans (not me, particularly) passionate about the unfairness of the current rule. Changing it would appease them and partially offset the first group.

Each of these fans wants a change to be made to either get rid of the DH as a whole or add the DH to both leagues, you'd still piss of half of them, along with half of baseballs fanbase.

&gt;3) Looking at the stats, I suppose it's possible to allow the AL to keep the DH for intraleague games, but have all interleague games go by NL rules (where there appears to be no significant advantage). I don't know how well a compromise like this would actually go over with fans, and really doubt it would be passed by the MLB, but it's something to think about.

I don't think that's realistic at all. It's interesting but logically doesn't make sense, as if it's awarding a specific side without fully implementing that side.

Basically the advantages to this are the MLB makes the game slightly fairer, while at the same time risking a significant drop in viewership. Yes the drop in viewership may not be that significant, but I don't think it's worth the risk."	0	False

1. Making a market illegal doesn't stop it from existing if there is enough demand (see: drugs). But for most situations, you're right. Adding legal barriers would make the risks outweigh the profits for most scalpers. But if this occurred, venues would almost certainly raise prices naturally in order to keep their current profit margins (because the scalpers and the ticket brokers are one in the same; venues are getting kickbacks from the secondary market). 

2. Keeping tickets tied to the purchaser's identity would solve the scalping problem, but it would create an even bigger problem with regards to tickets going un-bought or un-used. I know personally I would be much more hesitant to buy a ticket for a show 6+ months out if I had no chance of trading or re-selling it. So it is a solution, just not necessarily one that would improve the situation. And this would cause uncertainty for the venues, as people are more hesitant to buy, and that uncertainty would probably lead to higher prices. 

3. Yeah, but boycotts don't work when people want the thing. It will always be a prisoner's dilemma, where each individual is better off doing what's best for them, at the cost of the aggregate. It's the ideal solution, but not at all realistic. Not to mention, secondary market prices would crash right before the event, making it even harder to get people to not buy.


You make good points though. I think you've highlighted some solutions that aren't directly ticket price increases. Are those solutions actually better than the current situation? That could be debated, but that isn't what I posted, so ∆"	0	False

What I read about the application of that law suggests that it has been exclusively used as a leverage against bigger crimes - prosecutors throw it in the indictment to increase the pressure to take a plea.

The bigger problem is that you are not directly talking about adultery, but about a ""conspiracy to cover up a felony misdemeanor"". That kind of indictment would *really* be a stretch for a sitting POTUS. Even attempting to impeach the POTUS for felony-misdemeanor might be questionable as the question whether felony-misdemeanor adultery constitutes a ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" as used by the constitution would have to be settled first.

The checks and balances we could theoretically use to deal with something like a speculative financial crisis or corporate tax evasion do not exist for the subtle but incredibly consequential problems created by their products. 

3) These companies are ludicrously wealthy. They make unbelievable amounts of money off of their work and it’s pretty hard for me to believe that some of these choices are motivated by economic survival and not unadulterated greed.

4) It sounds like you’re describing externalities to some extent when you discuss hurting someone else or something else as a result of the production process. We have processes to deal with externalities in other industries, but it’s really hard to quantify them for something like software use. But that doesn’t mean we can’t try to find ways to minimize those externalities through cultural or legislative change. I get that companies need to do everything they can to edge out the competition but we have always tried to restrict what is permissible based on our social priorities and that’s no different for big tech."	1	False

The lending institution, as we saw in the 2008 crash in mortgages, could make more money from the acquisition and then again when the targeted company is liquidated, rather than extending financing directly to the company and make less money from the unsuccessful loan. Why wouldn't the debt created in buying the targeted company rest the acquiring firm?

How can I saddle my home with the debt, so in case I no longer can pay the mortgage my credit score is not affected?

If there's an answer to this other than ""well the house isn't really that similar to LBO"" I would jump at the chance to refinance my home so I get that mortgage off my credit history and place it into my home's credit history; my debt to income ratio would be off the chain if that could be the case, which is why Bain Capital doesn't put the debt into their own balance sheet.

Science is not based on axioms but on theories. Scientists build their base of knowledge by going back and forth between general assumed principles and particular observations. This is what moral realists and ethicists do as well.

Science is distinguished from polytheism because it is based on different set of unverifiable beliefs that can not be reached through logic or axioms. For instance: ones beliefs ought to be consistent, the best predictor for future events are past events, conclusions should be based on empirical evidence. One can imagine situations and universes where these statements would not be true, but that alone doesn’t make them false. 

Similarly, a moral realist will start by making an assumption and then testing it, seeing if it coheres with other beliefs, if it’s claims are falsifiable, if we can use these principles to predict outcomes and communicate effectively.

Strictly speaking, the anti-realist position isn’t necessarily false, but it isn’t verifiable either, and if it rests on requiring axioms for all claims to truth, you can very easily fall into nihilism. "	1	False

And to respond substantively: I agree that limiting exposure to misinformation is helpful, though I think there's another perhaps-too-neglected aspect of combating conspiracy nuts: the human factor – assuming good faith, trying to understand rather than condemn, and, in line with the analogy, remaining cognizant of people's elephants.

And I just want out with my kids tonight to walk the neighborhood, so I don't know what to say other than you are just seeing more things that exist than had before.  

Hell, my neighborhood had kids who were clearly from somewhere else driven up, hopped out and did their thing, went back, and the car moved to the next house.  So I think the internet has made these things more obvious when they happen than before, and some people might prefer it to the non-trivial pain in the ass that Halloween is for parents.

What do I mean?  Well, I have smaller kids, so there are 4 choices for what we do on Halloween:

1) Kids stay in so we can hand out candy.

2) We all go out so we can trick or treat, but house is empty.

3) One parent does house, one does kids.

4) Half and Half (one parent does first shift, another does second).  

Especially if you are a single parent, not having to deal with all the specifics of the Holiday is totally reasonable.  If you go with your kids, you leave your house dark. If you stay in, the kids don't get to go.  Trunk or Treat allows a bit more flexibility to celebrate the holiday in less favorable circumstances."	18	False

Yes. Go on r/Nicegirls and see hundreds of examples.

&gt;What I've seen is women pointing out that beauty standards are unfair and make it harder for women who don't conform.

Yes, but I think inherent unfairness is kinda a given with life. For example, I'm below average height. Women supposedly do not find short men very attractive. There are some things I could do;
I can complain about it, and let that define me. Cynically bringing it up any chance I get. I can acknowledge it to the woman like that one bagel shop guy, essentially forcing the disadvantage even more so upon myself. Or I can just act as though it isn't a factor, and try my luck. Guess what? No one has even mentioned it. Because no one cares. Will they notice it? Probably. If they built up this expectation of me and then found out that I was a wee-man, would they disappointed? Probably. Am I going to let that define me? No. If it doesn't work, better luck next time. 

Point of fact, your disadvantages are only devastating if you let them be. Being bitter and resentful towards it, complaining about it, bringing attention to it, all stem from, in my opinion, the psychology that inceldom is birthed from. They are similar. A tall woman with no breasts and a bird nose that complains about unfair beauty standards being why she can't find a partner and ridicules men for only wanting a petite, big tittied blonde is an incel to me. These same women could find a partner if they truly tried, but they just assume that they're disgusting, listen to the assholes, and decide they are going to be alone because men are shallow and their culture has created a situation where she has no sexual and romantic value."	4	False

Consensus, public opinion, or any argument that a certain group, amount of individuals with certain credentials hold a certain view, is not a valid argument within science. To deem something as true or to believe in something on the basis of a group opinion is wholeheartedly wrong. Science requires facts, data and evidence that can be recreated, not public opinion regardless of who's opinion. I apologize if that came across as a bit harsh, but I find the argument that a person should believe scientists simply because they are labeled as such damaging. There is no room for belief as a indicator of truth in science; and I find it quite harmfully to the legitimacy of science when people assert other should trust and believe in science. Science in its very concept requires a kind of open minded skepticism to properly function. I would like to stop the argument that a consensus has any useful barring on the truth.

There is no reasonable doubt or any question of what happened like there was in the Micheal Brown case.

As a matter of law, it may have in fact been correct not to indict Pantaleo.  I'm gonna go over the two charges that could be applicable, second degree murder, and second degree manslaughter.

First degree murder requires murder plus another felony (e.g. murder while committing robbery), or a couple other circumstances that don't apply.

So, second degree murder in NY is [defined as follows:](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/THREE/H/125/125.25)

&gt;A person is guilty of murder in the second degree when: 1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person

Did Pantaleo intend to cause the death of Garner?  If he did not plan and intend to cause death, he is not guilty of murder.  My impression is that he was trying to arrest Garner, not kill him, and did a really bad job of it.

So next up is manslaughter.  Manslaughter in the second degree in NY is [defined as follows:](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/THREE/H/125/125.15)

&gt;A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: 1. He recklessly causes the death of another person

Since recklessness is the key to this, we also need to see [the definition of recklessness:](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/ONE/B/15/15.05)

&gt;A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto.

In looking at this, the key is whether Pantaleo took an *unjustifiable* risk in the manner in which he detained Garner.  If Pantaleo was lawfully allowed to arrest Garner, it's hard to say that a chokehold is totally unjustifiable.  NYPD policy notwithstanding, an arrest is a situation where violent force to subdue a person is lawfully permitted, and a chokehold for about 20 or 30 seconds is very rarely fatal.

If Pantaleo had no legal grounds to arrest Garner, then Pantaleo would be guilty of manslaughter, since he would have no justification for any violence against Garner whatsoever.

The cops offer both a plea deal: if they give info on the other prisoner the snitch gets off free and the other guy gets three. If both prisoners talk, both get two years. If neither talk, both get one year. 

Obviously the best option is to stay silent, but only if each prisoner knows the other will do so as well. But there is an incentive to talk -- you could get off free!

In the drug company scene, ""talking"" by developing a Cure is a false win. Sure, you get a temporary boost of money but a decade down the line your company is struggling to get half the profit you used to. A few more decades and you're fighting for scraps with the other companies. 

It's not really a prisoner's dilemma because the reward for making a cure is poisoned bait. This means each company can rely on the other companies not wanting to shoot themselves in the foot. So there's no competitive incentive to develop the cure ""because if we don't, someone else will"".

You still don't get anywhere close to 2x the driving distance.  If you work a 4 hour Uber shift, you don't end up 4 hours from home.   And the longer you work, the more efficient that, what, typically 30 minute (?) drive back home becomes.

AND they let you specify [your desired location to end a ride](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/basics/driver-destinations/).  So towards the end of your shift start trying to have it head home and you're even less likely to have to do a bunch of unpaid driving.

And if you can figure out how to get your mileage costs down to below 15 cents, then even on the rare occasion when it may cost you twice the miles, its still profitable.

Is there anything wrong with my source? Did the stress on *additional* miles makes sense?  If you're a 10,000 mile/year driver and you drive an extra 10,000 miles for Uber, that extra is takes your cost from $7,929 to $10,662, an increase cost of $2,733 or $0.27 per mile.

But I think OP is in part objecting to the fact that although it makes intuitive sense to assign blame unevenly to different parties, the actual laws for damages awarded to a plaintiff who is partially at fault will be something more like the following:

&gt; 1) Allow the plaintiff to recover the amount of total damages to him, reduced by the percentage of fault he is assigned.
2) Allow the plaintiff to recover only if he was an equal or lower percentage at fault than each defendant. Or 3) Allow the plaintiff to recover only if he was less at fault than each of the defendants.

The only problem as I see it is that moral relativism still allows for ruling classes/parties to subjugate the people by declaring certain issues/stances/beliefs as immoral for whatever reason. For example, if there is an emerging party declaring that all women should have the right to vote, the class in power can declare that women are inferior to men, it is immoral for them to think of anything except for raising children, and therefore should not have the individual right to vote. This further solidifies their power via the mechanism of moral relativism.

While moral objectivism may not actually be that objective since it is operating on the assumptions you brought up, it still is universal for all humans and therefore is less able to be subject to corruption by ruling classes. For example, if we agree that humans within a nation should have the right to vote, this applies to *all* humans in that nation."	0	False

One of the main jobs of police is calm de-escalation, isn't it human nature to get nervous in high stress environments? Police should absolutely expect that, especially if they just pulled a gun on someone. (Also this anxiousness could easily be compounded by the perception of cops treating minorities more violently). This is the same reason that the murder of Daniel Shaver was 100% unjustified even though he didn't follow the commands perfectly. Being scared and nervous when you think someone might murder you should not at all chip away at your right not to be murdered.

Does your argument mean that people who have nervous ticks/not great English fluency/certain mental illnesses can never be 100% innocent if they are shot by the police? Put those groups in a high stress police situation where they may be shot and there is no way they don't act in a way that police might construe as erratic (twitching, being confused, not perfectly following commands, or just being and acting scared)

Also, this is a little off-topic but, isn't this a little bit of a semantic debate? I do believe that Floyd was 100% not responsible for his murder, but even if your position was self-evident fact, why does it matter if the police were only 90-98% unjustified in murdering a guy? It's still obviously unjustified. This percentage system feels like a roundabout way to victim-blame and stop the police (both the individuals involved and the institution) from accepting personal responsibility.

Saying that gender should be kept neutral except when relevant is one way of conceptualizing gender equality, but I don't think it's the only valid way of looking at the issue.

Put another way, I think you are wrapping up in this OP a concept of what gender equality *should* look like, and your own concept might not include ""anyone interested in [the] equality thereof.""

This is going to be highly context dependent. Saying ""that man"" when you are in a room full of mostly women is breaking from the female default. For example, it's not uncommon to hear ""that male fashion designer,"" ""the male nurse,"" or ""that male social worker,"" simply because these fields are female dominated.

There's nothing inherently wrong with recognizing when something breaks from the norm (Eminem was, for a long time ""the white rapper"" or Muggsy Bogues was ""the short basketball player"" simply because of how unusual they were in their contexts) and it's human nature to do so.

Because while she's totally allowed to call out AIPAC for promoting policies she doesn't like (and, like I said, I don't either), she resorted to using classic Jewish stereotypes of greed, deep statism, and lack of loyalty to their home country to make an incorrect claim about how AIPAC operates. AIPAC does not directly donate money to representatives, they don't have undue influence on our government, and they are very much an American organization. What made her statements anti-semitic is not her criticism of AIPAC, but that she couldn't even criticize them without resorting to the same stereotypes that have gotten Jews persecuted for centuries. Clearly, as you've demonstrated in your post, it's pretty fucking easy to criticize Israel without using these tropes, so it's a shame that a public figure like Omar, someone who is supposed to understand what she's talking about, couldn't do that. It was a mistake for sure, but that doesn't make the words not anti-semitic. 

&gt;That being said, I feel like Israel has been the transgressor most of the time.

Which conflicts exactly did Israel start? I don't really consider the pre-state era violence to be anyones fault other than the British to be honest, but since the establishment of Israel as a country it has basically always been Arabs starting shit.

Likewise it's offensive to have a white actor in a black role, because of shitty things that happened in the past.  But it's not offensive to have a Maori play an Arab, because there's no history there.

It is almost set-piece identical to what happened in 2000 after which Kim Jong-il began nuclear testing.  Adding a Nobel peace prize would just be yet another identical feature to the 2000 Inter-Korean talks.

My opinion when sects squabble with each other about who is a ""true"" Christian or a ""true"" Muslim is that no one has exclusive ownership other those titles, none of them are actually doing what god ""intended"" for them to do, because there is no god. No of them can ever be proved to be the ""true"" version of the faith.

However, semantically and culturally, I think it is possible to propose definitions for ideologies. The proposed definitions can be debated, but we can strive for agreement. For example, we have the concept of a ""libertarian,"" someone who values liberty and is at least skeptical of state power. If someone says ""I belong to a certain branch of libertarianism that believes in a centrally-planned economy,"" we'd dismiss that position as an oxymoron. You can't expect us to consider you a libertarian when you are violating an **essential quality** of that concept.

So what are the **essential qualities** of a Christian? You may say ""following Jesus of Nazareth."" I think that's too broad. Muslims and followers of the Baháʼí Faith may claim to ""follow Jesus of Nazareth,"" but they're obviously not Christians. 

So maybe being a Christian is more narrow. I propose that the **essential qualities** of a Christian are belief in (1) the Incarnation and (2) the Trinity.

Mormonism lacks both of these.

I work in a factory. We have a union. If you were to ask people at my job whether or not we *should* have a union, I'd be willing to bet you'll get a majority response of ""yes.""

Yes, I understand, unions are not the same as the workers owning the means of production . . . but they can be. And in some places, worker owned and operated cooperatives started from union organizing. It's a business model that has been tested and proven to work.

Furthermore, I've found that if you can sit people down and explain to them what socialism *is* and *how it works in practice*, most people agree that it's a perfectly fine way to structure a business.

If it works for a few businesses, why wouldn't it work for all businesses?

&gt; Property rights as they are currently are valued by Working and Middle class peoples, and would resist the radical change required to realize a socialized workplace or anything further.

What property? Are you talking about my car, or my computer, or my cell phone? Or are you talking about the building where my employer makes their product? (Sorry, I meant, ""the building wherein my employer claims ownership over everything, despite the fact that a handful of individuals are incapable of producing the luxury goods we build every day."")

""The means of production"" is what we're talking about. But what are those means? Equipment, materials, component parts, knowledge, logistical or maintenance support, utilities (like electricity or water), and so on. These are typically owned by the capitalist (or the business, which is owned by a small group of wealthy people); but the thing is, under a socialist economic model, there's nothing that stops individuals from owning these things. We have businesses under capitalism. We can have small businesses under socialism.

So I'm still confused about how, *exactly*, ""property rights as they are currently valued"" causes people to resist transitioning from capitalism to socialism.*

(*I mean, I *know* why people are resistant, in general, but it has very little to do with the practicality of making that transition and *everything* to do with people misunderstanding what socialism is and why it's Good, Actually™️.)

On point #3, we agree: there is a lot of dissent among leftists about how to go about making meaningful change in our world. *A lot* of that dissent is fomented by right wing rhetoric designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves . . . so maybe we should stop listening to what conservatives and capitalists tell us about socialism? 🤔 maybe . . .

&gt; Nearly every Socialist revolution has resulted in anti-democratic, coercive, highly corrupt single party states that were achived thru bloodshed.

This is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed and overcome.

The fact that it hasn't happened yet, however, is not a reason to say that it *will never* happen. I'm betting, if we look at specific examples of failed socialist states, we're going to find that capitalist states intervened in ways designed to bring about the collapse of the emerging socialist state . . . but logically speaking, the argument ""all prior attempts have failed"" doesn't *prove* that all *future* attempts will *automatically* fail.

To your final point, I have only this to offer: money is made up. We can change how we use it, how we understand it, or even what it means. Hell, we could get rid of it entirely if we could just agree on a path forward.

In closing (for now), I find this an interesting thing to say:

&gt; The cure to capitalism in these cases is worse than capitalism itself.

because it implies that you recognize capitalism is flawed. Like, as in, almost like a virus or a disease. If that's the case, what do you propose should be the solution (if not socialism)?"	1	False

Otherwise why would some people go through hormones and surgery to be recognized as their gender? But as far as anyone else is concerned, yes, it's just words.

We generally don't question people's gender identity when it ""matches"" their sex. But if you can acknowledge that gender does not always match sex, then I think it's not much more of a leap to say that gender is just a feeling. 

The other option, as you suggest, is that gender is based on how well you fit the stereotypes of  male vs female. But consider my example of the very masculine woman again. Is that person wrong about their gender and is actually just a confused man? 

In my experience, very few people are holding up a measuring stick of gender stereotypes behaviour to see if someone is really the gender they say. If they are measuring, it's mostly to say that someone is performing their gender incorrectly, not that they are lying about their gender. I've never seen anyone tell a young girl who doesn't like dolls that she should start calling herself a boy if she's going to act like that. Far more likely is that she will be told that she *is* a girl and should act more like it.

&gt;Clearly, you want to your loved ones to be one with God, and not be separated from Him -- but it is their lack of faith in him, and their lack of willingness to find out from Him what sins they have committed, and repent from them, that is keeping them from doing so.

Your hatred of THEIR sin in some way implies that you are in a position to judge them; it is fundamentally different from your hatred of your own sin, or of sin in general. Hating the sinner's sin, if the sinner is not yourself, is a form of judgment.

However, your conclusions are based on a false dichotomy. If someone hates all sin as indicated here

&gt;

    If you were a Christian, you believed the Bible, and you believed that unrepentant sin damns the sinner to eternal torment, how could you not hate sin?

You couldn't

Then they will ALSO hate each specific sin. 

&gt;this phrase, it is the sin, not sin in general. It is their sin, not your sin. I'll revisit this.

It is logically impossible for someone to hate the whole of a group of actions and also not hate each specific action within that group, therefore if you do agree that, according to the teachings of Christianity, Christians should hate all sin, then you also agree that Christians should hate each individual sin. 
&gt;Your hatred of THEIR sin in some way implies that you are in a position to judge them; it is fundamentally different from your hatred of your own sin, or of sin in general. Hating the sinner's sin, if the sinner is not yourself, is a form of judgment.

Beyond the fact that this, once again, contradicts your previous statement, see my comment on another thread: God states what is sin and what isn't in the Bible. Stating that an action that is defined as sin Biblically is not a judgement, but simply the articulation of God's judgement. If a Christian were to say ""I believe that eating tomatoes is a sin, therefore I hate the action of eating tomatoes,"" and stated that those who do so are sinners, that would be a judgement, and a false one at that, obviously. However, even within that, if someone incorrectly judges someone to have sinned/incorrectly defines sin, that does not affect the integrity of the phrase ""Love the sinner, hate the sin."" Even if the sin being hated isn't actually a sin, that has no impact on the phrase itself because the CMV is not ""Christians incorrectly define sin, and therefore hate the wrong things."" 

In a perfect Christian community, where everyone defined sin exactly as it is in the Bible, they would hate all sin, they would not judge anyone, and they would love all including sinners. Therefore, according to the Biblical principles, upon which Christianity is founded, ""Love the sinner, hate the sin,"" is a perfect representation of the attitude Christians should have towards sin in our society."	1	False

My goal here is to show you that this specific ruling changed very little - and if anything for the better.  I'm unlikely to talk you out of hating Citizens United.  All this ruling does is change the spending of the people whose views aren't reflected by any existing super PAC.  I.e. the people rich enough to consider spending tens of thousands per year, but not the people rich enough to start a super PAC.

I have spent tens of hours reading articles, going over comments, discussing with my SO, taken silly gender identity tests, writing to myself, and self reflecting on trying to understand gender identity and what that would mean for me as a person. The ultimate conclusion I have reached is that I must be Agender. I don't ""feel"" any specific way about my gender. I think that's because of two reason. 

First, that I have no reference point for what a different gender ACTUALLY feels like. I can only imagine what that is. To claim I ""feel"" like another gender without ever actually being able to know anything other than how my head works seems dubious. Further, if I can't feel other genders, how can I be sure my given gender is right? How can I be sure that everyone with my given gender doesn't feel exactly as I do?

Second, there are no ""rules"" for what makes a person a specific gender. If a women never wears a dress, that doesn't mean she isn't a women suddenly. If a man does, he's not less of a man. Enby people can do either and still hold true to their chosen identity. Two identically presenting/acting/etc people could claim to be two different genders and it wouldn't be wrong.

So, if you can't ACTUALLY ""feel"" what it's like to be a different gender, but only assume based on what your told by others, and genders have no walls to define what they individually are, then how does it make sense to claim to be anything other than me? And if I don't fit in any gender label (because none of them have requirements,) I must not have a gender. And I image that for everyone else, it's at its root, the exact same. That people only pick genders to be labeled as, but those genders don't really communicate much other than the personality they think they have. 

IDK if that's perfectly worded, and if I'm wrong somewhere, please correct me. I just literally cannot identify what it means to be any specific gender, so to me, that means I must not have one. Am I wrong in thinking that?"	3	False

You seem to be linking criminal offences with police numbers. Less criminal offences to be charged will equal less police. There is no reason to think they will be casually linked. You could have more manpower to focus on other stuff.

Secondly and kinda related. Even, to use your drug decriminalization example, if you got rid of all of those as ""crimes"", there is still a TON of stuff left for them to do. Take cybercrime as an example, I dont have the numbers off the top of my head, but the vast majority of it never gets touched by the police.

She wants to throw her hat in the ring again, and that's her right.  Chelsea Clinton hasn't followed her parents into politics, aside from stumping for her mother, so it's unlikely there's a political dynasty in the making.

The Bush thing is more an anomally than a trend. George Sr. was a successful politician, was elected Vice President on the Reagan ticket from 80 to 88. (it's important to note that VP of the US has litte official power, just to cast the tie-breaking vote in the senate, and to replace the president if he dies), he was elected president from 88 to 92.  He had two kids that followed him in to politics.  I don't think there's much doubt that both benefited from their dad's name in early campaigns, but nepotism only goes so far.  His campaigns were orchestrated by political genius/satan incarnate Karl Rove, who knew exactly how to brand him, and ran effective smear campaigns in governor, primary and presidential races.  That is, his winning strategy was to make the opposing candidates look bad rather than bringing attention to his own.

Jeb on the other hand went the florida route.

This is one of the reasons DC is located where it is, on the border of two states with its own waterways, to assure there's no way its neighbors can meddle in its affairs. Restricting DC to an even smaller area surrounded by a new state will virtually guarantee that New Columbia's wishes will carry more weight in the federal government than Utah.

This might have been a concern in an 18th Century agrarian society. It isn't a concern now. You think New Colombia is going to threaten to cut off the Federal District's food supply if it doesn't do what it wants? Come on. ""New Columbia"" won't have any more influence over the federal government than any other state of similar size and wealth. Do Maryland and Virginia have outsized influence now due to bordering DC?

&gt; If the primary concern is disenfranchisement(which while valid is also a bit overexaggerated given DC has electoral representation), the logical solution would be retrocession of the land to the states whose territory was relinquished to form DC. This also has specific precedent regarding DC. Specifically, Alexandria, VA was retroceded to DC because they were disenfranchised.

First, DC does *not* have federal electoral representation. They have non-voting representatives, which is not the same thing.

Second, Virginia *wanted* Alexandria back. Maryland definitely doesn't want DC and it can't be forced to take it. The franchise of those living in DC shouldn't depend on the whims of Maryland."	11	False

I'll form my own educational system.  With blackjack.  And hookers""?

Haha, essentially yes. 

&gt;Could an argument be made that, in the modern day, with the advent of the internet, opportunities for access to education are roughly equalized?

Not at all. Among the people that are less educated than might be ideal, there are those who don't have easy access to the internet, those who simply don't have the time, and those who have both problems compounded. Even amongst those who possess the time and resources, they need some more structure than simply having access to every article on wikipedia.

&gt;And moreso, if the elitist culture has inspired such a backlash of insecurity, wouldn't society more avidly embrace education, even as they pretend to not care?  

It's sort of a catch-22. Education has to become easier to embrace before we can really embrace it. But of course until we embrace education, those resources are never going to become easier to access.

If college (and better resources for all levels of schooling from elementary to high school) was equally open to everyone, then there wouldn't really be an intellectual elite the way there is today in this country. Once the opportunities are completely leveled out, there won't be so much support for those whose arguments spring forth from feelings of inferiority because the amount of valid arguments for not attending will plummet. 

&gt;Though I did say I wasn't looking for a ""cause"" for anti-intellectualism, I think your post squirms into a loophole by suggesting that it isn't, at root, anti-intellectualism as anti-elitism.  However, our mainstream culture still glorifies aspects of elite culture, so the anti-intellectual components of the mainstream culture aren't explained in this scenario.  It could potentially address some areas where the anti-intellectual sentiments are especially strong, but I wouldn't say it covers the broader social issue.

The aspects of elite culture that we glorify usually don't include the sense of superiority that being elite happens to cultivate in some people. This is the same sense of superiority that less educated people often project onto intellectuals. The obese caviar eating old man with a monocle and transatlantic accent is a trope commonly made fun of, just as the trope of the rich person who has been so rich their whole lives that they can't do simple things like laundry or making themselves breakfast.

There are positive glorifications for being elite just as there are negative denigrations for the same. This is also true for intelligence. "	28	False

“Responsibly raised meat still involves killing a human thing”

I guess my struggle to understand a lot of these points is the underlying principle that human lives are equal to those of farm animals. I am willing to consider that is the overarching mindset of vegans. I do have some issues with it though. 

One being, animal welfare should be considered despite the end result. They are still living creatures, and they should be treated with respect, from the beginning of their lives to the end. I still believe it is more ethical to give a farm animal a good life, than subjecting them to the horrible conditions of a factory farm. 

The second is, if all animal consumption ceased to exist tomorrow, these animals would face extinction. Their genetic traits are the result of thousands of years of breeding for a single purpose. They have to be cared for, or they will not survive. 

I am not convinced that buying a veggie burger from Burger King will do anything other than increase demand for meat. Even if meat alternatives eventually make up 20% of their revenue, 80% is factory farmed meat. The increased revenue from vegans will cause these businesses to grow and expand. With each new store the supply of beef will also have to grow."	1	False

Humans are not always rational, even if we’d like this to be true or if we actually believe this to be true of ourselves. Making a logical argument (logos) is only one aspect or even mode of persuading someone to agree with your view. So yeah, some of these arguments may not be logical in the strict sense, but they may appeal to someone’s emotions. Criticising them for not being logical doesn’t really get you to the outcome you want, but it’s far better than a person failing to acknowledge that their arguments may not be always watertight.	4	False

Let's consider this the other way around. Protest is illegal, or at least garners you a fine for violating local ordinance. You mention illegality doesn't stop truly heartfelt protest, and therefore illegal protest should be sufficient to show grassroots resistance.

There's a problem with that assumption however. Now, protesting requires money. Not everyone can afford the fines, bail costs, legal fees and / or missed work that protesting in your world would be met with. Now the only people who can protest are those with sufficient resources or the completely &amp; willfully indigent. 

Moreover, the line between protest and other forms of free speech can be blurry. What if you put up a sign in your yard? What if you hand out pamphlets in a public park? What if you discuss an unpopular subject on public access TV? What if you wear a shirt with a message subversive to the administration? What if you wear a Halloween costume caricaturing the President?

We think of protests as being disruptive because those that are annoying &amp; in our face catch the most attention, by design.

If too many Americans are going to college (and I think this opens up an entire new conversation on what the value of college is meant to be) it seems like the reasonable path is to make admissions more selective or uphold higher standards for students once there (and accept more students will fail) and not to accept that some students won't go or won't complete college because they can't afford it or have to attempt to do it while shouldering significant financial commitments.

That’s about a third of the total work force. If you halve their hours, then you need another third of the work force to fill in for them, leaving 1/3 to do what 2/3’s previously did. Imagine thanks snapping half of the employees at every retail store, every food place, etc. I would suspect many small businesses would fold between the combo of being understaffed, and less money being earned that can be spent there. Now those employees can go work at other businesses so they would probably no longer be understaffed, but small business owners would be screwed, I’m not sure who would be willing to buy their business property with so many stores shutting down so now they are forced to pay for it while working an low paying job. Rural people would also probably be screwed because when a lot of businesses shut down, rural people are left stranded. This has already happened quite a few times. I’ve seen a bunch of cases of Walmart leaving small towns when it became unprofitable, and the residents were left stranded. This would only increase that happening. With less money being earned, that also means less is being paid in taxes. Even just a 1/3 drop in pay means a trillion less in revenue for the government. That’s most of the discretionary spending, likely meaning mandatory spending like social security would have to be cut. With over half of voters being 50+, I’m not sure how well that would go down. Also issues like debt, even if incomes and prices and other things decrease accordingly, debt wouldn’t. While the government could cancel debt owned to it, I’m not sure what it can do for debt owed to others. So anyone with debt not to the government is probably screwed when it comes to paying it off. There’s more but I don’t want to be here all day, these are some of the things I can see likely to happen. There’s a reason we don’t see people proposing stuff this drastic right now. Reducing by a 1/5? Sure. By 1/2? That’s quite radical, I don’t think even radicals like Bernie are proposing anything close to that. The shortest I’ve found him proposing is 32 hours.	1	False

Imagine a game with excellent gameplay and absolutely no story.  Solitaire for example.  It's simple, the rules are easy to understand.  It has extremely high replay value.  It's just the right amount of challenging and games last just the right amount of time to be enjoyable.   Yes, it was a card game first, but it's just as viable as a computer game.

There is plenty of value in studying the mechanics that make that a valuable game.

Now, imagine a reverse scenario:  A game with a good story but awful gameplay.  I can't site a specific example off the top of my head but I know for a fact that I've played them.  Or to be more specific, I've play _part_ of the game.   When the gameplay is screwed up, there's no reason to stick around for the story.  In fact, there's a huge disincentive to attempting to play through the mess of a game to suss out the story.

I'll give you a 3rd scenario.  Good gameplay and a good story which the player completely ignores.  That's how I play generally.  I skip the cut scenes, skip the blah blah talky bits.   I couldn't tell you the ""story"" of 90% of the FPS I've played.  I just know:  Nazis are targets

So, we've got
Good game play + Zero story = excellent game that people play over and over
Good game play + great story = excellent game that does really well and leaves an impact socially (which is great)
Bad game play + no story = unplayable.
Bad game play + great story = unplayable and no one finds out the story
Good game play + skip the story = great game

Clearly the ludologists are onto something.  Gameplay is way more important than story.

Thanks for clarifying.  I am aware there was a mistrial.  
I just meant verdict in the colloquial sense of ... an opinion - that is, the stance held by the jury.

I see.

I was only aware of the first explanation, that there was a single holdout juror, while the rest of the jury was agree to convict.

In the case of the second explanation, where multiple jurors are undecided, the conversation does indeed change.

I guess until more information comes out, this may all be too speculative.

&gt;Perhaps some people are seeing that the typical requirement gives too much power to a single unreasonable juror.

&gt;I know that most people are upset because the evidence here looks SO plainly obvious, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for debate on some actual (and longstanding) policy issues.

Absolutely. There's genuine cause for debate regarding the legal system (always has been).  

I just think it's unfair, even unjust, for the public (and media) to insist (as they seem to be) that because we don't like the jury's position (that is, assuming that it is 11 for, 1 against), therefore there's something wrong with the jury, rather than suggesting that there's something wrong with the system.

I'm concerned that I may be strawmanning here, through a lack of understanding what it is that people are complaining about.

The first is the reliability of the source, I know you have acknowledged that it isn't scientific but I think that is a bit of an understatement. If you browse around the website there are some very pseudo-sciencey and alarmist articles: ""The reality of chemical terrorism"", ""10 steps to free yourself from the international conspiracy against enlightenment"". This immediately suggests they may have some bias. The article also uses a bit of a scattered approach to the science to try and provide evidence for their hypothesis. The things mentioned are all very separate theories and, although they may all talk about 'parallel universes' in some way they each mean different things when they say that. Very few people suggest parallel universes like those in sci-fi where there is another 'you' wandering around.

All this being said, the article does provide some good links and talk about some interesting science so lets dive into that, one idea at a time:

* **Dark Energy** The article's link for this doesn't even mention dark energy and is even more pseudo-sciencey, I don't know if this was a linking error or what. Basically dark energy comes from the fact that we looked at the universe and saw that not only was it expanding as expected but that expansion was accelerating. Accelerating anything, whether it's a car or a universe, requires energy and we have no idea where that energy is coming from so we call it 'Dark Energy'. As we know nothing about this it isn't surprising that some scientists are toying with parallel universes to try and explain it but that is no way a mainstream idea.

* **Andromeda** The article is correct in saying that Andromeda is heading towards us but galaxies colliding in the universe isn't unusual and is reasonably well understood. It's just run of the mill gravity, no parallel universes needed.

* **leaking gravity** This is based on a really interesting fringe idea. Have you ever thought about how weak gravity is? You, a tiny human, are able to defy the whole planet's gravity just by jumping! Some scientists explanations for this are extra dimensions that gravity is able to 'leak' into whereas other forces cannot.

* **Force 10,000 times the Milky Way** Now this is, in my opinion, the coolest idea here. It's called Dark Flow and causes all the matter in the *visible* universe to be moving in the same direction. This suggests there is something large outside our visible universe that we cannot see. Some scientists have suggested this is another universe but that doesn't mean there is another Earth there, it may be unrecognisable from our universe. Dark flow as also recently been measured to be less than first thought.

Anyway, I'm waffling but I hope that piqued your interest to read more about this, wikipedia is a pretty good place to get an overview. 

**TL;DR: ** Your rain gods analogy is incorrect as most of these ideas are on the fringe of science and are never presented as some overarching 'parallel worlds' theory."	1	False

I definitively don't see this one, since self defense (and similar justifiable homicides) is a thing, and killing in self defense is not punished, despite being able to say that it is murder under duress (I am choosing to kill the person threatening me rather than the target that he is trying to point me at).

&gt;duress does take away one's cognizance and agency except for certain sticking points

I don't see how duress could take away your cognizance any more in one instance than in another (give me your money or I'll shoot you vs kill Johnny or I'll shoot you). In both cases you are under the same threat, so the duress levels should be the same, it's just that in the money case, it's not too big a deal, life goes on, and the law recognizes it (and you could hypothetically make this argument for rape, which would be why perhaps some districts might allow it as a defense there). For murder, life doesn't go on (sucks to be Johnny), it is a big deal, and therefore, extenuating circumstances or not, you made the choice, bad on you."	1	False

It is pretty amazingly bad parenting to not teach your daughters about inappropriate touching.  Later Lena talked about her sister, ""relaxing on her"" when they watched tv, masturbating in bed with her, and bribing her with candy for kisses. These are all boundary issues that Lena's parents should have handled by teaching the kids that it is not appropriate to bribe your younger sister into sex acts, even if they are just kisses. Also, the ""relax on me"" comment seemed to have sexual overtones that Lena tried to normalize.

Yes, it is normal to be curious about sex and anatomy, but the disregard that Lena has as an adult is where it gets messed up. She compared herself to a sexual predator, meaning she was getting a sexual thrill out of having her little sister lay on her, kiss her and masturbating next to her. Turning that into a humorous story takes away from the fact that it was wrong to do and normalizes children doing it, as opposed to teaching that it should not be done. 

Another way would be if a young boy did that. If as a young boy, I peaked at my sisters vagina, paid her for kisses, had her lay on me for sexual thrills, and then jerked off in bed next to her, that would be wrong of my parents for not stopping it and wrong for me to make light of it later in life.

1) Not the medical definition

2) **We *agreed* that casual usage is not based on chromesomes, correct?  More on gender identity.**

&gt;What troubles me is that this would seem to implicitly encode the harmful gender-sex association into our language

You would never call a masculine woman who identifies as a woman a man, would you? And vice versa.  You are referring to gender identity.  The fact that trans people exist show that gender ≠ sex.

When you call someone a he/she you are not referring to gender expression, gender roles, or gender norms, you are talking about gender identity.

---

I think I've already addressed a lot of your points.

The existence of innate gender identity and how it's separate from gender roles/gender expression. This means that you are not reinforcing gender norms by using man/woman to refer to gender (because you are talking about gender identity, not how they present and act).

The fact that many men/women do not ascribe to traditional gender roles, yet still identify with a gender that matches the one assigned at birth. This also implies that gender identity ≠ gender expression/gender roles.

The fact that gender identity may not match with the gender assigned at birth (transgender people). Because we have already established that man/woman refers to gender identity, *and* that it doesn't have anything to do with gender norms, then what reason do you have for not calling them a man/woman?

To be replaced by what? The point is, ""men"" and ""women"" are often referring to larger cultural standards, not to every particular individual. These cultural standards exist, even if they don't necessarily concern every single person in the nation. Like I said, someone that comment on how ""men are socialized"" is making a statement about manhood in a particular context - often the society they're living in - and these statements are not devoid of value. 

&gt;If ""I'm just so sick of blacks doing X"" is a kind of statement you'd instinctively draw back from since it sounds racist, you ought to pull back from ""I'm so sick of men doing X"" statements, too.

Again, the comparison is rhetoric. There's more to it than just the words being used. People are taken aback by the first statement because it plays into a very long history of racism and oppression. That history is missing from the second statement, so of course people will treat it different. 

&gt;the first speaker is kind of fucked... *unless* the first speaker just adds literally one word to their statement: ""*some* media teaches men to be sexually aggressive."" With one word, four letters, and one syllable the speaker changed their statement from an inaccurate and sexist generalization to an accurate statement that can't be refuted.

That's where I feel we're getting into the needlessly nit picky territory, in my opinion. First, the big bang theory is hardly ""progressive"" as far as masculinity and gender relation goes and we could discuss that further if you'd use it as an example. However, beyond that, ""gotcha's"" aren't really arguments. The person isn't ""fucked"" because you chose the most literal interpretation of their words and found a counter example. You're just talking passed each-other. If you engage with people that way, it's not going to be super productive. Like, do you assume this person says ""every piece of media ever produced..."" or more something like ""a majority of popular media..."" or something to that effect? 

More to the point, what is the ""correction"" even meant to achieve? Defending media?

&gt;So where should the onus be, really?

That's a good question and the only real answer I can think of is ""*on both of them"".* Discussion happens between people, not one way. So yeah, maybe they could make more qualified statements, but there's real value in you meeting them at least part way and not going for the most uncharitable reading - or the one example you feel unravel your reading of that argument. There's a lot of middle ground, I feel, between ""reading their mind"" and ""most obtuse reading possible"". In that particular case, ""popular media does X"" is a really common turn of phrase that's generally well understood to be pointing at trends and such. 

&gt;Well first, the comparisons don't have to scale in terms of actual impact for them to still be valid comparisons. 

In my opinion, it really depends what you mean to compare. In that case, the comparison is basically limited to the words we are using, which isn't enough to convince me there's real harm to be found. Like I said earlier, you're drawing a parallel between two vastly different situation and would have me understand them as the same, but it doesn't work that way. If ""homosexual man"" was the complete equivalent to ""white man"" in our society I'd likely hold a similar discourse here.

Now, I'm not saying there's no harm at all, I'm saying I'm not really seeing the actual harm ""as a social thing"" I guess. 

&gt;Which brings me to point two: men are only ""dominant"" because a disproportionate number of *individual* men happen to occupy positions of power disproportionate to their demographic representation. Nothing there stops women and PoC from holding positions of power, or using their power to the detriment of white people.

Sure, but they are still dominant. You don't need for that dominance to be divinely ordained for it to matter. I have no problem imagining minorities could use their power or influence against white people, or that some might do so right now, but how often does it happen really? To be clear, if you come round and tell me all about your racist boss, I'm not going to argue with you about it. That's an aweful situation to be in. It's just there's a pretty significant difference between that particular articulation of power being an exception to the rule and it being the rule.

For instance, you bring up  Sarah Jeong a few times, but what is she actually doing. How is she hurting us in any meaningful way? She has a influential position, but for every one of her, there's probably a dozen of us. So where is it hurting exactly? 

&gt;It really doesn't matter to me, a straight white male, how many straight  white males are in positions of power if the positions of power that  are relevant to me are occupied by anti-white, anti-male, anti-straight  racists, sexists, and bigots. 

I hear what you're saying. However, I'll disagree on a least one point: there's a lot of benefits to living in a society geared towards you which you are very quick to wave away. Being a straight white man in a world where the vast majority of the positions of influence are occupied by straight white man is not inconsequential, it's going to make things much easier for you on the long run. That said, it's true your not immune to prejudice. Like I said in the first post, I agree there's some damageable prejudice out there and I'll try to call it out when I see it. I never meant to imply we were immune to it, just that there's much slimmer chances we'll end up suffering from it in the end. That's why comparisons to jewish or LGBTQ+ people do not sway me much.

If anything, this over-representation is doing more for equality as it's almost a given that white people will be employed in this industry in the UK over their black counterparts, while *that is not a given* for the black community. With such a small percentage of black people available, they *need* to entice this community as much as possible since diversity is the goal. If they didn't do this, then the disparity within that industry would be even worse than it is now.

This is strictly a numbers game and they aren't in the black communities favor, thus marketing needs to be incentivized towards them (as they seem to be doing).

But numbers don't ""exist"" outside of being ideas that can exist in ways that are similarly communicable between minds capable of comprehending them. they are abstract quantifiers that ""exist"" in the same way that sequiturs exist, because all valid mathematics are logical sequiturs. Harry Potter exists as a logically coherent idea, to some extent. He does not exist as an actual thing.
&gt; Does logical possibility exist, or is existence is logically possible? My answer would be that existence is logically possible, and that is how I am defining and understanding existence, because we more often use existence vs. non-existence to differentiate between non-fiction and fiction that forms a sequitur. In other words, fictional things don't ""exist"" but they are often sequiturs. Plato probably had it right when he divided ""existence"" into concrete existence and abstract existence. But ""existence"" as a term has changed to really only mean concrete existence, and my mind is too colloquially caught up in using it that way.
&gt; Science is an epistemological method for reducing doubt about notions of how reality works. It is also logically true.
&gt; Science is true when its conclusion necessarily follows the data examined, and when the data is accurate. Math is true because it is sequiturs that flow from a very precise definitions of quantities. ""Murder is wrong"" is not true unless you assume an axiom that it is true, or it fulfils the conditions of another axiom that make it true, ""You ought to act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."" is not true unless you assume it as an axiom or it fulfills another axiom.
&gt; 

So now that I have established that you are not an ontological nihilist I will explain my metaphysics.

I am not actually sure whether a Categorical Imperative exists but I think one may exist. It would be an inherent trait of rationality that people act rationally in that manner. 

&gt;I am using basic axioms too: My happiness is good, and my suffering is bad. Because I am empathetic and because I want to get along with other people, and because I want society to co-operate as much as possible, I fold in my axiom with a universal axiom: All happiness is good, and all suffering is bad. It is also the basis for a categorical imperative: ""When acting, one ought attempt to do what they are able to do to maximise happiness and minimise suffering."" This is a very broad categorical imperative and adhering to it is based on how you respond to the infinite hypothetical imperatives you and everyone faces in life.

Your axiom is a much less plausible one since it is not integrated with the rest of your epistemology. How do you define pleasure?

&gt;How is it not reciprocal by definition? It assumes that you ought to do things that result in other people being made to be as fulfilled as you. What could be more reciprocal than that?

It does not demand that. It demands that you maximize net utility so as a result it means that you spend your life serving utility monsters and either killing unhappy people or infinitely expanding the population. You also need to benefit people regardless of their morality, and although deterrence is allowed, someone who is incapable of responding to deterrence due to being mentally disabled can just do whatever they want, and the same thing applies with rocks. As a utilitarian you must sacrifice everything you have to make someone who is easily pleased happy with nothing in return since that maximizes utility.



&gt;Yes, but very few betrayals benefit very few people in the long run. And the more that society shows utilitarian solidarity, they less that any particular betrayal is likely to result in benefit. I have a degree of empathy where I really don't like betraying people, and most people feel kind of shitty when they betray people. So people have a self interest in fulfilling empathetic drives by not just betraying people all of the time. Sure, some people betray people very easilly, which is why it is imperative for the rest of society to do what is necessary to make sure that betrayals don't result in greater outcomes for the betrayer.

That is contractualism, not utilitarianism, utilitarianism is based around unconditional submission to the easily pleased (which probably means rocks) with nothing in return. 

&gt;Define ""pure reason"".

Pure reason is reasoning without a goal. In this case, it means studying the concept of obligation in an a priori manner. 

&gt;Yes there is: The idea that emerges from it that each persons happiness ought to matter equally when making collective decisions.

That is antithetical to utilitarianism. Whoever has the greater marginal utility is the person who matters. You are confusing contract theory and utilitarianism.

&gt;Rich and powerful people always have more bargaining power, no matter what. Utilitarianism says that some people being rich at the expense of others is unjust, by logical necessity, because of the soundness of the rule of diminishing marginal utility of wealth. It provides a logical basis for why rich people ought to not be rich. What is the ""pure reason"" that suggests why ought not to be rich and how is it different from the ""pure reason"" that rich people ought to be as rich as they can cause themselves to be?

Neither one supports their claim to more power. However, we do need to compromise with them to run a society.

&gt;This is a tendency for any moral system accepted by any society. Why would society coming to accept Kantian consequentialism be any more likely to reject the assertions of the ruling elite than if they were to accept utilitarianism?

It wouldn't. I was saying you as an ethical egoist should seek to become an oppressor.

&gt;You don't understand people if you think that people have no selfish interest in being a part of a happy society. Only craven sociopaths want to be a king of ashes. Most people only have so much appetite for betrayal, any remaining incentive for betrayal is based on a lack of solidarity in society. No matter what ethical system you follow, a lack of solidarity will always be a problem in getting people to appeal to that ethical system.

I really think that you need to be an oppressive group rather than an oppressive individual to be successful. You will have all the benefits of community. "	1	False

I agree we're talking about subtle differences here, and maybe just arguing over semantics to some extent, but I think it's worth parsing. Like I said above, the problem isn't telling a child that anything is possible if they're willing to work for it. That's absolutely true (with some obvious exceptions where a given goal or dream is *literally* impossible). In virtually any field, you can find people who overcame incredibly long odds to achieve their dreams, and those examples would never exist if they were discouraged from dreaming big. 

To me, the problem is only if you're suggesting that hard work is a *guarantee* of success. That's definitely a lie, and I agree it's not the right approach. But I'm not sure that's what most people do, so I don't think it's really a problem.

Come on Organic Chemist!

That's acidic, but pH isn't everything, and it's a misunderstood metric.  For the lay, it works like the Richter scale.  So something that's 3.0 pH (say, Raspberry Jam) is not 10% or 100% more acidic than something 4.0pH, it's **1000%/10x more acidic**.  Rubus, Vaccinium, Fragaria are all significantly acidic and common jams. So like a logarithmic scale, that discrepancy can be deceiving.  And for context, if somebody tasted a 3.9pH beer, they might say it's a bit tart, but not a sour beer.  A 3.0pH beer you'd be feeling in your mouth for hours, and probably have you scheduling a visit to your dentist to have your teeth re-enameled.  I can offer this experience firsthand.  So, no, it does not defeat the premise of the previous poster's comment.  

Now - perceivable acidity to the human palate, it turns out that measuring hydrogen ions gives a rough idea of where things land, but isn't the best metric. Tritratable Acidity (TA) is though.  I have no idea what the TTA of honey is, compared to jam in these fruits, but if you want to have a meaningful conversation from a food science standpoint, this would be the gun to bring to the fight."	9	False

As some commenters in this sub have pointed out in past conversations, **reasoning itself *requires* faith**. Religious reasons are not the only form of reasoning to rely on faith.

Suppose you have evidence supporting a certain claim you want to make. How can you be sure that the evidence is credible? How do you know that it contains no lies, fabrications, or false assumptions? Did you  gather the evidence yourself? How can you even trust your own senses or perception? To answer these questions, we must make assumptions and have faith in the credibility and validity of evidence.

I'll give an example: ""1 + 1 = 2"". This is something we take for granted as absolutely true, something we don't feel we need to prove. [We totally could prove it if we wanted to](http://tachyos.org/godel/1+1=2.html), but it would take forever. And even that logical proof is the condensed version. We take it on faith that these things are true so that we may focus on more important stuff.

Tour argument is not unique to religious reasoning, but applies to reasoning in general. By this token, religious reasons are no less inherently valid than other reasons.

Alright, hopefully you'll still be able to read this, because I get the feeling that this thread is gonna get big soon.

It's important to understand the primary mission of Starfleet in the first place: to explore deep space and conduct research and diplomacy. While the Star Trek movies have emphasized combat and explosions, you have to understand that those are meant to be used defensively and as a last resort. Discretion and observation are the cornerstones of the typical, successful, dutiful Starfleet officer. It's why Kirk was dismissed: even though he was successful, he not only violated the Prime Directive, but he also betrayed the spirit of Starfleet. Whether you agree with his actions or not (which I completely do, if only because I've got a man crush on Spock), those are the inescapable facts.

So, with that in mind, the Prime Directive is an iron clad rule because interference with the interior dynamics or fate of another planet or civilization, no matter how small, will have unforeseen consequences. Let's take a look at the Nibiru:

Suppose Spock's device had malfunctioned. It kept the volcano at bay (which the tribe had been unaware of), but it also caused a tectonic plate shift in the crust of the planet as a result of the backfiring force from the eruption. We'll say that the temple the Kirk is running from is annihilated, but the population remains largely intact. Sure, Spock is saved when Kirk emerges from the ocean. The people are alive, but what happens now?

Maybe there's a special herb only found on that planet that happens to cure a deadly disease. Unfortunately, they have now associated Starfleet vessels with earthquakes. Now, you have three options:

    Leave the planet alone and allow people to die of this new disease.
    Sneak onto the planet, risking the lives of Starfleet officers in the process.
    Commit to wholesale war against a stupefied, illiterate civilization.

Now, you might be saying ""Sure, but that's just one case,"" but when scaled to the size of an entire fleet that spans an entire galaxy, you can't possibly expect central command to have the time to review every single case of an alien race that needs help. Unfortunately, these constraints call for a blanket rule."	3	False

In your post, you write ""*psychedelic therapy has shown absolutely Z E R O side effects, both physiologically and psychologically*"". But that's clearly wrong, because there are psychological side-effects. And the psychological side-effects actually seem worse than the physical. A persistent perceptual disorder for 5 years? That's worse than cancer, in my opinion.

I don't know if you consider MDMA a psychedelic, but it has physical side-effects (hyperthermia, which can be fatal). Benzos generally don't have physical side-effects, except for withdrawal symptoms when you stop suddenly.

&gt;Regarding Benzos, I have also read, in my cited sources, that most of these positive effects listed are due to the placebo effect.

No. The whole point of clinical trials is to *compare* a drug to placebo. These are called randomized placebo-controlled trials. Such trials are necessary for FDA approval. Benzos are superior to placebo, otherwise they wouldn't be FDA-approved. Why would people get addicted to benzos if the effect was just placebo? Are they addicted to placebo? Think it through.

How do you know the effects of psychedelics aren't due to the placebo effect? It's very hard to randomize studies on psychedelics, because the subjects will know if they're getting the real drug or a placebo. The subjects in the real group will immediately notice the psychedelic effect. This is a huge problem (called [unblinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment)). It means that research on psychedelics is less reliable."	10	False

Hmm. It supposes a will surely. I'm not sure it supposes a free will. Free will is that sense of agency and control over your actions, as though you could have used your will in a different way if you had chose, but that the way your will is both activated and the avenues it chooses to take of action are dictated by something that they didn't choose.

&gt;Because if it doesn't then we're basically bound to do what we're bound to do anyway and can't change that.

We are bound to do what we are bound to do, since free will doesn't exist. Which is why I'm like, what am I seeking to change? If the lack of free will doesn't exist and it doesn't change anything, why am I referencing it? Earlier you said if free will didn't exist it wouldn't make sense to punish criminals, but it would make sense to momentarily remove them from society. I agree wholeheartedly. I also want to apply this type of thinking to rewards for effort and how some, through luck, are able to get more.

Imagine you bought a house and 10 years later it turns out there is a gold mine under it. Do you own it? Is that fair? Is not our machine and our emotional state producing part of ourselves not also just gold mines stumbled upon?

&gt;No, not in the sense of an objective reality, though nihilism doesn't really defeat that it only draws that into question. Though the ability to establish any agreement or norm of what is fair and moral, also presupposes that we have the ability to do so. So if we don't have that choice, we don't have that choice. Not even our skepticism would be our genuine choice. Which makes that exercise kind of pointless, doesn't it?

It seems like you are saying that without free will we have no opinion. Is that what you meant?

&gt;I don't get where you're trying to go with that? I mean wouldn't we be sociopaths if free will wouldn't be a thing, in the sense that we don't actually feel empathy, but merely walk the walk and talk the talk as long as it clearly benefits us?

Hmm. Why do you conclude this? To be honest I've become a little lost. Can we perhaps define free will? I have trouble defining what exactly it is. It's like why would free will being gone suggest we shouldn't punish criminals but just remove them from society. I agree though.

You could say the same thing about most of the other issues I mentioned. Just because we *haven't* done something about it yet doesn't mean we can't. We haven't done anything about climate change, but I suspect we can if we put our mind to it.

&gt;You say that inequality could be fixed by changes in our economic system, but that's saying it economic system is wrong, not that billionaires are. I am intrigued by the argument that were not addressing these issues because the super rich are actively lobbying against them, do you have any evidence of this, I would be interested in seeing it. 

If you have cancer and lose the ability to use your hands, the fact that cancer is causing it doesn't make the symptom less bad. Billionaire culture is, in fact, very damaging for the world in general.

As to examples I'd point to, say, the US tax code and the Trump tax cuts as just one fairly simple example. The rich lobbied for an enormous tax cut the benefitted the rich which will in turn worsen income inequality. They are only able to do this because they are rich, which is sort of the problem. Wealth buys power which in turn buys wealth.

&gt; For the last part, why not focus on the 15% growth for the ninety percent? Why does the fact that someone else's progress is more then yours diminish the value of your own growth? 

Because context is king. From 70-79 we had real wage growth of 2-2.5% a year, meaning that over the course of that single decade, wages increased more than they have for the last four decades. Wages used to grow, and the buying power of wages used to grow as well, neither of which are the case in 2020, which leads to the increased poverty and other symptoms we talked about.

The thing is, the economy has still been growing during that period. The problem is that the overwhelming majority of actual gains have been going to the wealthy. What we're talking about is the distribution of gains in the economy. If a rich person gains a vastly larger share of the gains, that share comes from somewhere else, namely the gains for the poor."	11	False

Smaller communities are also much less diverse. You get people who hold the same views they create their community and that’s it. You might have the odd traveler through the town, but they’d be an anomaly and treated as an oddity at best, discriminated against and treated poorly at worst. This also effects the flow of information, ideas, and culture. Want Chinese food? Might be shit out of luck. Want authentic Indian? Well this small town might now have the diverse population to support it, or like I’ve said at worse actively fight it

Small towns more easily become insular, discriminatory, or apathetic to views outside of the norm for that community, and can exert greater harm to those who do not fit the mold

I agree with a lot of your points, but I’d like to bring this up as possible negative sides that you might not have thought about, or at least to say for those who do not fit the mold of these smaller communities, they would not be happier. Something to think about"	164	False

So the truth is that neither party legitimately supports rank and file unionism, because as you've touched on, unions are bad for employers. They make it harder to extract profits, so bosses hate them. And both parties, Democrats and Republicans, are parties of the bosses.

There is no way to satisfy both employees and employers. They have diametrically opposed interests. Anything good for employers is bad for employees and vice versa.

From an employee's perspective, there is nothing to be gained and only things to be lost by compromising. Bargaining is necessary, compromise never is. Compromise occurs between two people or organizations that have a way toward a mutually beneficial relationship. Bargaining happens between adversaries. It is a critical mistake to think compromising with employers is ever a good thing.

The real reason for the drop in unions is the red scare of the 50s and the turn towards neoliberalism in the 70s. The bosses were unhappy they couldn't ramp up exploitation, and so they hollowed out the unions to prevent workers from being able to fight back. It has nothing to do with a lack of compromise on the part of Democrats."	2	False

If so, it's likely they raised her with Mexican cultural values. She's better off than a Mexican immigrant would be because she spent a significant part of her youth in American schools, but she doesn't have the same background as someone whose parents were also born and raised in America. She also likely grew up in a community of her people, further reducing her exposure to American culture.

For example, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and assume she knows what a quinceañera is. Do you? If an exam question were structured around knowledge of what a quinceañera is, would you be able to answer it? It's likely there's an American cultural equivalent that's as foreign to her as quinceañeras are to most Americans.

Altruistic acts generally aren't expected as a rule because people are allowed to be a bit selfish in our world. Altruistic people are exceptionally praiseworthy for this reason. Expecting altrusitic behavior from everyone is idealistic but certainly not reasonable and I think these kind of excessive rules create more of a social burdon than benefit, IMO.

There are many things that are nice to do in society that we generally agree we shouldn't all be obligated to do in every situation. For example, if you see trash on the street and you pick it up and throw it away you've done a good thing. It would be an odd world if we treated someone who didn't have time go above and beyond like that as if they'd failed to meet their social obligations.

Avoiding making messes of any kind while you're someone's guest is a similar thing. For example, I always try to clean up my own dishes and wash them if my host doesn't have a dishwasher. They usually stop me because they want me to be comfortable and enjoy myself, but I still try to help out. It would be an odd social obligation as a guest to be **expected** to clean up after themselves in these situations.

There's no difference with how you use the bathroom. Some guests will leave the bathroom spotless. Otherwise will use a portable trimmer to clean up their beard and leave hair everywhere and not even realize that's inconsiderate.

As a woman I've been in a multitude of situations where men have over stepped my comfort levels and boundaries but I felt like I couldn't say anything or didn't want it to escalate to a confrontation or even worse like I couldn't safely get out of the situation if I did, particularly when I was younger.  

It does feel a lot like you are trapped.  And some men and women will poo-poo that and tell the woman that experiences this that it's their responsibility to stand up for themselves, and they were leading the man on, etc etc, blame the victim sort of stuff.  But if you aren't assertive, if you are shy or have anxiety/confidence issues, or even if you are just overly concerned with hurting the other person's feelings or making them feel ostracized, it's not so easy. I agree it still up to the woman to put her foot down, but that is a really hard lesson to learn and even when learned it's still a struggle to do it or navigate those situations.  

I talk about this with my boyfriend a lot because he never made the connection that he did this or that men do this until he became a nurse and started working with women and heard them describing it so often:

**Men are just CLUELESS for the most part about their actions and how uncomfortable they can make women because (in general) men aren't used to feeling unsafe.**  They aren't bombarded with the fact that they are the weaker sex and can be taken advantage of or even hurt if they aren't constantly on guard.  So it doesn't occur to them that their actions could be interpreted as dangerous or boundary crossing.

So well meaning men will stand in a doorway while they are talking to a first date while alone in their household.  A good percent of the time in that woman's head a warning alarm is going off 'My exit is blocked off.' and cue the beginning of anxiety or all out panic. A guy is attracted to a woman who is much smaller/shorter than he is and he's backed her into a corner and looms over her (he just thinks he's showing his attraction and creating an intimate situation maybe) she feels again trapped and on the defensive. And in either case, when you feel unsafe like that, one of the first things they tell you is to not escalate, not to do anything to make the guy lash out or become aggravated.  Or even if the woman can't articulate what is making her uncomfortable, she still FEELS that discomfort and insecurity (which subsequently is exactly where a PUA wants a woman so he can capitalize on that insecurity and uncertainty).

Not to say that every woman treats a date or interested man as a potential attacker but it is something that is way more prevalent than I think anyone realizes and women hide it! Of course we don't want to say some guy who seems like a good guy but socially awkward, who we are still somewhat interested in, who several of our friends are also friends with and think is a great guy, made us horribly uncomfortable or feel threatened. 

And men just don't seem to get that. ""She could have left any time she wanted! I wouldn't have stopped her!""  But how did she know that?  She just saw a big guy standing in the only exit. 

I literally had a boy in high school who held me in a bear hug and kept pressing his hardon against me and saying my name while looking at me 'pointedly' while I was waiting for my mom to pick me up after school.  Inside the school, with people walking by! I had dated this guy for like a week in middle school.  He was way more popular than me and could make my life awful if I ticked him off (which I knew already because I turned down one senior varsity football player in study hall and all the sudden I was a lesbian and/or slut in everyone's mind for 2 years).  We never even spoke on a regular basis.  But he would not leave me alone.  He also played football, so even though I tried to push and struggle and get away he easily overpowered me.  The principal walked by and thankfully the boy let me go but I had no idea what to do prior to that! 

I sat down so he couldn't grab me like that again but he kept putting his arm around me and pulling me into him and trying to get me to kiss him.  It was awful and terrifying.  I was sending clear signals (pushing away and turning my face away) and saying no no no over and over again.  But for whatever reason it never occurred to me that I could scream or make 'more of' a scene (again I was terrified of the repercussions) and  I didn't want to get him in serious trouble for something so small right? But maybe screaming and freaking out was the only thing that was going to get him to realize -'No this is not okay.'

And the point of all that being, I'm sure that guy heard from some of his jock buddies that girls just play hard to get and he just needed to be assertive and make the first move...

Successful, til the French invaded

&gt;West Florida (1763–1810)

Successful, now part of the United States.

&gt;United States of America (1776–present)

Successful.

&gt;Lanfang Republic (1777–1884)

Successful, until the dutch invaded.

&gt;Vermont Republic (1777–1791)

Successful, now United States.

&gt; France First French Republic (1792–1804)

Not successful.

&gt; Cisalpine Republic (1797–1802) Helvetic Republic (1798–1802)

Subjects of First French Republic, not really independent states, so tied up with Napoleon etc.

&gt; State of Muskogee (1799–1803)

Failed revolution against Spain, eventually conquered by United States.  Never really formed a government.

So even if we give some republics a mixed record, we can certainly find examples from many eras of successful republics.

Can we find _any_ examples of successful socialist states at all?"	3	False

An ill-informed populace is only a symptom of the disease--a poor education system. While America still ranks fairly high globally for education &amp; developed many of the educational methods used in other countries, they often don't apply here. Inadequate pay for teachers and issues with school funding being assigned by property tax mean that schools aren't often great, duly, many low-income people will not receive a good education or foundation for logic. Later down the line, they don't have as much knowledge regarding child rearing (for ex: reading to a child will help them learn good vocabulary and more) that will ultimately perpetuate this cycle unless the educational system improves. 

Becoming educated on issues is not as easy as you think--while for you and I (who clearly have enough free time to browse reddit, access to internet, a computer, and reading/typing skills) browsing ""alternative"" news sources may be a clear option, a great majority of people only receive their news from Fox, CNN, and other media outlets that only present a narrow view. These mainstream news sources often only present the narrow Republican vs. Democrat view, instead of recognizing that perhaps both parties are wrong and stuck catering to corporate interests. Even more people never think on their own -- seriously, 83% of Americans do not spend any part of their day thinking. It's fairly difficult to sit back and muse upon the merits of various social programs when you are concerned with making ends meet or supporting a family. For most people, thoughts and worries are always running in their head &amp; they don't want to think about the world's issues -- just survive the day. Like you, I find it very hard to believe that anyone could not be concerned  with the major issues of our time &amp; not set out to find the truth on their own, but many don't have the educational backing, free time, or mental bandwidth.

I encourage you to approach this issue from a compassionate standpoint &amp; try and sympathize with those who did not receive a strong educational foundation. Meanwhile, focus on correcting the issue if it bothers you so much--spread awareness and advocate for news sources that provide educational awareness on issues (think websites like Vox). On a final note, consider the dramatically different backgrounds most people in America come from. How can we possibly expect someone from a religious small town in Kansas to agree with an individual raised in a big Eastern city? It's frankly quite shocking that we are able to come to some medium of consensus given America's disparate population composition."	8	False

Hrmp. It doesn't but anyway, your post, your rules.  
  
I'm trying to think of a real world example of this and nothing immediately comes to mind,
  
&gt;Just because all pineapples are melons does not mean that all melons are pineapples.  
  
So, to call that a ""sentence"" so it does not violate a ""rule"", we need to find a subject and a predicate. Subjects are generally nouns (words for people, places, and things) and predicates are generally verbs (words that convey action or a state of being). But like any ""grammar rules"" they are not absolutes. The predicate is actually easy to spot, ""does not mean"" that is a state of being. In a simpler example, ""A yellow card does not mean a player is ejected from the match."" The subject is a ""a yellow card"" and the predicate describes the state of being for the yellow card and I doubt that any grammatician (see, it's not even recognized as a word by Chrome) could find fault in that sentence, structurally.   
  
So the subject of our sentence is ""Pineapples are melons"" the ""just because"" is simply an introductory phrase such as ""*First*, we kill all of the lawyers"". Where ""first"" is neither the subject nor predicate and is simply an introductory word.  
  
Your alternative, which would read, ""The fact that all pineapples are melons doesn't mean that all melons are pineapples."" is going to rankle most grammaticians and style critics. The word ""that"" is notoriously problematic and almost always superfluous. What really betrays the issue you are having is that you mischaracterize the subject, ""fact"" is not the subject but would just be part of an introductory phrase. The sentence is not about the word ""fact"" it is about A, or ""all pineapples are melons"".

It happening infrequently only means that it happens infrequently and it doesn't preclude that there are more than two classes of people.

Correct me if I have misinterpreted your position, but you say there is a binary, and that all people fit into either male or female. Yet you accept that there may be anomalous people, so surely that means that the binary isn't a valid model? 

If you were making a product and it had to be either red or blue, but out of every 500 you found a purple one then yes, you have an anomaly and it's not going to pass quality control. But that doesn't work in nature when the quality control is just 'can this live?'. They are still a person and not an anomaly and so if you then try and classify them, you may not be able to put them into a male/female box.


I suppose in a statistical sense, the observation of non-binary people is anomalous, but that's just because there is a large background of binary-conforming people. But my point is that the fact that the do exist and don't fit into the binary means that the model of the binary should be changed. I don't know how much maths you know, but I suppose the way I see it is that rather than having a distribution like two delta functions (one on male and one on female), you just have rather steep Gaussians so the vast majority are on male and female but there's a small but non-trivial proportion that is not.

But nobody is saying they're more valuable than other jobs. Expecting servers to get a 20% tip while not expecting a chef to get a 20% tip is not the same as saying that waiters are 20% more valuable than a chef!

If a chef takes a job, and both the chef and the employer don't expect that chef to be receiving any tips, then then that chef is going to get paid exactly what both them and the employer agreed on for the wage.

If a server takes a job, and both the chef and the employer *do* expect the server to be receiving 20% tips, then the base wage they'll agree on is *less* than what they both expect the server to actually make, because they both expect the difference to be made up in tips.

It's a dumb system (I can't agree with you enough on that!). But nothing about this system implies that servers work is more valuable than the chefs. There's no strange ""entitlement"" here. That's just how the restaurant industry in the US works.

Also, like I said, there are restaurants that don't use tipping. Do you think the servers in those restaurants make less than on average than servers in other restaurants? No. Their base wages are different to compensate.

But I think all of this is missing the point. Again, go back to side-by-side examples. You go to a restaurant and sit at a table. Meanwhile, I sit at the next table over. We both order the same thing, and we get two different servers, who both offer identical service. But y*ou* made a choice that resulted in your server being paid less than mine, and less than what both that server *and* that server's employer anticipated when they took that job. You understand the system. You understand the same expectations that were present when the employer and server negotiated their pay structure. But *you* made a choice to circumvent that system that results in reduced pay for your server despite them doing their job properly."	6	False

I'm more discussing what happens as you get older and why jumping into new forms of entertainment might be harder to do for various reasons. I did use music as my springboard, though.

Remove musical taste from the equation and I think my message more is just that when you are 18, your life is much different than when you are, say 40, in varying respects.

When you are 18 your brain is still developing alongside having, on average, much more free-time and fewer responsibilities than someone who is 40 years old. I think those two facts of life play a significant factor into who someone aged 18-22 might appear at first glance to enjoy varying kinds of entertainment compared to someone who is 40. You just don't have the time you used to, and when you do have that time, you try to make the most of it, and sometimes a sense of control is what helps make life bearable for many people. Revisiting what you are familiar with helps with that for many people.

Also, and this is tied into a sociological point I made, entertainment and pop-culture sometimes is linked to a very particular set of experiences in ones past. When you are 40, you're way past the 'coming of age' stage of your life and often just your outlook on music in general is much different. I understand, as you pointed out elsewhere, that people make music well into their 40's (same could be said for other mediums), but you'll also find that breaking those people down is important as well: many people play a brand of music they are familiar with, or at minimum rehash it. Most of the innovative acts in music are people in their 20s, not people in their 50s. Again, I'm using music but it is a springboard for a bigger point I'm making.

I read an interview with Ad Rock from the Beastie Boys where he said he doesn't listen to new music much. He said he wasn't hating, but it just didn't feel like his vibe and he was more comfortable with what he came up. Music (and entertainment) is a lived experience sometimes as well, so you gotta consider people at varying levels of their development when looking at what they choose and when they choose it.

If people choose to be gay, they also choose to be straight. This would have to have happened at some time, marking a time where you found forks in the road and found one way or the other the better option. As you may realize, this isn't exactly a fitting description for being straight, and it therefore might make you reconsider your perspective of sexuality.

Just as how you did not decide one day that you were going to like women instead of men (making assumptions just to write this out quicker), I would suggest that the vast majority of gay people did not choose to like men more than women. 

If a gay person chose to be gay, that would mean you as a straight person chose not to be. So why, then, would some people 'decide' to not like women and instead like men? If you say that you DID choose between seeking relationships with men and seeking ones with women, but decided based on liking one over the other, then you didn't exactly choose much, did you? If you feel that you DID choose to be straight simply because it is what society sees as normal, it would indicate that you have the same level of attraction to both sexes-- which, in my opinion, makes you a bisexual who took the opportunity to fit social norms. And if you never made a conscious choice to find attraction toward the opposite sex rather than the same sex, why would it be reasonable to conclude that anyone else made the concious decision to like their own sex?

I never woke up one day to make any sort of choice to like men. I didn't compare and contrast the benefits or attraction. I simply noted that I had only ever been attracted to men(at the time, boys). I was 13 when I figured this out, and can look back now and see it far earlier now with how my relationships went with my close male friends as a kid. I know quite alot of gay people, and when I was younger, quite alot of gay teenagers. Never once did I hear that a single one 'chose' to be gay. Only once did someone -who held homophobic views- claim they did choose to be straight; all other straight people I discussed this with (far greater in number than the number of gay people) did not choose their attraction one way or the other. The one who claimed he did choose is now an out and proud bisexual judging from his facebook (not evidence just an observation).

So then, I must posit a question to you; when did you choose to be straight, and why did you decide not to be gay?

I myself am, as yourself, a survivor of early childhood sexual abuse. Normally I do not debate this, because it is rare the debate is in good faith, and when I do I explain is morally and psychologically. But that does not seem to be your issue. You seem to accept it is immoral, but cannot see why immorality makes it so harmful, there are plenty of other things that most people see as immoral, and they do not cause such damage. Same as your confusion about psychological harm, you can see it does cause psychological harm, but from what you say you can not grasp why, ideas about it impacting trust and not being emotionally ready from what I gather those sound a lot like moral arguments. 

You need a practical reason, not because you are defending child molesters, but because you do not really get why people are harmed by it, even though its wrong. The practical reason is that it damages the developing brain. It leads to a specific form of what amounts to brain damage, subtle, but affecting whole sections of the brain, and very difficult to change. Here are a few citations regarding the affect on the developing brain.

I believe it will always be and always was immoral. And even if we do not have a consensus on psychology it is for certain psychologically harmful.

However, the conclusions (bullet points) immediately below do not follow from that premise, and the arguments you listed are not good warrants for linking your premise to your conclusions.

What are your criteria for a right or wrong action? You need more than just a statement of what has value in order to say what actions are morally right.  You need to explore *how* an action relates to your value measure, and a set of moral rules or guidelines.  Simply referring to a ""continuity of consciousness"" and ""harm"" isn't enough. You have to define both. Until you do that, it's hard to figure out how you're drawing some of these conclusions.

&gt;If someone kills me right now, it harms me, therefore it is wrong. If someone kills me in my sleep, I am and was before a conscious entity and the consciousness will likely resume once I wake up; it would harm me if someone killed me, therefore it is wrong. But if I was never able to experience consciousness and I am not experiencing it at the moment, I don’t really lose anything, therefore it is not wrong to kill me. Similarly, if I am in a coma and will not ever wake up, I am not conscious now and won’t be in the future either, so it is not wrong to kill me.

I just have to keep asking ""why"" after each one of these sentences.  What is your criteria for ""harm""? From what I can gather, ""harm"" requires both of the following:

* Past consciousness

* Deprivation of future consciousness

Why?  Is it because this combination prevents avoidable net loss of consciousness over time?  If so, this is a very narrow view of consciousness on the grand scale.  You must also consider actions which prevent consciousness from arising in the first place to be immoral, if consciousness is your only value.  That is, an action like infanticide must be immoral, unless there is something one of us is leaving out."	2	False

I think this is a particularly inept example, because while most people do not understand math very well and so have trouble understanding what sorts of mathematical knowledge might depend on being able to do arithmetic (or algebra, or calculus, or geometry) quickly, *everyone* is fluent in their native language and has a strong grasp of the difference between what you can do with GoogleTranslate and what you can do as a fluent speaker.

But the broader issue is that the task you wanted to accomplish (google ""used cars"", look at pictures of used cars) is pretty direct. Maybe it took you three times as long, or something, but not bad for such an obscure question. A search that is more efficient with contextual knowledge needs to be one where you don't know in advance what questions you might need to ask, either because (a) the questions will depend on answers to initial questions or (b) the question is more precise than what the search algorithm is good at locating. The ""Go"" example I chose because someone who has no contextual knowledge about go wouldn't be able to think of that strategy - not because he wouldn't think of using google translate or Wikipedia to find the word for Go in foreign languages *if he wanted to know the word for Go in foreign languages*, but because he wouldn't realize the foreign word would make a better search string.

&gt; Search Engine 101 would teach a better search string may have been ""java app fails after terms of service"" or ""terms of service java error

Alas, I can see you have never encountered this problem. The person having the problem never realizes the wifi ToS has anything to do with their problem. They may not realize they were connected to a wifi network with the ToS, or connected to the internet at all. When the app starts, Java automatically checks for updates for the app. The wifi network sees an attempt to access the network and sends you the html for the ToS page. Java interprets this response as an updated version of the app's data and writes the html over the actual data. There is no way to connect the two things if you don't know how they work - that java is checking for updates, that the ToS sends data for an html file to any application that uses the internet.

&gt; I didn't even need to know distribution was a thing. The point I'm trying to get at is for the majority of people the how doesn't really matter. 

Because of your whole spiel about how ""education is a staircase, we shouldn't make students start at the bottom when we have so many inventions that help you start partway up"", etc etc etc, I assumed your goal was actually for people to ascend the staircase. The ""diving board"" represents someone who has only just enough education to use a calculator or something similar, but nothing more; he climbs up his little staircase, but the staircase was only built so he could play in the pool. He isn't becoming educated. If your position is something like ""The dirty proletarians will all be baristas and janitors, they don't need any fancy book larnin',"" then I don't agree but I can see why many of my examples would affect you. If, on the other hand, you *don't* think most people will win the nobel prize but you *do* think most people should be educated to a level that would permit them to understand public policy and current events, pursue their academic interests, and aspire to a broad variety of professional paths, then (a) there are a large variety of applications where being able to translate a conceptual problem into an algebraic problem is important, and (b) there are harder and harder levels of math which rely on algebra just as heavily as algebra relies on arithmetic.

The point of the example wasn't specifically about the relationship between the expression ""6x5"" and the conclusion that x=-15. It was that ""knowing how to solve 6x5=?"" is much broader than ""knowing how to input the string 6x5 into a calculator."" The first includes types of knowledge that aren't included in the second. More generally stated, knowing the answer to the question X is much broader than knowing how to input the string X' into a algorithm, where X' is the input for which the algorithm outputs the answer to X.

&gt; We can outsource certain parts of knowledge onto our tools and instead focus on creativity. Of course those that will become experts in their field will know the How's and the Why's and the What for's as they learn more about their subject as they need it.

Again, you wobble back and forth. First no one needs to know algebra; but now we need to educate people to make them creative! And how are they supposed to be creative if their quantitative thought is stunted at the second-grade level? Creativity means the capacity to look at the same problem in many different ways. Your view, however, is that if there is *any* problem that can be solved either by thinking in a certain way or with a tool, then *only* experts need to be able to think that way, and the proles will use the tool: and learning to think in as few ways as possible will make them more creative...? As I say, this is wobbly. Either you think ""an expert"" is anyone who isn't a barista or a janitor, in which case you are simply proposing something like educational apartheid, or by ""expert"" you genuinely mean only the top people in every field or profession, but you have a serious misunderstanding of the importance of being able to solve problems on your own.

I remembered another funny example of the motif. For reasons of security and confidentiality, the military wanted each part of the manufacture of the first atomic bombs to be done in a separate geographic location, and they wanted all the people who understood the bomb in Los Alamos and all the people at the production facilities completely in the dark. So for example the military wanted the people at Los Alamos to give the engineers in Tenesseee instructions for how much of what they were manufacturing (enriched uranium, but they had no idea, to them it was just certain minerals and gases coming in and out of machines) could safely be stored in a certain area. But when Feynmann arrived in TN, he found that the explicit instructions had been ignored because the people in TN had no idea what they were doing and had stored small quantities of their product, well below the safety maximum, in eight different rooms.... *but the rooms were adjacent to each other and the piles of enriched uranium were separated from each other only by thin concrete walls and floors.* The didn't know how a nuclear chain reaction would work so they didn't interpret their safety instructions as an attempt to avoid a chain reaction. The engineers and workers did not, in your theory of this, need to be ""experts"" in nuclear physics, or even know that they were dealing with ""uranium"" - and yet somehow they kept screwing up their very simple instructions because it was impossible to anticipate in advance how someone who had no idea what the instructions were for would interpret them.

&gt; yes it may be time consuming but you can help yourself by investing a little time into increasing your knowledge for something you use every day.

That's exactly my point. You want to learn a store of background knowledge (like the organization of your operating system) by heart, because even though you *could* learn the answer to any specific question with a search engine, even fairly basic investigations are complex, unwieldy, and unreliable until you have enough background knowledge to streamline the search down to the more challenging questions.

Good google-fu is really more about persistence and chutzpah than anything else. Even learning the advanced search functions, eh. They're not very robust. Beyond persistence you need specific knowledge about the subject (to streamline the search, as you say, to try different various different strings, and to have a good conception of what kind of answer you need) and about where data about the subject is available online."	2	False

There’s nothing wrong with not wanting to be in a relationship (I mean nothing is wrong with armoantics). However, not wanting to be in one yourself, doesn’t mean other people’s relationship are net negatives. I mean getting married correlates with several heath benefits:

For example, studies show that, because marriage reduces the risk of nursing home admission, marriage may also lead to reduced nursing home costs.(22)  The effect of marriage in shortening hospital stays may also lead to reductions in health care costs

With the practice of arbitrage, it brings the supply of one market, to another market to loosen up the demand and ultimately lower prices, but acting as that middle man, it is guaranteed profit (for a little while).

A single marketplace has only a limited amount of resources and services, but by introducing one marketplace to another, you bring the wealth of both marketplaces into one... helping the consumer overall!

The problem with two markets is that they are operating on two very fundamentally sets of data... where one may say...

Market A: 100 Units of Copper, 1000 Units of Gold
Market B: 500 Units of Copper, 500 Units of Gold

By taking advantage of those differences... you force both markets to realize that there is MORE information than what was originally taken into account! And if conditions are right and if costs virtually nothing for those two markets to interact... then it would be one marketplace of 600 Units of copper, and 1500 Units of gold.

Arbitrage is just new information coming into the equation. A correctional force for the right price of the product."	4	False

That is still their choice. Some might say the same of hysterectomies and vasosectomies, but we still allow them with a minimal amount of checks to prevent hasty decisions. 

The only mental health conditions that I think should be included in concerns about mental health affecting suicidality from a legal perspective are conditions that literally detsch one from reality in an obvious and severe way, such as psychosis, mania, and dissociation. 

Beyond that, it’s just nobody else’s business. We as a society should be endeavoring to address problems in our civilization that cause people to want to kill themselves, not forcing people to endure them simply because we do t have to suffer the same bad days. 

You’re advocating for a very hazy line to be drawn, and im guessing just don’t really care about that much about the views of the people who fall in the wrong side of it. How long should a depressed person have to be depressed to be allowed to legally kill themselves on your view? Should they have to subject themselves to ECT before they should be allowed to die? 

You are demanding that people’s right to control over whether or not they live or die be curtailed due to other people’s different estimations of how bad their lives are. That’s not an arena with clear-cut lines by any means, and I for one am much more comfortable letting people do as they see fit for themselves. The stats say the vast majority of suicide survivors regret their attempts and do not try again; better to disseminate those stats to as wide an audience as possible and make mental healthcare much easier for people to access than start denying people basic human rights to mitigate the damage our imperfect society wreaks on itself.

So if you want to define free will that way, I'm fine with that.

&gt;if there was 0 probability to choose B, then you cannot choose B.

I'm not sure I agree with this.  I could choose to intentionally drown my cat.  But I choose not to.  There is 0 probability that I will choose that option, even though the option is available to me.  It's not that I *can't* choose it, but that I *choose* not to, using this free will thing.  

I think this gets to the meat of our disagreement.  I'm saying that our ability to choose something doesn't logically necessitate that we must eventually make that choice.  You're saying it does.  In the end I think it's just the definitions you're using, again:  To you, 0 probability of choosing option B means there is no ability to choose B.  To me, 0 probability of choosing option B could also mean I would never choose that option.  Let me try to lay these out in logical form, in a universe where only options A and B exist.

The argument you presented goes like this:

* (p1) Free will exists: I have the ability to choose either A or B

* (p2) The probability of my choosing B is 0

* (p3) 0 probability means I don't actually have the ability

* (c1) Therefore, I have no ability to choose B (which contradicts p1)

So one of your premises must be wrong.  We agree on p2 so one of p1 or p3 must be wrong:  Either Free will doesn't exist or 0 probability can't mean I don't have the ability to choose B.

Here is my argument:

* (p1) Free will exists:  I have the ability to choose either A or B

* (p2) My will is such that I never desire to choose B

* (c1) Therefore, the probability of my choosing B is 0

Take the SAT for example. It has a reading section, which tests your analytic abilities after you read a short passage. You have to identify the meaning, the tone, maybe if there's a hint of irony.

Now, there's also a math section. They include questions that require critical thinking, such as conditional statements. Some of the harder questions do require you to ""think outside the box."" Even some reading questions require you to make deductions based on the information you are given. 

Finally, there's an essay portion, where you have to examine an issue usually regarding a moral question such as ""is there ever a time when deception is better than the truth?"" or something like that. Two essay graders look over what you wrote and examine your reasoning and argument along with your syntax and diction. 

Finally, I would like the dissolve the misconception that ""studying for a test does not demonstrate knowledge or intelligence."" Or course it could, as long as we make the right tests. Your last paragraph:

&gt;Put it this way. Do you want a bunch of people who test really well, and can all solve a certain set of problems perfectly, or a critical thinker that can solve many problems with ""Outside the box"" thinking""? It depends on the task at hand.

I think you're mistakening tests as asking you to memorize ""2+2=4"" instead of asking you to learn addition, and that is why you find our current standardized tests unsatisfying. True there are many tests out there that asks you to remember certain facts, but as I mentioned earlier, there are plenty of tests that sufficiently demands critical thinking.

It all really started with a game called Deus Ex. Which I'll get into further later, but first I must say that it is a very good game. Whether or not you're a gamer, I highly suggest playing it (the original, not the sequels. Which are also good.) Now, the thing about conspiracy theorists is that they are a rather... ostracised group of people. And why not? They're kooks, they're crazy, they wear tinfoil hats, am I right? Yeah, no... wait... what? Well, I can't sit here and say that conspiracy theorists are the most reputible people in existense. And Scotsman aside, there are a lot of them that make others look bad. A lot of it is psychological, people want ""inside"" knowledge to make themselves feel better about themselves. People are prone to believing the absurd, no matter how much evidence is lacking. And some people just don't know any better. But... what I will say is this. Conspiracies are real. Not all of them, of course. But some are, as this [Cracked.com article](http://www.cracked.com/article_15974_7-insane-conspiracies-that-actually-happened.html) can inform you.

I know what you're saying. *""But those aren't Illuminati conspiracies.""* and you're right. I just wanted to make it clear that conspiracies are real, they do exist, and acknowledging this fact does not automatically make one a crazy kook. Now, here's the thing about the Illuminati. They actually exist. Or rather, I should say, they [used to exist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati). I'm sure we can all agree that what *used* to be the Illuminati, most likely does not exist. With that said, why do we call the so called powers that be the Illuminati in the first place? Because it's not what *they* call themselves. It's what *we* call them out of convienence. There are people out there, who hold great power over others, and they are working together to create a new world order. We call them Illuminati, they could call themselves testicle-powder gang for all I care.

Hold up! Am I seriously going to assert that there is a large group of people with great influential economic and political power who are conspiring against us without backing it up with any proof? Well... ah... ""proof"" is such an absolute word, innit? No, I can't give you proof, because if I did that I would be labelled an anti-semite. (On account of the fact that those who do ""follow the money"" always wind up finding themselves with Jews at the top of the metaphorical pyramid.) What I hope to do is at least provide for you such an argument that you change your view and say, ""Hey, maybe this isn't *complete* bullshit afterall."" Though don't get it twisted, there is quite a bit of bullshit.

The game Deus Ex is interesting in that it presents a lot of ideas about conspiracies. I for one would not be surprised if it was Illuminati propaganda because it makes the Illuminati sound like the good guys. (And also other bullshit ideas like the lack of twin towers and a terrorist attack in New York, when it was published a year before 9/11. Again, bullshit, but fun to think about.) The character Leo Gold plays a small role, but he really spells it out for you [all at once](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsLccQXPJ0k). Now, assuming you either do not wish to watch that video or I linked the wrong one, here it is in text:

&gt; Number one: In 1945 corporations paid 50 percent of federal taxes. Now they pay
about 5 percent. Number two: In 1900 90 percent of Americans were self-employed;
now it's about two percent.  
&gt; It's called consolidation. Strengthen governments and corporations, weaken
individuals. With taxes, this can be done imperceptibly over time.  
&gt; The entire executive branch is hand-picked. Nineteen of the last twenty-three
U.S. presidents have been members of the Trilateral Commission. The Trilateral
Commission is financed by the Rockefellers and the Rotschilds.
&gt; Ever wonder why big car companies pay two percent tax while the guys on the
assembly line pay forty? Corporations are so big you don't even know who you're working for. That's
terror. Terror built into the system.

Now, the numbers in reality aren't quite right. But you can not seriously say that we don't live in a world [where the tax system is fucked up](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/04/irs-incomes_n_918458.html). Conspiracy? Yeah. Illuminati? Maaaybe. But when you take a look at the banks themselves, you start to realize how fucked up things are when they literally [throw around trillions of dollars](http://pubrecord.org/nation/8622/pentagon-papers-wall-street/) in secrecy. Of course it's a conspiracy, news media outlets won't report it. And why not? Maybe because the [media has been consolidated as well](http://i.imgur.com/coIc4.jpg). Seriously, you can't say that's acceptable.

Another thing the game Deus Ex points out is the [Knight's Templar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_Templar). Which, I'm sure we can both agree no longer actually exist. There is no Templar Holy Grail conspiracy. But if you know your history, you know the Knight's Templar literally invented the banking system that we know and love today. The federal reserve. Most people don't know this, but the federal reserve is a private organization. As in, not the government. Why? Because this gives them incredible leeway in how they manage themselves. Rockefeller and Rothschild are two names we CAN put to this (without sounding like an anti-semite,) because those families were huge proponents of the federal reserve. Why the conspiracy? Because there are only [nine countries without a Rothschild banking system](http://i.imgur.com/AALrBwi.jpg). Consolidated as fuck! Especially when you examine the [timeline](http://i.imgur.com/dQWHtso.jpg) of ownership.

So is the Illuminati the bankers? Yes and no. But it's clear now to you that there is some serious fuckery going on in the system when so few people control so very much of the world. Our money is not our money. Because of it's entertainment value, I highly suggest watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mII9NZ8MMVM&amp;feature=g-vrec) which demonstrates just how real the conspiracy is. Though it paints the ""red shield bank"" as it's own thing, when really it's one tentacle of the Illuminati. We haven't even begun to discuss the government.

The government, the gubmint, dem big bad money stealing grubby lizard folk, boy howdy do I hate me some gubmint. I'm being silly when I say that, of course. It's not like the CIA has spent billions of dollars on illegal operations to literally create the crack epidemic that ""keeps down"" the already disenfranchised of America. Except [they totally did](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_and_Contras_cocaine_trafficking_in_the_US). It's not like the CIA spent time and money on illegal operations and experimentations with the goal of complete and total mind control. Except [they totally did](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_ultra). And of course they'd never use their consolidated media to manipulate views. Except [they totally do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird). And this is just the things they *admit* to doing. But only a ""kook"" would let their imaginations run wild with what is still kept secret.

I've dealt in facts. It's crazy, it's scary. Can so few people truly hold so much power? Doubt it not. Is it even that unexpected? In the game Deus Ex, it treats the ideology of the Illuminati as one that simply utilizes common sense. Based on the idea that the one who is most fit to rule, will be the one to rule. What makes the idea of the Illuminati scary, is the idea of consolidating the entire planet under the rule of one. When one person has power over everyone, all our eggs in one basket, that's not something we should strive for. Yet it's happening. I've dealt in facts, though I've only begun to scratch the surface. It goes much deeper. Iraq wasn't about oil, but an expanding hegemony. DARPA is a scary as fuck technological nightmare. We do have a cure for AIDS, but it's not profitable. We really do have available alternatives to big oil. And let's be honest... NSA?

Damn, if only we could put names and faces to all these people... [oh wait.](http://i.imgur.com/PVpFY.jpg)

Though I recognize this as a fallacy of an authoritive argument, I can't talk conspiracy without hearing what the late, great [George Carlin](http://i.imgur.com/GZKjc.jpg) has to say...

&gt; ""They try to make it so your belief in conspiracy makes you outside the norm, that you're a kook, that you're a 'conspiracy buff' . . . Do I believe in conspiracies? Nah. Do I believe powerful people would get together and plan certain outcomes? Nah. Do I believe powerful interests would operate outside the law, maybe even kill people? Nah. Do I believe that secret government agencies might feel the need to assassinate a person and cover it up. Nah. I think everything in America is open, clean, and above board, and powerful people always play by the rules.""

So yeah... Illuminati? Nah, that's crazy. That's bullshit. But you know what isn't bullshit? The fact that there are a small group of people who wield great power in this world. We only call them Illuminati so they have a name.

I would like to think that prostitution would cut back on human trafficking, abuses, disease, etc, but so far the evidence is murky at best, and from my research, seems to point the other way.

One of the points of this article is that making it legal increases competition, which helps the *customer* not the prostitute.  It drives prices down, and, to compete, the prostitutes may try to offer things others don't (for example, not kick you out when you beat them, allow sex without a condom, etc.).  

Additionally, what seems to happen is that the pimps/sellers start a legal version of their business, which makes it easier to cover the illegal side, which they keep doing, since it's still lucrative.  It becomes harder to prove trafficking and slavery charges since they can say it's all voluntary and the women are often unwilling to take the massive risk of saying otherwise.  In Europe, about 75% (it varies by country) of prostitutes are immigrants, which makes them easier to control due to poverty, language barriers, and the ease of holding their immigration papers hostage. 

Options for decriminalizing prostitutes (but not pimping, and perhaps not purchasing sexual acts) may be worth exploring as an alternative - this isn't a merely two sided issue.  

Here's one [source](http://books.google.com/books?id=N5zUu-lLJUUC&amp;lpg=PT126&amp;ots=LIQkqI9sTV&amp;dq=percent%20of%20prostitutes%20that%20are%20immigrants%20europe&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=percent%20of%20prostitutes%20that%20are%20immigrants%20europe&amp;f=false ), I only skimmed it, but appears to match with the findings I researched a year ago in a debate with family on the topic, so I don't have others handy.

When dealing with brain-damaged people, the option of ""not letting them live anymore"" becomes available. With non-brain-damaged people, it is not, as you just said. Thus it is their mental capacity that makes the difference.

It's also been mine.  We allow the removal of support, but we don't allow them to be actively killed.  The reason mental capacity makes a difference is because the decision to retract support at that point falls to anyone else.  If they have mental capacity, the decision rests with them.  None of this implies the ability to affirmatively destroy a viable fetus.

&gt;Well if you want to make it technical, we could just sever the cord, thereby ""letting it die"", and then once it's dead, remove it. I think that's more cruel, but if you think it's better because of this technicality that you're claiming matters, then so be it. This is basically the same as what we do with defective infants...just starve them to death...then we can tell ourselves how much more noble we are because we didn't give them a painless injection. (This is one problem with your killing vs letting die belief, because it is causing so much additional unneeded suffering in the world. Why would we ever prefer starving someone to death?)

That's one way of looking at it.  For better or worse, the technicality does make a difference.  In the case of a non-viable fetus it's a moot point: it can't survive anyways.  However, from an infringement perspective that still has the same problem the head-crushing did.  I would argue that at the point where you're disconnecting it you do have to outright remove it, simply disconnecting a viable fetus, waiting for it to suffocate to death and then proceeding with the head-crushing isn't an acceptable alternative.

&gt;Well pain is one factor, and was just one example. It's obviously not the only interest any given person has though, and most people generally have interests other than pain that preclude fire. The point is that a direct relation between pain and the appropriateness of setting someone on fire can be drawn. No such relation exists with race/sex/species, and that is what makes such claims fallacious.

This is what I'm disagreeing with.  My point is that it's reasonable to make such general inferences.  Most humans feel pain, thus we treat humans like they can feel pain whether or not they actually do.  Such relationships *do* exist, at least in a limited fashion.  The issue with your previous example was that the particular differences and characteristics being asserted were not true of the class.

One incidental example of this is things like insurance, where demographic information is used in pricing.

&gt;It is. Just like the people who point to black people's lower test scores on average, which are factually documented, and argues that therefore the entire class of black people should be treated as less intelligent. You realize why that is a grossly unfair and disgusting way to view others right? You disregard the individual, and instead generalize averages across populations down to the particular. There is no way to argue that is a legitimate approach to things, and is essentially a fallacy of division. Do you understand why doing that with black people is inappropriate?

The reason that black people have lower test scores is the result of factors separate from their blackness, though.  In the case of sickle-cell anemia, skin cancer or something similar it's perfectly reasonable to do so.  The fact that bad examples exist does not imply that all examples are bad, essentially the hasty generalization fallacy.

&gt;Your phrasing was that humans as a class have rights different from animals, and that's what I don't acknowledge. There are a lot of individuals within the human class that have an interest against being killed, but that doesn't mean the class itself does or that you can make general statements in comparison to this group you've called ""animals"", because that's far too broad. The class ""dolphins"" and ""apes"" have the same proportion as us, so you can't define the world in terms of ""human"" and ""non-human""...that makes as much sense as using ""rocks"" and ""not rocks"" and then talking about characteristics as if ""not-rocks"" is some generalizable group.

Ah, my phrasing was unclear.  What I meant was that you acknowledged the human average as having the relevant interests in acknowledging that the vast majority of adult humans have them, and that we were thus debating whether such rights should be applied on an individual or class basis.  It's true that we can't make direct generalizations about the group ""animals"" due to its broadness, but that doesn't mean that we can't say that humans can be distinguished from it or given separate/different status.  You're absolutely right that were we to get into looking at what precise rights animals should be deemed to have we would really have to start looking at separate classes of varying width."	1	False

Science is structured in a way that researchers are encouraged to ask questions and pursue answers. Not all the questions are worthwhile and not all the answers are correct. One single study should never be used in isolation but examined within the broader context. That is part of the scientific method. Evidence based policy is not meant to take a single piece of research and use it to create an entire policy/agenda. Instead, evidence based policy is about looking for all the relevant existing research and using that to try and develop a policy. First with pilot programs and trials. Then collect more evidence to evaluate whether the policy is achieving it's intended goal, identify unintended consequences, and if alternatives are better. Then reevaluate policy and adjust as necessary. This evidence based approach uses evidence to develop, execute, and evaluate policy. By contrast, a lot of policy today doesn't have clearly stated objectives that can be measured. They are created as a reaction to some other event and don't address the underlying or root . For example, sex education seeks to prevent unwanted teen pregnancy. We have decades of reliable data showing that comprehensive sex education, easy  access to health care, and access to contraception is the best way to reduce unwanted teen pregnancy. The current us policies surrounding abstinence only education encourage schools (through a matching block grant program) to do the opposite because parents feel that teaching kids about sex leads to more sex. If these policies were enacted through the process I described above, then we would have gotten rid of these programs a long time ago.	2	False

If Bank B buys Bank A, it currently assumes that those loans are assets of Bank A because the loans are transferable. If the law said that the loans get nullified, Bank B would take that into account when doing the valuation of Bank A and would lower its bid accordingly.
&gt;
&gt;No, I am not. If Bank B buys Bank A, then Bank B OWNS Bank A. Which means, you still have a contract with Bank A. No transfer needed.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Not if it mentioned upfront that the contract is exclusively between the two parties. Or if the law also states the same.
&gt;
&gt;If you do this, it wouldn't apply to any existing contract, and there would be a lot of limitations of the options you would have in the future.

Why would it not apply to existing contracts? It would be a default law that states baseline unwritten expectation for all contracts, current or future. Everyone would adjust around that law. 

You are inventing concerns. Everyone adopts their lives around new tax laws for example. And they do it routinely.

&gt;Bottom line, a contract is, simply put, an agreement between two entities, who, 99.99999% of the time, are not you. Why do you feel you have the right to tell them what they can and can't agree to?

You're putting words in my mouth. I never said how the contract should be written. I only made a case for default behavior for all contracts unless the contract explicitly overrides it. 

Same case applies today. If you write a contract that it is null and void or needs to be renegotiated if one party gets bought out, that is what it is.

&gt;&gt;Firstly, your example has nothing to do with nullifying contracts when one bank buys another. When bank A owns the asset, the house, it has 120k worth assets. If that has reduced to 108k, that is a loss on the books. Banks routinely have to write off bad loans or underperforming loans on its books. It just affects valuations. It does not stop one bank from buying another.
&gt;
&gt;You demonstrate a misunderstanding of mortgages. Bank A doesn't own the asset. It never owned the asset. Unless payments aren't made and the house is foreclosed on, it never will own the house. John Smith owned the house, and Bank A loaned you money to buy the house, in exchange for a security interest in the house (a ""lien"").
&gt;
&gt;It is a 3 party sale. 
&gt;
&gt;Party 1 sells the house, gets the money. 
&gt;
&gt;Party 2 gives the money, gets a promise to pay from party 3, backed by the house as collateral. 
&gt;
&gt;Party 3 buys the house, in exchange for a collateral backed obligation to make payments.
&gt;
&gt;Party 2 is the Bank. It owns the debt. Even though party 3 PAYS the debt, party 2 owns it. Who are you to dictate whether they sell their asset? They did you a solid by fronting the loan amount. Your way of saying thanks is to dictate to them what they can and can't do with their asset?

""Your way of saying thanks??""

""They did you a solid??""

Wow. Just wow. So we should be grateful for the benevolence of banks who stoop from their mighty splendor to give us loans? Is that your stance?

You are getting completely confused. Where did I say anything about forcing banks or individuals to do something else with their assets or loans?

While you explain loan ownership very well and very succinctly, you are unable to grasp the logic here.

My point is dead simple. And you avoided answering it too, and chose to give explanation on something else.

1. You said that a law that would force contracts to be nullified or renegotiated if one company buys another company would ""destabilize"" society. I said nothing of that sort would happen. **If** such a law was already there, companies would just factor that into their valuations of other companies and work on that new paradigm. You have said zilch to prove me otherwise.

2. You gave an example of a house losing valuation over time. That example has nothing to do at all with one bank buying another (with which you have the loan). You spoke about how the lendee is suddenly given a magic bullet to get rid of that loan because one company buys another??

The lendee doesn't even need to do that. This is a big reason why people foreclose or short sale.

At any rate, like I said, all these are market risks. And just like an investment strategy, when company A buys company B, it will take these factors and risks into account as well. But it is not a ""dealbreaker for the economy"" like the way you are painting this out to be.

&gt;&gt;Poppycock. There is no ""destabilizing"" of the economy that will happen. Like I said, it will only affect the valuation of the loans when one company buys the loans from another.
&gt;
&gt;Can you cite the peer reviewed studies that demonstrate your asserted risk of ""none"" to the level of confidence that you're presenting?

How can I produce peer review for a hypothetical scenario?? I will admit I came across too strong and I shouldn't have. You too have ample room in this argument and are making some good points too.

&gt;&gt;It can also be argued that this entire business of reselling and buying and repackaging and ""tranching"" loans like CDOs is itself a toxic practice and in fact, this is what ends up ""destabilizing"" the economy. Like it did in the 2009 housing market crash.
&gt;
&gt;This isn't what caused the housing market crash. Excessive creation of subprime loans and short selling stocks did.

The entire reason why subprime loans and NINA loans were being sold like candy was because they were being repackaged into CDO tranches and were sliced and diced so much no one was even keeping track. And those CDOs were all getting stellar ratings by credit rating agencies.

So I think you're turning a blind eye to this.

&gt;I work in finance. You are going to need to actually bring real evidence, based on things that actually happened, to convince me of anything.

You mean evidence of why and how the 2009 crash happened? And you actually want me to give proof that CDOs did not play a role in this??

&gt;Side note: the CMV started with the sale of one company to another, not with the sale of debt between companies. The latter is a common practice that is as safe as the banks doing them. More focus should be placed on regulating banking safely rather than destroying essential balancing methods for financial institutions that help mitigate debt and encourage market growth.

Completely agree.

At any rate, OP was only making a very hypothetical point. A fairly unrealistic one at that.

&gt;And that is being done, namely via new regulatory agencies with experts researching and placing controls to analyze and mitigate risk in financial regulatory spheres. And I vastly prefer letting those experts handle the regulation, over ""reddit polls"".

Well, reddit is not passing any laws anytime soon. But you seem to suffer too much from the ""appeal to authority"" syndrome. You don't have to have too much deference for them. They are not benevolent either. Ifanything, they are sharks even if not crooks. And they have screwed up plenty.

Those very ""experts"" were single handedly responsible for the meltdown of the economy. And they all got away scot free to boot.

I don't think I am, but I'm also not an expert.

My understanding is that with a NIT, you get paid each month an amount dependent on your earnings. The normal income-tax processes are in place and do this automatically without additional admin and means-testing, but the amount you get is dependent on your income relative to the threshold.

A UBI pays out a constant amount each month to everyone, with no regard for their earning. Then additional taxes are used to recoup that money from people who you're not trying to benefit with it.

With a NIT, if you earn the threshold amount, you receive no money. With a UBI, if you earn the threshold amount, you receive that amount, but your taxes also go up by that amount. 

I can't speak to the reliability of the source because I just found it with a quick search, but this seems to give a pretty good overview of the differences. http://www.scottsantens.com/negative-income-tax-nit-and-unconditional-basic-income-ubi-what-makes-them-the-same-and-what-makes-them-different


&gt; Otherwise what you're proposing is way more regressive that if it were funded by a consumption tax. The rich would pay nothing to fund UBI!

I don't think it's right to say that the rich would pay nothing, because I also backed increasing other taxes on the rich. As you've identified, it's hard to come up with a single tax that is able to fairly tax rich and middle-class alike because they manage their money differently. Instead of aiming for that with a consumption tax that *kinda* gets there but has other problems, why not just have income-tax *and* some other tax that more capably targets the rich?"	1	False

You did mention an ""academic"" context so perhaps I was reading too much into it. I don't think there is a lot of opposition to using the word ""cringe"" in academia, although I am aware of complaints about using the term ""capitalism"" in academia. Perhaps you mean something closer to english departments and not economics.

&gt;Secondly, in the case of that authoritarian regime, if anything relying only on the meanings pre-established and controlled by an authority is more likely to lead to the people being easier to control, and that the constant coinage and usage of new words and meanings can actually be a very useful tool of resistance.

Despite the 1984 reference, I don't see it happening by authoritarian regimes. It can also be used to distract from the truth or pivot away from responsibility. Remember when ""fake news"" was used by the left until Trump coopted the term? What does Jordan Peterson ""really"" mean by what he says? Terms like defund the police are talked about as if they have a particular meaning. It's a canvas that listeners can paint their own personal meaning on to.

It's a handy tool to say whatever your target audience wants to hear without ever having to go back and answer for any of it. ""Well, that's not what I meant.""

&gt;Thirdly, as much as it might be uncomfortable to contemplate, sometimes, the changing/replacement of old words and meanings, even when it's done by the authority, can be beneficial. 

I'm more advising caution than saying it's never helpful. The idea of words not really having meanings is something I find troubling, but managing speech to some extent can be useful.

Plus it gets so confusing. How am I supposed to know what particular person means when some other person means the opposite? Perhaps that should have been my key point."	2	False

This was a hard one because I personally actually don't care so I had to think why I should care as well. I'm going to tag u/pixeldigits because I think he's asking for the same thing, namely why you both, individually, should care.

Let's assume you are a near perfect individual. You can easily and efficiently fact check all targeted messages and can even tell when accurate statistics are being misrepresented. Let's even go so far as to assume that you are so intelligent and aware that you are completely immune to the effects of manipulation. 

So big data can't affect you directly, *but can it affect you indirectly*? I would say yes. 

Distributed power is a crucial part of a fair society (and I assume you want to live in as fair of a society as possible). When normal people have the freedom and power to think and act upon their own self-interest, that reflects back on your experience. When people are fighting for a better wage, better healthcare, better education, and better politicians, you benefit from these actions whether you feel them or not.

Big data is a dangerous tool for manipulating society. With the proper data, you can appease those who fight for your wage, healthcare, education, etc. by giving them the proper lip service to calm them down. I don't want to start a whole debate on whether Trump is a good president, but he for sure does not deliver on everything he says. How does he have such steadfast supporters despite this? He is very good at knowing what his constituents want. And it is precisely because he knows what his constituents want that he is able to appease them time and time again without delivering on his promises. As a more extreme example, with just the information that his constituents felt resentment and cheated out of their fair share, Hitler fed off of this resentment and gained millions of followers. 

So, once again, why should *you* care? We don't have a Hitler, and one politician who knows how to lie better isn't necessarily worse than one who is worse at lying, right? Wrong. The greater the ability of an individual to influence society, the more power the individual has relative to everyone else. And from a historical standpoint, the more power in the hands of the few, the greater the inequality that exists in that society. And as a (I assume normal) member of this society, I'm sure that's what you'd want because you'd inevitably get more than if other people were taking disproportionally more resources. 

But this is not happening right now, so why should you care? You should care because companies having your personal data enables this. And by the time you realize it's having an effect on your well-being, it would be too late. Fighting against companies having your data is a preventative measure. 

Lastly, you might think there is value in seeing the world fairly. Maybe there's value in observing the world through an unbiased lens without having to fact-check everything. Maybe there's value in your loved ones also viewing the world through an unbiased lens. With big data getting out of hand and the direction of targeted ads and news today, is seems like that's all disappearing very quickly. "	3	False

I think I could’ve phrased the bit about language describing your gender identity a bit better. I meant to express that being cisgender, your perspective on gender and pronouns differs a lot from someone outside male or female on the spectrum. Like I said, I don’t mean that as a knock against you (and I don’t think you took it that way). 

&gt;How does the language describe my gender identity? By using my pronouns (I am a man) it’s not like I buy into all the qualities that constitute a man on the furthest end of the spectrum. It would be wrong to say that I have all the qualities that is assumed to be masculine. I also have qualities that may be assigned as feminine, but I don’t need a new pronoun to reflect that. 

I definitely agree that using a certain pronoun doesn’t put you into a box. However I actually think that this is a point for my argument. For example, I’ve noticed that a lot of people, when they first learn about nonbinary identity, tend to think it’s just “between male and female”. Like I said earlier, there are as many ways to be nonbinary as there are nonbinary people, and I think that having several gender-neutral pronouns could help nonbinary people more easily diversify their identities. 

&gt;If people accept all the pronouns that are used at some point, this argument would work. But that is something that happens with time. You can’t force it on people who don’t accept them. 

Well, everything needs time, right? People are still resistant to singular they pronouns being used, but they’ve gained a lot more mainstream traction in recent years. And I don’t really see the whole “forcing” part of it. When someone uses pronouns that differ from the ones associated with their birth sex, there are always gonna be people that reject that, and people continuing to use those pronouns isn’t forcing anything. Are you referring to people saying it’s transphobic if you don’t understand or want to use neopronouns? Because I don’t like that either and I don’t think it lends to productive discussion, but I also don’t think that itself is an argument against them. 

&gt;There’s a big problem with this. If you make a word for every unique thing there is, you would run out of words. 

I think this is a slippery slope fallacy honestly. People aren’t arguing for a new pronoun for every person. 

&gt;With language, how am I supposed to remember which pronoun to use?

The problem with a lot of these is that they are for government jobs, they are often hard to get and not worth the time. Those generally don't even pay enough to be worth it.

This already exists in small part and would only need to be expanded.

The U.S. covered it, without even voting on it.

It's a different world. It seems like a lot of music fans are even slower to move on than the record industry was. Success means different things now than it did in the past.

As a listener and fan, what does that mean? Do I lack for new bands to listen to? Are there no shows to go see? Are there no new albums to buy?

The answer to each of those is a firm and definite ""no."" 

Are the bands I listen to all over top 40 radio? Probably not, but they wouldn't have been before, and nobody but the people programming corporate playlists cares about that.

You might say rock not being on the radio makes it harder to find. Nobody uses the radio to find music anymore. The bands are on YouTube, on Bandcamp, on Spotify, on music sites and blogs. It's easier to find it now, I'd say. Hell, it's overwhelming how much of it there is. I can't keep up.

For the musicians, it might be different. But becoming the next guns n roses was always playing the lottery. Perhaps that went from one in a million to one in ten million, but at the same time, there are much more accessible and reliable ways to become popular enough to get by.

Now you may still disagree and believe that the baker should still make the cake, and if this is the case I ask you, where do you draw the line? Is a Jewish baker required to bake a cake for a Nazi wedding? Is a Christian photographer required to photograph an orgy? In both these cases a religious individual is being asked to serve an event with which they disagree, which is exactly the same as the case with the Christian baker and the gay wedding.	1	False

Significant cognitive capability and sentience.

Firstly I did not say that recognizing the mothers voice indicates significant cognitive capabilities. The point was that is indicates sentience. You've conflated the two by starting in your first paragraph talking about cognitive ability, and then trying to compare it to sentience in your second paragraph.

My point has nothing to do with cognitive ability, and I hope yours doesn't either, so we can simply stop using that idea entirely, because it would  lead to very bad and quite evil things.

I'm also not talking about self awareness, because what does that have to do with anything either?

Maybe you need to edit your OP to be more specific otherwise people will have to chase a moving dot. 

It seems your rebuttal of Natalie's discussion is that this is not how you individually experience the word and therefore she's wrong. What necessarily makes your experience with the word the overriding correct interpretation when you just said you are experiencing it in a different setting/culture and a different context? Why does that make the derogatory connotations of ""trap"" wrong in how she explains it? 

Because [""Are Traps Gay""](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trap) has a specific history in the US and other English speaking countries. Are you trying to say how we experience the word and how we use it is wrong because your culture/community uses it differently? I actually don't quite follow that reasoning. Perhaps your culture does use the word differently but that doesn't change how it's used here and the overriding transphobic notions wrapped up in it. 

Japan has a different context for blackface than the US but that doesn't mean blackface in the US isn't considered offensive or historically wrapped up in fraught notions of racism. A lot of Japanese people don't see blackface as offensive and don't necessarily even understand why it is offensive to black people in the US. Does that make the US wrong here too? 

It seems to me you're kind of saying that cultural ignorance be tolerated instead of taking the step forward in understanding why someone is rightfully offended. If you didn't realize the complete context of the word and don't acknowledge the historical facts around it what is the case for the idea that a non-transgender community gets to decide on words to describe transgender people? 

I don't know if ""trap"" is translated differently in your country's language but the English slang use of the term in English speaking countries has been and continues to be used against transgender women in English speaking countries in exactly the way Natalie describes. That's just historical fact like how blackface has been used as a derogatory performance of ""blackness.""

I am not Spanish, so I will have to use US political parties for my example.  People who are minorities in the US are both more likely to be less educated and more likely to be democratic.  By developing a test that requires you to understand even _basic_ civics, you are going to eliminate more poor minorities (e.g. Democrats) than you are any other group.  The only way to avoid this is to make the test _so_ rudimentary that anyone can pass it without formal education and at that point, what purpose does it serve?

Now, lets say you focus it on just what the parties believe.  Well, each person is unique and may align themselves to parties for different reasons.  Say you are an inner-city Democrat who supports the party because they want to increase the minimum wage and strengthen unions.  I ask you, ""What are the top 3 Democratic issues?"" and you say, ""Minimum wage, union reform and strong labor laws.""  I now have the power to say, ""Sorry, the correct answer was abortion rights, universal healthcare and women's equality.""  I just denied you the vote because I was able to design the question in a way that purposefully eliminates people I don't want.

As good as the idea seems, people shouldn't have to prove some level of intelligence to tell their leaders what issues are important. If I feel that my country needs universal healthcare, I shouldn't have to hit some arbitrary level of civics knowledge in order to make that opinion known; I should have the right to vote for the person who promises to fight for universal healthcare.  Yes, it means that there is risk in people making uninformed decisions, but the consequences of limiting  the vote only to those we deem worthy is much more dangerous."	17	False

And if they were to ask why, the answer is the same that would be acceptable to baseball fans. With pitchers as good as they are, and the rise of big analytics, teams have a much better idea of where players put the ball and can deploy their infielders accordingly. The end result is a more boring style of baseball. Banning the shift aims to gives us more of what fans want to see: hits, big plays, runners on base, etc.

Because of that, it is also very strange to blame the politicians and legal system for doing exactly what the police unions lobby for, but not blame the police unions themselves. I do not understand saying ""This lack of accountability is a problem"" while simultaneously saying ""The organization that primarily negotiates for this lack of accountability is not a problem.""

What I can change your view on is your second comment about the inverse scenario.

Not only should you give your siblings a handout, you should evenly split the winnings with your immediate family. So for example, lets use the $300 million winning scenario and you have 1 sibling and 2 parents. You give them each $75 million (or whatever the amount after taxes divided by 4) and call it a day. I don't know how close you are with your family, but if you wish to have any semblance of a normal relationship with your family, then you need to dismantle any benefit you have over them. Easiest way to day that: split evenly. 

OPTION 1:

Let's play out the scenario where you keep all your money and only give negligible contributions to them. While at first your family may not ask you for anything, over time they will become resentful. They know you did not earn that money, several balls in a rotating bin decided you were going to be rich and not them. Nothing you did earned you that wealth; you got lucky. It could have easily had been them as the rich one and you as the poor relative. They won't forget that. Family events roll around, but they are never the same. You cannot relax. You are paranoid everyone is coming up to you asking for money. And they probably are indiscreetly, talking about fancy new cars or grandiose business ventures. You feel like an outsider in a room full of leeches. After so many refusals, your extended family as well becomes resentful. They know as well you did not earn that and they start seeing you as a greedy person who doesn't have the decency to spread the unearned wealth. 

Your family starts plotting against you. They no longer view you as waycooladenu, they see you as a stiff money bag that needs to be bled. Everything you do becomes a potential target of a lawsuit. You hosted a halloween party at your $9 million dollar villa, but your marble floors had a spill you didn't see. Guess who's going to slip in that puddle and slap you with a $500,000 negligence claim? 

This becomes your life. A person with no real family, just leeches that try to cash grab whenever they get the opportunity. I know I've been focusing on family, but this will be true of your friends as well. You will be a loner in this world with an ever depleting source of cash from people always trying to find you negligent for everything you've ever done. 

OPTION 2:

After receiving the check and sharing the news with your immediate family, you split the wealth with them. They are ecstatic. You tell the news to your close friends (lets say 4 of them). You split your wealth again. You are now down to, lets say $10 million. You now have enough to live a very comfortable life and never work again. The other great part is you have people close to you that will not feel resentment and you can share that care free life with them. 

Your extended family. Family events are much more care free for you. Those pesky cousins are not coming to you for money anymore, they are going to your parents, who still have half of your winnings. They, likely being the more generous types, help spread the wealth among them. Family functions are stress free and enjoyable. No one is asking you for money, no one is plotting against you. You have plenty of money to feel comfortable and your family and friends think very highly of you for being so generous. 

That's my reasoning for why being greedy won't pay off in the long run and you should share you wealth with your family. "	1	False

Even among immigrants from such countries to the West, such opinions can persist, for example [20% of young British Asian people support violence against women who ""dishonor"" their family](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/support-for-honour-violence-in-poll-7578177.html).

It is not just an extreme minority who act and support such acts. But you are right that they are similar to other parts of the world from a few centuries ago - but you're forgetting how horrible those places were, in those times. Some parts of the world have undergone a massive transformation in the last few centuries - democracy, equality for women, equality for LGBT people. Those things are just a dream in large parts of the world. It might be hard for people raised in modern countries to even understand how huge the gulf is. There is a massive cultural difference between the country you grew up in, and most Islamic countries.

That difference is not a justification for Islamophobia. But neither is it justification for saying there isn't a difference, or that it is only an extreme minority who have views we in the West find abhorrent.

When in direct conflict, or the appearance of direct conflict, national populations do not seek domestic change, but rather the removal of the external threat.

If I punch you so hard that I knock a couple of teeth off, then, _in my view_, you clearly deserve it. If I thought that at least a modicum of restrain was in order, of course I would have shown some restrain. 

&gt; &gt; Aside from that, some people find it very psychologically taxing to show restrain. What reason do you have to prioritize the punched's well-being over others? They have a right to talk more to peaceful people and less to violent people.

That would be a very weak argument, even if it didn't completely miss the point.

It simply doesn’t make much sense to domesticate a carnivore to eat. They require much more labor/resources per calorie of edible meat. Pigs are actually pretty much the only common domesticated animal that aren’t herbivores.

Regarding #1, societal expectations are passed on through the generations.  But a typical implication is that 'because societal expectations result in men holding positions of power, therefore men are sexist', which doesn't make sense because it is both men and women who have learned these societal expectations, and it is both men and women who continue to reinforce them.

Regarding #2, we should absolutely be striving to bring more equality and end unhelpful societal expectations.  However, when you talk about ""male chauvinist/sexist world culture"", I believe you're shooting the wrong target.  Equality won't be brought about by convincing everyone that men are chauvinists or sexists, it'll be from convincing people that sex-specific differences (such as women having 100% of the pregnancies) are no longer as important as they used to be.

Whether you like the idea or not,  the simple fact is that work you and not work you are actually the same person,  and no impenetrable wall between the two exists. When a company is hiring a person,  they are hiring a person,  not just an activity.  For the same reason that many functions are considered too sensitive to contract out to a contractor,  an employer may wish to vett the character and public presence of their employees.  

For an example of this in action,  use the small town example,  which exaggerates the effect for easy examination. 

In a big city you have a certain illusion of anonymity.... Not so in smaller communities. 

Let's say in hooterville,  pop 1200,  Jim is well known as an asshole.  He brags about his asshole exploits on Facebook,  showing how he benefitted from swindling people,  got so and so in bed then dumped her,  (#cumdumpster)  and also happens to be very publicly active in the ""777 club"",  a faux satanic club that binge drinks while sacrificing kittens once a month. 

Everyone knows Jim is an asshole.  But Jim also has never been late to work even once in his life.  He is,  arguably,  the best electrician the town has ever seen.  When it comes to work,  he is 100 percent professional.  Jim decides that a change of career is in order. He goes to a car dealership in the next town over,  and the manager loves his resume and references from his old jobs.  He is obviously qualified,  and has an exemplary record with all of his employers. A quick look at his social media,  however,  leaves the manager deeply concerned.  As a car salesman,  Jim's public reputation will reflect on the entire enterprise.  Ultimately,  he is turned down for the job.

I don't think that the evidence supports that claim and that to make it instead would require you to prove that to be the case. Monotheism has existed for less time and yet has changed a lot over multiple iterations. If we had no access to the myths of polytheistic cultures it would still be more reasonable to assume change than stagnation.

I'm not just saying ""inductive reasoning is the best way to solve problems because I believe so,"" I'm using verifiable evidence collected throughout my entire life.

I really don't mean this to sound flip, but it is kind of funny that what you are doing here is defending inductive reasoning using inductive reasoning. The process of using data to extrapolate universal laws is inductive reasoning, so to say that you believe in inductive reasoning because it has successfully solved your problems such as data points A,B and C and therefore you can expect it to solve future problems is really tautological.

Your main point is really interesting though. I meant to tailor my response more to your question, but honestly I got sidetracked in my comment and started to ramble a bit. The point I started with however, seems like a fair response to this idea that we shouldn't be contented with faith as an end point, even if pragmatically sometimes it is inevitable. Or to put it another way that we should always search for evidence to justify our assumptions and not accept them truly on faith in a global sense.

My response is that the legitimacy of faith as an explanation, or the requirement for empirical evidence, is going to be based on the question being asked. Different questions are best answered using different epistemological methodologies. For instance, if I want to know how tall I am, the best way to gather that information would be to use inductive reasoning and measure myself. If I want to know whether it is consistent to support both abortion and the death penalty I will use deductive reasoning to see if the assumptions involved in my support for those views conflicts. Deductive reasoning would be fairly useless in answering the first question, and vice versa for the second.

The question then is is there any class of problems best solved by faith based responses. I believe there probably is such a set of questions. I am going to substitute the word intuition here which I feel is a fair stand in for a faith based belief since an intuition is a belief not based on any form of reasoning.

So what types of questions then are best answered with intuition. In general they are questions that relate to your own conscious experience. For instance, if I want to know whether I am happy or not I can't use deductive or inductive reasoning. I merely consult my own consciousness and accept that intuition of whether I am happy. If I want to know whether I am sad, even though there might be behavioral correlates I cannot collect evidence for whether I feel sad in my own mind. The only way to answer such a question definitively is to accept the intuition at face value and go from there based on faith. There do appear to be some questions best answered by faith and intuition.

So lets try to bring this back to religion which seems to be at least part of the central focus of your question. From the perspective of a religious person you might say that the question of whether there is a God or not is best answered using the same methodology as whether or not you are happy. The way you perceive God is as a part of your own consciousness and therefore in the same way that you wouldn't approach a question of your own conscious state with inductive or deductive reasoning you can't this one. It is a question best answered by intuition or put another way best answered by faith.

Of course this is somewhat of an arbitrary designation, but there is no particularly good reason we would expect the question of whether there is a God to be one best answered with an inductive methodology either. At the end of the day it is a question we know sufficiently little about how to answer that we cannot be sure which methodology is best suited. It could full well end up being a question best approached from a faith/intuition based methodology.

What do you want your relationship to mean?

For me, family is not about being buddies (though not exclusive to it).  They're not necessarily people you hang out with.  They're people that you are there for and are there for you.

Friends - real friends - are very much like family.  In fact, the very positive end of both relationship spectrums are the same to me.

Buddies are folks I like to hang out with and spend time doing stuff for fun.  This requires shared interest, time, and space on a semi-frequent basis.  I have friends that used to be buddies as well but lost buddy status when I moved and our schedules didn't allow for regular online meetups.  Still do things together once or twice a year.

Positive acquaintances - people I don't mind making small talk with and might become buddies or friends if circumstances change.

Acquaintances - folks I cross paths with, frequently or infrequently, but about whom I know almost nothing personal.

Now the trick is that relationships are two-way.  Maybe I've got a friend who will only think of me as being a friend if we are also (what I call) buddies.  That's fair - but it means our friendship is time and space limited.  I can't force friendship on someone.

You may be dealing with family that define the family relationship differently than you.  That's fine - unless the won't maintain the relationship at the level you want without some additional input from you.  Then you have a decision to make (and doing nothing is a decision).

&gt;I believe people should respect that and shouldn't take it personally and weaken the relationship.

Relationships are personal - even business relationships.  They're also (at least) two-way.  You don't get to decide them on your own.  You say the relationship is strong.  They're telling you they don't feel that way.  You can meet their expectations, not meet their expectations (and accept they won't be as satisfied with the relationship as you), or change their expectations about what is needed in your relationship.

It sounds like you (and those with whom you have a relationship) are going through a transition.  The condition in which your relationship formed is not the condition you're in anymore.  You can let it all change on its own or try to steer it.

Personally - ask yourself how often any one that complains you're not visiting comes to visit you.  As someone who has moved a lot - everyone says they want you to visit but doesn't on their own.  They're just being a bit selfish.

When I pointed this out to some of my family and friends a few, very few, did something about it.  That improved our relationship.  Others did nothing and got moved to a 'friendly acquaintance' status - now I take their requests for what they are, polite nonsense.

tldr:

You need to define, and perhaps redefine, your relationships while recognizing that they are personal and two-way."	2	False

I love Jon Stewart, but if I'm going to use something I heard on his show in an argument or in making a decision, I will fact check it first, because I know he is a comedian. Regarding the Otatmeal article you linked to, while I agree that the reaction of the author was a bit angrier than necessary, you also need to have some context on the whole Edison-Tesla thing. For geeks of a certain stripe, the Edison-Tesla rivalry in which Edison is a douche and Tesla is an unrecognized genius is already there. The comic is taking on an already existing narrative and not breaking any new ground, and this needs to be taken in to account when considering it's humour. The point is not that Edison was god, but that his contributions were arguably greater than Edison's, and yet he is virtually unknown despite being a purer scientist, while Edison is universally praised despite being ethically and morally corrupt. In any case, I do agree that comedians who try to make a truth claim that is patently false and get called out on it should simply ackowledge that they were wrong. A better example of this is Bill Maher and his documentary Religulous, which (while I do agree with the basic message) has a lot of inaccuracies about various religions. 	2	False

Their authoritarian dictatorship wasn't hidden. It was well advertised that they had work camps and any who opposed Dear Leader would meet a gruesome fate. They did this to demotivate other would be dissidents. Spying did not help in this regard.

&gt; [Hitler] didn't have good reasons to invade Poland

Are you suggesting he had good reasons to invade Austria and Czechoslovakia? Hitler's speeches, desire to rid the world of non-Aryans especially Jews and communists, and his Four Year Plan indicate that Hitler wanted war. Spying would not have helped.

&gt; ...international support...balance of power...international community...

The main reason we have separate countries is that citizens want different things in different cultures. Naturally, this creates friction and the citizens of each nation will want their country to be the best country. Accepting spying puts those with lesser spy networks at a tremendous disadvantage.

A country could learn that another one is running low on troop reserves and order an immediate attack. Another country could find out it's neighbor will have fewer jobs in the next month and short their economy, making billions at the expense of the neighbor. The risk is extremely high.

From what you've been saying, it seems you believe this would work with a strong international community in an already established time of peace. How strong is the international community now? The world constantly gets more and more furious with the US for it's actions. The EU is crumbling since certain countries are bankrupting others. Russia and China are making land grabs. The extreme trust and care that this would require does not exist. Spying is significantly more likely to cause international harm than to stop it."	2	False

In a multi-lane highway, I've definitely been in the situation where the car in front of me is going under 50 MPH, and the cars in the next lane are going above 80 MPH. But I don't want to be moving at 50 MPH when I move over to that next lane, because my car can't go from 50 MPH to 80 MPH in half a second.

Even for a single-lane highway, it's trickier if you're going too slow, because the only way to pass is to move into the lane of on-coming traffic. And you definitely don't want to stay in that lane longer than you need to. Minimizing the distance needed to pass and maximizing the speed gets the job done as quickly as possible.

But single-lane highways are just overall a bad situation for everyone.

I appreciate not liking tail-gaters, because I don't like it either. But the question I have is when you slow down, does that actually cause the car to stop tailing you? I don't think it would, and the focus should be on safety / comfort, not getting revenge on an inconsiderate driver.

If they're not conscious about tailing you, what sometimes works is to speed up to get ahead and then slow down when you have a more comfortable distance. That of course only works if there aren't cars in front of you. If they speed up as well, then it's likely they just want to go faster than you."	1	False

It's basically Rastafari/Garvey/panafricanism and then developed further by back to Africa movement and then the Nation of Islam and the literal Black Panthers. Whether or not it was good history or not is sort of besides the point, it was part of a mythos that parts of the African American movement found useful in recasting themselves as more than victims and in rediscovering a sense of pride and achievement. 

So I'd be a bit careful about claiming that it is bad history. You probably have a bit of a point but lots, I would say most, ethnicities and communities have foundational myths that are built upon bad history. And so that poses the question as to to what ends you'd choose to start first with the foundational myth of parts of the African American civil rights movement as being the most important one to unpick and not - I dunno - the existence of Italy.

In other words, religion is so disconnected from the objective and material circumstances of my life that I can’t find any use for it and, therefore, any personal relevance to it or importance in it.

It’s funny; I’ve been an atheist for quite a long time now but for quite a period *after* I landed on a pretty firm view of atheism I went to (Catholic) mass close by to where I lived every Sunday. And the reason I did this was precisely for the reasons you list here as ones that you don’t. 

I liked (like, still) the otherworldly aspect of things. I like the sense that there are concerns and thoughts that we share as communities and which have persisted for thousands of years. I really liked the ritual of taking time out and spending that time in quiet contemplation of those questions. I liked the sense that a community of people were gathering for these weird esoteric rites for similar purposes. 

I stopped doing it partly out of time pressure and partly once we had kids and it would have been firmer indoctrination than we were comfortable with. 

But, those religious behaviours had real value for me. And helped me after I stopped doing it, and also eased the path for me into mindfulness and meditation which I started later. 

So, it’s not ‘belief’ as such but certainly religious ritual. And as I understand it, this kind of agnostic approach to ritual is how many Jewish people approach religion also."	5	False

I feel like you're just overthinking this a little. ""Wages"" in general go up more of less in lockstep with prices, but that's because there's a constant stream of people entering the workforce, changing jobs, and getting raises. But for any *individual* worker, you only see wage gains if you actually get a raise / promotion or switch jobs. Lots of workplaces only do those things once a year if at all, or are often happy to slow play these raises because they know that most workers don't want to change jobs. It'll happen eventually, but it's different from a company just deciding to raise prices. But it just seems like common sense that most people who are already in the workforce will see inflation in prices before they see it in their wages, even if that doesn't really show up as a lag in the overall averages.

> If you have significant debt, inflation made your net income go up. So is there a reason to prefer savings vs debt in this conversation?

I feel like you could make a slightly different CMV just saying ""actually inflation is good for people with debt"", and I think that would be easier to defend. But asking ""is there a reason to prefer savings vs debt in this conversation"" just seems like a weird question to ask. I mean, it depends. If I have a lot of savings, I would prefer to look at it through that lens. And if I'm instead struggling with debt, I'm probably *still* struggling with debt even with inflation, so I'm just not really sure what point you're making here. Which framing you choose is likely going to depend on your point of view, but my point is it's all describing the same thing! ""Savings fixed + stuff more expensive"" and ""savings deteriorating + stuff costs the same "" is just semantics. But the former makes more sense to most people because their bank account number is staying the same while the price numbers are going up!"	1	False

You simply disagree? No, the issue is very complex, you don't just 'simply disagree', there are complex emotional factors involved that make your decision far from 'simple.'

&gt;I feel like it is much more effective than making a child stand in a corner for a bit and think about what they've done.

Again, as you mention, this is based on your *feelings*, not solid evidence. Also, the fact that what discipline you experienced as a child seems to be determining how you want to discipline your child seems to suggest that your parent's behaviors are simply extending to you, so your reasoning is more based on 'this is how it was done' as opposed to rational thinking about what actually is more effective.

So when [reputable organizations](http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/physical_punishment) suggest that based on their expert opinions, physical punishment is something to be discouraged, you, as someone who is not an expert, should probably consider their viewpoints which are based on psychiatric evidence as opposed to personal feelings.

The AACAP also states that this kind of disciple can have the follow results, including:

&gt;* bullying other children

&gt;* being aggressive
&gt;* behavioral problems
&gt;* fearing his or her parents
&gt;* poor self-esteem
&gt;* thinking that hitting is okay

They mention, importantly that

&gt;Parents who were physically punished as children are more likely to physically punish their own children.

So if you chose to punish your child in that way, there is the increased possibility of them also punishing their child in that way. Essentially, you are deciding to help continue a negative cycle into perpetuity.

As someone who has worked with a variety of kids, and is aware of the delicate nature of early childhood development and the importance of environmental and parental factors in determining what a kid turns out to be, I ask that you take a lot of time to deeply consider this issue, as it could profoundly affect someone I imagine you care a tremendous amount about.

Asking for my credentials, or talking about your own, is a logical fallacy. An argument from authority is not credible. The argument is either sound or not based on its own merits. The source is a distraction.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument\_from\_authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)

Further, I could be lying about my credentials. So could you. Credentials are completely meaningless in this situation. I have great educational credentials but refuse to present them because it is logically fallacious and I will not lower myself to that level.

Because nobody that takes their work seriously wants to be believed just because of their title. I don't want to be persuasive because I hold X position and have Y years experience doing blah blah blah. If that is what persuades someone then I am making completely failed arguments. I have more respect for myself than that, and you should too.

Other than repeatedly attempting to rely on a logical fallacy, the ""trap"" that you see, I suspect, is that you recognize but do not want to admit that 3 is an arbitrary number of tracks. I am highly confident, but will welcome any evidence otherwise, that there is no research suggesting that there are exactly 3 types of students. Therefore, your track system is arbitrary and will fail to serve nearly as many students as a single track or one-size fits all scenario does. Because there will be marginally more students that have their needs perfectly met by 3 arbitrary tracks as there are that would have there needs met by 1.

You also declined to address that what you actually need to meet your goal is to maximize individual learning outcomes, which three arbitrary tracks does barely more than the current 1-track system to achieve.

So your track system is arbitrary and does not meaningfully address the actual end-state you wish to achieve."	2	False

There are breaks ordered every fifteen minutes at extra time. But stamina is becoming more and more necessary. If penalties weren't a thing, this would continue. Arguably, physical and mental resolve are key factors. There are also a finite set of substitutes, so strategy is inhibited after that amount of time and the failing players can't be replaced. The way the teams operate could possibly change. Taking blind potshots until one miracle happens, or ball hogging until the final few minutes of the interval. If they are so drained proper attacks can't be created as effectively, then these things could happen. There have been games that had indefinite extra time in the twentieth century, that lasted ridiculous amounts. Like this example: https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/extra-time-no-end-worlds-longest-match-stockport-doncaster

When things become sudden death, the factors also change. Extremely careful play that forces draws are encouraged. Reinforcing a cycle of draws between them. It may be more about knowing your opponent and what he values in a setup more so than a game of twelve. The factors are also slightly altered in sudden death as well. There are also circumstantial factors to take in like fatigue or mood. Some of these things may happen to a player, and that would contribute more during a single decider match than a set of 12 or a set of 4 rapid games.

I think Carlsen may be better at calculating than Caruana, but there is still a sense of intuition about the game of chess, regardless of timezone. There are only so many moves you can think ahead.

That would imply that there's some way to tell whether it does or not. Otherwise you could say that smoking probably doesn't increase the odds of cancer, but sometimes it sets it to 100%.

Yes, I did say that and it was improper wording, that is my fault. What I was trying to say is that the hypothetical likelihood of someone committing suicide being higher doesn't mean that everyone who is more likely will ever do it. I know that's pretty much obvious, but that means that people who will never commit suicide will have their right to bear arms revoked and be less able to protect themselves and their family for no reason. I see that as morally wrong. I mean, if we applied this same reasoning everywhere we'd end up banning black people from owning guns since statistically, black people commit more violent crime. Unless you'd argue that that's perfectly fine as well. Since this will probably be interpreted that way, I'm not baiting to call you a racist or something if you do. I'm just asking if you hold this view exclusively concerning mental health issues, and if so, why?

&gt; I've seen good arguments that it shouldn't be. Regardless, right now we as a society have decided that it shouldn't be. If you want to argue otherwise, we periodically have threads for that and I see no point in rehashing the argument here. As long as it's decided that keeping people from killing themselves is a good thing, keeping guns away from potentially suicidal people would be a good idea.

I don't disagree with the first part, but as for revoking the right from anyone who might commit suicide or is more likely is overkill to me. Unless, they have expressed suicidal thoughts or are exhibiting tell-tale suicidal behaviors, have attempted before, etc. I'd say we could integrate a psych analysis, but I don't believe that would actually prevent any suicides or homicides. Even if people told the truth, as the saying goes, ""Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.""

Until it happens, nobody knows what anyone will do in a given situation, including themselves, and their psychiatrist.

&gt; Pretty much. If I thought people committed suicide because they did a thorough cost-benefit analysis and spent a long time thinking on it to be sure that's what they wanted, then I'd be a lot more willing to trust them that it's a good idea.

&gt;That's just about a worst-case scenario for Occam's razor. It involves so many assumptions you would need scientific notation to count them. It might even be an infinite number of assumptions.

Let me see if I understand your problem. You want ""the laws of physics"" to give you a small set of rules to predict the result of any observation given sufficient initial conditions. This is reasonable. Your concern is that the Copenhagen interpretation requires assigning a non-deterministic mechanism to the deterministic evolution of the wave-function. The introduction of non-determinism precludes a finite set of rules for predicting the results of all observations.

But Many-Worlds really doesn't do you any better! You say you've done away with the mechanism that introduces non-determinism, but as a scientist I still have no deterministic set of rules for determining what I will measure in any given experiment. The 'branching' mechanism is fine philosophically, but how does this mechanism occur? Is there a deterministic rule for predicting which branch my experience will take in a given situation? How does MW explain that I only ever experience one branch?

As long as MW doesn't explain these things it's no better than Copenhagen, prediction-power-wise. I prefer Copenhagen, not because I'm more certain it's right, but because it's more upfront about it's shortcomings. We don't know what the connection between consciousness/experience and measurement is. Copenhagen says ""this is what seems to happen, let's treat it as a rule for now."""	1	False

I expected you would like people to make their own mistakes too. Me too, to some extent. How else are you going to learn? Learning from good or bad examples only brings you so far. And thank you for the delta, I do feel comfortable enough to accept that one ;)
 
**Diminishing returns**
  
But I do think there are diminishing returns on allowing people to make their own mistakes (and get hurt by them). I think we should take this very seriously. After all, are we really so concerned that we don't have a direct democracy but rather a representative democracy? The latter already disables us more from making our own mistakes. The choices are outsourced and we didn't choose for that. We inherited this system, ultimately from the dictators that allowed us to have it. Even If we did choose to have a representative democracy, should this be reexamined every new generation or will each new election require a referendum about this?
 
**How much democracy?**
 
Let's say we indeed go for direct democracy. Should the population really be asked to vote on every minutia: what percentage of the budget should go to research on vaccine Y, what percentage should be reserved for street salt storage, what % should be used to cover medical treatment Y, what percentage for infrastructure maintenance, etc. and the minutiae of how many guards should be at the salt storage structure at what pay/hour?
 
**A middle way of grey?**
 
Or might it be best to have a large amount of these issues be decided by the experts without any input of the public (how a lot of these things are already done)? I agree, these are not necessarily as dichotomous dilemmas as I'm painting them, but to some extent, all these shades of gray are also there between democracy and autocracy/dictatorships.
 
**Turnouts**
 
Another thing to think about. What happens if the majority does not vote? Will it still be a democracy, in effect, it would be more like a demidemocracy. Dadjokes aside, some nations (like Belgium) basically enforce voting, first with warnings then with fines (iirc). Others, like the USA even try to discourage large groups from voting all together, in both primaries and general elections.
 
You could say, 'voting only if you want to' ensure that those who want to be heard, will be heard; and those that do not [really] care or do not have enough information to make well-informed/educated and well-reasoned decisions, do not need to vote - which could be construed as a form of expression opinion as well, a form of voting.
 
Then again, you could also say: if not every eligible voter votes, the people haven't really spoken. Forcing people to vote, will likely increase the chances that they will from well-informed/educated and well-reasoned opinions - and blank ballots can always be an option anyway. 
 
**Empower people to make mistakes**
 
If you want to empower people to make mistakes, then you could indeed need a democracy, or elements of it. But not necessarily or exclusively so. You could even say, that expert-driven bodies might thrive extra well with dissenting opinions. So the ability to voice disagreement for those who disagree strongly enough, is welcomed.
 
In fact, democracy might be a foil for the really concerned voices to be actually heard. After all, in a democracy the people have already spoken! There is no need to hear the pleas of a small few, even if only a small portion of the population actually voted. Never mind that the population could've voted for representatives that they deemed good enough overall, but disagreed with profoundly on the matter they're petitioning for now.
 
With a benevolent technocratic and expert-driven autocracy/dictatorship, however, these issues might be taken more seriously. Simply because those who really do care, while they otherwise would not need to worry, have done more work to form an opinion. Which shows a matter of engagement and likely intellect - just the thing that those experts could definitely respect and learn from: perhaps they have missed out on some key insight. Diversity of viewpoint and opinion are valuable to experts too who may be well aware of problems like group-think and paradigm blindness.
 
You could make many arguments, in many ways, I realize this. But I do think there is something very good to be seen in those types of benevolent technocratic and expert-driven autocracies/dictatorships that we (as people who have had several generations raised in democratic societies, and thus a culture infused with appreciation of such systems), might more eagerly dismiss than is justified.

I understand that a majority of the Texas *people* would not vote to secede, but since you've elaborated in other comments that you think even local areas sound be able to self determine their ability to secede, i think it's possible that we could effectively have cities that want to remain but whole rural counties that leave the US.  This would effectively create cities that function as islands in the middle of an entirely different rural country.

The issue is that you cannot separate biology, because it's a justification for why love is not a decision. You can choose not to act upon love and that may cause lack of love and attraction to eventually develop, but it is not definitive because you cannot control such.

Love is clearly not 'just' an emotion; it is a biological process that is both dynamic and bidirectional in several dimensions. Social interactions between individuals, for example, trigger cognitive and physiological processes that influence emotional and mental states. Besides this, there are also other occurences, or lack thereof, that can cause development. However, it is also true that it is a decision in the sense that you can shoot to pursue it as a way of strengthening or wealth said perception; however, just because you choose to engage (decision), doesn't mean love itself is a decision. 


This is basically the best explanation of the previous - 


Love is a sensation due to hormonal stimulation in human bodies as a mechanism to get a pair (or mass) of individuals in order for them to have sexual intercourse and romantic engagement. It is a biological mechanism developed throughout hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution in order to ensure reproduction of the next generation.

Every animal species has its own ritual. The higher the intellect of an animal species, the higher the complexity of the social life of the species, so is the complexity of the process of wooing the other entity.


For humanity, our social structure is so complicated such that one male is allowed to marry only one female, so a much more complicated ritual has been developed over time in conjunction with the civilised laws and the norm of modern society. In life, we have the ability to move away or try to create lack of romantic and sexual engagements, which can cause love to ""die out"". However, we cannot control it totality. 
.


I guess maybe I cannot believe it because so many people try to force themselves to love one individual, but they can't. If love is a choice, I should be able to romantically love anyone, but I can't. Love is definitely not a decision. It’s not a choice. You don’t force yourself to keep loving your siblings, you just love them. Now, of course love is circumstantial. If you, or someone is involved does something, it can cause the feeling of love to be lost. However, key word is can, not is."	13	False

Pro-life believes life itself has value, and a fetus (no matter if it's disabled) as a human life has value which is why in all most all cases you cannot abort it.

\-Only allowance on pro-life side logically is if the fetus is a product of non consensual sex (rape), and the fetus is causing an imminent threat to the mother's life. Only if the fetus is of rape and it causes a threat to mother's life should it be aborted.

\-The reason why pro-life doesn't logically support killing a fetus even if the mother's life is in danger, is because both the mother and the fetus have the same value, and abortion is a procedure that actively murders, meaning you are participating in the murder. True Pro-life basically says you stay out of it and let nature take it's course because the baby is not a trespasser in the mothers body

\- Because consensual sex is a contract taking the responsibility if you end up getting pregnant even if the pregnancy is unintentional, a rape baby where the mother had no choice can now say that the baby is trespassing without her consent and is threatening her life so she has the moral ground to abort it.

All other cases would be considered a spin of pro-choice, because they don't have the same view that every human life no matter disability or development has the same value. They believe that the mother's life and in some cases bodily autonomy has a greater value than the fetus, therefor there should be cases where we can get rid of the fetus in favor of preserving the higher valued mother's life.

Pro choice, although usually gives a lot more of the choice to women, still is a result of the fact the fetus in their eyes doesn't have a human life value equivalent or above that of a women."	1	False

I think the best way to support underachivers and provide better opportunities for advanced students is through a free form system.

&gt;The reason a curriculum needs a deadline is because educators time is precious, it's a finite resource. There can only be so many teachers, teaching so many classes, in so many hours. As such, there needs to be a structure to ensure that everyone is getting the most out of everyone else's time.

Just like a gym is a finite resource. I'm not sure what's your point?

&gt;Smart students can take extra classes if they have more time. They can also study harder material to get ahead.

Not as far as they can get in a freer system

&gt;If you're lazy and there's no helping, then your proposed system is worse because it means the lazy students will be even worse off

It cannot be worse off. Wherever they go, except to places and time that still enforce capital punishment, they will not learn, regardless of systems.

&gt; If your slow, there should (and often are) catch up classes.

Not as often as required unfortunately...

&gt;Cheating - people who take the test early could relay the questions to those who haven't taken it.

don't recycle the questions.

&gt;Time Management - tests aren't just about testing your ability to memorise information, but to also complete processes on deadlines. Revision on a deadline is an important skill because it teaches you how to prioritise. Life isn't going to come at you on your schedule

This feels like an excuse to make life unreasonably hard for students, with an excuse like, well, life is hard, we're just preparing you for it. Time management is an important skill. I agree. How to prioritise is an important skill. Life isn't going to come at your schedule, I agree. But if you could make life easier, why won't you? Why not make assessment a pure assessment of skill and knowledge, and nothing else?

&gt; Resources - marking tests is labour intensive, so it'd be disruptive to constantly trickle completed tests to teaches/marking bodies. It makes more sense to do it all at once.

This doesn't make any sense at all. Why would making labor more regular is disruptive? Giving 10 markers a steady job for the whole year is better than getting 100 markers a month in a year, and 0 markers for the rest of the month.

&gt; Defeats the Purpose - Tests shouldn't be a barrier, they should be an evaluation. If people could keep putting tests off until they felt they learned everything, it no longer becomes an evaluation of skill and a ability to study, and just becomes a grid to reach the pass state.

It is not an evaluation of skill and ability TO STUDY, it is an evaluation of skill and ability to OF THE TOPIC. "	1	False

&gt; Why? Not being facetious, genuinely, why do they matter more than us?

I'd argue that we're both equally important. And that we should be balancing our own needs with those of future generations. But it is vital to understand the differences between wants and needs. I'm reminded of a quote from the old game Alpha Centauri:

&gt; Resources exist to be consumed. And consumed they will be, if not by this generation then by some future. By what right does this forgotten future seek to deny us our birthright? None I say! Let us take what is ours, chew and eat our fill.


&gt; CEO Nwabudike Morgan ""The Ethics of Greed""

This position assumes that there are finite resources that will eventually be consumed and never replaced. And if that were the case, then it might be a defensible position. But we've been on this earth for millions of years, and only in the recent centuries have we been making as huge an impact in the environment as we have. And if we want that environment to still be there for the rest of the human race to survive in, it's our responsibility to take care of it. Because the environment will go on with or without us. And if we trash it enough, humans won't survive, even if other life will.

&gt; there is no right and wrong when it comes to human beings

From my perspective, that's both true and misleading. Human beings do indeed have their own moral compasses and there are many different moral preferences. But there are some fundamental things every moral position has because it's built on the principle of selfish beings working together:

* Positions against murder, as people won't want to work with each other if their own life might be in danger by doing so

* Positions against theft of critical resources, once again putting lives at risk

* Positions against dealbreaking, as it impacts cooperative work when someone doesn't fulfill what they say they will do.

And so on...

It's easy to slide into nihilism when it comes to seeing just how many different moral positions there are, but unless you aren't interested in seeing people cooperate with themselves (and by extension seeing the human race survive), it's unwise to treat every moral position as a preference."	6	False

The first problem with your argument is simple; you think that this particular exchange is good for morale.  The second problem with your argument is that you imply that there were only two courses of action- never getting this man back, or accept the deal to free our most viscous enemies.    

I'll tackle the second issue first.  The people who are upset with this transfer aren't upset because they would rather have left him behind.  They are upset because we did something so terrible, so unthinkably dangerous, something arguably illegal, to get him released.  There is a reason we don't negotiate with terrorist organizations.  We could have waited until another opportunity to reclaim our soldier and we didn't.  The taliban said they wanted their leaders back and Obama immediately jumped on the opportunity.  

Now on to the morale issue.  You suggest that trading terrorist leaders for one soldier is somehow something that will raise the morale of the troops (or at least keep it on an even keel).  But you seem not to have been paying attention to the troops who have been very vocal about their opposition to this exchange.  Do you know why they are so upset?  It's because there is now a precedent set.  Now our enemies know that all they have to do is kidnap any single soldier they can get their hands on and they will be rewarded with whatever they ask for.  

There is a reason we don't negotiate with terrorists- it emboldens them.  It rewards their terrible behavior and it makes them more aggressive towards obtaining the next pawn they see.    

It's a game of chess and Obama just gave up his queen, his knights and his bishops just because the other side said that they might eventually take a pawn that's been under threat since the beginning of the game.  How would that make you feel if you were in the armed forces and you realized that your own commander and chief was so easily outsmarted by our enemies???  

Morale is down.

The old extreme was ""You can't ever cut off family/close friends no matter how abusive or toxic they are to you!""

The new extreme is ""They didn't read your mind to know what your needs are! Therefore they aren't meeting those needs! Go LC/NC!""

In reality, a middle ground in which communication is clear and open and boundaries are set can fix most relationships enough to where they can be healthy for both people. This requires both people to be completely open about their issues and to set clear boundaries and follow those boundaries. This may require a bit of distancing or shifting of relationship dynamics, but it doesn't mean that you just have to cut someone off because they have issues or your relationship isn't going the way you want.

However, if when you try to communicate or set boundaries, the person reacts in a way that is abusive or refuses to communicate or follow boundaries, then cutting them off can be a boundary in itself. ""I have asked you repeatedly to stop borrowing my car without asking, calling me after midnight, making me pay for lunch every time we go out, etc. You're not listening, and I think it would be better if we didn't hang out for a while until you show me that you can respect my boundaries."" Of course, if someone is hitting you, stealing from you, damaging your property, or deliberately harming you in some other way (spreading lies about you for example), then you have a right to go NC/LC without question.

IF we don't communicate with someone and then our resentment builds and builds, we will eventually end up harming them more than if we had just communicated and set boundaries in the first place, whether that is by exploding on them or ghosting them. 

We have the right to not be abused by those we interact with. We also have a right not to be ghosted or abandoned without a conversation. Consideration for others shouldn't mean allowing ourselves to be harmed, and it doesn't have to if we avoid pendular extremes."	1	False

Sure, I suppose a good server or bartender could still get a tip in the same way that a hotel concierge who really goes that extra mile might get slipped a $20, but that leaves backwaits, barbacks, and bussers out of the equation, who normally get a slice of the large tip pie that frontline hospitality workers bake.

I also do think that the amount of moving parts correlates pretty well with complexity, at least when you're first getting into a game. If you start playing a game and see that many moving parts, it's definitely going to be harder to learn at first than if you start playing a game with way less moving parts.

Additionally, I would like to point out that like there is variance in difficulty in MOBAs, there is in fighting games too.

I believe Democrats are sincere in their stated opposition to gerrymandering going forward (off the top of my head, I don't know what the party position was in 2010) because Democrats allow themselves to be held accountable by the mainstream media, which prevents them from outright lying about their positions in the way that Republicans do.

Republicans said that their tax plan would be revenue neutral, mainstream media said they were lying, conservative media said that it would be revenue neutral, so conservative voters believed that it would be revenue neutral.

It works pretty for objects. For instance, chairs can generally be reduced to objects with four support legs, a flat surface for sitting, and a backrest (note how even here we haven't properly described all chairs). It works notoriously bad for people. Suggesting that there are physical traits that are distinctly Jewish to the point where it is obvious (to you apparently) when a person is Jewish or not merely by looking at their face is reductionism based on perceived racial traits; hence racial reductivism. I write perceived because that's what these traits really are. They're invented, and then reinforced by confirmation bias.

The US went into Korea to stop the spread of communism and stays to protect an ally from aggression North Korea. 

The US is a Taiwanese ally because of a desire to project democratic values abroad, but does not have a significant military presence on the island. The world would hardly question the United States enforcing ownership of a breakaway territory, challenging the Chinese over the Taiwan issue is not compelling.

I guess I kind of forgot about it over the years, so I thank you for bringing it back to my attention. 

I think the main disagreement here seems to be a voting issue. It's not that Centrists are in the wrong, but it's more that, by not ascribing to the Left's view on human rights (and the Right's supposed suppression of them), you are actively standing in the way of justice. I agree with this point. If electing a certain politician means that, for instance, gay people aren't considered real citizens, then it is a severe injustice to vote for that person from this point of view. However, maybe I'm in a minority of Centrists for thinking like this, but I don't use Centrism to find a ""compromise in the middle"". 

I don't look to vote for someone who perfectly fits all my boxes, because that person doesn't exist. I am not American indeed, so I can't relate fully, but I can understand the issue somewhat. Ultimately, my point is that I have varied views on many controversial issues, and my views are varied to the point where I don't fit in with the Left or the Right. I hold views from both camps, as I believe most people in the world do. When I go to vote for someone, I have to weight a bunch of factors. Which policies of theirs do I agree with, which I don't, and how important I think each policy is. This process is different and nuanced for everybody. To use an example, I would say the issue of human rights is probably the biggest policy issue and should be placed at the top of anyone's priority list, so if my options are to vote for someone that will guarantee equal rights for all versus someone that makes it a point NOT to give equal rights to certain groups of people, then I will probably vote for the former. But, there are probably many, many other policies that I don't agree with in the slightest from that particular politician, and the opposing party might check a lot of my other ""boxes"". Ultimately, I would have to vote for the former because those other policies don't really count as much as the big bad wolf, so to speak, but this is just my personal philosophy. Many people would look at the first politician and agree with his stance of human rights, but since they disagree on 15 other things they don't want to vote for him. Now we get to this moral dillema, if you disagree with 10 things but agree on 1 thing, arguably the most important issue out of them all, are you a bad person for not voting for them just because of that one issue? 

According to you, yes they are. According to me? I don't know, probably I guess, but it's also unfair to assume that people will disregard every other faucet of their ideology and principles just for one pertinent issue. Also, since I'm not American I don't have a good grasp of what each party exactly wants to achieve with their policies. Your answer on the topic would be just as biased as some hillbilly rural farmer. As a result, there are a lot of things I can't say with confidence. One thing I CAN say, however, is that I have talked to lots of Americans from both the right and the left. This general picture that people who vote right don't care about human rights and actively want certain groups to be treated as sub-human is false, at least from my own experiences. At the end of the day, it's a difference in priority and personal experiences that divide these groups. In your eyes, voting Red means less human rights for you and a general disregard for equality. In some republican's eyes, they probably don't want to deny basic human rights to citizens, regardless of who they are, and they are primarily voting based on other factors. I genuinely don't know if electing a republican president would entail all the things you say it would. If it does, then sure, you have a very strong point, but to argue that everyone who votes Red, or even that everyone who is a Centrist contributes to the issue and is actively harming the fight for human rights is a bit of a stretch IMO."	2	True

When we went to war in Iraq, we knew that some innocent people would die, but the intent wasn't to kill them.

Roughly 37,000 Americans died just in the invasion of Normandy. So, if you think Bush is worse than Bin Laden because he ""killed a little over 4000 innocent american soldiers"" then you must think Eisenhower is far, far worse, because he killed 37,000 innocent American soldiers (just in one battle of the war!).

But of course that's not how we look at things. We can distinguish an act taken with the goal of killing people from one taken for an entirely different reason, despite knowing that there will be innocent lives lost.

I've had this conversation with others before, and the response tends to be about how the US was justified in invading France in WWII, but the Iraq war wasn't justified. If that's you're thinking, and that people are to blame when lives are lost in unjustified wars, then by your reasoning, the following people (among many, many others) are all worse than Bin Laden and the other terrorists: Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Tom Daschle, Chris Dodd, Diane Feinstein, John Kerry, Harry Reid, and Joe Lieberman.

I agree, and tried to walk the line in point two where there should be a certain level of inclusion due to importance to national conciousness and impact on later writers.
2. I'd push back on the ""natural tendency"" for white people to choose while literature, instead a learned bias for what people consider the classic works. I'd agree that the implementation of another course would be more difficult but the issue as always is the zero sum nature of course. There's always a trade that needs to be made. I'm somewhat against including something because of the color of the author but extremely receptive to inclusion of a slave narrative due to its impact. (2b) I didn't really think out why, more that inclusion for color is tokenism but there can be inclusion without it being tokenism assuming the validity of the importance of the work. (2c) I was trying to make the point that there are already many classics excluded including in very influential and important genres. Race certainly plays a role in that the authors had a race, exclusion of those authors because of inclusion of other authors because of race is relevant.
3. I heartily disagree. I think that the challenges for other immigrant and native groups in terms of contributions to the canon are very similar. It also minimizes american minorities who have been present for hundred of years. For instance, hispanics in the southwest precede the presence of whites and blacks in those areas. My family (mexican descent) and many other have been here since some of the southwestern states became US territory. It speaks to our marginalization that you characterize us as ""immigrant groups"" and to a certain eurocentricism that you see america in Black and white. While you also gave a passing acknowledgement to native americans which usually get some acknowledgement in courses, there have been significant contributors in the modern era.

It appears to me that this happens to many things, not just art. Science and Engineering are also candidates - look up, for example, the whole post-nuclear bomb discussion of the responsibility of physicists, maybe culminating in the great novel ""Die Physiker"" by the Swiss author Friedrich Dürrenmatt.

In the end, everything happens in a context, and adapts, in a sense, to the context. I'm far from a post-modernist, but there is a point in the influence of society, ruling structures and dogmas. Of course this goes for art as well. Componists, for example, had to cuddle up to the rulers in early modern times in order to make ends meet, as have authors even in the 19th century - Goethe, Schiller et al were and are hugely successful German authors with close relations to the rulers, and probably furthered their liege lords goals with their writings. 

In this sense, it is not surprising that there is a relation between movies and capital. In a sense, for modern blockbusters, a huge amount of money is needed to bankroll production, way bigger than in earlier times, with all those CGI artists needed to make it look good. Deadpool had to completely modify its ending because they couldn't finance a great CGI shooting, so they went another path, and arguably made a better movie out of it. 

Movies are kind of special in this regard. Many people in the West are in a position that they could take a sabbatical and write a book, and established authors get advances to stay afloat. Composers can do the same, in a way, and get stipends to go through music school. 

But movies can be made as expensive as you can. While not all movie directors want that, it's surely advantageous, at first glance, to have more money. Imagine Star Wars VII without all the CGI. Even The Hateful Eight, which could have been a stage play just as well, cost 50 million $. 

&gt;  i'm not totally convinced it will not cause the extinction of good film unless the above point about art in history is fully explored

I feel that you are in a sort of nostalgia yourself. The 70ies and 80ies were squattered with successful (at least in terms of return-on-investment) B-movies and exploitation movies. This has not let to the downfall of civilization, and all we remember from those times in terms of movies are Grease and Star Wars. We remember the best and forget the worst. I think it is entirely possible that we will forget most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the new DC movies in 20 or 30 years and rememer maybe the dark Batman trilogy. 

&gt; I feel like this requires further exploration with examples. I'm not sure this argument is wholly substantiated on its own, although personally I find myself agreeing with parts of it.

The Dan Brown novels were commercially successful and dumb and uninfluental as hell, the movies even more so. Reservoir dogs grossed less than 3 million $ and spawned Quentin Tarantino. Need more examples? Ice Age grosses like a money magnet, but has 0 cultural impact. Fatal Attraction was the highest-grossing movie in 1987, but was almost forgotten these days. Batman &amp; Robin (the one with the tights) grossed a 100 millions.

It's very poorly understood, but it is a risk though a minor one for the majority of users. Another DSM diagnosable condition (though not limited to psychedelics) is substance induced psychosis. Diagnostic criteria is basically the same as regular psychosis except that the onset of symptoms must come as a result substance use and symptoms must fade after cessation of use. As far as not knowing yet, that's the reason we should reschedule psychedelics to allow research. As most psychedelics are schedule 1 substances it prevents us from knowing what the long term effects are because research is extremely limited.  What we do know is that LSD and psilocybin (active chemical in Magic Mushrooms) have virtually no risk of overdose and no known common long term effects despite widespread use. The widespread use part is important because if there are severe long term effects we would expect to see users seeking treatment. We don't really see that. With that in mind I don't think we should be scheduling substances for some *completely unknown and possibly nonexistent risk*. Especially when we consider that schedule 1 is supposed to be reserved for substances with a high potential for abuse (LSD nor psilocybin should qualify as tolerance builds so quickly that habitual daily or even weekly use will result in a reduction of effects to nearly nothing) and no accepted medical use (preliminary research indicates psilocybin and LSD may be useful in treating depression). Even cocaine is only schedule II.

I would argue it never picked up steam because of how unenjoyable the experience is for most people. It's important to note that salvia is not what we would call a classical psychedelic. It's actually an atypical dissociative psychedelic. If you're unfamiliar with what that means I suggest you look on youtube for videos of people of smoking it to get an idea of the common effects. Their reactions are often dangerous and unpredictable. Many experience delusions and react to things that are not there. It's what most people believe the classic psychedelics are like, but they are very different in that most users will not become delusional. The risk of salvia is somewhat mitigated by its short duration, but you can do a lot of damage to yourself and others in 15 to 30 minutes in my opinion. This doesn't mean safe use is impossible though it just means proper precautions should be taken. Trip sitter, safe environment, and starting with a small amount of the substance are common risk mitigation tactics. As far as Argyreia nervosa goes, you should have done a bit more research. While the plant itself is legal to possess, consumption of that plant will not induce a psychedelic state. In order to achieve this you must perform an extraction of ergine (LSA an LSD precursor) from the plant which is actually illegal as LSA is a schedule III substance itself.

Lastly, while I have tried psychedelics most of my knowledge about the subject is academic in nature. It relates to my research in the nexus of drug use, risk perception, and crime in criminology. I have literally hundreds of interviews from active and former drug users about their subjective experiences and their perceptions of risk (both legal and otherwise). I've also read lots of the available research with regard to drug use effects to analyze how the known effects of drug use and how society reacts to/perceives drug use relate to a likelihood of future criminal involvement. For example cocaine use produces addiction through dopaminergic reinforcement which eventually can lead to the user prioritizing use of the substance over other aspects of their life. That's not necessarily problematic if you have the resources to feed your addiction, but it becomes quite the problem if you're poor. Classic psychedelics aren't known to produce these types of effects so from a criminology perspective the effects of the LSD are not interesting. However, how we treat the use and production of the substance is very interesting. Possession of relatively small amounts of the substance are enough to give felony charges and in some cases earn the individual a life sentence. This is interesting as the manufacture and sale of LSD (and most other psychedelics) is not associated with any dangerous criminal activity. No turf wars, no cartels or gangs engaging in risky activity because production is difficult and the substance is not especially profitable. Though this shouldn't matter since the scheduling system isn't supposed to take into account the criminal element surrounding the drug it would at least make some sense tf that was the reasoning behind the scheduling. If you really want to understand more about drug harm and why many argue psychedelics should be legal, I would suggest reading the work of David Nutt and others who have developed drug harm indexes."	1	False

If it's deflationary tendencies leveled off to a predictable amount, then yes, this would help alleviate the problem with *new* debt contracts because the interest rate should, ideally, reflect the expected rate of deflation.

It is not the same dialect as ""business English"" or other dialects like Chicano English or Appalachian English; there are meaningful linguistic distinctions between them that reduce (to some extent) their mutual intelligibility.

It is reasonable to expect a standardized dialect in communication in any business, government, legal, or other official communication setting where clarity and mutual intelligibility are a priority, and/or to arrange for interpreters/translators if they are required.

While AAVE is much more mutually intelligible with general American English than some other language dialects are with their respective standard dialects (the many dialects of Chinese, for example, that all share a writing system and are largely mutually intelligible in writing but may be only 50% or less mutually intelligible with Mandarin when spoken).

Housing/lending should be definitely be protected against discrimination on the basis of language (the language you speak has no bearing on your creditworthiness or tenant history).

I couldn't access the full text of one of the papers you shared (the Oxford Handbook one) so, this may have been in there, but I didn't see anything that indicated housing/lending discrimination was still found when controlling for credit score and other actually relevant factors, just that AAVE speakers were approved at lower rates than standard English speakers. But there may be other correlated variables (such as credit score, eviction history, etc.) that are more linked to socioeconomic status than race. 

If standard English speakers were more likely to be approved than AAVE speakers \*with the same credit score\*, that would be compelling evidence of linguistic (and thus racially linked) discrimination.

The big issue with this, and all of the analogies you use is that it bundles different types of risks and causes together and treats them as the same.

Take a look at your car example.  Insurance is there because while death or injury can be a result of some random accident, in actuality it is often caused by a person behaving in a manner they shouldn't.  They become inattentive  while driving, or sneeze or something, and crash.  A person performed an action that had a negative consequence on another person's life, and the victim didn't really have a say in it.  They didn't consent to getting hit by a car, even though they were in it.

On the flip side, there are risks where the person taking the risk  would be the victim if things go wrong, and their fate is either in their own hands or more or less up to fate.  Imagine investing in the stock market.  You know there are ways to mitigate the risk, but it's always there, and the market can just crash and you lose your money.  Or you can go hiking and twist an ankle.  These activities both have risks that you weigh the likelyhood of them happening against the likelyhood of a good outcome AND you decide it's worth the risk for the reward.

In short, we generally hold that knowledge of a risk is consent as long as the harm doesn't come from negligence or malfeasance from another party.

Sure, I’d agree with you that much of the advice on their is questionable and I wouldn’t follow it.

While potentially “despicable” behavior is advised, none of the examples that you provided actually advise committing a crime. Someone divorcing someone else may be misguided but it’s not a crime. Same as reporting someone to police or cutting off a personal relationship, neither are people advising someone to commit a crime.

Politics subs where people organized and ultimately we *actually saw* a large scale crime play out is very different. They actively engaged in conversation about criminal actions that were carried out (some of them, not all). As mentioned elsewhere on this thread, both may be considered “bad”. But my CMV argument is that it’s not a double standard that you are proposing it is for one sub to be banned but not the other. It’s not a double standard because they aren’t the same thing.

Yes, but it's not like the FCC bans a full range of words that are crucial to expression of ideas, simply a tiny handful of obscenities that, frankly, add *nothing* except crass emphasis and can all be substituted with more civil verbiage. Again, I bring up the example that I can say ""The American government, capitalism, Democracy, the President, Congress, the Founding Fathers, sliced bread, the Pope, God Almighty, and everything about this country is compelte and utter garbage"" and I will receive no fine unless I substitute ""garbage"" with ""shit"". If *that* upsets you, and you feel is a threat to your freedom, then I have to say you have seriously misplaced priorities.

&gt;Suppressing words, is suppressing speech. It's not different than the FCC saying ""you can express any political idea you want, but you can't say Obama""

Except that the FCC, to my knowledge, has never once its entire history banned anything other than obscenities. You're really, really stretching here. Even in your hypothetical case, one could still say, ""The President"" and express 100% of the same range of opinions and ideas. For the umpteenth time, the protection of free speech is rooted in the principle of allowing free exchange of ideas. The banning of a word only infringes on the expression of an idea if there are no suitable substitute words. If your view is simply ""The FCC fines obscenity"" then way to go, your view is unchangeable because it's simply an expression of a fact, but if you want to make it about a broader principle of free speech, you need to think critically for a moment about what ""freedom of speech"" really intends to protect and preserve. It's not simply whatever sounds you can make with your face.

It sounds, to me, like you want to make a mountain out of a molehill so you can make a categorical statement that sounds alarming. It feels really dramatic and scary to say ""the government suppresses free speech"" like a brave freedom fighter struggling against a corrupt dystopian tyrant. It's an exciting alarm to sound, an exhilerating soapbox to stand on, but you're crying wolf *hard* when your evidence is that you can't say a word like ""poopy"" on the radio."	1	False

Even here, you're hedging. You've seen things that other people can't relate to unless they've been in *some sort* of *care-taking* role. So even though they've never worked at a hospital, never been a nurse, if they've done elder care at a retirement home, they **can** relate. Not perfectly, not 100%, but enough to have a valid opinion.

The people involved in the sexual act did. How can you claim bodily autonomy of the woman without granting the same to the foetus? 

Did you fully read the arguments presented in favor of bodily autonomy? There's a pretty common metaphor presented to discuss it, so it seems difficult to miss.

The metaphor goes like this: Let's say there's a wonderful violinist who comes down with some horrific disease. In order to save his life, some of his fans stitch him to you in the night (you have some sort of antibody that keeps him alive), knowing that a cure can be developed in nine months, whereby you can be separated. Would it be immoral for you to detach him from your body, resulting in his death?

Now, that's an extremely quick summary, and obviously the parallels aren't 1:1 with pregnancy. But the key fact is that many people would immediately answer ""No, it's not moral to force you to carry him around for 9 months, even if he'd die otherwise."" That is why the bodily autonomy argument works even if you grant, for the sake of argument, that a foetus of some kind is a full person with rights.

If you say ""it's different because the parents chose to have sex"", then you're not really addressing the right to bodily autonomy, so much as you're saying that certain actions can invalidate that right, or that rights can be taken away based on your decisions, which is an entirely different discussion."	2	False

There are a number of reasons it is worse to farm dogs and cats for food. 

1. They are largely carnivorous (secondary consumers)—this means that for every calorie you get out of a cat, it has to eat hundreds of calories of meat from some other animal you also had to kill to feed it. And in turn, if that animal is a primary consumer, that animal also has to eat—usually hundreds of calories of plants. So to get one meal, you need to waste potentially thousands of meals worth of farmland and calories to farm that animal. Cats in particular are often apex predators in some areas and not only subsist in eating other animals, they eat animals that eat animals that eat plants. So you can be a quarternary consumer. That’s a lot of wasted resources. 

1. The same issue with (1) happens again with water. Secondary consumers need to drink water, but so does their prey, and so does their prey’s plant based diet. 

1. Dogs and cats cannot be farmed humanely in small spaces. Both are really roaming animals and have been selectively bred as pack/family animals as compared to chickens which can potentially be treated humanely in much smaller spaces than cats and dogs. 

1. Their meat is unhealthy as compared to chickens, most fish, and even cows. In general, human beings aren’t adapted to eat predators. Heavy metals like mercury and certain vitamins (vitamin A I think) can get concentrated in predatory species when they eat animals that ate tainted food. Those toxins can then get concentrated in humans that subsist off of the meat of predators. It’s the reason too much swordfish or tuna is dangerous. They are fish that eat other fish."	12	False

Consider airline pilots (again).  There are two pilots on every airline flight.  They are equally qualified to fly that plane.  They even take turns flying.  One flies one leg, and the other flies the next leg.  Yet the ""Captain"" is paid MUCH more than the first officer.  Again, they're functionally doing the exact same job.

The reason is because when shit goes down, it's the captain whose ass is on the line.  They have the legal authority and responsibility for everything that happens on that flight.  To take on that kind of risk requiring paying someone more, otherwise why would anyone ever agree to do it?  Everyone would just want to stay a first officer forever, getting paid the same to do the same job, but without any of the risk.

I think one of the reasons there is such focus on children and prevention is because there are more angles to attack this problem from. There is prevention, immediate post trauma intervention as well as long term therapy. Children like you have said have better outcomes because of their brain plasticity, that is just biological fact, but there are many treatment models that are used with adults who have experienced trauma. Unfortunately for adults there is no prevention work or immediate post crisis work as the trauma has already set in so we must focus and target the symptoms which for many are longstanding and therefore more difficult to address. Trauma therapy requires a lot of work for the client that is for sure. Treatment modalities for adults continue to advance. I attend a trauma conference every year which contains lots of focus on treating ptsd in adults. Some of the newer advances include EMDR and body movement. There is a large push to continue research into how biofeedback can be used in trauma treatment for adults. A lot of attention is focused on polyvagal theories as well. Most adult treatment are trending more towards the physical changes and how to address them. Don’t get me wrong we have and long way to go still but I do believe there is attention placed on treating adults there are just fewer angles to address the problem from. I also would argue that although prevention does not help current adults dealing with PTSD it does look to reduce the amount of adults in the future struggling with PTSD. I know playing the long game solves nothing for those suffering now but there is a reason why it seems the focus is pointed in that direction. The most effective treatment for any problem is always going to be preventing it from happening in the first place. In addition it’s important to recognize the impact of generational trauma which prevention seeks to address to a certain extent. This can work two fold with helping adults with PTSD understand their trauma and prevent the trauma from continuing its generational impact.	3	False

In brief, the Gotha Program was the party platform of the German Social Democratic Party.  Marx's ""Critique of the Gotha Program"" is his attack against this specific program and, by extension, evolutionary social democracy.

Some of it is just petty sniping over terminology, but the thrust of the critique is that the social democrats have misunderstood the revolutionary aspects of communism.

I can give you a few of the more important quotes:

&gt;Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the program does not deal with this nor with the future state of communist society.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic litany familiar to all: universal suffrage, direct legislation, popular rights, a people's militia, etc. They are a mere echo of the bourgeois People's party, of the League of Peace and Freedom...

Discussing the lower phase of communism and its transition to the higher stage:

&gt;What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has *developed* on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it *emerges* from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor... The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another...But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This *equal* right is an unequal right for unequal labor...   
&gt;  
&gt;In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly – only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!

For what it's worth, when people speak of communism, I generally find that they mean that very last bit ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,"" but that's not Marx is saying communism is! That's the higher phase of communism, and in the lower phase the principle is ""The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another"" which is another thing entirely.  Lenin subsequently went on to label these two stages separately as socialism and communism but Marx didn't.

The strange thing about Marx is how little he actually says about communism (as the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [puts it](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/#Utop): 

&gt;It is well-known that Marx never provided a detailed account of the basic structure of the future communist society that he predicted.  This was not simply an omission on his part, but rather reflects his deliberate commitment, as as he colloquially has it, to refrain from writing “recipes” for the “restaurants” of the future

So it's actually not easy to talk about Marx's definition of communism in anything more detailed than sweeping generalities.  For Marx, what really mattered was the *process*.  

And, while this is more contested, it's a violent process.  Quoting now from the Communist Manifesto:

&gt;The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win

Long story short, the best read on Marx (at least in my opinion) is that he thought it was only communism if you passed through the phase of forcible overthrow (certainly this is what Lenin thought Marx meant) and that what Democratic Socialists were aiming at was not and could be communism because it was not revolutionary in that way."	2	False

I don't think this is entirely true. If someone who is turning 40 and has no complete higher degrees, no past work experience, and no marketable skills don't what fitd what society expects of them? Even if they take a full time job I don't believe it is. Part of societal expectations involves having gained some form of experience, knowledge, or skills at a younger age. It's about increasing your own value in order to make more in the future so that it's worth more for an employer to give you a higher wage.

&gt;I simply do not believe that most companies CANNOT AFFORD to pay minimum wages for all employees. A company can afford whatever it CHOOSES to afford

This simply isn't true. A company definitely can't afford whatever it chooses. Every company has limited funds whether that's in the firm of start up capital or income. There are significant limits to what it is capable of doing.  This is just completely false. A company wouldn't be able to choose to pay every single employee several million dollars a year independent of what they're doing. It makes no sense. 

Are there some positions that they could afford to pay more? I'm sure there are. But there are many that simply aren't worth it. If the technology exists to automate a position that's low skill and repetitive then there's some limit to what it's worth a company to pay someone to do that. If it would cost more to pay an employee than to purchase, install, and maintain an automated system then there's no reason to. I see no problem with paying someone less to do that job if they're willing to. The job experience and ability to put it on a resume may be even more valuable to the employee than the money itself in many ways."	2	False

I do not think fishing is comparable to fox hunting. The main reason I wouldn't sab fishing is that I have no idea if the people fishing are doing so ethically - my own brother fishes, he tends to eat what he catches and ensures that the fish do not needlessly suffer for prolonged periods. This is in stark contrast to fox hunting, which by its very nature cannot be done ethically - the fox is never eaten, and the fox is made to suffer for prolonged periods.

We are satisfied, nevertheless, that this experience seriously compromises the welfare of the fox.* 

The same report also said that the inability for foxes to escape dogs by going underground  causes them fox ‘extreme fear’ and is a ‘serious compromise of its welfare.’

 Autopsies reveal hunted foxes are not killed quickly, but endure numerous bites and tears to their flanks and hindquarters - causing enormous suffering before death. Foxes forced to face terriers underground can suffer injuries to the face, head and neck, as can the terriers. "	6	False

We either need to accept:
1) Animals simply don't need to be treated with the same respect that humans do, and so doing things like fucking or eating them is fine.
or 2) Animals should be treated with the same respect as humans, and we should not treat them in any way we would not treat our fellow human. That means not killing them, forcing them to work for us, etc. (This one would probably cause the world economy to crash if we all ascribed to it btw)

One example is with presents, with a lot of my friends I've seen women put in a lot of time, effort, energy and money into finding presents for their partners. Whereas I've often seen men who seem to ponder what on earth their girlfriend could want without ever attempting to find out. 

It's really an unfortunate, untenable position for men. When they're in a committed relationship, they're expected to open up more emotionally to her than to anyone else. This is untenable because it's in contrast to how he ought to act in general, being reserved (which are usually the facets that make men wholly attractive to women in the first place (yes there are exceptions)). Women will often say that she doesn't want to date a girl. 

So what this does is impose a double standard on how men should behave. On the one hand, they're successful at courting due to emotional reservation (i.e. a degree of ""manliness""). On the other hand, once in a committed relationship, they're expected no longer to act like this around their partner. So it's expected that he essentially lives a double life, but then that's its own issue because if he lives a double life then he's not *really* himself around her. 

The problem isn't that women are being nags, *nor* is it that men are not performing emotional labor. It's that women think men's brains work the same way their female brains work, and men think women's brains work the same way their male brains work. While there is a pairing structure going on with the male and female, they fundamentally think in different ways (some of it is socialized, some of it is biological)."	23	False

What you experienced on the ground was living with Israelis. I am sure they mostly are just as you describe them. Most people are warm, welcoming and good natured in person. But somehow, collectively we get swept up into ""us vs. them"" thinking and make decisions that are rather evil. It's not just Israel that does this. Most nation states do.

I'm not going to try and convince you that Israel is somehow more evil than other nation states but they did just most likely carry out an assassination of a scientist. Other countries do similar things. Russia seems to just off enemies of the president. The US carries out drone strikes all over the world. Now many in those countries will argue that they are necessary evils to protect the state and its people. And that may even be so. But a necessary evil is still necessarily evil.

Israel is in a particularly vulnerable position and vulnerable countries (or even countries that just FEEL vulnerable, as the US did after 9/11) tend to justify all kinds of evil things. So I don't want to change your view that Israelis are wonderful, good people. But that can be true and it can still be true that Israel, as a nation, commits a lot of evil to protect those people in the modern world. Perhaps the media is hypocritical for focusing on how Israel does this and not some other countries but it does not mean they are portraying the actions of the government of Israel incorrectly.

Your situation sounds crappy, and I'm sorry about that. But the mistake you're making is putting the onus on the college to figure that out and fix it. You simply can't expect that of the world. Let me show why.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's suppose there are two students applying to college.

* Student A was in your situation: Had drive, tried to do a bunch of things but parents shut them all down, then wrote an admission essay/appeal saying ""I Had Drive But My Parents Shut Me Down"".
* Student B was NOT in your situation. They had no drive, they didn't try to do anything but skate by in school, did nothing extracurricular. BUT they're trying to get into college in bad faith. They also write an essay/appeal saying ""I Had Drive But My Parents Shut Me Down"", which is full of lies.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask you, how is the college supposed to tell the difference between student A and student B? They can't. If the two have essentially equal grades, there's no distinguishing features between them. They can't say B is lying and A is truthful.

&amp;#x200B;

But if there's student C, with the same grades but who also did sports, that's something they can check. They can verify it, they can see that that person did school and another thing at the same time and still got the grades. That feature is a useful signal for figuring out who can successfully complete college and who can't. Not 100%, but people who did sports and school on average are more likely to be able to make it through college. That should have weight in the selection process. You can substitute any number of other things for sports in this example."	235	False

&gt;We don't know for certain. 

*You* don't know for certain. A religious person knows for certain that god exists. An atheist knows for certain that god doesn't exist. An agnostic knows for certain that nobody knows anything. 

Since you've included atheism as a religion in your definition, you must also believe that the absence of proof doesn't prove anything. If you can't *dis*prove a religious person's claim that he or she knows with 100% certainty that god exists, you can't say that, ""we don't know for certain,"" because it doesn't follow your own logic. 

&gt;There is no proof for any religion that can be 100% confirmed...

There is no empirical proof, which according to your own logic doesn't matter. If you believe that atheism can be considered a religion, burden of proof (which is the core principle of atheism and their version of ""proof"") is as meaningless as stating that there is an omniscient magic fairy in the sky or that I'm actually an alien from Venus. If burden of proof is meaningless (because otherwise you wouldn't consider atheism a religion), then the fact that there is no proof to support either side has to also means that *any* claim about *anything,* with or without proof, should be considered as plausible (which is also what you've stated yourself) unless it can be 100% empirically proven to be false. 

If this is so, it would be just as logical to believe that our entire universe may or may not be just an illusion cast by a really smart mouse from a really advanced galactic civilization as it would to believe what we currently believe about the universe. Neither can be proven to a 100% certainty, and since burden of proof is meaningless, both options are just as valid (or invalid).

With regards to who gets to choose the answers to these questions, there exists a spectrum spanning from anarchism (stateless) to totalitarianism (state controls all) and every point in between.

Classic socialism is where the state controls #1 and #2.  The US postal service is a good example of this.  The state owns the post offices and mail trucks -- employs the postal workers -- sets the requirements for mailing postage -- etc etc.

A somewhat less intrusive and more modern take on socialism is for the state to relax its control over #1 and #2 and focus more exclusively on #3.  So let the private sector do the work but redistribute the goods via taxation and social programs.  But this is typically referred to as ""social democracy"" now, probably because its proponents want to avoid the failures, abuses, and associated stigma of Soviet-style command and control.

But really, they are just two sides of the same coin.  At the end of the day, the meaningful distinction is public vs private distribution of goods.  When the state seizes the ability to make economic decisions, colloquially that is referred to as ""socialism"" even if it doesn't fit the classic definition.

So referring to UBI as ""socialist"" is wrong in the classic sense but makes sense within the context of how the term is now commonly used and its practical application."	2	False

Whatever you're saying about making a decision to take the pill doesn't really have anything to do with anything as far as I can tell. Anyway, it wouldn't be very useful to say that ""pill x causes diarrhea when John takes it."" So, what a scientist MIGHT do is to gather more anecdotal evidence by surveying even more people. Still anecdotal but will give a more broad view of what happens to people taking pill x. Even then, you would be hard pressed to find a causal link (unless the correlation is consistently 100%). Say it's 20% of people...whatever. Then you might ask WHY it causes diarrhea in 20% of people--maybe it's people with Blood Type A (or whatever the fuck). So, you limit your population...blah blah. That's the point though: anecdotal evidence begins and ends with the evidence presented. ""Proper research"" doesn't--it tests, retests, reformulates, etc. The way OP states it, especially in a broader context, anecdotal evidence is much inferior to proper research.

Guilt and shame-ridden hangovers were a common thing, they were followed by self-reflection and apologies, plus of course laughing about how much of a dick that person was. It was normal.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think that binge drinking culture caused my generation to normalise apologies and forgiveness. We've all done or said the stupid thing, we've all pissed someone off or overstepped a line.

The implication here is that you only apologize for things you did while absolutely wasted. Either you and you friend group are living saints when you're not drunk, or think only the most terrible transgressions are worth an apology.

Most people apologize for a variety of things, most of which are minor. If someone consistently refuses to apologize for trivial issues, it tells me they don't really give a shit how other people feel  and how they impact others, and I see no problem not wanting to hang out with someone who doesn't care about you at all. If anything, I think people are much more willing to apologize for things now than in the past, but the behavior for which a simple apology works is less extreme. 

I'm also very unclear what kind of behavior you are referring to when you and your friends get drunk, so it may be that changing standards that make that behavior unacceptable is a good development. For instance if your friends drive drunk, get into fistfights, harass random people, damage property, or are loud for a long time at 2 am in a residential neighborhood, I am 100% ok with them being ostracized for that - because showing you have no consideration for anyone else means everyone else is justified in ostracizing you until you understand that the behavior is not ok."	4	False

I would argue that there are advantages to being forced to do something that you struggle with or that you find uninteresting. There's a lot of learning that takes place in these circumstances. No, you might not use those mathematical concepts in your life, but you'll certainly use those other skills you built (resilience, study skills, time management, stress management, etc.) that will help you face similar challenges later on in life, and I believe high school is just as much about building these life skills as it is about building knowledge.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve

 &gt;**One feature of a CTC is that it opens the possibility of a worldline which is not connected to earlier times, and so the existence of events that cannot be traced to an earlier cause.** Ordinarily, causality demands that each event in spacetime is preceded by its cause in every rest frame. This principle is critical in determinism, which in the language of general relativity states complete knowledge of the universe on a spacelike Cauchy surface can be used to calculate the complete state of the rest of spacetime. However, in a CTC, causality breaks down, because an event can be ""simultaneous"" with its cause—in some sense an event may be able to cause itself. It is impossible to determine based only on knowledge of the past whether or not something exists in the CTC that can interfere with other objects in spacetime. A CTC therefore results in a Cauchy horizon, and a region of spacetime that cannot be predicted from perfect knowledge of some past time.


Which you accurately point out in your OP:

&gt;If that's the case, that creates a never-ending paradox of second Harry's saving the first Harry's. When Harry first noticed he was being saved, he thought it was someone else, not his actual future self. Continuing on that path, old Harry will want to go back in time to help Hermione and be by the lake, only to help himself.

It’s a different type of ‘time travel’ than say, Back to the Future where Marty can make changes which do affect the future. That doesn’t mean it makes no sense. It just follows a different set of axioms about how the universe works. In the B2TF universe, causality is an inescapable fact. In Harry Potter it’s not."	22	False

But that's not the rule and it isn't how it was called in this instance.  The act of a coach coaching is what breaks the rule. So it doesn't and shouldn't matter whether the player receives that coaching. I would absolutely prefer to have coaches completely out of view from players to make sure that there is no chance this gets broken, but as it stands right now that isn't the rule. So if anyone receives coaching, they should be penalized. Hard stop, no questions asked. Otherwise it's unfair enforcement of the rule, and whether that was her first or third, it still affected her and without that call she only has a point penalty.

True, and I want to make clear I in no way believe sexism was to blame for anything that happened during this match. There are other sexist things happening in tennis, but they are unrelated to this particular event.  But what does happen, is that Serena and others are allowed to argue in some instances and not allowed in others. Again this creates an environment where the rules are unknown and arbitrary. Murray was called by this particular ump in the past for calling him an idiot or something to that effect. Nadal yelled obscenities to the same without getting any penalty. Serena has said far worse to other umps with no penalties, but gets a violation for saying ""you're a thief"" here. While I fully believe her conduct is unacceptable, if it hasn't been penalized in the past and there have been no changes in rules or clarifications, she had no expectation that what she was saying was a penalty in the sense that it will be called. Uneven enforcement of the rules creates a situation where that penalty is unfair, because it wasn't known that it would be the result of her actions. "	29	False

It’s to what extent the government applies these principles that people disagree on. And the fact that libertarians believe these things should be achieved in an extremely hands off way is what makes them extreme.

Maybe rewording the American idea to something like “having a small government to prevent tyranny and guarantee people have rights” would fit more with what you’re going for. Obviously the American idea is more than that (checks and balances, freedoms, etc) but in terms of how it relates to libertarianism specifically, I think that is where libertarians are and where most people disagree with. I think very few people disagree that we should have democracy for example or freedom of speech.

Most people today believe the government should be bigger and more hands on and that having such a small government today isn’t good. For instance, some people today see “for the people” as having medicare for all.” Or some form of the ACÁ. libertarians believe in far less welfare overall, which is why it is extreme. But you guys just believe less welfare is beneficial for all, whereas I and others believe more welfare than what libertarians believe is beneficial for all. And more welfare = bigger government.

Large scale straightphobia doesn't really exist, and you can't really equate misandry to straightphobia, not least because around half of straight people aren't even men in the first place, and since sexuality is often not outwardly evident, bi men, particularly those not in SSR would ALSO experience that misandry."	2	False

The first point to my argument is definitely the weakest as it is speculative and it remains to be seen how this will impact the game if at all in the long term. I just have not seen any evidence of this driving away fans (yet) and there does seem to be at least some evidence that this will boost attendance for teams hosting the Astros.
&gt; If so, shouldn't fans be even more ""blown up"" in their reactions?

Fans should definitely be more angry with the league for not addressing this sooner. But I don't think the Astros should bear the blunt of the blame, which they currently are.
&gt;If the cheater actually believed that to be true, they would not have cheated

Baseball teams used to sacrifice bunt and steal like crazy, because they thought it helped them to win, even though we now know it was actually harmful. Similarly, I have no doubt that the Astros at the time believed the system was helping them. And when it worked correctly, I'm sure it did. The problem is that it was not perfect and when they got it wrong, or perhaps when the hitter was expecting a bang but did not hear anything, their performance would be negatively effected. It seems from the analysis I have seen that the positive and negative effects in large part cancelled each other out. While this does not condone their actions, it should inform the way we react to them.
 
&gt; Plus, I mean, racism has been happening and normalized throughout American history, but that doesn't make it good!

Again, I'm not trying to say what the Astros did was good or that we should not be upset about it. And fans certainly have a right to riot over this if they so choose. But I do not believe it is fair to the Astros or their fans that they seem to be serving as a scapegoat for what is a league-wide issue."	2	False

I think everyone in this posting can agree to this.

However, what several people are saying is there are various cultural pressures (at least in Western society) that have the effect of keeping wages lower for women.  This is more difficult to address, because the government cannot very well institute laws governing cultural norms.  The two most compelling of these cultural norms are (in my opinion):

1.  Women are encouraged to take jobs in less lucrative fields, such as social services and education, while men are more apt to take jobs in more lucrative fields such as engineering

2. Women are more likely to pursue a less rigorous work schedule after becoming a parent.  This includes taking several years off from work while the children are youngest, which would stunt the woman's career and electing to work less hours than their male counterparts, which would make them less attractive candidates for promotion.

Frankly I am not sure how either of these are to be addressed.  As for issue 1, there currently are campaigns to encourage girls to pursue STEM fields while in school.  That may help, but lots of factors contribute to women choosing less lucrative careers: Expectation that the man will be the breadwinner, desire for a career with less rigid hours, discrimination in male dominated fields, and the Western cultural belief that ""men are logical, women are emotional"" all conspire to put women in less lucrative career tracks.

If I am at a loss for issue 1, I truly am clueless for issue 2.  I know the plural of anecdotes is not data, but I saw it first hand.  I worked in a very rigorous, lucrative profession that had both men and women.  As the women gave birth, they opted for an easier work load (less hours, easier clients,  less travel).  There is nothing wrong with their decisions.  Child rearing is a deeply personal issue and everyone has to do right by their families.  However, that's a decision that put these women on a less lucrative career track.  Like I said, I have no idea how to address that.  Again, its very much a cultural issue: women are expected to be the child-raisers, men are expected to be the breadwinners.  That would need to change to improve this issue.

One last point: The thesis of my point is the wage gap is due to cultural issues, but that doesn't mean it should be ignored.  There are all sorts of cultural issues which raise problems in our society.  Best example is self-segregation of schools and communities.  Beginning in the 1960s, when red lining was no longer legal in real estate, the whites moved away and formed their own communities.  Nothing illegal there.  But what was lost was a sense of racial diversity.  How should that be addressed?  Is having a school that is &gt;90% white adequate to teach the children there about cultural issues? (Not to get off topic, just to drive home the idea that 'culture' isn't necessarily the end of the discussion)"	43	False

I'll admit that hunting now days takes far less skill than the ""hunters of yesteryear.""  However, its seems like what you're really taking issue with is people hunting with a firearm as opposed to something like a bow and arrow.  

All that being said, I have been on many hunts where we've gotten nothing. What you're not taking into account is that many of these hunters that you see pictures of with their ""trophy"" kills (although I don't like that terminology), is what they did beforehand.  

When I go deer hunting, for example, I usually start planning things far in advance.  I'll go out in the woods weeks before hunting season scouting the area in which I'm allowed to hunt.  I'll look for deer tracks, watering holes, antler rubs.  I'll look for the types of flora that the deer like to eat.  I'll follow the bucks and figure out their habits such as when and where they like to eat, drink, sleep.  I'll find out the most efficient places to put a feeder.  I'll look for where I can take cover in the tree lines. It's stalking for hours on end.  Quite a bit of work goes into it.

I'm guessing what you're thinking is the typical hunter puts up a random feeder, drives up his ATV, drinks beer, and kills whatever he wants on the spot without putting any effort into it.  And, while that does happen, its less often than you would think.  Most animals are smart enough to get out of the way of those types of idiots.

They are not. They are a design company, using technology as a means. They design products that people want. Technology is just a means to that end. 

The expectation of technology companies are vastly different from design companies. Tech companies are expected to be 'cheap' and compatible. The problem with that is that people with a life just want things to work. That is Apple's style. They design products to work for people, regardless of price or compatibility. 

This is also a strong rationale for the hate Apple often gets. They are subverting the expectations that many people have for the standard behaviors of technology companies and products. But if you look at them from another lens, there are decent reasons for this. 

Apple products have a premium due to both the increased cost of producing the products and a need to appropriately price to ensure the 'aura' of a product worth the investment. (Yes this is a business decision but also a 'design' reason.. investing in a product makes it more 'worth' it. Perhaps 'scummy' but also very, very, common in design businesses. Because it works. ) 

People who are invested in Apple products also tend to extremely happy with their choices due to the product being designed around them, instead of the technology. Airpods are great example here. They sync extremely well... almost 'magically' so, due to a custom bluetooth chip. But that also makes it incompatible with random products. There is a choice between 'make it work extremely well for a limited set of products', or 'make it compatible, and work just like a crappy bluetooth product.' 

I and many other people would choose the first option. That's the reason Apple does this. It is not a choice for them. They need it to work. Sometimes the benefit to the customer is of more value than the demand to be compatible. It isn't always a perfect tradeoff, but it is still a tradeoff with a customer-first focus. 

That's also a reason for poor repairability. It's not about being greedy, but rather a tradeoff between considering decent design (space!), security et al, and ensuring that a minority (yes, it is a *small* minority of people!) can fix their products. And make no mistake, being able to 'hack' your own hardware is also a security risk... 

This is also the reason why the San Bernardino situation happened. There are *no* ways to cripple security that works just for some people. Apple was not willing to cripple the security of their products for all people due to 'edge' cases. I note that this is claimed to be 'PR', despite the fact that Apple *wanted* to provide full end-to-end encryption to prevent themselves from viewing iCloud data.  [They were pressured not to.](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-apparently-abandoned-encrypted-icloud-backup-plans-after-fbi-pressure/). I'd love to hear more about the claim that Apple 'scans your data'. I suspect this is more about the government requesting these scans, which Apple wanted to prevent in the first place...  

Which is where understanding of the [PRISM program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29) is severely lacking as well. It isn't companies sucking up data, it is the government *demanding* getting into the companies communications. Apple cannot break the law, no matter how broken the law is. Complain to the the US and the Chinese governments respectively for PRISM and Tencent. Again,  Apple *has* been complaining and fighting back on this. Has any other technology company? Google? Facebook? 

If you want to claim that Apple is 'no better' than other technology companies on security, you will have to provide evidence that these companies are working to protect your data... at all. 

I also find it hilarious that the complaint about Apple not being innovative is also coupled with a demand that Apple maintain compatibility with older technologies. That is a contradiction in terms. Further, this are are phone focused features... older technologies which consume significant amount of space on a product extremely space constrained. I'm not going to defend specific choices, but the idea is to move a product forward based on trade-offs. Sometimes you have to 'innovate' by moving away from less used technologies in order to make room for newer ones (IR? really?). This is in vast contrast to the 'feature list' product development most technology companies provide.  I don't want 500 shitty features. I just want want what it has to work well. Are these choices always good? No. But doing this is actually good design, despite how it poorly serves those focused on the technology features over the design. 

If you actually look at it, much of Apple's aura of 'innovation' is actually them taking products and designing them well. Sometimes in 'innovative' ways, but mostly innovation in taking existing technologies and applying them in more usable ways. iPods are probably the standard for this example. They were not 'innovative', they were simply well designed despite the fact that they were actually late to market. 

Is Apple scummy? I'm sure they are in some ways. Everything is one way or another. But the reasons given are not necessarily valid if you are actually looking at rationale behind the actions, or the information behind the situations."	94	False

But there's some evidence that legalizing prostitution ends up greatly increasing the demand for prostitution beyond what the market can support. Or in other words, if prostitution were legal, a lot more people would want prostitutes than would want to be prostitutes. And when that happens, you will inevitably get people trying to increase the amount of prostitutes, though whatever means they deem necessary, in order to capitalize on that market. And in this case, that would include a lot of trafficked women.

Maybe I'm not articulating it right. If we can be wrong, then we by definition must also be free to be right.  

If our incorrect beliefs are entirely caused by neurons firing, or environmental stimuli, or inherent brain structures, *then they aren't incorrect*. In a world without free will it is meaningless to talk about being right or wrong, or having correct or incorrect perceptions.  

On the other hand if it is possible to be incorrect about anything, then we must possess a will capable of more or less freely deciding among various given choices. To me, that is free will, and all it can be. I don't know how free will could be anything more than simply the ability to make choices given what we know and what we experience. What could it logically be beyond that?  

In other words I don't think you can have a little bit of free will. We can't decide, for example, to see gamma radiation. That's not one of the choices available to us. We can't decide to exist in more than one place at the same time. For the things that are beyond our physical capability, we are not ""free"" at all...we are constrained by what we are. But within the limits of being a human with eyes and brains and so forth, we must either be free to make choices given to us, or we should banish the language of ""incorrectness"" forever from our vocabulary. If we're not free to decide whether something is blue or green, good or bad, lying or telling the truth, generous or stingy, then we are not free at all. Our ""errors"" are not our errors, they aren't even errors. Neither we nor anyone else can be responsible for any mistakes we make. There is no such thing as ""delusion.""

She's alone in a big house in the country, and even though she sees plenty of Trump signs whenever she walks out of the house she's not much better supported by the people in her community. 

When it comes down to it, our happiness or unhappiness has a lot more to do with our individual circumstances than it does with any abstraction--politics include. I would probably take that one step farther and say that our feelings about abstractions are always informed by our individual circumstances.

If you don't have those things, or find that the political disagreements have so marred your relationships with your family and friends, then try to move. But the important thing, IMO, isn't necessarily to surround yourself with people who agree with you politically, but rather with people who are warm, loving, and welcoming and accept you for who you are.

If you think this, you are not pro-black-lives-matter (BLM).

It's the kind of thing someone says when they don't understand BLM.

BLM's mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes. By combating and countering acts of violence, creating space for Black imagination and innovation, and centering Black joy, we are winning immediate improvements in our lives.

It's a 3 word title for a movement that opposes the status quo, where black people can be killed by citizens or police, and there is either a lack of investigation, or no investigation at all.

Blue-lives-matter/all-lives-matter are 3 word catchphrases which represent no movement at all.

Their sole purpose is to create a straw man whereby BLM is redefined to mean black-lives-matter(-and-other-lives-don't). Which is simply not what BLM is about.

Once the straw man is created, it's easy for groups who don't want to engage with the BLM movement to say ""well if you don't think my life matters why should I care?"".

There are procedural errors on both sides and either you or OP pointing fingers doesn’t admit that both sides have big issues. That aside, the right wing takes advantage of these procedural matters as a way of covering up the end point. Abortion was protected federally and now isn’t in half the states. That is an end result that doesn’t rely on an argument that’s just “oh well it wasn’t a federal power so we’re allocating it properly”. The outcome changed. And for the worse of people despite other’s moral views. Same for most of these issues. 

When judges lie in their hearings about their views which are obvious and then make decisions perfectly in line with their political ideology, they are political. No judge up there is making decisions without their personal beliefs. That goes for both sides. I’ll change my mind when the court starts making votes and decisions that are actually surprising. 

There’s also a line between legal and moral that I think is being missed here by many people taking a conservative argument. Just because something is in writing, be it law, constitution, or the bible, doesn’t make it automatically right or a precedent that we should be following for years to come just because. 

Your argument about gerrymandering and others seem to be in line with others here which is simply attacking the left back. Sure OP has clearly a political preference in his argument but it points to larger issues. Of course the left will complain about gerrymandering when they are losing votes - BUT - I think we can all agree that it’s an issues that goes both ways and needs to be readdressed systemically along with many of these issues because it’s all wrong no matter which party benefits. Saying it’s only an issue for libs isn’t a valid argument it’s merely an attack - and you wonder why people are fighting so much. Nobody wants to actually talk about change for the better."	15	True

I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/48usgx/cmv_i_believe_black_people_have_a_lower_average/d0mpy0w) was a pretty good comment that covers most points that come up. (Credit to /u/Doppleganger07)

The tl;dr of this is two things: 

1) IQ is an imperfect measure of intelligence, which doesn't actually have a unified, commonly accepted definition by all the experts. IQ tests show *something*, but it's not equivalent to ""intelligence.""

2) Many, *many* factors other than genetics influence intelligence. It's impossible to eliminate all these factors when trying to find out whether a demographic group as broad as ""all black people"" has lower IQ, and we know in the past that groups with lower IQs and actual genetic differences based on demographics didn't have lower IQs because of genetics but because of environmental factors, which are very much at play with the black population. It therefore seems quite likely that there's no genetically based difference to intelligence at work.

For convenience, I've quoted the whole thing below. The original post has links to sources that are not included in the quote, so please go there if you'd like them.

&gt;This statistic of course, doesn't take into account anything other than race. Let's go through why most of the academic community isn't concerned about this.

&gt;1) The gap we see here is not at all unique. There have been many instances of populations of people with lower than average IQ that have closed the gap entirely.

&gt;For example, women used to score far lower than men on IQ tests. This is no longer the case since women have gotten more educated. In this case, we are starting to see the IQs of women surpass those of men (in general)].

&gt;Another example is the IQ data gathered from East and West Germany prior to unification. East and West Germans were / are genetically indistinguishable, but there was a gap between the two reaching 17 points in some areas. If you take IQ as being mostly genetic, these results are highly problematic.

&gt;A third example (and I could go on for longer but this is already long enough) is the Flynn effect. This is the well documented phenomenon that observes populations IQs rising as they develop economically. The average black person today gets the same score as the average white person did in the US in the year 1950. The average black person's score is 15 points higher than the average white person just 100 short years ago. Unless you think there was a major genetic change in whites in the past 50-100 years, the rise in scores (for both races) was due to environmental changes. Whites have simply enjoyed a higher standard of living (then and now) which leads to them having environments more conducive to learning.

&gt;I know I said that was the last example I'd give, but let me do one more because I think it illustrates my point. Another big difference in IQ scores can be seen between northern Americans and Americans in the South. In fact, there have been studies done where blacks in the north scored higher on IQ tests than whites in the south. Are northerners different genetically than southerners? If not, then why the difference? If we accept whatever that difference is, why are you not using that to explain the black - white difference?

&gt;The above examples give pause to the idea that IQs for groups are set in stone (they 100% are not and that's a fact), and that genetics are the primary determination of a persons cognitive ability.

&gt;2) IQ scores only measure one type of intelligence (poorly)

&gt;IQ scores can only measure one type of intelligence, and it doesn't even do that as well as we'd like. IQ tests don't accurately measure strategic intelligence, or even creative intelligence. 

&gt;This is a huge problem since these forms of intelligence that the IQ tests cannot measure are some of the most important. Creativity lies at the soul of every major invention. It lies in the soul of every song, movie or play. Similar things can be said of strategic thinking.

&gt;Would we think worse of people like Jimi Hendrix and Ghengis Khan if we found out they scored low on an IQ test. If we would, we probably shouldn't.

&gt;3) IQ scores cannot measure potential

&gt;There are certain types of questions asked on IQ tests that you can get better at with practice. For example, pattern recognition and memorization are two things you can improve on drastically throughout your life (if you practice). This has two problems. One, it gives advantages to people who do similar kinds of thinking activities daily (this explains some of the Flynn effect we discussed earlier). Two, we may mistake someone had a low genetic limit based on someone not normally having to perform those kinds of activities, or not having as good of tools throughout their lives. Here is someone discussing this here.

&gt;4) At this point people will often say that when you control for certain variables the differences don't entirely disappear. For one, the differences fall away quite rapidly once you start controlling for things (income and neighborhoods mostly). Second, we have no way of controlling for other things that effect IQ testing scores.

&gt;One such example is Stereotype Threat. This is a phenomena that we've seen in not only IQ scores, but in math, reading, sports and (essentially) any other area where a stereotype exists. Stereotype threat is the phenomena that shows people perform worse if there is a fear that they will further a certain stereotype about themselves. The presence of this cannot be totally corrected for (although it can be manipulated somewhat).

&gt;Another example is cultural differences. We know that there are many ways that different races raise their children that influence their cognitive development. I really want to wrap this up, but one such example is the word gap.

This is by far the least persuasive of your points - thousands of people are born and raised in DC and have their families and social ties there.  It is a major city where people live their entire lives, not somewhere people only move to as adults.

&gt;A concern underlying excluding federal representation of the federal district in the federal government was that just by being the place where all the federal representatives gathered, the federal district would already get the concern and attention of the government’s representatives. By giving the district its own representatives it might get undue influence relative to the several states.

I get this as a theoretical concern, but I don't think it's actually borne out in practice.  The document you cite shows that the huge majority of that spending is in salaries to Federal employees, and Federal procurement.  That's just spending incidental to the fact of it being the seat of government and needing lots of Federal employees and offices.  Sure, DC Members of Congress would advocate for Federal spending for their constituents like all Members of Congress do, but I don't see why physical proximity would make them extra special?

&gt;D.C. has recently been bankrupt. It won Home Rule in the 70s. By the 90s D.C. had a control board and ceded many financial obligations that a state would ordinarily shoulder to the federal government. So far this has worked well. D.C. is among the more prosperous cities in the nation. Statehood would presumably require D.C. to resume the financial obligations of a state. That would likely ruin the city’s finances.

However, I think the points you make in favour of this move are solid, leading me to question why you are against it. As for your points against – that a signed interpretation is not the same experience as hearing the show – well, of course, but if people are deaf then they **can’t** hear the show, and there’s nothing the artist can do to change that. What they can do is provide an ASL interpreter. 

If there is *anyone* in the audience who is sufficiently hearing impaired that they might have trouble making out the lyrics (and for some performers that might be not very hearing impaired at all), including perhaps people who are profoundly deaf but still love hip hop culture, then having these interpreters available is a bonus. 

Indeed, you quote Inspectah Deck; I’ve never heard him rap that, but I can still get at least something out of reading the words on a screen in silence.

And in any case, what harm does it do? Is anyone distracted or offended by the presence of someone signing?  

Might I suggest that, rather than the presence of the interpreters, you’re reacting to the online reaction to them that you’ve seen? In that case, your anger is with media outlets for providing excessive coverage for something relatively minor, and should not be directed at the innocent performers and interpreters.

I'm just pointing out how ridiculous calling some things rape is. There is no black and white ""it's rape so that's that.""

These underclassmen ""can't"" give consent, but by whose standards? In some countries it's fine, normal in fact, in others it is a crime. Are these underclassmen on the same level of inability to give consent as toddlers are? Hell no. But it's still ""rape"" because they ""technically"" can't give consent (in america).

Well I'm pretty sure if your dog or mini horse is fucking you, then they've given enough consent. Maybe not consent on the ""technical"" level required by state, but you're definitely not harming this animal, and the animal has obviously chosen to do this. And don't try and tell me it's like when someone in power (such as a female teacher) manipulates a teen to have sex with her. If you've never seen a dog get randy, completely on it's own accord, it's probably because you've only been around neutered dogs. And I'm no PETA advocate, but nonchalantly looking at chopping off a living being's nuts as some type of regular procedure is waaaay worse than letting that naturally horny creature fuck what it wants to.

I think the problem is that a female or receptive animal can't express verbal consent in any way (even if it isn't spayed you still have a problem), and since there's no way to determine that, no one can penetrate something with the inability to express a desire to be penetrated so. Therefore, all sex with animals is illegal, because it's not cool/fair that only the homosexual zoophiliacs get to have sex with their partners while straight zoophiliacs have to suffer.

So OP is kinda half right. There isn't anything wrong about having sex with a willing male animal, or even receptive female ones. But determining the consent of the latter group is impossible, and therefore it's possible for them to be taken advantage of, which isn't cool. So we have to say no to all animal sex. Luckily, people who like to have sex exclusively with animals is an extremely small part of our population, so it's a small price to pay for society to say no animal sex. For those who do have those urges, either go live somewhere rural where it's unlikely you'll be caught, love your partner and don't take advantage of them, or move to a country where it's culturally acceptable.

Sounds to me like you are psychoanalyzing r/socialism and have decided that they are only asking for a condemnation of fascism for egotistical reasons. Couldn't it be (and wouldn't it be more obvious) that they are genuinely concerned about the rise of fascism globally? The paradox of tolerance is a very real concern. At some point, free speech becomes a platform for incitement to violence. I realize that is a very dicey line to walk, but nations great and small have toppled over that line into nightmare.

Maybe, just maybe, a group of people who found themselves on the very scary, bad side of fascism in the 20th century (socialists) genuinely fear that it will happen again. Indeed, may already be well on its way to happening. And they are hoping that at some point, someone will draw a line and maintain it before there is no more containing it.

For instance, if people had condemned Hitler after he wrote Mein Kampf and on the basis of the views he expressed there, barred him from holding public office, would that have been a power play, or would that have saved the world from unimaginable carnage? Do you think Hitler's free speech rights were more important than absolutely condemning his views and drumming him out of government as a result? 

I don't mean to Godwinize this thread, but Hitler is a good example of someone whose fascism was endlessly tolerated until it had to be violently suppressed, at great cost. Can we learn the lesson of that catastrophe? Or must we quibble about it being a power play and accuse everyone of being disingenuous when maybe they are actually frightened?"	6	False

Big population != big density. Population over area is density. In the 1800s we had less people but I would imagine they also occupied way less area than today, so the person per square km (or square mile wtv) was probably higher back then than now.

Reason for this is when affordable cars like the model T became a thing in the 20th century, that's what made having suburban sprawl possible, as it became a reasonable expectation that everyone could have the means of fast transportation (their car) at their disposal to use, so living far from the city center wasn't much of an issue anymore.

If we encourage individuals to vote for candidate C as opposed to A or B, then it gives candidate C a chance. Unlikely? Certainly. Extremely. But you still uphold your value set and ideals.

This won't happen though. Part of the reason why so many people vote for the two major parties is because they agree with them on enough and want their ideals to be upheld. There is a reason why the only successful third party was the Republican party, and that happened during a time just before the Civil War. As CGP explained in his First Past the Post video, people will tend to vote against the candidate they dislike. This is just a fact of the current system and one you have to work in if you want to have any real voice in politics.

&gt; I liken it to vegetarians and vegans who choose to diet, they adopt a mindset that allows them to carry on with their lives knowing they made a difference, no matter how small. One meal that doesn't include meat is one potential animal life saved, and if they do it for long enough, they may convince others to do the same; as we've seen, it's become somewhat of a trend in some liberal groups.

This is fine. I am not saying that you cannot or should not ever vote for a third party. At the end of the day, you need to vote the way that you can live with. Many people in Alabama either wrote in a candidate instead of voting for Moore for the obvious character reasons. There isn't anything wrong with this, but it isn't an effective way to vote either.

&gt; Voting for your own ideals makes you less predictable and less likely to be subject to being gamed in this way; I'm aware that cultural ideals and patterns exist and can be taken advantage of, but I'll argue that it wouldn't be nearly to the extent that they are today.

Voting your ideals is also a good way to ensure your ideals are actively suppressed if they don't entirely align with a major party more than a third party. The reason why Republicans and Democrats don't bother going after Libertarian and Green Party voters is because they won't usually switch anyway and they are unnecessary to win. Independents are the ones who will win elections because enough people agree with either the Democrats or Republicans that any other party won't matter, and the other parties are simply too far to extremes to appeal to the Independents in any significant number.

And yeah, what happened with Sanders sucked. However, had he run as an Independent, he would not have gotten nearly as much attention because the entire focus on the left would have been on Clinton and O'Malley, with Sanders getting about as much attention in the media as Stein or Johnson, possibly less even. In the end, he would have drawn away more Clinton voters as well, which would have made her run even harder, and we might have had Trump win with both the electoral and popular vote.

Unfortunately, the candidate that will best represent you right now is the one that has the greatest chance of winning and has the fewest policies you disagree with. Conservatives don't have their views represented at all if a liberal wins, and vice versa. The better outcome for any individual is more likely when they vote strategically."	1	False

Instead of doing that, it seems to me much more reasonable to drastically shorten the transition period between presidencies. The only reason why it takes two months to change presidents, from what I gather, is that the founders left enough time for a newly elected president to travel the whole country by horse to reach the White House.

Because they're famous for writing music for children's movies and a niche off-broadway musical. Go look at Howard Ashman's career and he's known for 4 things: Little Shop of Horrors, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. It wasn't like he had decades of winners out there from a cultural standpoint.

I'd also say Ashman and Menken came in during ""The Disney Renaissance"" from the late 1980's through the mid to late 1990's. Go watch ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"" for a documentary on the timeframe, but it lays out how and why everything went right for Disney in those ~10 years, and Menken and Ashman are part of that. They helped save Disney as a corporation.

Like you said, there is also the documentary ""Howard"" on Disney+ which talks about him.

&gt;So in your opinion what happened to the musical industry as a whole? If Ashman and Menken were the greatest ever than pardon me for putting it bluntly on this debate forum but why isn't anyone else even trying to live up to their example with the three qualities of melody, development and reveals?

Because if everyone could, then Ashman and Menken wouldn't be special. That's like asking ""If Michael Jordan was the best basketball player ever, why doesn't everyone just do that?"" There will always be people that are spectacular at things, better than others, and irreplaceable.

I'll also add, your taste is entirely subjective. By many metrics, Encanto is MORE popular than Aladdin or The Little Mermaid (and obviously Frozen was even moreso), so while YOU think they fail to be good or live up to these other movies, MANY other people would disagree with you. I'd also add these are movies from when you're a kid, and people have nostalgia from when they're kids. Everyone thinks SNL from when they were a teen was the best, and SNL now and before sucks. It's because that's what you grew up with, and it's hard if not impossible to capture that magic and feelings again."	1	False

So the USA government would take over, but Europeans could still vote for Bernie in the next election if they didn't like how the current administration handled the take over?

Omnipotence flows from this creation. If you create a world with certain physical laws, the fact that you can create those physical laws implies you had the power to decide on different laws and have the power to break those laws.

If God created the physical universe, is there any way he cannot be seen as omnipotent? This depends on your view of omnipotence. 

By including a creation with free will, God has already chosen to limit his omnipotence. Under free will, people can choose to do terrible things, and if God wants to remain consistent with the choice to give people free will, he will not be able to force a change. The question comes whether you consider the self-imposed limitations to mean that God is no longer omni-potent. Presumably, a being that creates the world and its physical laws has the power to force people to do as he desires. To that end, God is omnipotent and has chosen to limit himself by not forcing his will on people. 

What flows from this is likely that by choosing not to force his will on people, he cannot be omnibenevolent. The Judeo-Christian tradition teaches that God is good, that his benevolence is greater than a person's understanding. No teaching that the Judeo-Christian God is omnibenevolent would be consistent with actions of God in the Old Testament, the basis of belief for the Judeo-Christian God, in which God kills large numbers of people, and had to be responsible for the deaths of innocents. Given that these actions are described and considered truth by people following the Judeo-Christian God, no logical claim for omnibenevolence is consistent.

Omnipresence and omniscient follow from omnipotence.

It sounds like the issue you have is the inconsistence between a God who could choose to prevent suffering or evil and the omnipotence of the Judeo-Christian God. It's completely conceivable that an omnipotent being would choose to abide by his own limitations, the offering of free will to his creation and physical laws that can lead to suffering, and would therefore allow evil in the world, even as a good being. The teaching of God's goodness do no imply omnibenevolence, but instead that he doesn't relish in the suffering and does have a plan for salvation.

I'll add this isn't exactly my belief, as I'm leaning towards atheism at the moment, but this is consistent with Christian teachings."	3	False

I mean you can believe that but **that is just not the definition of democracy.**
Just because Johnson wanted a new election for political gains does not make the election suddenly undemocratic.

&gt;The most vital part of a referendum is that it is a binary vote. It’s the only way to ensure a majority. Had there been various options for leave on the ballot paper, there would have been no majority at all, which means the referendum was wasted. The only way you can get a majority is by having a binary choice. 

**No it is not. If you really want to dive into this I can present you with a referendum I looked at this week:**

Look at that graph of the outcome and then read this: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method

and this:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method

Take your time to really understand how the cloneproof Schwartz sequential dropping works.
**After that you should be 100% convinced that there can be more than a binary choice.**

&gt;the expensive referendum caused expensive arguing.

No. Stupid politicians caused that. If they had a hung parliament they could have called for an election 2 years ago. But they did not.


&gt;It’s not dishonest, it’s the truth.

Yes it is dishonest. It is true but the way you use the fact is what makes it dishonest.

&gt;I don’t agree with the fact that there can be a majority government with 30% of the popular vote.

I said 30% of the population not the voters.

&gt;Governments almost never have a satisfactory mandate, and referendums have even less of one. 

**In fact referendums have a way better chance to have a good mandate. Especially in the UK with your bad voting system.**

&gt;The UK operates as a representative democracy, so if anything undermines that, even if it’s other forms of democracy, then UK democracy is decreased. Similarly, if forms of representative democracy were introduced unnecessarily in Switzerland, a direct democracy, then Swiss democracy would be undermined.

**That is not what undemocratic means.** If the UK switches tomorrow to the Swiss model you would be more democratic not less."	1	False

I'll try to share that with you, the plus side is I'm not your average feminist (I'm actually not a feminist at all).

Let's start with
&gt;Are there actions that people can take which would increase their risk of being the victim of a crime?

The answer is NO.  Unless you're *literally* asking for it, which is not the case 99.99999% of the time.  The point is nobody ever wants to be the victim of crime.  Look at it from a different perspective, I can't *increase* my risk of being a victim, I can only *decrease* my risk of becoming a victim.  The difference is basically, there are no actions I can take that increase my chance of being raped or mugged, because I am literally always at risk for both (i'll slip in that I'm a male).  The part of me getting attacked is out of my hand, that responsibility lies on the attacker.  BUT, there is some part in my hand at how defensive I am.  Such as carrying a weapon, avoiding dark alleys, staying alert (not distracted by phones or music).

So to address your overall opinion, it just needs a slight tweak.  Thinking that people increase their chances of being attacked is unfair, because it is not their fault somebody else chose to attack them.  But sometimes people definitely ignore a few safer choices that **could** have (not would have) ended without crime.  Could they have done something different? That's for no one but them to decide for themselves.  Even the most defense-ready and safe person can be a victim of violent crime.

&gt;Is the State the sole entity responsible for the prevention of you being a victim of a crime?

Of course not.  The sole responsibility lies on the attacker/criminal.  At the end of the day, they chose to make a crime begin, not the victim nor the state.

When it comes to educating about preventing violent crimes, people are always overly two sided.  It's either ""teach people not to rape!"" or ""teach people how not to get raped!"".  I say why not a little bit of both?  Educating about rape is never a bad thing, in some cases the rapist didn't even know they were raping someone.  And that's the majority of cases where the two people knew each other before.  For your ""stranger jumping out of a bush"" scenario, that's where the other education shows its strength.  Combating the rapist with self defense, or avoiding the bush in the first place are obviously good things to know, and I hate when people argue otherwise.  Each ""style"" of education would be pointless on its own though, we really need to implement both if we want to see a decrease in violent crime.

&gt;You and your female friends walk home after a night out at the bars. You get to the point where you have to go the separate directions. Your friends is drunk. She says she wants to take a short cut through a local park, which is unlit at this time of the night, and it is also where homeless people usually gather for the evening. You know that she can take the long way home and walk through the main street, where it is well lit and has plenty of foot traffic still at this hour. As her friend, would you try to stop her from cutting across the park?

This is where we still agree, I don't think blaming the victim's friends for not looking out for them is out of line.  If the friends weren't there in the first place, don't blame them, but if they were there and they let their friend walk through the park, then damn them.  You can teach people not to rape all you want, but I would NEVER let my drunk friend (of any gender) walk home alone like that. How would I feel if something happened to them? Responsible!  And if anyone says otherwise, I do not want to be their friend.  Educating people to look out for their friends is never a bad thing.  And people should be encouraged to go to parties with friends if they know they will be drinking or doing anything mind-altering.

&gt;Response to thread's title.

Those women bare no responsibility. They did not ask to be attacked. They could have been doing everything right in the self defense hand book yet were still attacked. I could walk around with a lot of cash and *not* get mugged.  I can walk around the next day with a bullet-proof vest and no money, and get mugged.  The victim has no input in the situation.  Yes, there are vulnerabilities, distractions, and areas that should be avoided, but even if I ignore those safety tips, it was still 100% the decision of the criminal to commit the crime.  I wasn't asking them to, and frankly, with those ""stranger in the bush"" cases, if it avoided them safely, they'll just catch the next person that gets too close.  It is not for anyone else to ask if the victim could have done something different though, I like to assume they were doing everything in their power to not get attacked.  After all, they didn't want to be attacked, and the criminal wanted to attack. Kind of a ramble at the end here, but I think my point is finally put into words somehow.

TL;DR: Teach people not to rape, but also teach people how to prevent themselves from becoming the victims of crime.  Women who position themselves vulnerably bare no blame at all.

I’d guess what happens more often is that people don’t want kids anyway, and then engage in backward reasoning to justify this decision as being selfless.

There is nothing inherently selfish or selfless about having kids. The decision itself can be about fulfilling some biological imperative, or search for fulfillment, or might be about respecting the wishes of one’s own parents, or obeying your faith, etc... It may be that the nuclear family was simply the main model handed down, and that person possesses humility enough to not think they know better than the last dozen generations.

For the first two years I had to hire a personal trainer and paid upfront because I wouldn't skip something I'd paid for, that should give you an idea of how unmotivated I was, I basically had to exploit my own moral failings just to make myself do it!

It's gotten easier this year, mainly because lockdown has meant that I'll jump at any chance to do something to stop me from getting bored, and I've put a TV with Netflix in the room I workout in and I take it as an opportunity to watch the shows my fiancee doesn't want to watch with me (Altered Carbon is good shit yo), but I still don't *enjoy* it and I do sometimes resent having to do it.

My routine is pretty basic. It's basically all handweight and bodyweight stuff - push-ups, leg-lifts, crunches, curls etc. I did buy a bench when lockdown started too, so that I could do some back and chest stuff. When the gyms were still open I would use the machines there, the variety of them helps with the monotony, but I found that the hardcore stuff like deadlifts led to the same effects as cardio - dizziness, heart palpitations etc, so I can't really do those.

The main downside of the gyms closing has been losing access to the cross-trainer machines. I can't really do running, rowing or cycling for any extended period of time (I mean I can ride a bike from A to B ok, but not at a pace or intensity that's going to benefit me too much) but I am able to do 15-20 solid minutes on the cross trainer, I guess it's a tad gentler. The other downside is not seeing the trainers there. I made an effort to get to know them and am pretty good friends with a few of them, and that's another motivator for me to drag my ass down there - just to hang out.

The only reason I say this is because my friend got into coke from weed, purely because his dealer once gave him half a gram when he sold him some weed. 

My point is more so that when you get an illegal drug from someone, sometimes they also carry worse drugs, and will attempt to manipulate weaker minded or more troubled people into using drugs that will make them more money. It’s not the drug’s fault, but the pieces of shit people’s fault."	3	False

Well one is paid by my tax money. The other is not. I’m buying the bullets those cops are putting in my neighbors. And I control whether I keep paying them to do it. I’d rather pay them to arrest law breaking protestors. 

I do not pay law abiding protestors at all. 

&gt; Does a protestor spend years training to wear a uniform and earn money? 

No. So, there’s another difference, right?

&gt; Most would say no. But in regards to causing violence or harm to people, both police and protestors are causing violence and harm.

But cops are getting paid to do it, right? So that’s worse. They’re also getting years of training and earn money. If I was paying protestors to harm people, I’d want my money back. I am not paying them, so I can’t really call to defund them now can I?

No. The people saying you should wear a mask are saying you should wear one. That’s not the same as saying a cop should arrest you or threaten you with violence if you don’t. 

You can believe in freedom for individuals and believe you have the freedom of speech to point out what a reckless moron an individual who chooses not to wear a mask is. 

If you believe in “freedom for the individual” why don’t you believe the individual is free to criticize others? You believe in free speech for the individual right?

They certainly don't, they're just inconsequential for casual players - which, combined with the much better solo play / campaign makes it more enjoyable overall to them, at least that is what I would assume and feel like as a casual player.

Never said it wasn't, my point was that if you are going to go after the Bible for promoting violence, but give the Quran a pass, even though it has hundreds of verses promoting religious intolerance, then you are not being very philosophically consistent(not saying you are specifically, but there are plenty that do.). Many people who cry islamophobia have no issues with criticizing christians for their misdeeds, even though their actions towards people are lesser by comparison.

&gt;The same could be said of the female castrating African countries who are majority Christian.

Female genital mutilation isn't a part of the Bible, though. That has more to do with local practices than it does with religion.

&gt;A spade should be called a spade. But damning an entire religion because of some people's interpretation of a young religion that hasn't had time to develop like Christianity and Judaism has, doesn't seem entirely fair.

I agree, but I don't think that is what is going on. The concern is *radical* Islam, not Islam as a whole. Maybe some of the laymen don't see it that way, but people higher-up do. Even Bush made comments on many occasions that we were dealing with extremists, not your average everyday followers. The problem is that this extreme minority does hold a lot of power and can spread propaganda pretty fast. This is a rational thing to fear.

&gt;I see this as a problem of education, not of theology.

The thing is that powerful followers of radical islam take great efforts to keep education away from people, so the two go hand-in-hand. "	6	False

Math is logically true. But numbers don't ""exist"" outside of being ideas that can exist in ways that are similarly communicable between minds capable of comprehending them. they are abstract quantifiers that ""exist"" in the same way that sequiturs exist, because all valid mathematics are logical sequiturs. Harry Potter exists as a logically coherent idea, to some extent. He does not exist as an actual thing.

Does logical possibility exist, or is existence is logically possible? My answer would be that existence is logically possible, and that is how I am defining and understanding existence, because we more often use existence vs. non-existence to differentiate between non-fiction and fiction that forms a sequitur. In other words, fictional things don't ""exist"" but they are often sequiturs. Plato probably had it right when he divided ""existence"" into concrete existence and abstract existence. But ""existence"" as a term has changed to really only mean concrete existence, and my mind is too colloquially caught up in using it that way.

Science is an epistemological method for reducing doubt about notions of how reality works. It is also logically true.

Science is true when its conclusion necessarily follows the data examined, and when the data is accurate. Math is true because it is sequiturs that flow from a very precise definitions of quantities. ""Murder is wrong"" is not true unless you assume an axiom that it is true, or it fulfils the conditions of another axiom that make it true, ""You ought to act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."" is not true unless you assume it as an axiom or it fulfills another axiom.

 &gt; I am not just assuming a random thing is good. I am using basic axioms for the entire epistemology that holistically includes ethics.

I am using basic axioms too: My happiness is good, and my suffering is bad. Because I am empathetic and because I want to get along with other people, and because I want society to co-operate as much as possible, I fold in my axiom with a more universal axiom: All happiness is good, and all suffering is bad. It is also the basis for a categorical imperative: ""When acting, one ought attempt to do what they are able to do to maximise happiness and minimise suffering."" This is a very broad categorical imperative and adhering to it is based on how you respond to the infinite hypothetical imperatives you and everyone faces in life.

 &gt; That is not utilitarianism. That is a firm of contract theory since it is dependent on reciprocity. Utilitarianism is non reciprocal by definition.

How is it not reciprocal by definition? It assumes that you ought to do things that result in other people being made to be as fulfilled as you. What could be more reciprocal than that?

 &gt; Deontology is a moral system based around unconditional surface level behavioral rules. The Kantian categorical imperative and similar systems are a basis for morality that comes from pure reason and it does not necessarily manifest in the strict adherence to surface level rules.

Define ""pure reason"".

 &gt; Why do you think that utilitarianism is reciprocal? There is no basis for that,

Yes there is: The idea that emerges from it that each persons happiness ought to matter equally when making collective decisions.

 &gt; and not betraying people when it benefits you in the long run is against ethical egoism.

Yes, but very few betrayals benefit very few people in the long run. And the more that society shows utilitarian solidarity, they less that any particular betrayal is likely to result in benefit. I have a degree of empathy where I really don't like betraying people, and most people feel kind of shitty when they betray people. So people have a self interest in fulfilling empathetic drives by not just betraying people all of the time. Sure, some people betray people very easilly, which is why it is imperative for the rest of society to do what is necessary to make sure that betrayals don't result in greater outcomes for the betrayer.

 &gt; You said that you are a ""utilitarian"" yet you have a justification as though you were a contract theorist. Rich and powerful people have more bargaining power in the social contract.

Rich and powerful people always have more bargaining power, no matter what. Utilitarianism says that some people being rich at the expense of others is unjust, by logical necessity, because of the soundness of the rule of diminishing marginal utility of wealth. It provides a logical basis for why rich people ought to not be rich. What is the ""pure reason"" that suggests why ought not to be rich and how is it different from the ""pure reason"" that rich people ought to be as rich as they can cause themselves to be?

 &gt; Be on the top and it is good.

This is a tendency for any moral system accepted by any society. Why would society coming to accept Kantian consequentialism be any more likely to reject the assertions of the ruling elite than if they were to accept utilitarianism?

 &gt; You really don't understand ethical egoism if you think that a happy society matters.

You don't understand people if you think that people have no selfish interest in being a part of a happy society. Only craven sociopaths want to be a king of ashes. Most people only have so much appetite for betrayal, any remaining incentive for betrayal is based on a lack of solidarity in society. No matter what ethical system you follow, a lack of solidarity will always be a problem in getting people to appeal to that ethical system."	1	False

Everyone has a unique brain, but certain components tend be structured differently or of a larger or smaller size on average between all women or all men. A doctor looking at a trans woman's brain in isolation would be more likely to assume that her biological sex assigned at birth is female. Unless you're to propose that these biological differences in brain structure and development are purely caused culture and society, there seems to be a very real biological basis for gender dysphoria to exist.

EDIT: I should also add, gender dysphoria is much deeper than ""hobbies, passions, and how you present yourself."" In many societies it's (relatively) socially acceptable for a woman to present herself fairly masculinely. We haven't fully accepted gender nonconformance by any means, but butch women exist and (arguably) face less discrimination than trans men, while being able to freely engage in masculine aesthetics and expectations to the degree that they choose. Given this, why would trans men exist at all, if they could have simply otherwise been butch women?

It is the roll of the Executive Branch of Government and as the leader of that branch he has those powers granted him in the Constitution. No legislation is needed for him to impose or remove tariffs (though they can be put in place by Congress as well). Trump has already started to increase tariffs, and has done so with Canada and Mexico, and is currently looking to do wo with the EU. Trump cares more about his opinion domestically than he does in Europe (as most Presidents do) so his reputation taking a hit in Europe really does not matter.

Well, why shouldn't I call the cheap stuff authentic? Where do we draw the line at real chinese?

Obviously naming ice cream with a tea leaf on top ""Confucius' ice"" is going too far, but General Gao's chicken has some traditional chinese ingredients in it, and it uses garlic, so it tastes chinese enough to me. 

Maybe my ancestors perfected cooking over all those years, but I'll assume I didn't inherit any of the taste buds, but surely they'd be pleased that their cooking could inspire hippies across the ocean to modernize and adapt it! I mean, some of the traditional chinese dishes take so much time and skill, it's just impossible for me to learn if I don't pursue a culinary career path.

Then your view is a tautology and there simply isn't any point in trying to change it as you've pre-set all of the parameters such that you view is correct. ""Given the right conditions"" any government will be absolutely perfect, and ""given the right conditions"" **all** governments will seem ""better"" than whatever we have now. 

It's a super ridiculous argument to set up because the over riding purpose of any government is to deal with conditions that *aren't* favorable. ""Given the right conditions"" no government would be necessary at all because everyone who would otherwise be governed would already be acting perfectly. Government exists because groups and individuals *don't* act perfectly.

&gt;If we were however I would point to Denmark, the least corrupt country on Earth. If the Danes consented (still in a democracy) to the aristocracy, I think the chance of success would be very high if the proven candidates that have already shown they know what they are doing were the first to run the aristocracy. From that point on it would become an election from those who qualify to vote.

Your examples are highly flawed as they represent complete outlier countries whose history, political, social, and economic make up are vastly different than the rest of the world. Denmark, the people in Denmark, and the Danish government are not *inherently* corruption free. They are a tiny, tiny country with a relatively large GDP and for most of their history have been rather insular, isolationist, and homogeneous in population. Maybe they could make a aristocracy work, maybe they couldn't. It's pretty irrelevant as they are an outlier and not an accurate gauge of how other countries opperate.

Same thing with Singapore, who you've brought up in another thread. They are a country with an extremely unique history in the world, and would almost certainly not exist if it weren't for the protection and influence of larger countries, and corporations who operate in larger countries.

The point of getting as many people vaccinated as possible is that if someone does get sick, the virus doesn't have much of a chance to spread. The person hopefully gets through the contagious portion of the sickness before encountering another susceptible person.  
&gt;  
&gt;Say a vaccine is 95% effective and a sick person goes to an event with 100 people where everyone is vaccinated. That sick person would have to encounter one of the 5 people there who the vaccine wasn't effective for (4 if the sick person is one of those people). And then they'd have to actually spread the virus to one of those people. That's a far cry better than all 100 people there being a risk.

Cool, with you so far - but a vaccine passport doesn't change anything here. 

&gt;But let's bring Group 2 into the party. Say 10 of the people show up to the same event, bringing the total attendance to 110. Now suddenly there are 15 people who are at risk. That makes it three times as likely (roughly) for that sick person to spread the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;While you might say ""Who cares, Group 2 can suffer the consequences"", it's not just Group 2 that suffers. What G2 is doing is putting everyone who in a risk group at risk for a longer period of time. The virus might not spread like it's doing now, but it's being allowed to simmer in the background.

So here we've got 10 people who *chose* not to get the vaccine, and 5 people who got the vaccine but are unknowingly still at risk, right? 

I say ""who cares"" to both of them - the first 10 for obvious reasons, and the latter 5 because they still made the choice to accept the risks of attending a public gathering. I'd say they made a well-reasoned choice - they were vaccinated before going - but if they get sick they get sick and that sucks. 

&gt; Now G3 can't really risk doing anything because if they're medically unable to be vaccinated it's probably because of an underlying medical problem that would making getting COVID more dangerous than it would be for an average person. 

Yup, and I get that G2 people who catch it at a concert can go about their lives and put G3 people at risk. However, that's the case with all infectious diseases anyway, so my point is if that the risk of G3 catching COVID is still comparatively super-high, then we just shouldn't be having concerts yet anyway. 

&gt; Or to put it more simply, you've probably had your measles vaccine. Does that mean if a co-worker came into work with the measles you'd be willing to sit in a meeting with them, shake their hand, and pretend like everything was fine? Or would you say ""GTFO, you're sick!"" 

No, I wouldn't. But I feel like two employees in a workplace is a different situation than two members of the public at a public gathering. 

I'd be equally skeeved if someone sidled up next to me at a concert and was like ""what's up I got measles,"" but that's a risk I ran by attending a public gathering in the first place and I'd take issue with the venue checking to make sure we had our measles shots before I entered - or more precisely, with the gov't requiring the venue to do so."	1	False

Its obvious this rehabilitation your imagining is in a prison of some sort not just on the streets for most violent crimes.  I think everyone can agree the prison system isn't good, nor is it focused on rehabilitation, but that just means we need to improve the prison system, making some strange delineation between rehabilitation and prison based on the crime makes no sense, being in prison for 2 months and being in prison for 10 years can both mean a sentence focused on rehabilitation, it's just variable on how long we estimate that would take, and requires a system focused on rehabilitation.  It seems like your recognizing that prison is a horrific place that functionally scares some people straight that are in short times, and is so awful it ruins people when they are in for a long time, but that's not because we treat minor crimes different, its because we treat them the same and the impacts of our shit prison system is magnified on long sentences, so fix the system don't make wonky non-legal deliniations on who gets rehabilitation or not.	2	False

I accept it as how it works, but when I really try to think about it I don't quite understand the logic.

The way I see it, gender roles are simply outdated; a way for our hunter gatherer ancestors to divvy up labor to people whose biology best suited each task, that's lasted far longer than it should have. Society's gender roles for people is based on biological sex but not intrinsic to it. Gender can be related to sex but is not inherently tied to it in any way.

It makes total sense to me if someone essentially says, ""Even though my biological sex doesn't match up with the biological sex these societal roles are typically assigned to, I feel more comfortable filling those roles than I do filling the ones that are typically expected of my sex."" Makes perfect sense to me. sex is your biology, gender roles are your place in society, and people's chosen gender roles should outweigh outdated norms. 100%.

Having a gender identity that does not align with your biological sex or your gender roles does not make sense to me logically. If a bio male identifies as a woman but still fills all the societal gender roles of a male when it comes to things like the way they talk, dress, act, interact, and the things they do for work and play, I just don't know where the gender identity comes from. Your identity matching your roles and/or sex makes sense, but I just don't understand where the internal feeling of ""I am a woman"" would come from for the person in the above example. Is there an intrinsic sense of man and woman that's not tied to biology or society? what causes it? what does man and woman intrinsically mean if it doesn't have anything to do with any of that?

My opinion is that it doesn't matter and it doesn't have to be logical because it's identity, which is personal and doesn't have to conform to any outside systems or ideas. For the longest time I just assumed people with very nonstandard identities like that were gender abolitionists who were using their image to point out the inherent insanity of strictly upheld gender roles, because everyone I personally knew who was like that identified that way. I'm seeing a lot of people online that don't seem to feel that way and I'm just not sure if there is a better answer than, ""It doesn't make sense and it doesn't have to.""

My closest friends include an enby who dresses fem but uses male pronouns, a cis male who prefers female pronouns and likes to dress fem, a masc leaning enby who prefers they/them pronouns, and a trans man. I identify as cis but I am very weakly attached to my gender. I say that to say I'm no stranger to a variety of gender identities and people whose identities and roles seemingly conflict, but it's not something that I've personally experienced. My friends who have gender identities that don't align to their gender roles all have a kind of, ""I don't know why I feel this way and I don't really care"" mentality or they're the aforementioned abolitionists."	39	False

&gt; I am still doubtful of the idea that all morality has the common aim to promote well being. I think this way for two reasons. First, I feel like much of religious morality hinges on doing what God says not what promotes human flourishing.

But, God never really spoke to the people, we presume. God is the **representation** of society, father and order. So, when God says something in literature, it represents the idea of the prophet's ""perfect"" (or close to perfect) society. Again, you may say it is subjective, and to some extent it is, but we live in a quite an objective world (enviorement). So, eventually these subjective ideas get taken to a very objective test. This is where it ties to your second argument.

&gt;  This part of my disagreement is much more strong than the above: I think even if we agree that all morality is based on human well being, it too cannot be objectively measured. For example, two people may argue whether freedom or security are more valuable to human well being (I dont think these two values are inherently in opposition, but such values can be, thats why i mention it). If two people disagree on this claim, there is no way to objectively measure which is true. 

There do happen to be multiple models that provide enough well being to guarantee survival of the model, but various models vary in terms of prosperity they provide. **For every society, in one particular time, in one particular enviorement**, there is one single best moral that would provide it the most prosperity, and that's the one it should strive for. Again, that doesn't mean that there are no other solutions. There are many viable solutions that would provide enough well being to allow the survival of society, but one is the best solution. It is impossible for us to find that one ""Godly morality"", but, we should strive to do so.

 Now, the bolded part in the previous paragraph is the key to this counterargument. There are multiple legitimate moralities, but each is objective. Think of it as a set of different equations. For one society, it can be objectively immoral to allow immigration, while to another society it can be objectively moral to allow immigration. Each society is provided one unique equation to solve, but that doesn't mean the solution is subjective.

Perhaps - even Dickey agrees with you there.  However, that wasn't the concern _at the time of the Ammendment_.

1) A sadly large chunk of the population gives more attention to celebrities than to important issues. That same chunk of the populations puts an inordinate amount of stock into what those celebrities endorse or profess. That's why advertisers pay big bucks for celebrity endorsements and why influencers are even a thing (taking a wide view of what ""celebrity"" means.

2) Change, whether it's from corporate actors, government, or large groups of individuals, requires broad-based buy-in. Companies change when staying the same threatens their profitability. That comes when large enough sections of their customer base are ready to change their buying habits. Politicians and laws change when a large enough portion of the electorate is more likely to vote out office holders if they don't act on a given issue. All of these take numbers. The otherwise politically engaged  don't make up enough consumers or voters without some buy in from people who are generally less likely to give a shit.

Put those together and celebrity statements can put wheels in motion. Wheels that matter. And that's newsworthy in three ways.

1) It's something people want to hear on the news (see point number 1 above).

2) Because of the effect it has, it can be a relevant moment in social trends, which, as point number 2 above notes, drive major changes.

3) ""Newsworthy"" is a broad term. With a few exceptions, most news outlets include human interest, fluff, puppies being saved by firemen, etc. If something happened and someone wants to hear about it, it's newsworthy. It may not be the kind of news YOU and I feel we need to hear."	3	False

It’s trying to preserve the cultural harmony over the need to confront truths which cannot be changed.

The way those views work is usually something like this:

* Mastering skills is therefore a pursuit that has larger sweeping connotations for myself. By mastering several things I will lift myself up into new ways of thinking.
* Improving myself is like a sort of transcendence over the earlier unimproved self. Mastery is therefore ultimately a spiritual pursuit, and could lead to transcendence.

The European schools of thought that practiced this way of thinking used the term ""magnum opus"" (literally ""work enlarged"").

It's important to keep this in mind, since it completely changes the implications of your Ice Age argument. Oil and gas are finite resources. We can't just burn them now and keep the planet warm indefinitely. If we burned them all, we would get a spike in temperature now, and then a slow reversion to the mean.

If our goal is to prevent Ice Ages, we should stop burning hydrocarbons today. Burning gasoline today does nothing to help against an Ice Age that's coming ten thousand years from now, as the carbon cycle will scrub all that CO2 out before we need it. 

As such, if our goal is truly to prevent Ice Ages, we should leave as much oil, coal, and gas in the ground as we possibly can. Save it for when the planet is actually entering an Ice Age. Future generations faced with that threat could then start burning it as fuel as soon as polar ice caps start to advance.

Seeing it from that perspective, I cannot just dismiss every white person as unattractive, because there will be exceptions somewhere.

Applying this to hair colour, I can definitely say that I'm attracted to dark-haired people and not attracted to blondes. However, if a blonde guy dyed his hair black, and somehow managed to keep it like that for the rest of his life, I might be more attracted to him.

Remember, a twelve-foot-tall tank/gun/whatever has a average sight-line range of less than 4.5 miles towards a similar target.  (i.e. on a flat plain without any obstructions, 4.5 miles out they won't be able to see each other due to the curvature of the Earth.)  In comparison, maximum range for most unassisted Howitzer rounds is closer to 15 miles.  Given average terrain variations and obstructions, unless you're fighting in Kansas the ability to lob significant amounts of kaboom at people without a sight-line is worth its weight in whichever high explosive you favor.

Even a ~250-foot-tall naval vessel will lose sight-line at about 20 miles (again, towards a similar target), and at that point we're talking about the largest of the large.  Anti-ship missiles can easily reach hundreds of miles, torpedos can potentially reach similar ranges, and the guns of much smaller ships can reach close to that distance.  (Additionally, most torpedos are effectively immune to laser countermeasures.)

&amp;nbsp;

Let's say we have three people and the police. We aren't at the trial yet. One of people is Dave. Dave is dead. He has been murdered. Bob is our other person. Bob is actually innocent. Bob and Dave a history of not getting along. So the police have been looking for whiteness and asking questions, typical police stuff. So the police go to Bob and ask him some questions. Stuff like how did you know Dave, and where where you tonight? Well Bob says he was at home the whole night watching TV. He says he never left. He also makes a comment about how Dave deserved it. 

Now the police also find Mrs Alice. Mrs Alice is a nice church going lady. She would never hurt a fly and would certainly never lie. So she was out giving food to the homeless that night. She saw Bob stop by the convince store to pick some food and cigarettes at about 9pm.The convince store is close to where Dave was murdered. Dave was murdered around 9pm. 

&amp;nbsp;

Do you see where Bob went wrong. He was so scared and worked up  by the police questioning him that he forgot that we went to the store, and even worse he said how he didn't like Dave anyway. 

&amp;nbsp;

So fast forward to the trial. The prosecutor stands up, looking sharp in his freshly pressed suit, says to the jury; : ""Bob has had a history of not liking Dave, he even said Dave deserved what he got, Bob was near the scene of the crime, Bob was stong enough to kill Dave, and most damming of all Bob LIED to the police about the night of the crime.""

&amp;nbsp;

Now hopefully in 2017 the jury would want more than that. Hopefully there would be cameras, DNA, finger prints. Hopefully they could use your cellphone location data or car location data  or even your home electricity use data to show that Bob was innocent. But before all those things existed people were routinely sent to prison who were innocent. Our story has Means, Motive and Opportunity. And it has Bob accidentally lying to the cops. Had Bob chosen to remain silent he could not have lied. In this case it was him lying to the cops that damned him. 

&amp;nbsp;

The purpose of the right to remain silent is to protect innocent people, not guilt people. The whole 4tg, 5th and 6th amendments are to protect the innocent. Innocent people routinely confess to crimes they did not commit. Innocent people routinely make false statements to the police."	1	False

If Walgreens says ""too bad, Christian Person, you must fill that prescription,"" they run the risk of running afoul of the CRA. Thus the various Religious Freedom Restoration Acts across the country that provide accommodation options to ensure businesses can serve their communities while also respecting the rights of their employees.

I dont fully understand all of the complexities and nuances of this issue so I don't think I am the right person to argue for or against it. The following response was when I was under the wrong assumption of what changing bases would mean is so it is inaccurate and poorly informed. 

The appeal to metric is that it is incredibly easy to change between units as you would just move the decimal point. As a result everyone knows the powers of 10 and these powers can be used to form measurements of different magnitude. 

Milimeters is useful for very small measurements but you can still measure long distances with kilometers. These two measurements can easily be converted between the two using people's inherit knowledge of base 10. 

&gt;My main point is that the metric system should have been based on either powers of 12 or 16

How many people actually know the powers of 12 or 16 off the top of their head? Cause I only know 12 squared. I cant even tell you what 16 squared is off the top of my head. Anything after that I would need to pull out a calculator. Something converting units should avoid. 

&gt;Introducing the format numberbase, 1610 is written as 1016. That means that 1610 x 1610 = 1016 x 1016 = 1001

Dude I'm a math minor and I barely follow this. Units should be easily to use for EVERYONE. Including people who dropped out of high school and dont have the best understanding of math. It may seem easy to you, but I promise that base 10 is a million times more intuitive. 

&gt; base 10 was an arbitrary choice that humans made probably because of how many fingers we have

What's the problem with this? It makes it easier for somone to understand and see before them. Remember  that math isnt easy for many people. Being able to use fingers to help people count and convert units is super helpful."	2	False

That's the point everyone is arguing. A company should base its hiring decisions on the candidate who is most prepared, most hard working, and best fit for the company. That is best established by looking at completed coursework (transcript), proven mastery of assigned material (GPA or internal evaluation), and interview. For example, a low ranked uni grad who earns a 39 on the MCAT shows better mastery of material than a high ranked uni grad with a 34.

* Reasons why a high ranked uni grad is not necessarily the most prepared: There are students at high ranked universities because they are athletes, legacies, donors, or politically connected. After entering the university, the student may purposefully take easy majors, classes, professors, etc. and end up with a poor GPA because they slacked off, not because the classes were competitive. Also, core classwork is largely the same at the undergraduate level; rankings are based off of a multitude of things beyond class rigor. 

* Reasons why a low ranked uni grad might be more prepared than a high ranked one: There are students who are equally competent as students at high ranked unis, and who would have attended a higher university if they had the money/choice. There are students who did poorly in high school but turned it around in college (why evaluate an adult on their teenage/high school achievements, when you can evaluate an adult on their adulthood achievements?). Low ranked unis tend to have fewer opportunities for mentor-ship, field exposure, larger class sizes, and more. A student who does well in spite of these challenges and develops a resume equivalent to a high ranked uni grad demonstrates a better work ethic.

Consideration should be awarded based on a candidate's *demonstrated* preparation and work ethic, not on assumptions based on university names."	0	False

Drag shows are very different.  The performers are gay, and the shows started when anti-gay discrimination was far more severe than it is today.  There was a subversiveness to the shows- gay men who were being harassed for being effeminate instead embracing it, with a ""you want effeminate?  I'll show you effeminate!"" attitude.

The underlying idea behind the shows isn't one of derision, but of lampooning the idea of gender, that we need to be one thing or the other, that it's ""dirty"" to step outside your ""official"" gender role, something that is positive to the transgender community.

It can certainly extract carbon from the forests and if anything INCREASE biomass production (if you chop down trees that are full growth). 

So we can basically be neutral on the biomass while depositing some underground, which essentially amounts to a steady drain from the atmosphere (which is where the trees get their CO2).

&gt; Unless I am misunderstanding, you are requiring recycling operations to recapture carbon, but not requiring new paper manufacturers to; why?

You are misunderstanding a bit.

I'm pointing out that forests already capture carbon. But of course there's a finite amount of biomass on a km^2 of Canada or Siberia, so much of it isn't pulling much.

However, if we cut the older trees, the new ones will pull a great deal of CO2 as they grow. We, of course, are already doing this given how much wood we use. Not to all that much scale because we really are somewhat paperless now and the wood cutting companies have gotten really good at replanting after themselves, leaving both Europe and NA with growing forests.

We should be cutting down more wood, basically optimizing for forest growth. Full growth trees are a huge waste of potential capture. That'd capture considerable amounts of CO2.

Of course now we have tons of extra wood product to use and we should figure out what to do with it - we can only have so many wooden pieces of furniture and paper.

Of course, that is only a problem if discarding it in a way that doesn't let it back in nature (biomass/atmosphere) is more expensive than recycling, which I don't think it is."	1	False

Even if it's symptomatic of a greater problem, it's still worth acknowledging and being aware of when considering the outlooks of those without that advantage.

There is also current research on biofeedback and polyvagal theories to help advance treatment in adults. Treatment is no where near perfect at this time, I agree, but neither are treatments for children or prevention strategies as you’ve pointed out. To that point there’s room for growth in all areas not just adults. No one treatment is ever going to fit all those affected by PTSD. There are too many factors that go into determining what kind of therapy or medicine or combination will work for each person. Like I said before treatment is a lot of work for the sufferer and sometimes a lot of trial and error to determine what works. There is also the consideration of how changes caused by trauma are sometimes permanent much like someone who severed their spinal cord, they can still lead healthy and fulfilling lifestyles with some accommodations and assistance. Sometimes resolving all the symptoms is not possible and a certain amount of integration of new (maybe not ideal) parts of oneself is necessary to move forward.

Someone who is fiscally conservative but socially liberal may vote for a Republican and identify as a conservative, but someone with those same viewpoints may vote for a Democrat and avoid the label ""Conservative."" 

&gt; So you'd agree that conservatives (generally) believe people get what they deserve?

Not necessarily. In my view, conservatives generally believe that their current system is *more-or-less fair*. **They acknowledge the instances when it is less fair** (i.e. when someone receives something they don't deserve) ***however*** they feel that those instances are either **too rare** or **not severe enough** to warrant a change in the system.

So, to contrast with your initial point, it's not so much that people get what they deserve. Instead, it's more that ***most* people *tend to* get what they deserve and even though some people don't, upending the current system to fix the situations where people *don't* get what they deserve could backfire and result in a scenario where even *more* people don't get what they deserve.** 

Basically: if it ain't *completely* broke, don't fix it. 

&gt; Like how conservatives opposed the civil rights movement in the 60s, because keeping black people segregated was working just fine?

Kind of. In this scenario, the overall system worked quite well for a majority of the population (read: white males). It didn't work well for a minority of the population, so conservatives felt that it wasn't worth the effort to change the system. This idea largely stemmed from the idea that changing the system could result in a negative change for white people (even if that ""negative change"" was just having to interact with black people and treat them as equal). 

&gt; So, you'd agree that the colonial citizens who opposed the American Revolution would have been the Conservatives of the time?

&gt; And the southern citizens who opposed the abolition of slavery would have been the conservatives of their time?

I would say that they had conservative ideologies but they might not have self-identified as conservative. 

Conservative ideology in the way that I've described actually enables a method of resolving cognitive dissonance. In regards to the abolition of slavery, a conservative during that time could have felt that slavery was wrong, but knew how much plantations and southern businesses depended on slavery. So instead of advocating for abolition, they instead advocated for better treatment of slaves. Fixing the flaw - in this case, the treatment of slaves - was not worth the uprooting of the current system. 

It's important to note that my definition of conservative is contextual. A conservative in today's America would likely be a liberal or progressive 150 years ago. "	1	False

I don't care if your closed source software needs to reinvent the wheel.

So I actually agree on the entire ""help open source"" idea. But I'm still nitty gritty about:

1. the wasted time in the language ecosystem
2. forcing the idea through the use of a license

If somebody makes a GPL library for a popular problem, then sooner or later somebody will have to reinvent the wheel, because he has a personal preference for being able to do what he wants to do with code, or is developing a commercial application.

If this reinvention of the wheel is now publicly released we have 2 libraries for the same thing.

And forcing people to adhere to ""helping open source"" by the use of a restrictive license sounds wrong for me. Isn't the idea of publishing your code as open source that people can do what they want with it? If MIT is open source, and commerical applications are closed source, GPL sounds like something in the middle for me.

Could you...

1. explain to me why two libraries being made just because the earlier library is GPL isn't wasted time?
2. list a few examples where the decision to GPL license code actually resulted in less total developer time across the entire world?

Every worker has to compete with the person willing to their job for the lowest price. This is why we need minimum wage. Without it McDonalds could find truly desperate people, and pay them 5$ an hour. The amount people are payed isn’t at all related to the value they bring to the company. It’s related to the supply of workers. The issue with looking at wages with supply and demand is that the demand for work is essentially infinite. If the only job available pays 3$ an hour, you would have to take that job. It’s not like a product where you can just buy a cheaper one. You can make yourself part of a much smaller supply by getting educated, but everyone can’t work in academia or the tech industry. We need people to work in Amazon distribution centers, and Starbucks, and mail delivery. Those people will always be in very large supply. It doesn’t matter how much value they bring to amazon, without legislated worker protections they won’t be payed even close to that value.	1	False

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. Are you trying to say that my hypothetical straight people are homosexual because they are in a homosexual marriage? One doesn't have to be homosexual to behave homosexually. I think the most popular example of this is straight girls making out.

&gt;They ONLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOMOSEXUALS GETTING MARRIED. Tell me that again.

I don't think you're paying attention to what I'm saying: they have a problem with homosexual marriage, not homosexuals getting married -- there is a distinction. 

&gt;Great! Then why would they be against homosexual marriage? You don't HAVE to have sex to be married.

Here's the OED definition of the adjective ""homosexual:""

&gt;&gt;Involving, related to, or characterized by a sexual propensity for one's own sex; of or involving sexual activity with a member of one's own sex, or between individuals of the same sex.

""Homosexual behavior"" encompasses far more than just homosexual intercourse.

&gt;What? Everything a homosexual does IS homosexual behavior.

Refer to the definition above. Just because a homosexual does it does not mean that it is homosexual behavior (although it is A homosexual's behavior). Regardless, my point is that it is the feelings rather than the actions that make a homosexual. Therefore, in order to discriminate on the basis of homosexuality, you must discriminate on the basis of the feelings rather than the actions.

&gt;But what else are they basing it on? Certainly not marriage. The only factor in play if we were to go down a checklist of things they were discriminating against would be the fact that the marriage in question is same-sex.

That's right. They have a problem with same-sex marriage. That's not the same things as having a problem with homosexuals (i.e. people who feel a sexual attraction towards people of the same sex)."	1	False

You define your ingroup as essentially virtuous - never mind Obama's massive expansion of executive power, and never mind that the last person to invoke the nuclear option was a Democrat in 2013.  The outgroup is an unreachable, amoral other - they hate poor people, hate black people, hate gay people, have no principles, only care about winning...I'll bet they just kick puppies for fun too!

And what's more, you feel no obligation or see no value in understanding their views.  You know what you need to know about *them.*  You understand *their kind.*

This isn't a search for understanding or knowledge and it's not legitimate discourse, you're creating identity by othering people you disagree with. Tribalism.

&gt;There's a difference between intolerance of people who are different because of their race or gender and intolerance of people who have intolerant beliefs.

That there are other forms of intolerance is not a vindication of yours.

Realize this: you're basing these excuses for your own intolerance on your moral judgments of people who disagree with you.  Those judgments are based on assumptions concerning what various political views indicate about moral character.  Yet you have demonstrated and in some ways admitted that *you don't understand why they hold these views.*

Do you see why this is a problem?  In lieu of understanding, you take the cognitive shortcut and just assume they must be racists - which at this point is the Liberal equivalent of a Conservative suggesting that you must disagree because you hate America.  It's just a placeholder for thoughts and arguments that haven't been undertaken.

&gt;What's the point of saving objections to a conservative nominee when the Senate can just dismiss a filibuster anyway? The GOP has gotten more and more radical and their base will not punish them not matter how extreme they get. The Dems were right to show their voters that they were actually up for a fight.

1) Because if they'd waited until after 2018, they might've picked up some seats and removed the nuclear option from the table.  Now a bare Republican majority can pass anyone they want; they could find someone that makes Gorsuch look like Ginsburg and Democrats can't do shit to stop it.

2) Because it was a waste of political capital.  They were going to lose and every single person on the hill knew it.  They chose pure partisanship and party loyalty at a time when their best shot at mitigating Trump is reaching out to Republicans and building alliances that deliberately fracture the partisanship that brought us to where we are now.

3) Because Gorsuch isn't an ideologue who's going to fundamentally change the balance of the court.  He's a continuation of business as usual, which has actually gone pretty well for Democrats of late.  By assenting, Democrats could've forced a similar, moderate nomination if that comes up in the near future.  Now their only hope is that no liberal justices die or retire in the next 3 years.  If things go wrong, you'll get the SC from your nightmares.

But thank God they ~~tilted at that windmill~~ showed they were ""up for a ~~slap~~fight.""  Nothing invigorates the base like a public spectacle of partisanship, impotence, and perfunctory failure./s

&gt;&gt;Don't be ridiculous, the Dems gerrymander too. Republicans were just better at it because they and their voters decided to give a fuck about state legislatures.

&gt;Exactly. The Dems should get better at it.

I'd like to think you mean get better at local politics, but it seems like you mean get better at exploiting gerrymandering.  See, I thought the objective of a person who actually gave a shit about democracy and enfranchisement would be to reform the system so that gerrymandering wasn't exploitable and people were fairly represented.  What with principles being more important than winning and all.

But hey, gotta rep the tribe.

&gt;It's obvious that the GOP doesnt understand values, only winning.

I bet they talk in the theater too.

&gt;I'm saying them being extreme made no difference.

This argument doesn't hold water because A) most gains were local and local politics are idiosyncratic and less polished by nature.   Both sides of the party have bizarre and highly objectionable people serving at lower levels - the main reason you see fewer Democrats is because they lost so many seats. B) your admitted lack of understanding compromises the validity of you calling something ""extreme.""  All it functionally means is that it's an opinion you find very foreign.

&gt;The ACA was never going to get a political consensus. The GOP clearly doesn't want to help the poor get healthcare. If he had have waited, the GOP would have sabotaged it more and more and possible stalled it until Trump took office. 

Romneycare was a thing and the forcing of the ACA was what begat the stagnation in Congress.  The ACA was the leverage Republicans used to make all the gains they did.  It's possible if not probable that an effort at building consensus on ACA would not only have produced a workable healthcare plan, but would have allowed for more legislative activity over the past 6 years.

And this garbage about them not having a plan because ""they don't care""...is bullshit.  They didn't have a plan because A) they were incompetent, B) the party is too disunited to write a plan with broad support, and C) as soon as Trump won the nomination they started planning for a Clinton presidency that didn't include the repeal of Obamacare.

&gt;I've made that effort but have found few reasons to believe they care and many to believe they don't. It's easy to dismiss those beliefs by saying ""but maybe you're wrong"" and ""they can't be that bad"" but it's possible they are that bad. 

You haven't made the effort, not least because you later admit that you see no value in understanding them.  If you had, you could explain the most correct and reasoned defense for their views that you could find and why it was wrong.  (See: the Principle of Charity.)  Instead, you go to the default mudslinging and even more strawmanning here.

To be clear: I'm not arguing that maybe you're wrong or that they can't be that bad.  I'm saying that you have no idea what they think because you haven't tried to understand them as they understand themselves.  You're proud of not reading their media, you say it doesn't matter what they think because they're wrong (bit of an epistemological contradiction there...), and you consistently characterize them as borderline inhuman malefactors. You only relate to them through a dehumanizing, self-serving, tribal lens.

So no, you have not made the effort.

&gt;Learning about what Trump supporters think isn't that valuable if their beliefs are wrong.

Here's the value in understanding what they think: you might learn what needs, anxieties, or concerns they have that Trump and/or Republicans are addressing that you're exacerbating or failing to cater to.  You might learn differences between the way you and they understand certain important terms (like ""racism"") that may hamper productive discussions.  You might realize that you've badly misunderstood the political terrain of your country and recalibrate to reality.  You might find points of philosophical agreement that have somehow produced different outcomes and might be reconciled. This applies to most progressive partisans I've interacted with: you might learn that being offended is not an argument and that people don't need to validate one another's feelings for a discussion to be productive.

FFS, don't you remember in the first comment I wrote to you when I said that ""Trump supporter"" isn't a cohesive identity?  Yet you treat them that way.  Understanding them might mean finding some insight on a particular issue and changing someone's view on a particular policy without winning them wholly to your side.

Here's an easy example: working class whites in the rust belt went for Trump wholesale, right?  Why?  Well, was the Democratic party speaking to them and addressing their concerns?  In some sense it was, but only when addressing them as part of a larger group like the working class.  The Democrats would speak directly to black people, women, LGBT...hell, part of the Democratic strategy was triumphantly crowing about gay marriage, meanwhile working class whites are impoverished and dying from opioids in staggering numbers.  At the same time, the progressive zeitgeist is awash in discussion of (especially white) privilege - a privilege that is as alien to those people as anything could be.

From their perspective, the progressive left ignored their problems, blamed them in absentia for other people's problems, and they observed in the Democratic party an acceptance of identitarian politics for anyone who *wasn't* white, straight, and male.  It welcomed political engagement specifically as a person of color, woman, or gay person speaking on behalf of those collective identities, but acting as what most of them were was forbidden. It was an article of faith that a straight white male is politically covered and doesn't need attention, and that people like those voters need to be silent and deferent while people with *real* problems hold the floor indefinitely.  That probably wasn't the intent of Democrats, but it's how it looked to a critical audience.

The concept of alienation should be familiar to progressives, and that's precisely what the Democratic party and many of its constituents have done to the people who became Trump voters.  Given what I've described above, is it any wonder that the first guy to tell them he would make them great and that he cared about them got their vote?  Can you understand why their faith persists - because alternate options are in short supply?"	1	False

Specifically, messaging people on dating sites. But this is a poor predictor of who is actually attracted to who. It is muddled by expectations of how people think the other person will respond. If I were on a dating site, and I saw someone with supermodel good looks on there, I certainly would never message that user because I recognize that a super model isn't going to date me. That doesn't mean I'm not attracted to her. I offer this alternate explanation for the data:

Older men message younger women more often because they are creeps. They feel entitled to younger women, who they find more attractive, because they think they are owed (or at least think they can get) a younger women. This causes them to message younger women, based on the belief that it might actually get them one.

Older women have more reasonable beliefs. They realize that a younger man is unlikely to want to date them. This causes them to message men closer to their own age range, who they view as more likely to respond. 

This pattern of behavior can, I admit, be blamed on the patriarchy, but it does not reflect attraction. A study meant to measure attraction would ask people to rate images of men/women of various age ranges, then compare the respondent's age to the ages of the people they rated as most attractive. But the conclusion to that experiment (50 year old women find 20 year old men more attractive than 50 year old men) is so obvious I doubt it's ever been done."	1	False

If Apple cut the price of the iPhone in half by citing out all the glass and aluminum and replaced it with cheap plastic, profits would skyrocket because they could probably sell a whole batch at full price for half the production cost. Such a move would lead to a dramatic boom in profits but investors would take note of the declining product quality and conclude that it would take years to recover the damage done to the brand and future years revenues would be drastically riskier. At that point do financials really not factor into the stock price? Or is it that good profits we’re actually an indicator of bad business practices? 

I guess my point is that you need to look at the company as an entire entity and in its context when considering a stock price. None of it is decoupled or unrelated."	2	False

It's a plot device that moves things forward.

No because it's also applicable to powers that can't be used on PCs as well, that are only used on NPCs.  And higher level/more powerful effects often eliminate the chance.  So it's not just a plot device, it makes sense to players and GMs alike that obviously you'd need much more powerful magic to take away someone's free will on something they'd care deeply about.

&gt;My point was that Utilitarianism (which is a form of Consequentalism) could lead to those exact non-pretty things

The whole point of Utilitarianism is that you have to avoid rules that are likely to lead to those low-utility situations and make rules to avoid them... 

&gt;See point about In Flagrante Delicto. Retaliation is post fact, they are no longer mid action, self defense they are mid action, hence accepted.

Often but not necessarily.  Retaliation that isn't self defense that is in flagrante delicto (mid action) is banned.

&gt;I am curious as to why you say an addict wouldn't have free will (other than when it comes to murder). People do quit (not many), even when they have drugs on hand.

People quit by separating themselves from the drugs.  Very few people successfully quit by putting themselves in the same situations they normally use and just thinking ""this time I won't"".  Successful attempts are more likely to involve making it harder for oneself to access the drug so when the cravings strike they aren't right there."	1	False

Yes while it might look like conversational skills are the most important, that's only true at the flirting stage, that's how you get a girl to like you, or to even pay attention to you.

Who knows, if you were less socially awkward maybe she would be jealous all the time, which would in turn stop her having fun at those social gatherings.

To me it seems like you're typing pretty well, no need to worry about appearing immature.

There are so many more factors to love than conversation, in the five love languages book, only one of the 5 even mention words. They are - gift giving, quality time, words of affirmation, acts of service (devotion) and physical touch. Just because you can't format your words very well and are unable to provide a ""public bf"" maybe the private bf is the one she fell in love with and the one she wants to spend her life with.

I don't know if I answered you very well.

Not really, the right has it's fair share of media too, Fox, Newsmax, most of talk radio (which is hugely effective at attracting rural voters, one of the most important demographics in any election), OAN, MANY YT channels. The right has plenty of media.

&gt;Conservatives are being pushed to be more and more accepting of the gay community and of minorities. Tv shows and movies are filled with representation of these groups. Sports teams around the U.S. have racial equity slogans and organizations stamped on their uniforms. We're in a place where trans issues are now being discussed widespread similar to how gay issues were not long ago.

Fair point, but it seems that these kinds of things are getting more and more backlash all the time. As evidenced by (older) Gen Z being more Conservative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your perception of that may be because you are far further left than the majority of Americans and make a far larger circle of what you consider ""alt right""

I mean, I was pretty specific. What do you consider the ""alt right""?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and also ignore the significant shift to the further and further left we see in almost all of American forms of Media.

I admit I'm pretty young so I probably haven't been paying attention to politics enough to notice a shift. Do you have any evidence?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No...Would you say that America moving further to the left as a whole is a sign that Liberal Propaganda is working its magic?

No, but it's suspicious that Gen Z starts moving right at the same time the alt-right has perfected it's propaganda techniques.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The gay community is more accepted now than at any point in U.S. history.

But that seems to be in jeopardy given the insane backlash to attempts to expand trans rights. That may also start to extend to the gay community.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's a hot issue because democrats moved their position on this away from Republicans. The idea that this is moving further to the right shows you aren't looking past 3 years of history.... it was a common position of Democrats in 2008 that illegal immigration was a problem and we needed strong borders. It's a hot issue now because we are moving AWAY from the right.

Fair I was wasn't paying attention to politics in 2008 but even if Democrats talked the talk, they didn't walk the walk. Illegal immigration peaked in 2007 and legal immigration has been cut drastically since then. I mean Reagan even gave amnesty to illegal immigrants, there wasn't a snowballs chance in hell of that happening with Trump

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This has nothing to do with Alt right.

But a Conservative SC can help push the alt-right agenda, case in point: Texas Abortion law.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Democrats have the Majority in the senate. But this has again, nothing to do with the Alt right.

It's actually 50% but a lot of the Republican senators pander to the alt-right

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And state bills being passed have nothing to do with the alt right.

They do if they're helping advance the alt-right agenda.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We might right now be experiencing a step backwards in the massive amount of progressive culture shift we've experienced over the last 20 years.

Further, when moderators collude on at a widespread scale to suppress certain views, then the mitigating aspects of singular subreddit bans dissolve and you are essentially deplatforming views globally.

&gt; Though the costs are very low, 15-30 minutes of one's time, the benefits seem to be even lower. Though there may be some expected benefit in one's preferred candidate being elected, the probability of one's single vote being the deciding vote in an election is so astronomically low that the expected value is next to nothing, surely not worth even 15 minutes of anyone's time. Note that the probability is non-zero--just like some people win the lottery, some elections might have come down to single ballots--the argument is that in same way that the expected value of playing the lottery is negative, so it is for voting.

This, to me, is valid reasoning, but I think you're begging the question by assuming that the utilitarian calculus supports your view. Yes, playing *the* lottery has negative EV, and voting is similar in principle to playing *a* lottery, but that does not necessarily mean that voting is similar to playing a *losing* lottery. It's true that the odds of swaying the result with a single vote are very small (though sometimes not as small as you might imagine, and not always predictably so), but your claim that the probability-adjusted benefits are low  compared to the effort required is not an obvious one. Surely the benefits will be low *for you*, but the benefits would not simply apply to you, they would apply to many, many (sometimes all) people in the country. When you consider that the amount of benefit is inversely proportional to the likelihood of your vote actually having an effect, it's very plausible that your vote might have a net benefit.

Of course, this line of reasoning is only compelling if you are morally-minded. If you are a selfish, rational agent who will not benefit massively from a change in the outcome, then you are correct. But if that were the case, you would merely be saying, ""I don't think a selfish, rational agent should concern himself with morality or the well-being of others,"" which is trivially true. If your position is more nuanced than this, then it seems like your moral duty might not simply be to encourage others to vote, but also to directly increase their well-being by also voting *yourself*.

The reserve list doesn't effect kitchen table players.The reserve list only effects people who want to play sanctioned competitive magic. I think you will find talking to a cross section of SCG and GP grinders that all the top ones play MTGO. It is where the most competitive magic exists. Sure, there does exist some cross section of players that like competitive paper magic, but don't want to play MTGO.

For one, poor communities are notoriously bad at getting to the polls. Second, gun crimes in poor communities aren't going to encourage Nancy and Bob in middle class Wisconsin to vote in favor of stricter gun laws because they simply can't relate. It is not *their* problem. Mass shootings affect a larger demographic of people and the danger it poses (or at least the fear it generates) to middle class Americans can be used by politicians to promote changes that will hopefully have positive impact on the poor communities also. To your point, poor communities have been riddled with gun crime for decades and nothing has been done to fix the problem. The problem is suddenly affecting the middle class and the people that al make up the bulk of voters on election day. And it is affecting *everyone* including politicians' and decision makers' friends and families and others who probably don't associate with *anyone* below the poverty line. Mass shootings are no longer ""someone else's problem"" from the perspective of wealthy white people so as shitty as it is to the poor communities that have been dealing with it for so long, it is an opportunity to make changes that will hopefully positively impact the gun violence plaguing poor communities also.

You're coming from a place of compassion and I wholeheartedly respect and agree with your sentiment. But most Americans aren't looking at all the poor people needlessly dying from gun violence. Once again, doesn't affect them so not their problem. So why not use these tragedies that *do* hit close to home for middle class America to spin some positive change that will help *everyone?*

Who cares if it only prevents 117 deaths from random mass shootings per year if it is also preventing 10,000 deaths from targeted shootings in poor communities? My point is the catalyst for change does not matter as much as the change itself. If mass shootings are what is finally going to change the American perspective on gun violence and hello create sensible laws, then great. Focus the discussion on that."	26	False

At least where I am from (the northeast US) there is definitely a demographic and cultural difference. White collar workers are almost exclusively represented by educated white professionals. Blue collar folks like me are almost entirely African-american, Hispanic and eastern European immigrant, and po white trailer trash like myself.

I will check that out as soon as i get off work. And again, I'm not saying that the white collar struggle isn't as real as the blue collar one (corporate exploitation of the salary exemption is a huge concern, one the blue collar folks don't have to deal with), just that it's a different experience altogether.

It also means you have to put up with dealing with the weird foot fetishists.  Personally, if I had feet like that I would be doing my best to stay away from them as much as I could because they creep me out.  If the only way I could get shoes that fit was by actually dealing with them, I would view that as a major negative aspect of my life.

You listed Santa. Santa is based on a Christian religious figure, Saint Nicholas. So one of your points goes against what you're trying to say.

Seriously? Have you never watched television during Christmas, specials that mention the nativity (ex: ""Charlie Brown Christmas""), or widely viewed and televised concerts featuring music that honors ""Christ the Lord"" (ex: ""Christmas in Rockefeller Center"")? Is that public enough for you?

Yes, in fact 81% of all non-Christian Americans, including 87% of agnostic/atheist/secular Americans celebrate Christmas. This is reason enough to consider Christmas a more universalized holiday. But to say that it isn't celebrated ""as a religious holiday anymore"" is an extreme bias.

&gt;So there's no reason to throw a fuss over people not saying ""Happy Holidays"" (as long as references to Jesus are excluded, obviously).

Moreover, they hold, at least some moral claims actually are true. That much is the common (and more or less defining) ground of moral realism.

So it's better if you understand the subtext of the use of Microaggression, and the issue was why Minorities don't do well in organizations that aren't outwardly bigoted. 

\----

Non Micro Aggression Version

So let's focus on gender. In Russia, they had bath houses, this was a real problem for women, because men would go to the Bathhouses and they would discuss work. This was a network opportunity that women didn't have because they could hang with the men in the bath house. Thus business like journalism, where journalist would talk with people in the bath house (Partially because they couldn't wear a wire in the bath house) became male dominated simply because woman weren't give the opportunity.

Journalism wasn't bigoted, the Journalist organization hired women, the path to promotion was more difficult for women, because of a something outside the organization.

\----

Micro Aggression Version

In many companies in America, you get promoted by more or less getting people to like you, and being a team player. This can be quite complicated, and often you don't know if a person has a good relationship or a bad relationship with you because you don't see them that often, and you have to choose where to invest your time.

If your a minority there are some people that are (for the purpose of this discussion) micro bigoted, meaning that they don't like particular minorities but not on the realm of racism. So if an co-worker dump a ton of work on you at the list minute was it because you did something wrong, because he doesn't like you or because he's micro bigoted.

If your a straight white male, then you can assume the majority of the time no one is bigoted to you. If you a Black Lesbian Woman, then it's possible any one might be micro bigoted to you, and now you have to spend more effort in those relationships even if 99% of people aren't bigoted. The problem is that if a person is Bigoted it's a big problem for the Minority. Thus even though there is no racist policy, and no one in the company is outwardly bigoted, all these small interaction end up making it so minorities succeed less simply because they have to view all interaction through the lens of bigotry. And this is even if no one is actively being aggressive to them.

This is an effect of Micro Aggressions.

On the other end of the coin there is Sales. Sales people success is based almost entirely on how, much money they bring into the company (In some cases.) Ironically this make in this position extremely resilient to micro aggressions, simply because their ability to succeed is only dependent on their ability to bring in money. This is not a ""good system,"" especially for minorities as they suffer bigotry from clients, but it's a system where the person success is being validated objectively.

So generally in a company you want a system where you measure the success of individuals in an objective manner, and not who people like most in the company, because that tends to make people who have to spend more energy understanding social situation, less likely to succeed."	2	False

I think blame only really has a place in situations where someone acted in a way which was reproachful. This can include negligence, but I think only in its more extreme forms: a parent who forgets to feed their child for days is negligent to the point of reproach; a parent who leaves a small object in reach of their teething toddler is probably not. I believe blame is only a useful concept when punishment (or at least some kind of reparative justice) is involved. If a crime has been committed, blame is useful. If someone needs to make amends to the wronged party, blame is useful. Otherwise, not so much.

In situations where a person's actions led to misfortune, but where they did not necessarily do anything *wrong* per se, I think the concept of responsibility is more useful. Knowing who is responsible for a situation--whose actions contributed to that situation, whose job it is to deal with the aftermath, etc.--helps us prevent bad situations from happening in the future. It helps us see how our actions influence our circumstances, but avoids the idea that people must necessarily have done wrong or bear guilt for their actions to have bad outcomes. It helps me to think of it by looking at the word 'fault' very literally. We're used to things like ""It's your fault"" as a phrase, so much so that we don't really pay attention to the individual words. But 'fault' is a failing or negative quality about a person. If you decided a sprinkler system was too expensive, and as a result your house burned down, your decisions did potentially impact the outcome, but it's not your fault, quite literally, because you didn't do anything *wrong,* you just made a decision that had negative consequences.

Generally appropriation is the taking of a non-dominate cultural element by the dominate culture without attribution or respect. 

&gt;And the point I was making with police brutality was to show an actual issue vs a made up issue to make people seem racist for no real reason

I mean that's just begging the question. Would an example of cultural appropriation be helpful? Here's one I posted earlier today in a different thread:

&gt;I think the social context and results are very important when determining appropriation. For example, when Van Gogh just repainted a bunch of Japanese wood blocks and drew nonsense Kanji on the sides [here](https://www.zazzle.com/van_gogh_flowering_plum_tree_after_hiroshige_wood_wall_decor-256345248764627735) , that to me looks like appropriation. [Here is the original.](https://www.amusemuseum.com/english/ukiyoe/images/ukiyoe_img_02.jpg) 

To me it looks like Van Gogh just copied someone else's work for personal gain without attribution, and to capitalize on the 'foreignness' of Japanese woodblocks at the time.

The west got to bend Russian supplies and embarass them on the world stage and had no political harm from it. Infact western people rejoiced. 

> Do the sanctions against Russia hurt ordinary Russians rather than the ruling elite, as well as the British public by significantly raising gas and electricity prices?

I figured the point would be to pressure the people into unrest. Sanctions are to destabilize not necessarily just damage the economy. 

> Furthermore, recent Pentagon leaks reveal that there are 50 members of the British Armed Forces in Ukraine,[3] and the UK has trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil since the beginning of the war.[4] Does this risk making the UK a victim of Russian aggression? If Belarus were training Russian troops, would Ukraine have the right to retaliate against Belarus?

This is more an opinion than anything else but no. Belarus wouldn't be directly involved and unless their soldiers join an offensive (ie only engaging in defense of themselves) they shouldn't be considered a belligerent. 

> Serious questions have been raised about corruption in Ukraine, as the Democracy Index considers Ukraine to be a hybrid regime rather than a flawed or full democracy.[5] Ukraine has also been involved in several high-profile scandals, such as the Hunter Biden Laptop case,[6] and several political parties have been made illegal.[7] Moreover, approximately two-thirds of the aid donated by the U.S.A. to Ukraine has gone missing.[8] This raises concerns about the potential formation of a repressive state in Ukraine backed by Western arms and finance. 

None of this is relevant to the war besides the aid going missing. Even if a country is flawed I'd never advocate for an invasion. Iran and Afghanistan are flawed, but they deserve self governance. Only if they're purging others or doing human rights violations/crimes against humanity do they forfeit that right."	6	False

I disagree strongly with your final statement! Consuming art is an active experience! The book is nothing without the reader. You put in your own ideas, prejudice and preconceptions, and art throws them back at you. It's a dynamic two-way process. Any cold intellectual analysis that doesn't reflect the cascade of emotions and viewing process that you experienced on the spot risks being irrelevant and artificial.

It's debatable to what extent entertainment and art intersect in TV shows, and other parts of popular culture.

Property and safety laws are generally civil, not criminal laws.   


Criminal mischief tends to focus on intent, while loitering focuses on effect. Thus they are applied differently.   


Oregon's 3rd degree Criminal mischief Law reads ""when you interfere or tamper **with the property** of another **with the intent** to cause substantial inconvenience to the owner or someone else""  


Conviction under this law requires proving the element of intent. Compare this to the Loitering statute I shared earlier:   


""**No person shall obstruct** . . .blah blah blah""

In other words, Loitering makes it illegal to have the effect of blocking access. So if you hang out drinking beer with your buddy on my stoop, blocking access to my business, but you never intended to harm my business. You are still causing me damage but would not be punishable under criminal mischief laws. That's why loitering laws exist.   


 And, btw, that's why they are written as they are which is not merely ""people happen to be hanging out in public"" but ""people are hanging out with the effect of depriving others of their civil rights."""	1	False

In general, I agree with the premise that a responsible adult should always ensure the return of a cart to a corral or the store. I pride myself on the fact that I am very diligent in the return of carts.  


Today, and approximately an hour and a half ago as I write this, I left a Walmart cart out.  


Before OP jumps me, allow me to explain. Last week, I inadvertently missed an online college test due to getting the test date mixed up with a different online college test that I had (I essentially had about 5 tests all within the span of 5 days, so I dropped the ball here.) I messaged the professor, explained what happened, and asked if I could take the test late. He said I could, but I would have to coordinate a time with him since he can't just re-open it indefinitely, only for a 1 hour period. Now, were I a normal student, this would have been no problem to knock out the same day. Unfortunately, I work overnights, making scheduling during normal daytime business/school hours difficult. Even worse, I am a computer science major, meaning I need MY computer to take the test, I can't just use a school computer when I am on campus. After making sure my schedule gets lined up, I told the professor that I would be able to take it today at 11 am to noon. I had a campus class at 9:10, I leave at 10:10, I get home at 10:35+/- 5mins, and I can be all set up and ready for the test to open at 11. I had this precisely mapped out. As I was on my way out the door for school, my wife asks me to do 2 things ""since you are going out"". 1) Drop off a package to UPS, and 2) stop by Walmart to get ""I will text you a list"". Face-palm. Alright, I leave early enough I can drop off the package before I go in, and pick up on the way home since Walmart is right off the interstate on the way home. Typically we get Walmart deliveries, so I didn't anticipate her wanting more than a couple of things. So that was my plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So I get the package dropped off, go to campus, have a decent-ish class session, and then I bolt to the car to get to Walmart, because the realization hit just how close I was going to cut it. So I drive as fast as I am legally allowed (I am not even 30 and I have had more speeding tickets than I care to admit, not risking that getting in the way of my test) and get to the store., and park in my usual spot. I park near the corner of the parking lot because it is relatively close to the door by comparison, hard to lose your car, and most importantly a quick way to get out the back entrance to Walmart that allows me to take a specific route home, to avoid specific traffic. I check my phone. What does she want? 2 gallons of milk and several bags of Halloween candy. At this point I knew I had to use a cart. I try so hard not to need a cart, especially when I'm in a rush. So I grit my teeth and grab the cart and go shopping. I swear it was like everyone in that store was there specifically to add time to my trip, as I was constantly getting people coming out from around corners to get in front of me, and the majority of the time, they were SLOW. Like easily 1/3rd to 1/5th my walking speed, like they were on a stroll. The milk is in the back of the store, meaning I had to travers the whole-ass store for the milk, and then stop through the candy aisle to get candy. That is ALOT of room for people to get in front of me and take their sweet ass time getting to the next aisle. I felt each second agonizingly tick by realizing that I was likely going to be late for my make-up test, and my already elevated anxiety levels were sky-rocketing. I do that meme where you scoop candy off of shelves and I hot-tail it out of there. I go to the self-checkout, accidentally double scan one of the candies and have to get an associate to cancel the item, wait for the card reader to approve my card, and start walking at a faster-than-normal-but-not-so-fast-you-look-like-you-are-shoplifting pace with my cart. Show the receipt to the nice lady by the door who handed me some kind of a book, and get to my car. I had 10 minutes until my test started, and a 10-15 minute drive ahead of me. I scoop the bags from the cart, and I, with a huge amount of pain in my chest, get in the car and go. I left the cart there.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt horrible because this is the second time that I can think of that I have left a cart. The first was 100% the store's fault, cause they have some bullshit on their carts that auto-lock the wheels when the cart is X distance from the store, and I parked in the back of the parking lot that day, and the wheel of my incredibly full and heavy cart locked up on me 5 feet from my fucking car, causing a box of canned sodas to fly from the bottom of the cart onto the concrete and bust 2 of the cans open. I pointedly refused to return that cart, that store can get bent.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home and my test had already started, I was a minute late. I finished the test just as it was about to automatically save and submit. And then I decide to take a minute to relax and scroll reddit and I see this fucking post. God damnit. And then I just spent another 30 minutes typing up this adventure to realize that I butterfly effect'd myself into leaving this comment last week by missing my original test to begin with.

They really do things differently, and especially with the way they reboot themselves. 

Having the constant characters within the universe allows them to make commentary far easier than with constantly changing casts. When you see Bruce Wane you know exactly what you are dealing with, so you can tell a story from there without having to spend tons of time describing the motivations. With characters with such long history it doesn't do any good to the series to just get rid of them when they are archetypes that can easily capture the zeitgeist of the age. Comic books aren't supposed to have a character ark in the same way that manga has or even graphic novels have, its about building a universe with characters that live their lives in them. And often they exist to mirror the audience and make commentary on society at the time and even commentary on themselves. 

I think Superboy Prime is the best example of this for me. In Crisis on  Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis he serves the roll of standing in for the audience to help reboot the universe. In Crisis on Infinite Earths hes the young lover of comics that never wants the comic book world to grow up, thus saves it.   But during the 80s when comics had taken a turn where all the heroes had gone really dark, more anti heroes than heroes he came back in Infinite Crisis where he is angry at the dark turn heroes had taken and so is determined to tear it all down. His appearances serve as metacommentary in DC to try and critique themselves.

Its really hard to add new characters to replace the old ones with this in mind.  I've always felt that DC has been stronger for writing diverse characters as in strong rolls than Marvel in my opinion.   Marvel has always felt like its making plugged characters to whatever they feel whatever quota isn't filled rather than adding new charicters with their own role, story and powers. For me their strongest character that they have written recently is Singularity, shes unique and like nothing else out there.  While characters like female Thor get written out because it doesn't add anything to the character, its just derivative and doesn't make a unique plot or even add much. I felt that way about Miles Morales until recently, and still have mixed feelings.

That's disingenuous. You say he never claimed biological superiority, and I give you his exact words claiming that. Paraprashing, he says men and women differ in ability due to biology and since men are better at tech that's why there are more men in tech. There's really no explaining that away.

&gt; When it comes to actual suggestions and discussion in more specifics, he doesn't touch much, if at all, on ability. 

He does. 

It's a core theme of his memo. The entire context of the memo is that not all of the gender gap can be explained by bias. Some of it is explained by the superior ability of men. He spends pages discussing these biological differences. It's clearly not a point in passing. It is a core idea.

And some of his *actual suggestions* do directly target the biological ""inferiority"" of women. His words from the section where he makes actual suggestions:

""Women on average are more prone to anxiety. Make tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this with its many stress reduction courses and benefits.""

While his suggestion might not actually be a bad one, it does exactly what you claim he didn't do. He touches upon ability even in his actual suggestions.

Furthermore, he gives a tl;dr at the beginning of the memo, which one would presume to include all the major points he wants to make. It includes this juicy claim:

""Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.""

Putting it all together, men are superior to women at tech (and more interested in it) and Google is currently discriminating against the superior men in order to attain diversity goals. !

If I were a female engineer I would never be able to trust this guy to give me a fair peer review. Something that determines my future career and salary. 

Let's look beyond existing female employees. How might a superiority claim like this affect Google's ability to recruit new female employees?

&gt; Are you saying that won't work?

Yes, that's what I'm saying. Google does not recruit from the general population. Not even close. They hire the best people from the best graduate programs in the world. I don't know the exact percentage the pool that Google pulls from is likely far lower than 1% of the general population. I'd actually like to see the math, because it's probably shockingly lower.

Any change in Google's diversity program would best be targeted at this elite pool of potential candidates. Or even targeted at getting more women into the pipeline in the first place. Regardless, that pipeline does not get filled from the general population. Not even close.

&gt; And by 'differences reverse' 

By that I meant that at the elite end of the scale of woman and men who excel at tech we might find biological differences that actually favor women. His data is far too broad to be relevant to the population Google hires from. A unique study would need to be carried out on the population of Google's current employees and the population they hire from. That's the exact problem with deciding what you think is true and then cherry-picking scientific facts that confirm your bias. It doesn't even approach real science. His ""research"" doesn't even approach solving the diversity goals specific to Google. Some of his suggestions weren't horrible. But his data and his ""science"" are horrible in terms of suitability to the problem."	1	False

To your first point, I agree that equal treatment does not equal outcome, but I do not believe the metaphor you used necesarily applies in this case. The amount of time and energy needed to pass the test will certainly different from person to person, but the goal is to ensure competency. I believe the test is already a ""ramp"" in that everyone is able to surmount the obstacle and is judged by the same criteria, however it is still easier for some to defeat the obstacle than others (i.e., obese or handicapped people will still have a harder time getting to the door than healthy people). 

To the second portion of your post, I agree that the test could use some fine tuning. This doesn't mean it should be done away with because of ""racial bias"".

Their first reaction was to call me out for just being selfish and jealous because I had to pay my own loans off.   The joke was on them, because I come from a similar background as you and I never had a formal higher education, and thus bypassed the going into debt part.  I naturally gravitated towards a technology career path at a time when schools didn't even have computer science programs.

While I would tend to agree with you that people should be held accountable for their bad decisions, I also don't think we can have an honest discussion on this topic and not delve into the fact that there were predatory practices in play.

I don't think outright loan forgiveness is an appropriate answer.  How far back do we go, and how far into the future?  Do we  just forgive all current outstanding loans regardless of age?  Do we cover new loans going into the future?  Everybody focuses on how it's not fair to those that had have paid off their loans, but I don't see much discussion about fairness for future  generations which will get the shaft as well.  

From the limited understanding I have on this subject, most of these loans are federally backed with a 2% intrest rate while banks are turning around with an additional 6% on top of that. Instead of going complete erasure of debt, how about re-evaluating interest rates or allowing refinance with lower rates.  The fact that education related debt persists through bankruptcy is a huge red flag of a broken system.

Another idea to help ease educational  debt would be to offer programs like you see in medical education programs where doctors are incentivized to relocate to rural areas;  give 5 years of service in a rural area and your loan burden can be significantly decreased.  A system like this would still hold people accountable while still offering them reasonable alternatives to crippling debt.  Not only that, it would encourage people out of dense population centers where cost of living is already troubling as is.

So while I do agree with you that outright loan forgiveness is not a solution, I do think there are extenuating circumstances that our government created and needs to address.

yeah but that again is argumentative debatting. You base your view; that big govt. is worse than small govt not on a universal truth but on arguments that others might disagree with. (which is totally reasonable in a diverse society) 

For example, you might use the argument of personal responsibility to counter public social support.  
You can give examples to provide support for this view and one might give counterexamples to weaken your argument.  (also you are not talking about your view, when talking already existing facts, you can merely explain your thoughts towards these fact through your view)

While there are certainly parts to everyones political ideology which are ""based on belief"" most of them are founded in arguments, or else we would pivot to a different side of the ideology.

Again taking power of governance: I one person favors socialism, that person will either have arguments for why it favors socialism or it is worthless debatting that person as there is no objective value in doing so. (since the person cannot respond adequately to arguments)

One is your body does not like change.

This is an extremely hard lifestyle to maintain for years, it's really taxing. 

The other issue is, when you create all those fat cells (I was 450) they never go away, they stay with you forever, and when you are losing weight every single one of those cells release the hunger chemical. So there are times where I get so hungry I worry I will pass out (which has happened on occasion) and the only way to manage the hunger on a daily basis is drinking about 2-3 litters.of diet soda a day, the carbonation helps trick my body into thinking it's full.

So even if I was skinny, I would still feel hungry like a 450 person, and will feel that way forever. It's why doctors are recommending weight loss surgery for minors to help avoid this issue, and why they are calling it weight management now.

You can test for rote learning. You can test for facts and even concepts and a clever student can regurgitate.

On the one hand, I could perhaps be convinced that there is no moral issue with eating chickens. This seems unlikely, but I am open to the possibility.

I'm not really shooting for such a grandiose change. My argument was focused on an acknowledgement that under ideal/theoretical circumstances, breeding, killing and eating chickens is not immoral.

My approach on that front was completely isolated to chickens and it doesn't (and shouldn't) really take other animals into consideration.

It *also* completely ignores the current state of chicken farming and any atrocities currently practiced. My point is that breeding, killing and eating animals is *necessarily* unethical.

&gt; On the other hand, I could perhaps be convinced that eating chicken is consistent with most people's morality. I think that eating honey, for example, is consistent with most people's morality but I do not see any indication that most people have a morality that really allows them to eat chickens. I think they simply ignore the ethical dilemma instead of resolving it with respect to a coherent moral view.

&gt; This is why dogs are relevant. Most people really do seem to assign moral status to dogs, and yet whatever reason they have for assigning moral status to dogs would also be a reason to assign moral status to chickens. If you could convince me that dogs are not really assigned moral status in our society, I would award a delta.

Ah, I see, I slightly misunderstood what you were aiming for.

On *that* front, people do have a fairly consistent applied morality with regards to eating animals but it hinges on a few things (and is very different from person to person or culture to culture):

* People will not be okay with eating any animal that they have a personal connection with.
* This ""immediate"" connection can be applied to the entire species as a whole.
* People in our society almost immediately create personal connections with dogs, cats, etc.

This means people don't have a problem eating rabbit, squirrel, chicken, etc. but *will* have a problem eating cats, dogs and horses.

Cultures that *don't* have a problem eating dogs don't really see dogs as pets. They are street vermin and no personal connection occurs.

You can even see this in various films. A child on a farm grows a personal connection to a farm animal while the adults working the farm never do. When it comes time for slaughter, the child is thoroughly traumatized by the notion of killing something they are personally connected to.

The line in the sand between ""killable"" and ""unkillable"" animals most likely revolves around that connection. You can argue that killing animals is unethical *regardless* of such a connection but I feel that it explains the *behavior* that you are referring to.

----

But as I mentioned earlier, I misunderstood what you were looking for and instead presented an argument for why breeding, killing and eating chickens is not *inherently* unethical. So... sorry for going down the wrong rabbit trail. :)"	2	False

If you show, for example, than vegans are killing rodents and insects through grain production, and are not spending their entire lives living in the jungle foraging, then they must be hypocrites and you can dismiss whatever they are saying. Then you can eat mammals like pigs and cows, or birds like chickens or turkeys, or fish, all which have brains and central nervous systems more developed than insects or rodents. Or you can excuse the fact that the above animals require more plant food, and thus more insects and rodents are killed. 

It's not practical to go live in the forest and forage. I probably have more of an effect by living within society and working to become a vegan or animal rights activist, than I do if I lived in the forest and started foraging for food (or even if I killed myself, which I'm assuming will be the next thing you suggest). The definition of veganism according to the vegan society is, 

&gt; a way of living which seeks to exclude, **as far as is possible and practicable**, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.

But feel free to enjoy living out your ideals as a forager if that is how you believe it is possible for you to live your best and most ethical life. "	1	False

I will agree that the UN have historically been ineffective, but from what I can tell, the UN is built to be as neutral/""bashful"" as possible. China and Russia having veto power exemplifies that. This issue is fundamental and global, however. China is a major manufacturing centre and I'm sure that we could negotiate our way into including China in the project. Russia would be a tougher sell, but anything is better than more destruction and radicalization even to them. Putin's strategy with Chechnya hasn't necessarily quelled the extremism there and the government in power is still highly oppressive. In terms of crimes committed by UN members, I am also aware of those issues, and that rectifying those criticisms would be something that would also have to be ingrained in the culture of the project. We'd need significant levels of oversight and education for all of those involved from management to the communities affected.

I also agree that it is difficult to sell the idea to the US, EU and UN that these new facilities may be used in an oppressive manner. We would need to leave social values completely out of it as much as possible, as difficult as that might be for us. I'm not sure how we'd get past these fundamental issues, but I'm of the belief that people and communities are good, unless they are paralyzed by fear and oppression. We have spent so long fighting that the road to a viable solution is narrower and narrower. 

I'm aware of the broken window fallacy, but I'm approaching it with the hope that the destruction of sites would be relatively minimal. I doubt the impact of *re-*building on the economy would be very large. I simply meant that spending on building materials would increase, but I wouldn't be able to say how much, and to me it doesn't really matter. The end goal is the same. Personally, I'd much rather know that instead of throwing money into a pit to pay for bombs, we were throwing money at trying to build something new. 

I just keep going through scenarios in my head that might lead somewhere positive, and I just don't see it without a concentrated global effort led by all members of the UN Security Council to actually flex their muscles for the first time and do something about it. The alternative is more war, drone strikes, and loss of servicemen which leads to further extremism and alienation of those at risk. Blaming Islam or Muslims or this person or that person for this situation gets us nowhere, and historically speaking, war only makes the ideology more appealing. The only other option really is to leave them completely and utterly alone and wait for the people to sort it out for themselves, but we can't do that because ISIS' ideology is to provoke Western nations into an apocalyptic war in the Middle East at whatever cost is necessary. They won't stop if we stop. I imagine a generation of young Arabs growing up in this type of massive-scale project, through any strife it may experience, would be a more beneficial outcome and breed a hatred of extremism moreso than to go on the offensive, no matter how tactical we might be."	0	False

You want to know exactly what information is conveyed when someone tells you that she is “transgender.” As you stated, it says nothing about the person’s anatomy (which relates to sex), and it doesn’t seem to directly reference her gender roles, or how her behavior lines up with societal expectations for men and women. A trans person can identify as a man, but still have female anatomy and act like a woman, according to traditional gender roles.
Rather than being about sex or gender roles, saying that one is “trans” is a statement about gender identity. In other words, it is a statement about how she feels, and it gives you information about how they might react to certain stimuli, such as being called “sir,” or ma’am. 
Because it is an issue of identity, we can compare it to names. Let’s pretend my name is Martha. I identify as Martha. I am not intrinsically Martha; you can’t examine my body with a microscope and learn that my name is Martha. Martha is the name that some people (my parents) started calling me one day, and, well, it just sort of caught on.
So when I tell you that my name is Martha, I am saying several things. First, I am telling you that I prefer to be called Martha, and from there you might suppose that I would not like to be called “Harold.” I am also saying that people who know me think of me as Martha. Finally, and this is important, I am letting you know that you can reasonably expect me to do things that someone named “Martha,” might do. This is where names and gender identity intersect: you can expect someone named Martha to wear dresses and have longer hair than someone named Harold.
Now, as Martha, I might have short hair of course, and I might hate wearing dresses. But if the only thing you knew about me was my name, I wouldn’t blame you for having those expectations, as long as you didn’t judge me if I failed to meet them.
So when a trans person tells you he identifies as a man, he does, in fact, convey information. He reveals a part of his mind to you, what he thinks of himself, and how he believes he ought to be thought of. And from that, you can guess how he might respond to certain stimuli. You now know that he may be offended if you saw him and said, “hey, you probably love that show, “glee,” because in his mind, you should not expect him to fit female gender roles, even if he does happen to like the show.

There is more to be said about what it really means to be transgender, but I think it is clear that declaring oneself to be transgender DOES convey useful, psychological information."	179	False

Political tolerability and dignity are I think good answers.  I think stability goes alongside political tolerability - welfare is always a political football and is subject to unpredictable sudden changes, and chaos of that type is always a net negative when people are trying to plan their lives and careers.

Also, welfare tends to get saddled with all kinds of moralistic concerns and social engineering, like people saying we need to drug test everyone on welfare or don't let them spend food stamps on nice foods or welfare is incentivizing single mothers to have more kids for support checks or etc.  Debates on the minimum wage tend to stay economic and not devolve into these types of social engineering concerns.

Finally, I think there may be some benefit in effectively having two separate prices floors - life on welfare is a little worse than life on minimum  wage, they're not set to the exact same payout - so that there's still some incentive for people to want to move from welfare to minimum wage. This helps to ensure that the best candidates from the pool of welfare recipients still try to apply for minimum wage jobs.  

If we just raised welfare up to the current minimum wage, the incentive for people to go after jobs that pay welfare +$.01 would be fairly weak, so there might not be much competition to get those jobs and therefore the best workers among the welfare recipients might not apply for them.

Another way of looking at it: the gap between the standard of living on welfare and the standard of living on minimum wage, makes up for the difference in standard of living due to increased luxury time on welfare vs. actually having to get a job and go to work, preventing perverse incentives to stay on welfare even if you could get a job that pays welfare + $.01.

Where is the reciprocity in that? If there is none, then this is not ethics/morality, just a personal, emotional whim.

&gt;Morality can only work between comparable equals that can share values. Our values are not the values of a shark, or a cow, or a herring. Why should we impose human morality on an animal? Why not assume its values instead?

This simply isn't the case. In ethics, we make an important distinction between moral agents and moral patients.

Generally we take moral agents to be those who are (a) capable of rationally deliberating on moral reason, (b) capable of acting on that moral reasoning, and (c) morally culpable for their (in)action with regards to their various moral responsibilities. You are right to say that we hold very important moral obligations towards ourselves and other moral agents in virtue of their and our moral faculties -- that is, in virtue of our mutual moral agency.

However, that very clearly isn't the extent of our moral obligations. It is generally considered the case that children, for instance, aren't full moral agents in the same way we take grown adults to be; there is a deficiency in moral reasoning as a result of their not being fully mentally developed that we take to be morally excusable of certain behavior. For example, we don't punish or hold an infant fully morally responsible for carelessness around a candle that sets a house on fire; at least, not to the extent that we hold a rational and reasonable adult responsible.

However, even though infants (and we might also include the sufficiently disabled in this category) aren't moral *agents*, it would contradict many of our intuitions and moral reasoning to say that we don't hold significant moral duties towards these individuals. We not only hold negative responsibilities towards these sorts of individuals (e.g. we cannot go around hitting infants or the disabled), we hold positive responsibilities towards them precisely because they aren't as morally culpable as full moral agents (e.g. duties of care towards infants). Hence, we call them moral patients. Since we all hold these sorts of duties towards *all* ethically-relevant individuals, we can also say that all moral agents are moral patients, but not all moral patients are moral agents. Generally we say that the distinction lies somewhere in the lack of one of the criteria (a), (b), or (c) I described above, which would disqualify one from being a moral agent.

We also have good reason to believe that the status of moral patient extends to certain non-human objects, including animals. It seems to be the case empirically that animals can experience suffering, for instance. It is a common ethical principle that we (i.e. moral agents) have a responsibility to prevent or stop suffering when the suffering is (1) unnecessary and (2) in our capacity to prevent or end. As a result, we generally extend this principle to all beings -- not just humans -- that can suffer. It's why we don't abuse dogs, for instance! One could plausibly make the argument that animals don't ""suffer"" in the same ways we afford to other humans (whether agents or not), but because we can observe clear avoidance of suffering among the relevant animals, we generally say that in a position of uncertainty we ought to take the position that has the least chance of moral wrongness -- in this case, if we say that there is even a chance that animals can suffer, it is morally preferable to take the position and act in such a way that they do.

The argument for not eating meat provided in the OP is generally structured in the same way:

1. We ought to prevent or end suffering when the suffering is unnecessary or preventable

2. The production and consumption of meat results in suffering of creatures apparently capable of suffering

3. Certain people have the ability and access to resources that results in this suffering being both unnecessary and preventable.

C. The people described in 3. therefore have a moral responsibility to prevent the suffering described in 2.

My point here being that simply because the animals in question aren't themselves moral agents, moral reasoning suggests that moral agents hold at least some responsibilities towards them in virtue of these creatures being moral patients in the same way we hold other non-agential humans to be. It isn't enough to appeal to their non-humanity since the arguments that apply to human moral patients apply to non-human moral patients.

&gt;Nature is a constant slaughter of blood, murder, spilled guts, and creatures being eaten alive as they shriek in immense pain. We are simply more efficient omnivores than the rest, but this does not make us ""evil"" by nature's standards. As tautological as it sounds, if killing and carnivorous diet were ""wrong"" by nature's standards, they would have been evolved away and towards more symbiotic relationship.

In ethics there is a fundamentally important distinction between is and ought. The mere existence of suffering as an empirical fact of nature doesn't suddenly mean we don't hold responsibilities to prevent it (in fact, it seems to be the very condition that forces these obligations upon us. How could we hold responsibilities to not murder if murder wasn't an empirical fact of the world?).  In fact, there is an abundance of natural facts that directly contradict our various moral duties -- duties that I hope you very much abide by!"	62	False

It’s because the vast majority of people in history have been religious (and for that matter, still are). It is a very recent development that any country is majority non-religious.

I bet the most intelligent and creative people of the past likely found the popular preachers of their day to be insufferable as well. Highly intelligent and creative people often find the things that appeal to the masses to be dull and uninteresting.

I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s part of what motivates religious artists to reimagine their religious beliefs in their own way. The Sistine Chapel, for instance, was reviled by many religious people of its day for its glorification of the human form. Michelangelo’s art was a way for him to critique and subvert the puritanical views of such leaders. His creativity was thoroughly informed by his theological disagreements with the establishment. Dante’s Inferno is an another excellent example of an artistic work that expresses religious conviction while simultaneously subverting and attacking the ‘traditional’ religious beliefs of its day.

I suspect that your difficulty may be in imagining intelligent and creative people calmly listening to drivel without objection. History agrees - they didn’t sit calmly! They rebelled, undermined, reinterpreted and shattered paradigms. But they were still religious, and their creativity inexorably tied to that religious conviction."	1	False

Let's take Carter as an example. Carter was in training for or on active duty in the Navy (a government job) from 1943 to 1953, and continued to serve in the Navy Reserve until 1961. His political career before becoming President started  in 1963, and he continued being primarily a politician for that entire period. In comparison, Carter only actively ran his peanut business as his primary job between 1953 and 1963, for a period of about 10 years. The bulk of his work was for the government, not in business.

Also, Reagan seems incorrectly classified as well. He was not a businessman and never really ran a business. He was an actor. He had been a politician for over a decade before becoming president. Carter was clearly more of a businessman than him, so you should probably count the 1980 election as one ""won by the candidate of lesser business experience."""	2	False

In that case then would a slow elimination of the system not work? Most people who seriously consider eliminating police forces entirely, seem to agree that reform in other places is first necessary. Affordable housing, more social security nets, decriminalization of drugs, etc. As things get better we can slowly rollback the amount of officers and the powers they hold. I don’t personally subscribe to these ideas but it seems to me that there’s no inherent flaw. Once enough has changed to eliminate the incentive/demand for crime perhaps self policing could work. It wouldn’t make your idea the only idea.

&gt;Instead, letting employers decide if a person is qualified. (As they already do)

The function colleges serve now works like this

1. College puts students through a regimen of ""arbitrary requirements""

2. Graduates go on to work jobs

3. Businesses assess the performance of those graduates

4. The results of (3) cycle around and the school gains a reputation for its regimen corresponding to good (or bad) performance

Thus, the degree itself may symbolize ""arbitrary"" requirements, but those ""arbitrary"" requirements form a regimen that filters out students of various types. When a college has a good reputation, it's because their filter has been found by employers to correlate well to the qualities they desire in a candidate. Employers like this system because it allows them to have information about how the student performs under a certain regimen which they regard as a mostly trustworthy indicator of performance. They have access to this information at the resume stage, so they don't have to spend that much more time figuring out how qualified the person is *on the job* and instead can make use of the university filtering system as a rough heuristic.

&gt;Colleges should return to their roots, for the sake of creating a more educated populous.

Was this ever their root? I think they were mostly reserved for the betterment of a religious or beaurocratic aristocracy for millenia.

The lack of creativity with 3D is a fault with artists, not the medium. 

3D animation is arguably lacking in maturity, unlike 2D, which has had many decades already to explore every nook and cranny of how to maximise use of creative space. This is not the fault of 3D animation either, but a circumstantial fact.

This is a tricky specific example to deal with because - as you say - the show is quite evidently anti capitalist in its theme and story quite separately from what the author said. 

However, that said, I think you're putting too little weight on authorial intent here. 

And to deal with why I think that, we need to first define what it would mean for the work to be 'anti capitalist.' As we're on a literary theme, let's do this by telling a story. 

&gt;There is a war. It is a total war - tanks roll through ravaged city streets and terrified citizens huddle in the meagre shelter the remaining rubble provides. A boy - only 12 or 13 and malnourished - watches as a row of enemy armoured vehicles trundles down a road in front of him. He is angry. He is sad. He is lonely. He is frightened. He picks up a rock from the street and throws it with all of his might at one of the vehicles. It clangs harmlessly off the side, and the soldiers sitting on top of the vehicle don't even look his way.

There's my story. I hope you liked it. 

Now, let's consider the boy's action. Was the boy's action *an attack on the armoured vehicle*? It certainly wasn't effective. The soldiers didn't even seem to notice it. To all intents and purposes, only the boy was aware of what he was doing and why. But, given all that, was his action an attack?

I think it was, because intent matters. And intent matters independent of effect. And the author's intent is important in assessing the effect of a work because whether they achieved their goals is part of that assessment. 

Now, consider three scenarios:

1. Squid Game was intended to be written as anti capitalist but obviously fails
2. Squid Game was intended to be written as pro capitalist but obviously fails
3. Squid Game was intended to be written as anti capitalist and obviously succeeds

The critical assessment of the work, although each of these works are in some way 'anti capitalist' will be different. The analysis will vary, the perspectives gained through those analyses will vary. 

And, if we take scenario 1 above (which, to be clear I don't think is actually the case) the proper assessment of this work would be: The author intended to write an anti capitalist piece and unintentionally wrote something that did x, y and z. **Not** that Squid Game is pro-communist or some such thing, but a more nuanced assessment."	5	False

Saying ""He was black"" as a sole descriptor isn't considered racist. Saying ""darkie"" is, because regardless of my actual thoughts regarding black people, it is a racial comment that will be perceived offensively, and I knew that before saying it. We would pretty much absolve someone of being labeled ""racist"" if they were a rare person that legit had no idea that saying ""darkie"" could in any way be offensive, but all we see as an outside observer is a kid calling another kid a racial epithet, so it is automatically racist.

&gt;Are you saying that blackface in and of itself is not racist, but using it despite the knowledge that some black people will associate it with minstrel shows is?

Basically yes. At this point, blackface is inextricably linked with minstrel shows which were racist by definition. This creates an inherent link between racism and blackface whether the person putting on blackface intended it to be racist or not.

What this means is regardless of the intent of the wearer, any black person that sees this will automatically feel offense. The wearer may have no racist intent whatsoever but it is highly likely that they know how this will be perceived. They know it will hurt their black friends and any black person that looks on it. 

They can disagree with the logic behind it all they want, but choosing to put on the blackface for the purposes of preserving a costume when they know it will deeply hurt and offend others to their core does fit the definition of racism. The idea of a white person thinking their costume looking good is more important than the feelings of any and all black people that may look at the costume is racist."	6	False

I should also point out that *what to do* with moral agents that are guilty (culpable) of something is quite a different matter than whether they are guilty (culpable).

I've also found a baby monitor helpful when grandparents babysat. They worried they couldn't hear the baby, so they had the monitor on super loud.

&gt;*Mallory, education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces.The competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries.*

I agree!

&gt;*Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. That's my position. I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.*

I don't agree :(

To get what Sam wants, the Governments (eventually) needs to get out of education completely. Only the free market on a level playing field that can afford to give us the education system we need and really want.

Take Khan Academy, a super inexpensive education tool and Khan himself, a fantastic teacher. Such people would be superstars conceivably making *ten* figure salaries with students in the millions - if parents had a choice.

Some privately funded Universities do very well - consider Caltech, one of the best of the best, which is almost wholly run on private donations from alumni and bequeathments. But imagine how much better and bigger it could have got in a free market environment. Even Google sized. But in general, unless they are really superlative like Caltech, fully private universities can not survive in an environment where competitors live or die based on government funding.

It's in the market's best interest (and remember, all of *us* are the market) to have the best educated public possible. Businesses don't do it because the government has a practical monopoly over the field - disincentivising the will to create better education systems and courses. You can't profit (and profit your customers/students) when the government has a stranglehold on your customers!

The first step to changing your view is to simply accept you're wrong about this. I used to get annoyed at people who claim they have difficulty gaining weight. ""What?"" I thought. ""But I gain weight effortlessly. Usually when I don't even want to. All I have to do is eat tasty food and the weight piles on. Why don't they just eat? All of them are stupid/lazy/weak/liars/whingers."" Then I learned that no, just because my experience with food is the opposite of theirs doesn't invalidate their own perspectives. I think it's likely that most people are on my side of the spectrum, and have a much easier time gaining weight than losing it. But if someone says they have to exert a gargantuan effort to gain 15 pounds, and easily lose all of it unless they remain vigilant? I can simultaneously believe them and also realize that I will never share that experience, simply because we have different genetic makeups/metabolisms/brains. 

Second, the way you're looking at this issue just seems logically absurd to me. Over the last several decades, the obesity rate has more than doubled in the US and I'm guessing other Western countries have had similar, if not identical, leaps. I'm assuming you have at least a middle schooler's education in evolution and natural selection. Human willpower has not changed in that time frame. Nor has society changed such that we now celebrate obesity whereas we used to abhor it in the 1960s--it's been similarly detested in both time periods, and even moreso now if anything. But the way you talk about the issue, it's as if you think millions of people have randomly come together in a concerted effort to gain all this weight even though they have no external motivation to do so. Perhaps you think they're all masochists who want increased health problems, higher food bills, and to be less sexually attractive. Since human willpower has not changed at all in the past 5 decades, wouldn't it make more sense to look at some of the factors that *have* changed in that same time frame? Your argument that obese people are weak and lazy would need some solid evidence that in the 1960s people suddenly started having babies who were uniquely unable to control their food intake. This would be an extraordinarily difficult position to support in any debate. On the other hand it's easy explain the obesity epidemic if you look at food surpluses and government subsidies that were created in the 1970s shortly before the obesity rate started to rapidly climb. If you look at it that from that perspective, you'll realize that any generation of humans would have succumbed to obesity had they been exposed to the same factors, after all, we all have roughly the same genes. So, maybe you should change your position to ""all humans ever have been lazy""--and maybe that's a defensible position. Wouldn't we all like to just wake up and start doing productive work until we fall back asleep without needing to relax and veg out for a while? But calling obese lazy doesn't explain the issue, doesn't help them lose weight, and ironically is a lazy way to describe a phenomenon that is quite complex. Every respected obesity researcher in the Western world has stopped looking at obesity as a willpower issue and I think that you should too.

Third, it's cool how you've gained so much self-esteem from losing weight, but it all seems a little arbitrary. You've decided that since you lost 60 pounds, anyone who can't do so is lazy. You've made yourself the baseline standard. But what if someone who was 8% body fat told you you were lazy for being 14% body fat? Let's face it, you're a total lardass compared to some of those gym rats. And everyone knows girls find guys with eight-packs attractive, right? You can't have an eight-pack if you're stuck at 184lbs. Maybe if you weren't so weak you could have an eight-pack too. Moreover, if you weren't a lazy, worthless person, would you have ever gotten obese in the first place? The people who *actually* have willpower have been lean their whole lives, don't they deserve some credit for never fattening themselves up like farm animals in the first place, like you did? And what's with this /r/keto nonsense? Are you scared you'll get fat again if you start eating carbs like a normal person? If you weren't so *weak* maybe you could eat bread without becoming obese again. And anyway what good is weight loss if you can't bench 315 pounds? Why are you bragging about your pathetic body if you can't even squat 4 plates on each side of the bar? Stop bragging until you've stopped being so *weak*. I hope I've made my point. The way you describe anyone fatter than you (and that's essentially what you're doing, since many people who are 184 pounds or heavier would be considered overweight or obese) as weak and lazy seems like a thinly-veiled attempt to boost your own ego. But the cutoff marks you've created are totally arbitrary and suspiciously tailored to make *you* seem non-lazy. It's bad rhetoric and shouldn't have any place in your mature worldview. 

Fourth, you're mistakenly viewing obesity as a benign disease, and you're viewing the human body as a cold machine that doesn't have hormones or an epigenome or feelings. If losing weight were as easy as counting calories, everyone would do it. But it's not that easy, and that's why so many people are fat, and it's why it's still remarkable to encounter someone who has lost a lot of weight, such as yourself. Thanks to millions of years of evolution, the human brain is a lot better at gaining weight than it is at losing weight. There are so many hormones and neuronal pathways at play that make losing weight hard: insulin, leptin, dopamine, serotonin, endogenous opioids, ghrelin, peptide YY, triiodothyronine and thyroxine, and the list goes on. For a quick example, losing just 3% of your body fat is enough to make your leptin levels plummet by 75%, which makes your body disproportionately hungry compared to the actual calorie deficit that it's been subjected to. It's great that you were able to overcome your brain's attempts to ramp up your appetite in response to weight loss, but that doesn't mean everyone has it as easy as you, and it's unfair for you to invalidate the way *they* feel when they attempt to lose weight by calling them merely lazy and weak without considering whether it may genuinely be harder for them to deal with a calorie deficit. The list of people who struggle with weight loss include some of the smartest of the smart and the most accomplished of the accomplished, so it just doesn't make sense to write away the entire epidemic of obesity as an epidemic of laziness. Furthermore, weight loss after obesity has long-term effects on the body, which is why I said earlier that obesity is not just a benign disorder of fat storage. According to various studies, the metabolisms of people who have lost weight remain slower indefinitely, meaning it will always be harder for them to maintain their new weights than a person of the same weight who was never heavier. Is it really fair to compare those two people and call the first one lazy if they happen to regain the weight? I don't think so, especially considering that more than 95% of people who lose significant weight end up regaining all of it and more within 3 years. At what point do we stop and think that maybe all this gaining weight business can't be reduced down to a ""choice""? 

Finally, calling it a choice is *extremely* disingenuous. No one becomes obese or stays that way because of a singular choice. Again, you're using bad rhetoric. Even if we were to concede that obesity is a choice, it would really be more like *hundreds of thousands* of choices that lead to the final result. There's an interesting study that asked people how many choices related to food that they made in a day. I think the average participant answered something like 12 or 20 choices, but in reality, we make hundreds of such choices every single day, and for the most part we aren't conscious of them. That's possibly one reason why most psychologists agree that increased self-awareness should be the primary step in successful weight loss. But point is, if someone gains 50 pounds in two years and becomes obese, they haven't made one choice, they have made at the very least (730 x 300) = *219,000* food-related choices, most of them unconscious by necessity (I doubt anyone wants to spend precious brainpower making all those food decisions when they could be doing more important things like doing a good job at work or watching and enjoying TV). Calling obesity a choice is disingenuous for another reason, because none of us really chose to live in the society we do. I think you'd agree that it'd be damn hard to quit smoking if we were surrounded by a constant flurry of cheap cigarettes with little tax, advertisements of said cigarettes designed to hit us right in the reward center, vendors of cigarettes with huge signs and the audacity to waft the smell of cigarettes onto the streets, and if we lived in a culture in which pretty much everyone smoked cigarettes every day. Instead, if someone wants to quit smoking cigarettes, they may have to give up watching Mad Men and going to certain gas stations but overall it's not too difficult to avoid the majority of cues for cigarette smoking that society has planted on us.

You're being fairly general here. So I can't actually answer your question, your also diverging from the argument.

Like I said, murders etc, are different cases. But no, because people living in a surrounding area, deserve to know about current events and the sorts of happenings. That being said, I would expect the family to know about this before hand, rather than learning through a news report.

&gt;The economy is zero sum over a set period of time. While wealth can be created, after a period of time, only a certain amount will have been. Between Jan 1st 2010 and Dec 31st 2010 a finite amount of wealth was created. If you examine how that wealth distributed, it is absolutely zero sum.

""Non-zero sum"" does not mean ""infinite."" It does not mean that everyone is always as well off as they could possibly be. It means that it is possible for one person to improve their welfare without decreasing someone else's welfare a commensurate amount. 

&gt;2) Many of our job positions are explicitly zero sum by design. Low skill workers are paid based on the supply of low skill workers. The wealth they generate has no impact on the amount of wealth they earn. They are participating in wealth creation as supported by the theory, but for intents and purposes their personal ""economy"" is a zero sum game; a flat return regardless of what was produced.
3) It ignores that most people are already working to generate wealth, and that many factors go into whether it can be created at that time. Growth across an economy is fairly consistent in regards to wealth generation, and economic mobility rarely comes from extra productivity within a job. Instead nearly universally the answer is to do something else with a lower supply of worker, and NOT to produce more wealth at your current task. http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp[2]
4) It glosses over that a majority of people are not self employed and do not own their means of production in modern society. In the example above for instance, he suggests training an ox to produce more grain instead of farming manually. However, this required a premise upfront that we each ""own our own farm,"" and also assumed the ox trainer keeps all generated wealth. In the real world, the worker is incredibly unlikely to own the means of production, and still receives compensation explicitly based off the supply of other workers, and not at all based off how much grain he is producing. This line of reasoning breaks down as soon as you apply it anywhere else. No fast food employee is going to be allowed to buy a machine to replace him and still collect the wage. They will just be fired.

""Non-zero sum"" does not have anything to do with the distribution of wealth. It does not mean that everyone gains equally from economic growth. It does not mean returns to capital are distributed equally throughout society. Again, all it means is that it is possible for one person to gain a certain amount without someone else losing an equal amount. 

The amount of wealth generated in a given year is finite, but is not fixed. If the government said that it would tax all income at 100% and give it all to Bill Gates, then people would stop working and the amount of wealth generated would be less. If the government taxes Bill Gates $1 billion dollars and invests in an infrastructure that helps generate $2 billion of wealth, society is $1 billion better off. 

The number of jobs in the economy is not fixed. If the economy creates 200,000 new jobs, it does not mean that 200,000 other people lost their jobs. If an immigrants moves to a country to get a job, they are not necessarily taking a job from someone already there. Unemployment would not be solved if we just forced a bunch of people to leave the country.


These are not just theoretical arguments. Would you deny that is possible for one set of policies to be better, on average, for society than another set of policies? "	5	False

I appreciate your reply, but I tried my best to avoid emotionally-charged language the OP. I'm not saying anyone will be upset about anything.


&gt; Being accepting of social deviations means that you are also in favor of the concept of ""social deviation"" being undermined or weakened. It's the same goal

This is an interesting perspective and I'll award a !delta just for it. But I think it still raises a slight problem.
In the OP I gave the example of a society where 20% of the population consists of dark-skinned individuals and 80% is pale-skinned. This is just for the sake of argument.
Over time, if the society is highly pluralistic, it's reasonable to think that there will be fewer dark-skinned people because if we randomly combine the genes of the different phenotypic groups, the traits of the majority would be represented more than minority traits would.
This in and of itself isn't an issue but for the minority group in question, do you think they would be justified in being sceptical of the pluralistic ideal, in order to preserve their identity?


Take note: I'm trying to be very careful about how I word things. I'm *not* trying to argue that pluralism is bad. That's not what the OP is about at  all. All I'm looking for is a way to make the idea more consistent with the idea of diversity. For example, I personally value cultural diversity for one reason - multiple ways of thinking and acting serve as a sort of overall balance. If every culture was the same, humanity could be in for a serious case of tunnel vision.
Race (as I defined it) is somewhat tangential to the matter but I included it since race tends to be combined with culture into the single label of 'ethnicity'."	1	False

No kids, no getting married, no starting a new business venture, etc etc. A simple direct file would suit them perfectly, and their tax documents could be mailed to them by the IRS pre-prepared, and they would only have to manually file if anything changed.

The reason why this can't be done is because private tax preparation firms like HR Block lobbied extensively to put ""non compete"" laws in place to forbid the federal government from ""eliminating private sector jobs"" by ""providing such an expensive service for free"".

This is especially heinous because the majority of money made by tax collecting firms comes from their top 1-5% of customers, who would still be using their service even if the common folk got automatic filing done for them by the fed, so they wouldn't lose any substantial business from it.

The Yougov poll was also incredibly disingenuous. Many ""foreign way of doing things"" asked about increases to government authority and regulation. As with any other opinion poll, phrasing is everything. If you asked people if they wanted a simple file pre-prepared by the fed and only required action by them if they needed to change information due to getting married or having a kid or moving house, I would wager most of them would have voted in favor of it. The question as written suggests taking the tax preparation entirely out of the hands of the common man, and the common man does not understand that their annual tax refund is not actually ""new"" money to them but a portion of money they have overpaid to the government in taxes, so they see that as a net loss."	18	False

Now I'm not a neuropsychologist or doctor, so I might be wrong, but I think what you're seeing in the art style of MLP as well as anime is that it triggers the release of the hormone Oxytocin in the viewers. At a primal level, due to various social and developmental factors of the viewer culture, it just makes the viewer want to give the characters a big hug. It doesn't induce arousal except in some specific circles of the fandom, it just induces the urge to cuddle. Which are two very different things! Remember that young children feel the urge to cuddle long before they hit puberty and experience the effects of sex hormones. 

This might explain the weird bonding behavior you see in bronies, but I ask if it's really anything truly harmful. From where I stand, we need more bonding and tenderness in the world. Every fandom has its obsessed fans and perverts, as people have noted many times in this thread already, but I've always found the upper percentage of the brony community to be particularly well-behaved and good-hearted compared to most other fandoms. I mean, how often do you see so many people who are honestly and truly serious about ""love and tolerate""? Outside of the gay rights movements, anyway. :P

As for overly-obsessed fans, I'm pretty sure they only act that way because the brony fandom exists to back them up and collectively fight for them if they're ridiculed. If there was no mainstream brony fandom, they'd keep their appreciation of the show hidden and toned-down in public. So really, I don't think they're doing it to appease some sense of obsession, but just because it's cool! Getting a tattoo or keeping a few MLP figurines on a shelf is about the same as keeping a miniature Tardis or having some desktop wallpapers of shows you like. It's just there to provide some everyday inspiration for your life, as well as some social bonuses if they happened to be spotted by other fans, which I find to be completely understandable. 

The reason the mental restraint doesn't kick in as much when speaking about MLP in public is either because they're trying to advertize the fandom and invite more members, or just because they don't need to because it's socially acceptable in certain circles. It's kinda like seeing a cute kid and wanting to give them a hug and mess up their hair. If you do it to a random kid in public, you're a creepy pervert, obviously. But if you're at a family reunion and the kid is your cousin or nephew, that's very socially acceptable.

Now, I'm not really into MLP myself, but I'm pretty big on Pokémon. I always laugh when people bring up how crazy unexpected the brony fandom was, that adults would like something meant for kids so much, because *all of this already happened back in the 2000's* with Pokémon. Cutesy and simple series originally meant for kids? Check. Ballooned into a global pop culture phenomenon? Check. Spawned countless new circles of geek culture? Check. Taken way too seriously by adults? Check. Heavily abused and sexualized by the weird perverted corners of the internet? *Whoooooooooo boy*, check. For all intents and purposes, Bronies are the 2010's version of the Pokémon fandom.

And I bring this up because it kinda plays into why MLP makes you feel uncomfortable with the weird sense of bonding to the characters. Because that's the core reason Pokémon got so popular, too. It's not because the original Game Boy games were any good. They were pretty glitchy and unbalanced and the gameplay was actually quite terrible. And it's not because the show was any good. Its first two seasons were okay, I guess, but after that it's pretty much up there with Barney and Friends. So why did it become popular? Well, because of the Pokémon themselves. That Pikachu that followed you around in Pokémon Yellow really started to feel like a close friend and companion. You really wanted to give your Charizard a big hug after he delivers the final blow for you in the championship. You really feel driven to capture more and more monsters because you want to befriend them, too. Especially the legendary Pokémon! Can you imagine the joy the player feels when the god of the oceans, or the god of time, or the god of darkness comes down from the heavens and chooses to be your personal lifelong companion, promising to protect you and only you from your foes? Much Oxytocin and feels are to be had. 

So I ask again, is that really such a bad thing, if a fictional universe and the characters within make you say ""awwww""? Because from where I stand, it is actually more touching and motivational and inspirational than anything else."	4	False

The trailer made the Clinton-esque reference to ""HER"" turned into HERO.  It's explicitly appealing to her gender as an important aspect of why the audience should see the movie.

&gt; I would make a statement that explains what the comparison was trying to achieve

seems like it would fall under my definition of being upset. I don't know how I could describe what appears to be an intentional attempt to discredit my art and character that wouldn't communicate me being upset. 

&gt;I would be upset with the people who are assuming things about me, (and probably complain about how disappointed I am in them as well) but not the comparison itself. **These two things are connected, yes, but separate, at least to me.**

The fact that they are connected can't be ignored. If you restrain yourself from being upset at the person making the comparison, you leave yourself to be taken advantage of by those who hide their deliberate attempts at discrediting you behind accurate comparisons delivered in a non-insulting way.

Simply mentioning the Hitler comparison could significantly harm one's ability to make a living off the art, not just because of the people who make inferences from the comparison, but from people who *don't* make that comparison but have to consider interacting and being judged by those who *do*. Even if I like the art and do not believe the artist is similar to Hitler, others who might see the art might believe it, making me less likely to buy the art, meaning the artist suffers.

It would require legislative action to mandate the conditions you've described to prevent the effect that I've described above.

I don't see a solution there. The market can't just take care of it because healthcare is not a product like other products, particularly in Canada. If the US market didn't exist I think you'd have a case for two tier healthcare in Ontario, but that's not how it is. US healthcare is just too massive to compete with in a private option in Ontario. Unless pricing is somehow cheaper in Ontario than the US (and I don't understand enough about healthcare pricing to explain how this could be but I'd welcome you to if you are an expert here).

I maintain, Canada has effective two tier health care in the US. There is no convincing plan that can make a domestic private option competitive and also prevent erosion of the public market. For one, the geographic realities of Canada mean privatization is unlikely to improve outcomes for non-urban citizens and the reality of urban citizens is that they are well and easily connected to the US market. So long as a large competitor exists to the south I continue to lack a reason why Canada should develop its own private market aside from a slight increase in convenience.

I realize this is your view to change but I invite you do to so or explain why the US is not a sufficiently good option for Ontarians to reduce strain on the public system.

In other situation such as people having seizure, heart attack, etc... A person can bump their head when falling, which can cause swelling, or damaged spine. Such person CANNOT BE MOVED safely even by experts, causing serious immediate and long term damage.

Again, this ties to case by case basis. In some situations providing first aid, even poor one is the best thing to do. But in some, it is horrible idea. Hence why police probably gaved it up entirely. In the law suit driven culture, its honestly expected a person is scared to do anything, than to do something. Which probably leads for entire departments to be expressively told when and when not to provide  first aid. In order to avoid law suits, etc...

If there's a small number (say, three), then you only need a small number of people in the right place and time to compromise not just a vote, but the entire system.

The way it works it that every node has a copy of the ledger.  In this model, each polling place would be a node, so there would be hundreds of copies of the ledger in existence.  There would be no way to corrupt every ledger in existance.

&gt;I have a different problem: who are these people? How are they chosen? I worry that this gets back to a ""trust us"" kind of argument (albeit a weaker one than the electronic systems we have now), especially since so few people even understand the technology, let alone how to verify their votes.

This is known as the [Byzantine Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance#Byzantine_Generals.27_Problem) problem and is _exactly_ what the distributed ledger is designed to solve.  The idea here is that it doesn't matter who they are.  If every polling place is a node and has a copy of the ledger, trust is achieved through consensus.  Any ledger that disagrees with the prevailing opinion is discarded as inaccurate.  Security is built into the design here.

&gt;If someone loses their card, how do we know that someone doesn't get to the polls and use it before they do?

That is what the biometrics and pin are for.  The card is useless without knowing the PIN and having the correct iris scan/fingerprint/etc.

&gt;And if it's lost, isn't their biometric information now considered permanently compromised?

It is stored and encrypted on the card itself, which can only be unlocked with the PIN.

&gt;As I've discussed with others in this thread, if there's any vulnerability in the source code detected by malicious attackers, they won't be nice and tell us they've found it, so the machines could still be compromised, no?

That is why the code is open source.  Anyone can evaluate it and point out potential security issues.  There are _many_ whitehat hackers out there that identify security issues for the sole goal of fixing them - with something as serious as an election, the whitehats would be out in full force.

&gt; if it's recorded incorrectly because of the above, wouldn't a malicious hacker be able to fake the vote (in some way- I'm not sure how) such that it's recorded as a vote for Jones rather than Williams, but shows that it's a vote for Williams, when verified by the voter?

No, because if it is recorded incorrectly you are aware at that time and ask that it be canceled.  The voter can verify it by looking at the blockchain, which is the official record of their vote; the information that the chain shows _is_ the information that is tallied.

I don't see how actually getting the wall built will AT ALL help convince them more.  The only way that they'd see the wall as ineffective is if they looked at numbers and statistics about how effective it is and the only people who are going to do that are the ""liberal media"" and the only thing they'll hear is Trump talking about how much of a resounding success the wall is.

Illegal Immigration is affected a lot by the economy, and the economic downturn caused by China Tariffs could easily lead to large reductions in the amount of illegal immigration that the wall will get credit for.

&gt; Maybe they have married themselves to him so much so that the outcome of this situation does not matter at all.

Except everyone will know whether or not the wall gets built.  Everyone hates the shutdown.  Trump claimed ownership of that shutdown.  And while there is much finger pointing on who is to blame, we have Trump's own words claiming ownership and Trump's inability to deliver his campaign promise is going to be detrimental to his 2020 campaign.

&gt; Trump appears hellbent on keeping the government closed as long as it takes.

Just because Trump is posturing to be more stubborn doesn't mean democrats should let him get what he wants.  You're ignoring a viable and beneficial to the democrats way out of this mess:  Congress could pass the budget WITHOUT Trump's approval by overriding the veto with a super majority.  Democrats don't have to outlast Trump, they just have to force the hand of enough republicans to get a super majority.  Democrats ALREADY have a number of republicans willing to pass a budget without the wall funding, which is how they were able to get the version of the budget bill without the wall passed in the first place.  They just need a handful more.

In this negotiation the republicans siding with Trump are in the weakest position in my opinion, and if they eventually fold that'll be a huge win for democrats because:

* They'll have bypassed Trump
* Trump's shutdown will have accomplished nothing
* They'll show that Trump is unable to work with either party"	5	False

Yeah, so that actually isn't illegal.

&gt;I'm not a lawyer and I don't want to debate what distinctions, if any, there are between speech, acts, and speech acts.

I actually am, and the distinction is kind of important because of the move you're about to make:

&gt;It's all expression.

Well, there's a huge problem here, because non-words can also be expressive. If we're going to say all words are inherently expressive, and also non-words can be on par with words, then we're going to get to literally everything is expressive. Murdering your neighbor, after all, expresses ""I hate you, Jim!"" So we do actually need a distinction.

But, the distinction is probably well beyond the scope of this discussion, which is why I wanted to narrow things down and just provide a list of specific sorts of things I think are rather non-controversial as needing protection.

&gt;The actual interesting question is: should spending on campaigns be regulated.

Okay, I agree, let's stick to that.

&gt;What tools? How will they help the little guy have his voice be heard by his representative? You didn't answer either of those questions.

So this is actually getting at something different from your question, because political speech and the right to petition are different. Related, but different. I think the issue of having everyone be equally *heard* by their representatives may just be insolvable, at least not solvable by a campaign finance law which protects the kind of speech I identified as needing protection. Someone will always have more influence on politicians, and it just happens that money lets people buy a seat at the table. It's not great, but it's maybe better than only getting heard if you volunteered for the campaign, or have a family connection. I'm going to jump off this issue though because we're getting more to the point in just a moment:

&gt;Anyway, my preferred solution is a hard limit (maybe $0) on all political advertisements X months before an election by anyone.

Can you define what you mean by ""advertisement""? And are you using my definition of political?

May the NYT publish a candidate endorsement?

May SNL satirize the President?

May Joe Rogan have a guest on his podcast and talk about the upcoming election?

I think you're definitely right insofar as time correlates to characteristics typically used as evidence in support of or against person-hood (brain development, CNS development, anatomical development, etc), but I think that is still one layer above what the point of involving time is: it is to ""bookmark"" what the characteristics of the organism typically are post-fertilization.

The crux of the debate, in my view, can be succinctly described as: ""If the organism is a person, no justification is adequate. If the organism is not a person, no justification is necessary.""

I would disagree with your naming time as the primary delineation because for individuals who argue that a zygote is a person, this effectively makes time a non-factor. Sure, I know technically this is ""drawing the line"" as you say ""at the beginning"", but this is the same as saying ""time doesn't matter"".

Similarly, for individuals who argue about what characteristics are indicative of person-hood, they are primarily concerned with the characteristics themselves, not the timeline over which they occur (though this is what current American law uses as a litmus test). While in the vast majority of cases these characteristics emerge on a standard timeline, there are instances where they occur at slightly different times, or not at all. The easy example would be a still-birth: it doesn't matter at what time it would be aborted, because no matter how long you wait, it will never exhibit characteristics of person-hood which are of chief concern."	1	False

I settled with this idea of God. There's an infinite amount of things that we could know and God exists beyond that infinity imo.

Anything could happen at any moment and a I look at the force behind those possibilities and name that God. Funnily enough when you do that it just so happens when you listen to religious people pray to God, it makes sense and you can relate.

&gt;So many of his ideas, such as accepting our deaths and accepting the meaningless of much of everyday existence, instead of being afraid of it seem to be the same as what I've seen in Eastern philosophy, only with a lot of terminology that doesn't add much value to the idea. 

And this:

&gt;Other ideas like authenticity as a reaction to our limited lifespan have become cliches.

They are just not true to what Heidegger thinks (the former is a mistake of similar themes for similar ideas, and the latter is not what he thinks really causes authenticity, or at least not that simply). But I also don't think they are the things that make Heidegger truly important:

(1) He undermines the western tradition of epistemology. He does this by showing how other modes of being (instrumentality) are ontologically prior to the subject/object dichotomy (a dichotomy that is created by what he calls making an object present-to-hand). He shows how a holistic view is the more accurate view when trying to get at the nature of things/the world/ capital-B Being. (He does the same with materialism/idealism.)

(2) The ideas such as ""authenticity"" and ""Being-towards-death"" are less important then his new conception of self, Dasein (Being-there). It's importance is that it situates us within the world in a way that is radically different than where egoists place us. It is one in which we are coextensive with the world and others, and one in which we are primarily and engager with the world 

(3) He lays the foundation for what are the strongest arguments against people who think our problems will be solved by technology in his book *The Question Concerning Technology*. His view of how technology is a tool that also forms us is unique and wonderful, even though I disagree with his conclusions.

(4) Part of his whole point is to try and shake our given ontology to its very core, and by doing so expose it. It is meant to be difficult. It is meant to expose new ways of ontologically being-in-the-world (he thinks that is what true thinking is). It being difficult could be interpreted as a virtue. It gets a little sappy and poetic, talking this way. But think about art (a topic he writes about). When we see an art piece twice it is sometimes the case that we something entirely new. It is this event that he is trying to expose as more than trivial.

(5) He makes every continental thinker easier to read.

&gt;I also have a significant skepticism of continental philosophy in general.

What are you skeptical about? Analytic philosophy went through a similar trajectory as continental philosophy in that they both failed to come up with a proper foundationalism. We have people like Rorty, Habermas, and Bernstein that show why this is so, and that both philosophies, in fact, shared quite a bit. To dismiss one is to dismiss the other.

But all things aren’t equal, and historical context matters when it comes to language and it’s development, especially when it comes to slurs and taboos.

“White” and “black” are not labels that have been used historically as derogatory terms, and by that I mean that these terms have not historically been used for almost solely derogatory reasons, or as common parlance for groups who spoke of these groups in almost solely derogatory ways. They’ve been used to draw distinctions between groups. Derogatory terms for those groups exist, but “white” and “black” aren’t them. As such, because they don’t carry the historical weight of being used as solely a derogatory term, they are generally acceptable.

I would say the same is true for “brown” in most places? I might be wrong on that, but I don’t think that was a widespread historical phenomenon.

“Red” and “yellow” however do have that historical context. 

“Yellow” as a term for East Asian people came from the Swedish taxonomist Carolus Linnaeus , who separated people into four continental “types”, with distinct colors assigned to each.  Later the German anatomist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach continued this in his “five race scheme”. Some anthropologists also tried to prove that Mongolians were literally yellow coloured in an attempt to claim racial superiority for white people. The term “yellow” has no visual or biological origins either. It was picked as a colour for East Asian people arbitrarily, and was used almost solely for the purpose of placing people from Asia in a lower racial category than white people from its inception.

Use of “red” or “redskin” is slightly different, and a number of historical sources indicate it was used by some Native Americans before European colonisers adopted it. So, it’s not inherently racist in origin. However, during the 1800s and 1900s it was adopted and used as an almost solely pejorative term by majority white Americans. This is one of the reasons that the Boston redskins team had backlash, they didn’t adopt the name until 1933, while it was being used mostly as a pejorative, they were originally the Boston braves.

So yeah, this is one of the reasons we generally hold a different idea about on the face of it, seemingly equal and fair naming schemes."	395	False

I will address a few points.

**But it's  huge tax cut and it favors the wealthy!**

The media has been playing it up, but for individual tax payers it actually is not a big change at all. Use [this calculator](http://time.com/5030046/how-would-the-senate-tax-bill-affect-you-find-out-with-this-simple-calculator/) to see the effect on different income levels. Basically, it's a very small cut for everyone. People earning $100K get about a $1400 break, or about $116 a month. People earning $50k get about a $650 break, or about $54 a month. It's a fair tax cut across all incomes and you probably won't even notice it. If anything, it will let people in the lower income levels save a bit more for retirement.

**But they're trying to tax graduate students to stop people from going to college!**

The one change that has been most controversial according to the NYTimes et al is the removal of the deduction that universities use to avoid paying taxes on scholarship money going to tuition. This has been exploited for years by rich private colleges like the ivy leagues to give them a break on their taxes – they just hand out free tuition to graduate students, which *is* income, but they never have to pay any of that income into the tax system.

If you or I were to pay our little nephew's college tuition to Harvard, that money would be taxed as income, so we would have to pay even more than the very high tuition bill is normally. But if Harvard's extremely well funded endowment pays out tuition money as a scholarship, they can do so tax free. That allows Harvard to grow their endowments even more. They are not contributing their fair share to the tax system."	76	True

Here are a couple of excerpts in favour of the ""shut it down"" viewpoint (it's easy to apply this to pandemic misinformation as well):

&gt; In an ideal world, every time a piece of Holocaust denial was posted in /r/History, a dozen learned scholars would immediately pounce and tear their ""argument"" apart point by point. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen. A lot of their ""arguments"" are constructed in a way that they seem very plausible, which means that often it indeed takes someone with above average knowledge about this particular subject to debunk them. With a userbase as large as ours this also means that we can't reasonably expect everyone to have that knowledge yet. Which in return means that sadly we too often see that it takes a while before Holocaust denial does receive the pushback it deserves, at which point the damage already has been done and the false information has been seeded into the minds of people less knowledgeable about the subject.

&gt; Even worse, often enough we see it getting upvoted as well before receiving any pushback, giving it an even greater impression of legitimacy, which in turn means that they get even more exposure. These upvotes originate from a variety of sources; outside brigades trying to push the subject, the earlier mentioned ignorance on a subject and reasons we don't understand ourselves (on a userbase of millions you will always have the group of people that for some reason seem to look for the contrarian view no matter if it is true or not).  
  
   
  
&gt; Not ignoring the deniers does not mean engaging them in discussion or debate. In fact, it means not doing that. We cannot debate them for two reasons, one strategic and the other tactical. As we have repeatedly seen, the deniers long to be considered the ""other"" side. Engaging them in discussion makes them exactly that. Second, they are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall.

Of course, that one's harder to apply to pandemic misinformation, because a lot of it is actually good-intentioned, and not contemptuous, [as I explain here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pacb4n/cmv_anyone_who_said_they_were_waiting_for_fda/ha3tkwm/). My view on bad faith accusations is extremely dim, but if it's merited for Holocaust deniers, perhaps it might too be merited for people exacerbating public health emergencies."	23	False

Though the US is the one I know best and is also a particularly bizarre and egregious example. All voting systems have their own unique issues. Most people would agree that a functional election system should translate the aggregate will of the people into functional governance. But what that means in practice can get quite complicated. 

Let's say that we asked all of the people two different electorates to rate their respective representatives on how well they represent them on a scale of 1-10. 1 for worst possible and 10 for literally ideal.

One group has 50% 1 and 50% 10. The other has roughly a bell curve with a mean of 5. 

Which is more representative? In both cases the average voter rates them at a 5. But they clearly aren't interchangeable. What if we shift right a bit so that the majority say 10 in the first?

[Here is a wiki article that goes into some depth comparing different systems by more sophisticated metrics.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_electoral_systems) 

I won't get too deep into it. Its a rabbit hole. But the point is that the issues seen with entrenched suboptimal representation and parties tend to be caused by systemic factors that prevent the electorate from holding their reps properly accountable. 

I'm not saying that parties aren't *a* problem. Only that they aren't *the* problem. I don't know what country you are from so I can't really get specific. But there are pros and cons with every system and most can be managed with careful design. I suppose it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to remove party affiliation from the ballots.

The 2016 referendum was an advisory referendum. There has for many years been a lot of EU skipticism, and the conservative government decided once and for all that they would ask the people directly whether they actually want to be a member of the EU.

Compared to a general election where there are many factors at play (tactical voting etc), this was a direct question to the people: do most of you want to leave the EU? Is it worth pursuing this?

According to the results of the election: yes, most people would rather be out of Europe than in it. And so the government took that advice from the people to begin their attempt at leaving the EU.

However, there was never any consensus of what conditions people would accept for leaving the EU. That was never on the ballot paper, it was a simple yes or no question. Reasonably, a second referendum is needed in order to establish this.

So, without a second referendum, the results of the first referendum meant that parliament are interpreting the results of the first referendum as ""we want to leave the EU, by any means necessary, no matter the cost.""

If we have a second referendum, then the first referendum would mean that parliament are interpreting the UK as saying ""we want to leave the EU, but before we do, we want to decide whether the terms the government have negotiated are reasonable for us.""

If remain is an option in a second referendum, then the first referendum meant that parliament are interpreting the results of the first referendum as ""we want to leave the EU, but before we do, we want to decide whether the terms the government have negotiated are reasonable for us. If not, then we would like the option of staying as an EU member.""

If you come up with an answer to that question every single company in the world would be willing to hire you as a consultant.

This question breaks down simply to just how do you define career success.

Managers make more money, have higher future earnings potential, and have more influence in their company.

Individual contributors have less responsibilities, and are better positioned in the case of a layoff.

As far as things like personal fufillment, work/life balance, that is way too reliant on the culture of the company and the individual, I've seen people all over the spectrum for that.

per [qz](https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/):

 &gt;According to the National Registry of Exonerations, since records began in 1989, in the US there are only 52 cases where men convicted of sexual assault were exonerated because it turned out they were falsely accused. By way of comparison, in the same period, there are 790 cases in which people were exonerated for murder.


Let's assume those numbers are comparable and proportional in Germany. There's a very small number of false charges. So you're not likely to be accused of anything. 

But appropriate precautions might still be appropriate: never be alone with a student, especially behind a closed door, etc.

[German employment law](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/publications/features-of-german-labor-and-employment-law-october-8-2003) probably also gives you some process protections, such as the [right to contest a termination for cause](https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/termination-employment-contract.html) in front of a court.

Suggestion: it sounds like you have means to consult with a german employment lawyer about these concerns. Life is short: don't let the (relatively small, possibly null) fee for such a consult prevent you from the pro-social teaching that brings you joy. 

As a parent and a (former) teacher, I'd be fairly reluctant to bring a *claim.* Look at the /r/parenting discussions about such things--""am I overreacting? I don't really trust my kid!""--to see that fearing the public is giving them too little credit.

Lastly: you may be missing the degree to which the Kavanaugh thing is not an obviously *false* claim. The ""metoo"" perpetrators tend to repeat their behavior: which is why Cosby, Weinstein, Kavanaugh etc. are catching multiple claims, rather than just one. As many others have noted, Kavanaugh's judicial attitudes are comparable to the previous nominee, Gorsuch's. And Gorsuch never caught a false charge. (The claimants are facing death threats! Not a fun way to stop a nominee!)"	77	False

In that case, I don't disagree with you on principal. As a feminist I would also disagree specifically with a movement titled Men Are Trash. The fundamentals of feminism were not theorized in an effort to unseat men in favor of women categorically, but rather to equalize the number of seats held by both men and women in an effort to structure a society that supports both. That is to say, feminism isn't about women being better than men (that would be to use the same patriarchal argument only in favor of women), it's about men and women being equal.

I would agree that using a title like Men Are Trash is just as divisive and alienating as something like Women Are Feminazis. So in this case I dont see a problem with refusing to align yourself with a movement that perpetuates these attitudes. However I do see an opportunity to create dialog, and as you pointed out you're more than willing to discuss these issues. So I would try to find a way to bring your friends in on a discussion of what their real grievance is and how best to bring it to others' attention. 

I also want to clarify that I don't mean they need to make their message so deluded in an effort to not offend that it becomes meaningless. The point of a protest is to disrupt, if it does not do so it is not effective. But there are different ways of protesting and perhaps while you're friends are attempting to support equal rights and stand up against male aggression in various areas of society, they are in fact wrong in the language they're using to communicate their message.

Most classes already have that, too. I believe in English, it is called a syllabus. Besides: I am teaching five classes this semester. I only use a commercially available textbook in one of them, and that's because I'm one of its authors. In the others, the course material is entirely written by me, and updated each year during the summer. Most of my colleagues are in the same or a very similar situation. 

But what you're saying here kind of contradicts your point about a text format being 'more standardized'. Either you want to expose every student to the same written material presented in the same way, in which case you will get a textbook ... or you don't, and then you get a syllabus and/or course materials written by the teacher. But by definition you are making it *less* standardized by taking that approach. 

Further, I understand what you mean, but what you're proposing is extremely impractical. Students will ask individual questions at different times (whenever they get to that section in the text). Some of them may be truly unique questions, but most will be a repeat of something someone else was already wondering about, perhaps just worded slightly differently. You teach the same subject matter for a few years in a row, you'll get to know the pattern. You can anticipate most of the questions you're likely to get, and just answer them before ten people in the room formulate a version of it on their own, each at their own pace. 

The reason teachers teach the way they do isn't because they are under the illusion that everyone will take in every word they say. We know your mind will wander. We also know that very few of your questions or misunderstandings are likely to be unique to you. And so we gain efficiency by teaching to the group, instead of each individual separately. And if you miss a crucial part because your mind was wandering, just raise your hand and ask about it. Chances are you weren't the only one who didn't quite get that particular step, whether because of inattention or genuine incomprehension. 

Objections to the 'read and ask questions' approach usually take one of a few forms: 

- The genuinely confused one: I'm sorry, but I don't even know where to start ... How will I know what's important to understand/remember here, and what is not? Can you please point that out to me? 

- The 'this text is too hard for me' one: Well, I don't really *have* any questions because ... I don't even get what this text is about! (People who voice this objection are usually those with specific learning disorders such as dyslexia, or whose first language isn't the one I teach in). 

- The 'this is inefficient' one: Can't you just tell us what's in here, and then we'll ask questions as a group so you can answer them for everybody? 

- The 'I prefer a different format' one: Do we really have to read *all that*? I hate reading. 

- The angry one: why do we have to do everything ourselves, here? You're the teacher, aren't you?

And that's without considering all the students who don't voice any objection, but silently take away a completely wrong message from the text, thinking they understand when they actually don't (see /u/Numenorean_Mistborn's explanation for more detail on this)."	2	False

&gt;  
&gt;Disclose their condition as soon as possible to any prospective partner, before close emotional bonds are formed  
&gt;  
&gt;And recognize that their condition makes them a liability for anyone they might have sex with, prepare for that and always keep communication as open and clear as possible with their partner; especially if the partner is also a virgin.

What condition? Virginity is not an illness, nor does it necessarily suggest a mental illness in and of itself.

&gt;...but then does that mean that someone else gets to decide at what point a person has had enough...

That's an interesting question. However, I want to point out that you're now discussing when we would define it as terminal.

The point here is that many (almost certainly most) cases of depression would not be defined as terminal either by the doctors or the patient's family.

It many patients with depression are accepted as not terminal, and a symptom is of their depression is suicide - then we have a moral obligation to treat them and prevent the symptom.

The question of when to define it as terminal is interesting, but irrelevant to the point that most cases would not be terminal. 

&gt;...can doctors force an adult with...

Of course not.  Adults with medical decision making capacity (medical DMC) can decide for themselves what treatments they want. The issue is, people in the midst of a depressive episode are not considered to have medical DMC (about taking their own life). It's considered by doctors (I'm a doctor by the way) to be a medical emergency.

Again, if we consider depression a disease and suicide a symptom of that disease - then the patient does not have the ability to stop the symptoms. Let's try an analogy - you have diabetes, a symptom of diabetes is high blood sugar. Can you have diabetes and just decide not to have high blood sugar? Of course not, so if you have depression you cannot just decide to not be suicidal.

we can stop the symptom (suicide) and treat the disease (depression) and save someones life so they go on to live happily and healthily. 

&gt;...Or furthermore, when a person has stage 3 cancer

End stage cancer is a terminal illness.   They are not saying ""I'm otherwise healthy with a long life expectancy but my disease prevents me from making decisions - and I'm going to kill myself"". For the cancer patient it is the job of the medical community to assist that person in enhancing the quality of the life they have left and ensure their death is pain free and occurs with dignity. We don't ""force"" therapy on anyone who would not benefit from it or doesn't want it.

I understand your point, but, people die in stories all the time that motivate the character. 

For example, Luke fights because his aunt and uncle were killed. Peter Parker fights because of Uncle Ben. 

&gt; Imagine if a group of women bought all the media, and began to include pictures of men, either naked and submissive towards the viewer, or wearing clownish attire and failing to do basic tasks, into every book, movie, video game, newspaper, etc.

I, again, understand where you are coming from, but imagine, that ultimately only 10% of men played video games.

This is exactly the case to be made against censorship and promote the ""free market of ideas"". When political opponents who speak contrary viewpoints to the political party in power...and are jailed for it...then the ""free market of ideas"" is not there any longer.

Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone.

**1. - How does this relate to my point?**
So in the Emperor's view in return of the Jedi, he's already won, the battle is already over. He even says as such:

""Come, boy, see for yourself. From here, you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance and the end of your insignificant rebellion.""

The Emperor doesn't need to 'offer' Luke anything, as far as hes concerned he only needs Luke to give in to his anger, and he will become a slave to the dark side and therefore to him.

Again he says as such

""The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant.""

This is basically the equivalent of join me or die.
How does Luke react?
He tries to carve the Emperor a new asshole. He's given in to his anger and fallen straight into the trap Palpatine set for him.

In the same situation, Rey is given much more agreeable terms, - a chance to save her friends as you state (probably a lie on the emperors part, but still). And yes you can see her consider it, but she never crossed that line of attacking the emperor unprovoked- she resists where Luke could not.
Luke moved closer to the dark side than Rey ever did.
And Luke does it twice!

**So what do you think the suspense in the scene is supposed to be? What are we as viewers supposed to fear?**

In my opinion this is where the threat of Luke turning to the dark side ends, he has overcome the temptation of the dark side and become a Jedi Knight, and has succeeded where his father failed. The suspense is now based on whether the Emperor is going to kill Luke, or whether Vader will save him.

**Turned how? How do you envision luke reacting?**

Luke is about to kill Vader when the Emperor interrupts 

""Good....goooood - You're hate has made you powerful. Now fulfill your destiny, take you're father's place by my side.""

It's this interruption that prompts Luke to consider what's happening and look at his hand. If the Emperor stayed quiet Luke might have finished Vader off. 

I wouldn't take this statement too seriously though, it's more of a joke on my part!

**When you say why, what kind of ""why"" do you mean? Are we talking in terms of themes, or internal logic, or audience emotional engagement?**

I was referring to the themes and emotional engagement. As you were talking about internal logic you can probably ignore this point."	3	False

Ironically, I remember coming across an indie horror card game a couple years ago, where it uses the mechanics of a card game to pressure the player into making increasingly disturbing choices. Don't recall the name of it unfortunately.

I think the more time you spend doing this sort of introspection--and the less time you spend making universal statements about people in general--the more likely you'll be to discover things that truly help you find happiness.
As a general observation, I've discovered, once basic animal needs are met, most people need one major thing to be happy, and the nature of that thing differs from person to person. At most people need two. 

When someone claims he needs three things or five things, it's usually a sign that he hasn't yet learned enough about himself. And sometimes what seems like a single thing can actually be an umbrella term for multiple things. If so, it's worth slowly unpacking it.

For instance, I claim that I need to direct plays in order to be happy. But is that really true? ""Directing"" is a very complex set of behaviors. Are all of them vital to me? Is it possible that there's one aspect of directing that I really need--and maybe directing is the only way I know to get it? This may not be important information if I'm free to direct whenever I want, but what if I go through a dry spell? What if I have a financial disaster and can't afford to direct? Am I then doomed to unhappiness?

What if it's actually the pre-production I most cherish. A lot of that is research and something similar to scholarship. Maybe I'd be really happy as a teacher or researcher. It just so happened that, due to the path my life took, I found my way to directing and that allowed me to meet a certain need. But it might not be the only way to meet that need. I can't know if I insist on thinking of directing as a unified entity. (Or maybe what I most love is working with actors ... Or maybe they don't even have to be actors ... Or maybe what I most love is storytelling...)

In your case, I'd say this is worth examining: ""desire to create, and desire for fame, acceptance, etc."" I know you think they're all wrapped up together, and they are, but I wonder if that's because some less-important stuff has, due to your life circumstances, gotten tangled up and associated with some more-important stuff. I'm not a fan of psychoanalyzing people--especially strangers on the Internet--so I'm not saying any of this is true in your case. I'm just saying, at 53, I've see it true in so many cases (I've seen so many people slowly, over the years, realize it's true), it's may be worth pondering. 

To be honest, I don't know if gaining this self-knowledge can be rushed. Most folks I know were totally lost in their teens and twenties, and so they clinged to ideas like ""I want to be a director"" because they didn't yet have the life experience to tease that idea apart (or the need to do it) and clinging to an identity gave them an emotional platform to stand on. 

I wonder what your reaction would be if a genie came to you and said ""I can grant your desire for fame--I can make you more famous than in your wildest dream, but it will be as an engineer. If you agree to this, I'll give you engineering skills, and they will earn you fame, but you'll never be a famous artist.""

And I wonder what your reaction would be if he came to you and said ""I can make you feel deeply accepted--fully-accepted. I can make you feel loved for the rest of your life. You'll have a fantastic marriage and the best friends in the world. And you'll have children who adore you. You will never be lonely. But you won't be an artist. You'll be an obscure tech worker.""

And I wonder what your reaction would be if he came to you and said ""I will never grant you fame, and I will never make you feel infinitely loved. You'll be loved the normal amount--you'll have plenty of love in your life, but it won't be exceptional. And you'll have a small, passionate following as an artist, but you'll never have artistic fame. But, if you agree to this, I will cause you to be overflowing with creative ideas. New, original, exciting ideas will come to you hourly. And they'll all be fascinating to you and your fans.""

Do you read all that and say ""No! I need it all or nothing""? Is it all equally important to you? If so, I wonder if you'll still feel that way in five years... In ten years... It's worth continuing to ask yourself these questions as you age.

Here are some other things that stood out to me in your last post:

""It's sad because you want to spend 10 hours a day on the thing you love, and you can't, because you have to go work a job you don't care for. That's a miserable feeling.""

- No, it's not. It's a miserable feeling for *you*. Not for everyone. You do yourself a disservice by expressing yourself in universals. You get further from useful information, not closer to it.

""I know because that is my life.""

- Right. Your life. Not someone else's. Sorry if I'm nit-picking, but I really believe this distinction is important.

""the only way I will consider myself a great artist is by delivering so much value that people are willing to support me enough that I can make ends meet through that thing.""

- You're mixing together a bunch of things. I know they have relationships with each other, but they're not some sort of fixed unit. I'm talking about your ranking as a great artist, the amount of value you deliver, and people's willingness to support you. 

People support artists for a variety of reasons, not always because they bring great value to the worlds. I'm sure you can think of examples: really shitty artists who got lucky and caught some fashion wave. And think of the many, many great artists who were discovered after they were dead. Often, this happened by chance. A single scholar champions them and that creates a snowball effect. It just as easily could not have happened, and this artist--who has now, due to the scholar, created huge value--would have remained unknown forever.

As for ranking: sure, you can arbitrarily decide that it's dependent on popularity, ability to generate cash, critical acclaim, or respect within the field. Just note that it *is* arbitrary. There are other ways you could choose to rank artists. Or you could decide that ranking artists is a silly past-time. 

It also sounds like you've decided some arbitrary amount of creating-value is really important. If I create value for a million people, is that good enough? If I change just ten people's lives--really deeply change them--is that so worthless I needn't have bothered? How many people have to receive value for it to be worthwhile?

And while finding a way to pay your bills is important, I'm not sure why you've superglued it onto this other stuff. If a single rich patron gave you a five million dollars with the stipulation that you could make art for the rest of your life, but you'd have to give it away for free, would you turn him down? That would just be the support of a single person.
Again, all the stuff you've brought up (value, ranking, support...) may be important, but you've tied it all together. Admittedly, you've tied it all together the way many people (most people?) do, but these are cliches that are handed to us by our culture. We grow up swimming in them and rarely question them. As an artist, it's worth learning to be a free thinker. That will help your art and your life. Don't just accept what you've been told. Don't reject it, either. Question it. You'll give yourself more options.

Of course there are many people that fall in the middle, but for the sake of making a point I hyperbolized a bit.

It's hard to expand on any of your points without knowing which part of each you object to, so I'm going to take another direction. I guess another comparison I could draw here is to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. What is a stereotype about Americans? That they're loud, obnoxious/showy, and materialistic. To someone not from the United States, watching the Macy's parade might seem like a prime example of these negative traits. Thousands and thousands of dollars worth of floats depicting commercial characters, whole streets shut down, the costs of the set-up/clean up. But Americans see the Thanksgiving Day parade as a traditional part of Thanksgiving, a holiday which celebrates being thankful for what you have and the people around you. Considering America as a ""community,"" this is part of our personality as a whole. And others may frown on it, but we know that it is really a display of much more meaningful, more personal values.

The gay community also has a personality. Some may not understand it and even see it as the exact reason why they dislike gay people. But for gay people and for those who are friends of the gay community, the showmanship, flamboyance, and free spiritedness seen in gay pride parades are indicative of much more genuine values (i.e. love, family, ""a normal life,"" etc.). While the display does not resonate with some people, by increasing the visibility of the community and by working through more concrete means (such as fighting legislation to prevent gay couples from having equal rights), the hope is that fewer members of the public will look on with judgement and more will understand what they are really celebrating and let them do it the way their community pleases."	10	False

People are entirely capable of resisting their in-built instinctual desires for things. That only becomes seemingly impossible when the entire society around a person is hammering home the idea that these things are great to eat and easy to get. There’s no particular reason why modern society *has* to make carb and calorie dense foods easy to buy. That’s something entirely driven by culture and capitalism.

Consider how those same biological demands would work if we instead lived in a society where the government artificially manipulated the food supply to make healthy options the only readily available options. We don’t do that. In fact, our government does the opposite and artificially subsidized things like sweeteners and sugar. We give big tax breaks to major food processors and actively encourage them to set up shop in our country. We do nothing to restrict their right to advertise their products even though we *know* it’s psychologically exploitative.

Or consider how corporate governance rules lead to environmental destruction. Sure, the humans at the top of these systems have in-built biases towards consumption driven by their biology... but their biological impulses are fairly far removed from their corporate decision making. Their actual motives are driven primarily by how we’ve structured their incentives. We give them lavish rewards for short-term maximization of profit and actively punish them for taking a long-term growth and development view.  This isn’t a biological imperative, it’s a cultural choice we make in how we choose to organize our economy. 

Humans have in-built biases driven by evolution, but absent this cultural push towards indulgence and short-term planning we would be entirely capable of controlling those impulses.

These cognitive biases are built-in vulnerabilities in human psychology. But the responsibility for their application towards destructive ends lies with the people who rationally choose to exploit those vulnerabilities. That’s fundamentally cultural, not biological. It’s no more a fundamental part of human nature than an artificial bioweapon that exploits human biology is a natural consequence of human existence."	4	False

I feel as though i've already missed the chance to deal with this in my teens and have to make up for it now at 21. I keep reading about a certain point where it starts getting really hard to make any changes if you'd want to and i need to know what i want before that. What can i do about this?

That point where it becomes hard to make changes depends on you personally, so it's meaningless when people make online declarations about cutoff ages.  I transitioned at 26, and I can say by comparing photos that I didn't masculinize from 19 until 26 except for some reduction in hairline (which grew back on HRT anyway).  If I transitioned at 17 my chin would be a little bit smaller, I guess?
Unless you feel like you are in a period of rapid masculinization then whether you transition now or in a few years won't matter physically.  The main thing you miss out on while waiting is socializing and the relationships you build with other people, which is very important but it will correct itself over time anyway.  

&gt;I'm afraid i'll lose the ability to confidently know what i'm about. I think that before this i was in a pretty good place with that. I've spent my entire life shaping myself into someone i can understand very well. 

I'm a confident person and I claim to be an authority on many subjects, and I spent more time on introspection than anything else, so I can relate to how you must feel.  Facing the unknowns of transitioning was frightening, and it was hard to admit to others that the persona I presented to them was a sort of mistake.  But these hangups were all just things I had to work out internally, because externally it turns out that people love it when we admit our flaws and weaknesses.  

&gt;All i want to know is at what point could you leave the cringe behind? When did it become normal?

For me it took 18 months from accepting that I was going to transition until the last time I faced cringe over it.  2 months from acceptance until HRT, 12 months of HRT before going full time.  Going full time was the peak of cringe.  I'm a physicist and I came out in grad school, so I had to come out to all my professors and classmates and it was so hard to face them.  I remember sitting in group meetings and feeling so embarrassed that I wanted to jump out the window (like I said, dying of cringe if that were possible).  That was the peak of it, but slowly it got better.  After 4 months of full time (which adds up to the 18 months I listed), everything lined up for me.  I passed in public every time, I got my documents changed, I traveled across the country as my new self and got greeted as a woman in different cities and universities.  The success of that two week trip marked the end of the cringe era.  "	9	False

Those terms all generally mean the same thing in the US, and the government uses the word ""Caucasian"" interchangeably with ""white"". I avoided using ""white"" because people often get that mixed up with anyone who has pale skin, and using European because some people might think I'm not including Caucasian Americans.

>I don't think this is the argument. I think the argument is that there are a lot of anime characters that have a lot of European traits. This can be the case without it being the intent of the creators.

There are certainly anime characters with European traits, for instance most characters in JoJo or Attack on Titan, but that's not what I'm arguing against. There are people who will insist that Caucasian features *objectively* are the basis/match up to the most common anime styles. Their claim encompasses most or all anime characters, not just some.

So yes, for better or for worse, racial issues are not a commonly explored topic in Japan. Also we're talking about specifically what people *look* like, and in modern Japan most people don't consider themselves to look wildly different from Koreans or Chinese.

>There's a couple of flaws with this argument. We don't know what data the model was trained on. For all we know it could have had a ton of anime pictures labeled ""asian"". Secondly, a lot of asians try to mimic anime characters through make-up, filters and editing.

That's true, which is why that only makes up part of my argument.

Minding that I am not an expert on political or moral philosophy, I would contend that B3 is inferior, for one, because it is unstable. If your plan is to rape, pillage and murder (or act in other sociopathic / psychopathic ways), you will only be able to do so if you maintain a superior level of might, cunning and resources than those around you. Secondly, even while you are able to maintain it, I would argue machiavelian pursuit of self-interest does \*not\* usually lead to individual flourishing and well-being, unless you define them very, very narrowly in terms of material / hedonistic gain and unless you are deeply anti-social / misanthropic.

&gt;Religion offers an answer. Notably Christianity states that God offered amoral law and that we have a written form of it which accurately reflects God's morality.

Even if I were to grant the existence of the God of the Bible (which I do not), I disagree that religion offers an answer to our conundrum. It offers yet another set of axioms / values / goals. It must persuade me that God's morality aligns with my values and goals; otherwise, I will as soon reject God's morality as I'd reject the morality of tyrannical parents or a tyrannical government.

This can also be made evident if you ask a given theist whether they would treat their neighbor differently if they found out god did not exist. If they would, what is their moral standard really based on? If they don't, why is God needed?

In the end, there is an unavoidable practical issue: theists have sharp disagreements between different religions. And, of course, atheists have sharp disagreements with them. We all must, still, coexist. We all, still, mostly share a number of key characteristics and values as members of the same species. Any god's morality would be rendered immoral and tyrannical if it led to genocide, war, suffering, human languishing and/or extinction.

&gt;Instead of religion can we look to science? Science doesn't offermorality. It does say that the fittest members of a population will benaturally selected.

Agree that science does not provide moral standards or ""oughts"". I will, however, note that this understanding of evolution and survival of the fittest is terribly simplistic. As Dawkins and other evolutionary biologists point out, the traits that survive are those that make it most likely for \*any given gene or cluster of genes\* to propagate. This is one of the reasons why kin altruism is so common, \*especially\* in social species such as ours. There is plenty evolutionary advantage for our empathic, altruistic and tribal tendencies (both the beneficial ones that lead us to help our in-group, and the noxious ones that lead us to attack and ostracize the out-group).

Science can help us understand what IS, not what OUGHT to be. It can, at most, help us understand how our biology, physiology, psychology and sociology play with certain moral, ethical or legal systems. I can agree with that much.

&gt;I think what we're left with is that if we don't agree on the moral assumptions then we don't have a set of morals standards.

Yes, that is where we are at, at the moment. I don't believe, however, that we are at the point of ""anything goes"". There are facts about what humans tend to care about. There are historical facts about how different ""moral / legal"" experiments have gone. We have seen what kind of societies slavery produces, for example.

In the end, I don't think an objective, universal standard is floating somewhere in space. In the end, we as a collective (or as collectives) have to choose who we include in our ""moral circle / in-group"" and what we care about most. I would, however, predict that if we are unable to choose the flourishing of all human beings (and ultimately, all sentient / living beings), the interconnected nature of the systems we live in will make that choice a self-destructive one (e.g. the terrible effects of tribalism, climate change, etc)."	1	False

Think about it. As many Black people as there are talking about being Hebrew, which is just a loud minority, there are at least as many claiming to be American Indians. Once again, it’s not for no reason. Black Americans have a long tradition of grandmothers quietly telling grandkids that they had a family secret: being Indian. They offend Native Americans when they talk about it, but the truth is: genealogy proves it all the time. In fact, Congress has acknowledged this reality on several occasions already. 

> “It has been called a **‘paper genocide.’** […] The fact that some of Virginia’s ruling elite claimed to be blood descendants of Pocahontas in their view meant that no one else in Virginia could make a claim that they were Native American and a descendant of Pocahantas’ people. To do so would mean that Virginia’s ruling elite were what they decreed all non-whites to be: **part of ‘the inferior Negroid race.’ […] [For coloreds], to call yourself a Native American in Virginia was to risk a jail sentence of up to one year [under the Racial Integrity Act of 1924.**”

Whole tribes of Black Indians — like the Mattaponi, Monacan, and Yamassee — have gotten federal recognition in recent years, and many more still await that same respect. For generations now, though, they’ve all been living as members of the Black community, and most outside of chief families have forgotten who they are until they have genealogical research professionally done like CNN co-host [Victor Blackwell who publicly discovered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDq8W-hwj6g) he descended not from Africans but from Mattaponi descendants of the Powhatan Confederacy (Powhatan being Pocahontas’s nation). The N-word was *first* applied to the American Indian [according to Oxford Dictionary’s 3rd sense of the word](https://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/126934) and later to the Negro slaves from Africa who joined these Indians in America.

I reiterate: Negro history is wildly complicated, and Black people understandably struggle with it, especially since (a) some were incarcerated or brutalized in parts of the country for identifying as Indians for successive generations, (b) Native Americans have a [long, well documented history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201647_2.html) of denying Black Indians their heritage even when pure-blood ancestry was proven, (c) Jewish claims of antisemitism do shut down any conversation (w/Blacks or Whites) about what Negro connections to the Biblical Israelites might exist, which makes it hard to explore whatever’s actually going on there, and (d) Christianity teaches Black people (very haphazardly) about Israelite history and prophecy, and the Tanakh clearly describes a future, global diaspora of a very unique and rare type of slavery (chattel slavery) for which the Israelite slaves are transported on ships to diverse lands and their children are born into the slavery automatically. Of course, Christianity is more focused on the New Testament and tends to gloss over the Old, which is its own problem.

Regardless, several ethnic groups might actually be better served by cooperating with the Negro on tough questions about who they really are. This is the fallout we all get from centuries of evil colonization and imperialism. Imperialism has and always will have unforeseen consequences. It’s not about whether or not other people in the Middle East are racist. That doesn’t affect how Black people feel about Palestine. They just see themselves in the Palestinians, and yeah, they also make some unfair arguments when they talk about it. They also have a tendency to be highly irreverent."	1	False

&gt;Most stories I've read on the topic cite ""racial issues"" in one way or another, but I fail to see how a standardized test that is the same for all participants can possibly be racist.

Equal treatment means that an equal outcome will be achieved, not that the treatment is the same for everyone. If I have a building with a set of stairs leading to the only entrance, I'm treating everyone *equally*. It's the same number of steps for you as it is for the parapalegic who can only drag themselves bodily up to the door. However, the parapalegic is made to expend disproportionate time and energy to reap the same reward as you. Equal treatment would be, in this case, replacing the stairs with a ramp. 

Just because the test is standardized does not mean that it must be free of racial bias. Dispel with that notion. 

My second challenge to your post is your overvalue on the ability to read and write in English at a 12th grade level. Some points to consider;

EDIT ( sorry, posted this prematurely. Finished below:)

* Many would-be teachers speak English as a second language (as do their would-be students.) 12th-grade proficiency tests that ask questions like *""[In which excerpt from the passage do Kennedy's word choices most clearly establish a tone of resolve?](http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/education/2017/03/11/test-meant-screen-teachers-instead-weeded-out-minorities/99050796/)""* may be difficult for an ESL speaker to parse in a test-taking scenario, despite their ability to understand the concepts and communicate them in another way. 

* Practicing for this test costs time and money, which white would-be-teachers are more likely to have access to. 

* The [average American reads at a 1st or 2nd grade level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States). A 12th grade reading level is obviously far more than is required to cope with day-to-day life in a non-literary field. Why should an ESL teacher who is perfectly capable of teaching maths or sciences be barred on their inability to formally articulate ""what about Kennedy's speech establishes a tone of resolve?""

Surely it is important for teachers to be literate, and surely it is important for them to be generally more knowledgeable than the students they teach. But to wave away concerns about bias in this case seems less than prudent. "	22	False

1. The conclusion applies to both theists and atheists. God gave us free will. Ergo. There's nothing stopping anyone from doing anything. Indeed you see this throughout history. I love my religion but I don't whitewash it's history. Catholics have done evil shit from the sex scandals recently, to the Crusades and Inquisitions, to the political machinations of the early Church. Fear of eternal punishment or the hope of eternal bliss are not enough. Catholics throughout history have changed their morality at a whim and perhaps just justified their immorality with self-delusion just like Incels do. 

2. Maybe I'm an optimist but I believe that good morals are intrinsically good. That is to say they are more logical than bad morals. In game theory, you can be ""nice"" or ""mean"" to everyone around you (grossly simplifying the terms for clarity). They can also be nice or mean. Reality is not a zero sum game - people cooperating in being nice can do more than being individually indifferent. The short term benefits of being mean can be more than being nice, but never in the long term. That's the theory behind civilization after all: the rising tide lifts all boats. So if you believe civilization is a good thing, then being nice to fellow man follows. (As an aside: That's also the second half of the Great Commandment: Love everyone as you love yourself. The first half is simply to follow the second half, as God is love and God is the word from earlier in the Bible. So loving God also means loving to love. That's the truth of the Great Commandment as I see it.)

3. Truly loving means you don't care about rewards or punishment. I often wonder if a parent could live their child so much, that after death they would give up their salvation for a child that didn't earn it. I believe many would, and I believe God is one of them. If you relinquish your free will by only doing good because you fear the consequences for yourself then you go to oblivion. That's not love for that's ultimately selfish reasons and yet love thinks no evil. So a Catholic who doesn't believe in doing good just because it's good still sins. God gives us the salvation we choose. We are sinners, but God forgives, so we only go to heaven if we also sincerely confess, but leaving our ultimate motives unrepentant disqualifies us from the salvation we seek. (But as an aside, if you become enlightened and ask for forgiveness for that even in death, then you're forgiven and quality. However the part of you that was wicked on Earth must be shed so you lose a lot.) So you should do good because it's good. 

4. Atheism is not a belief system in the way believing in Catholism is. It's the lack of a belief system. So comparing the two in that way is like comparing apples and oranges. They aren't meant for the same thing. "	4	False

This is a bad argument in the same vein as ""she shouldn't have been dressed so slutty if she didn't want to be harassed"". Do you really think this song is going to inspire or empower men to sexually objectify women at work or in other non-sexual contexts? I don't.

Megan and Cardi don't appear in the video, so I'm going to assume you mean the song. Why this is empowering and not objectifying in this context is, again, explained in the OP. Generally when women are hypersexualized in hiphop, it's in the context of them being treated as objects who exist for men's use and pleasure, which is why it's bad (not just because they're singing about sex).

I'm saying that the current *moderate solutions* will do nothing to solve the problem (without geoengineering) and radical solutions will likely be so harmful to the world economy that it's more or less damned if you do damned if you don't (unless of course the impact of climate change isn't apocalyptic in which case you're not damned at all.) I'm pretty sure the CO2 half-life numbers I heard were actually in An Incovenient Truth.  I don't want to rip it just to support this argument though.  Sounds like you agree with at least that point.


&gt;&gt;It seems apparent that any abrupt, massive climate changes would be bad but how so? There is an uncountable number of factors. I’m sure there’s consensus that this change would cause more ice caps to melt and that some places currently on the verge of being too hot/ dry to be habitable would be pushed over the edge and become uninhabitable. The same can surely be said of cold places which straddle the border between habitable and uninhabitable. Surely there’s no consensus on which will outweigh the other. There is no computer that could model the thousands of factors that define human well-being across the world for even a day, let alone a century.

&gt;Well, first, it’s not difficult for geologists to look at the places people live and the arable terrain for growing food, not to mention the availability of fresh water as more water sources are swallowed by the oceans, and arrive at a rough estimate.

So all of these effects you described were arrived at by consensus in the geological community?  People move.  How many 100 year old houses are still around?  Creative destruction, people continuously destroy and recreate industries anyways.  We wouldn't move the entirety of Manhattan inland.  We would gradually rebuild elsewhere.  Land in floodzones isn't very valuable.

&gt;Second, if you really accept that no model for a thing’s effect on the population can be determined, everything past the point of “we know it’s happening and what it will physically do” is irrelevant speculation.

I'm saying global climate models are incredibly complex.  It's not a math problem or a chemistry experiment.  Look at your weather report from 10 days ago (it probably wasn't very accurate.)

&gt;To wit:
If scientists don’t get the benefit of speculation, neither do politicians (whose views are not those of experts), nor economists (who cannot actually model the innumerable effects of any policy).

You've got me on politicians. I agree that they are not an authority on anything in particular.  
On economists: what I'm trying to point out is that switching the entire world to zero emission renewable energy overnight would have a negative effect on a lot of people (impoverished Indians and Chinese for example who are reliant on Coal/ Petroleum.)  Someone has to give insight into the effect that the policies will have on those peoples' lives.  Climate Scientists don't do that nor is it their jobs to do that.  It seems like academic economists are a group who have expertise in the matter and should have their opinions considered (or maybe it's up to the coal and petrol lobbies to stand up for the little guy. s/... kind of)

&gt;&gt;There is strong support in the economic community that subsidizing sectors of the economy that the free market doesn't value is detrimental to the economy as a whole.

&gt;To paraphrase you:
""There is no computer that could model the thousands of factors that define economic well-being across the world for even a day.”
Sorry man, you can’t have it both ways.

Except economists are speculating about something they are experts in.  Looking to climate scientists for expertise in economics doesn't really make much sense.   Economists can also look to the past (other times the government has subsidized inefficient sectors of the economy for indication.  There haven't been past incidences of anthropogenic CO2 rises like we're having now.


&gt;Except there’s no reason to believe the long-term costs of renewable energy will be significantly higher.

Well the short term costs are.  The short term is all that a lot of people have.  If there was a way to undercut the petroleum/ coal industry I'm sure a businessman would be highly incentivized to do so.

&gt;And the amount of economic growth could offset it. Since “there’s no consensus on which will outweigh the other”, you would by definition reject this line of criticism, correct?

Not sure what you're trying to say.  

&gt;Speculation, which you find impermissible given the inability to sufficiently model the thousands of factors involved in economic growth, right? Or is it okay to speculate about policy outcomes only when it’s speculation that you intuitively agree with?

Not at all.  Higher taxes= bad as a general rule.  Just the discussion I didn't want to have.  I won't be swayed and it sounds like you won't either.   


&gt;“As a result, the world actually comes out slightly ahead: the costs of switching will be paid for in fuel savings between now and 2050.”
And, no, you can’t use their estimate of the cost without also using their estimate of the benefit. Either you think they have enough data to make a reasonable estimate of both, or you don’t think they can estimate either.

I was just looking for a number.  The same fuel savings would happen whether switch to renewables took place with government assistance or through the private sector.  I wonder what $44 trillion would do for AIDS/ Malaria/ Cancer research?


&gt;You’re not entirely clear on what it means to say that addressing climate change will have costs. Only $13 trillion are directly paid costs, the rest is the estimated loss in economic growth worldwide during that period, and ignoring any economic gain.

ok $13 Trillion on AIDS/ Malaria/ Cancer research.  The ""loss of growth"" won't happen and will instead be used for private investment or lifting more poor people out of poverty so that they can actually afford wind power instead of coal power.

&gt;To wit:
If you ignore the economic benefits of any of the other things you’d suggest spending money on, you could conclude you’ve just spent a bunch of money. If you include benefits, we have to include the benefits of both.

The economic benefits of government subsidized industry &lt; economic benefits when the private sector wasn't taxed in the first place.  Maybe we could talk about human benefits.  Malaria/ Cancer/ AIDS eradicated v a comparatively small number of people dying in natural disaster.

&gt;You seem to have a bunch of these “I vaguely recall this, and maybe I’ll actually find the source later.”

Nope because if I can get my reader to accept something logical I shouldn't need a citation.  This isn't a college research paper.  Would you open your mind to investing in Cancer/ AIDS/ Malaria research over impoverishing 3rd world countries with your feel good environmental policies?


&gt;But, again you’re trying to have it both ways. You won’t take the analysis of the potential benefits of spending money to stop global warming because you subjectively think that the benefits of warming might balance out the costs, but you take at face value an analysis of the potential benefits of spending that money elsewhere.
    
Nope, I'm saying that even ardent climate change interventionists should be able to concede that maybe the massive amounts of money is better spent elsewhere.

&gt;In case you don’t know what “The resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded” means, it means that the ecosystem will no longer be able to support live at the current levels. Which means starvation, mass migration, water shortages. In other words: something an awful lot like an apocalypse.

I've heard it referenced at the UN as a blockade during the yearly denounce the embargo vote, so I think many people may not realize the amount of trade Cuba actually does internationally.

But Cuba is definitely still missing out by not exporting to the US economy, as having the largest economy in the world as a neighbor should create a very healthy economy. The US GDP in 2022 was $25.43T according to the world bank, which is still bigger than the EU ($16.74T) Mexico ($1.46T) and Canada ($2.13T) combined at $20.33 trillion dollars. That's all compared to Cuba's $0.633T of GDP in 2022, which if you look at GDP per capita, then Cuba is actually doing better than Mexico.

I think people are grinding their teeth on the embargo because it's an unnatural restriction of the world economy, and because it's become highly politicized. Most countries of the world preach the principle of free trade, which the embargo flies in the face of. But it's also become a murky political topic as well with emotional speech like calling it a blockade, although that's far from reality. 

Finally for the 180 day rule, yes it's an inconvenience but I don't think it's very consequential.

Only about 20-40% of sexual offenders against children experience persistent sexual attraction to children. Meanwhile there are a fairly large number of people who are sexually attracted to children, but who don't actually commit any sex acts with children. The act of raping a child has something to do with sexual attraction, but it also has a lot to do with the desire to exert power and dominance. It's a form of child abuse that may not be motivated by sexual attraction.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/04/13/why-dress-codes-cant-stop-sexual-assault/
On a similar note, more attractive women aren't raped more often. Women wearing revealing clothing aren't raped more often. Rapists are not overcome with lust and giving into their libidos exactly. Rape has to do with sexual desire, but it also has to do with again, the need to exert power. It has to do with not considering the victim a person. There's a reason why rapist tend to be misogynists. They aren't overcome by lust, they just don't care about consent. If rapists just wanted to have sex, there are far easier and less risky ways to have an orgasm than rape. 

Sexual crimes aren't just about sex. They're about power, dominance and not seeing the victim as able to give consent. So to bring this back to the tomato in mouth example, it's missing a factor. Inserting a tomato doesn't have the same implication that the aggressor doesn't consider the victim human. It's not a demonstration of dehumanization. If there were thousands of years of history of one group inserting tomatoes into another group's mouth as a way of denying them human rights, we might think about the act a little differently.

I think this is fine. Shouldn’t there be a human element in law enforcement? Isn’t this why we use a Jury system — jurors aren’t legal experts, they’re average human beings?

There will always be a disconnect between what the laws are and they way they are enforced. You will never have a system where every law is enforced with equally vigor and rigidity. Trying to enforce the law blindly will be counter productive.

In this case, were the police to go out in the street and try to ticket every protester, what do you think the reaction would be? Wouldn’t this inflame the situation? What’s wrong with trying to deescalate the situation?

There’s also first amendment rights to consider — people have a right to assemble, yet states have the power to quarantine. Yet since the BLM have not demonstrably led to any spikes in coronavirus.

They don't have to worry about malware (on both Apple and Google's stores), and in Apple's case they're guaranteed to a certain quality.

The only reason those sports should exist within a college setting is for the players themselves, something to do on the side while they're attending school. 

Well, that already happens.  And outside of Football, Basketball, and (maybe) Hockey, very little attention is payed to collegiate sports.  College Baseball? Meh.  Soccer? Meh. Swimming? Meh. Gymnastics, Wrestling, La Crosse, Rugby, etc.

All of those athletes are doing exactly what you say, it's for the players themselves.  Of course, the same could be said for the most popular sports as well.

But Football and Basketball are popular, and Universities are often major cornerstones of the cities they reside in.  For many people, seeing high level, competitive play is only feasible at the collegiate level.  An NFL ticket costs several hundred dollars per person, an NBA ticket costs anywhere from $70-300.

In contrast an NCAA Basketball tickets top out at $70, and that's for the biggest teams.

If I'm a fan of football, and I want to watch a live football game, my options are: Peewee, High School, College, and NFL.  The NFL is outside of most people's budgets.  A college game is not, and a high school game is most certainly not.  

If I want to see a high level of play, I'm not going to see it at anything less than the college level.

&gt; If you want sports entertainment you should go pay professional sports entertainment. 

Maybe in an ideal world where sports are completely separated from Education, but that's just not the reality.  

Sport scholarships are help many students afford college.  Sport participation is generally considered to be good for developing students.  Encouraging physical activity is also kind of a big paramount what with the growing child obesity problem the in the USA.

Students at college are going to want to watch their college sports team play.

Alumni of a college are going to want to watch their college sports team play.

People in the city are going to want to watch their local college sports team.

This is not going to change. On top of that, that revenue is highly valuable to the University.  They use it those funds to pay for the remainder of sports programs that are not marketable.  They use those funds to improve their campus, to draw in more students.

People aren't going to stop being fans of college sports because college sports are deeply integrated into sports. You may as well argue that people stop being fans of sports altogether. "	2	False

I think there may be a few people in BLM who WANT to focus on ending white supremacy, but ultimately people only seem to show up when a white officer kills a black civilian. And this is ultimately viewed as another instance of a racist cop shooting an innocent black person...instead of another instance of a person having their civil rights violated by the police.

There are actual white supremacist groups, and I don't think defunding the police is a goal that aligns with ending white supremacy. Logically, one would think they'd want to partner with the police to find and eliminate these groups. As well as improve the laws and define white supremacy (legally speaking) better...which would be helped by partnering with Republicans.

In practice, I think it's fair to only associate BLM to matters of police violence specifically against black people."	5	False

Out of all the things you like, it's the one you like the most, it's the most special and meaningful one to you. That which you love is not just your favourite, but the highest thing you value.

I agree. I do have to say that, nowadays, we have access to more information, more choices than before, so it's harder and harder to keep that most valuable kind of love associated to just one thing. But I agree with your statement.

How is this an issue?

You can see that it is an animal reaction, and not a man made construct, by looking at babies who are jealous of new siblings, and dogs and cats who are jealous when a new pet is introduced into the house.

Men suffer from higher rates of depression and suicide because a ""manly man"" isn't supposed to be ""sad"". Because mental illness isn't ""manly"" so many men probably feel like they can't come forward with how they're feeling, and sometimes probably aren't taken seriously. 

Men lose custody battles, even when they are the more fit parent, because our society believes that women are inherently better at raising children, even if they've made demonstrably bad parenting decisions. 

Women ""get away"" with assaulting men because, again, our society believes women weak, man strong. So how could a weak little woman possibly seriously assault a big strong man? 

I believe the false rape accusations are a product of this weird in-between spot we are in, in society.

These claims are based on reports made by the American Association of Pediatrics. [**But there is a lot of criticism regarding their research.**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/796) The important points are mentioned below:

* **It takes around 100 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI, and UTIs can be treated easily by other less invasive ways, like antibiotics. Not to mention, it is easily prevented with basic hygiene. 1 case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of haemorrhage, infection, or, in [rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death.](http://www.cirp.org/library/death/)** This negates whatever minuscule protective benefit circumcision might have against UTIs. And it should be noted that girls are about 10 times more likely to get UTIs and yet we do not alter their bodies to reduce their risk of infection
* **Penile cancer** is one of the rarest forms of cancer in the Western world **(∼1 case in 100,000 men per year, rarer than male breast cancer)**, almost always occurring at a later age with the average being 68. When diagnosed early, the disease generally has a good survival rate. According to the AAP report, between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions are needed to prevent 1 case of penile cancer. [Penile cancer is linked to infection with HPV, which can be prevented without tissue loss through condom use and prophylactic inoculation.](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/) **Incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where ∼75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population is circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where ≤10% of the male population is circumcised**
* **The studies that claim circumcision prevents STDs often confuse correlation with causation.** [In fact, circumcision might increase the risk of contracting STDs](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/alleged-medical-benefits/sexually-transmitted-infections/), because it can cause pain and bleeding, increasing the risk of infection. The authors of the AAP report forget to stress that responsible use of condoms, regardless of circumcision status, will provide close to 100% reduction in risk for any STD

Another common claim is that circumcision reduces the risk of men contracting **HIV** by 60%. These were the results of some trials done in Africa, which found that **2.5% of intact men and 1.3% of circumcised men got HIV.** The 60% figure is the **relative risk** (2.5%-1.2%)÷2.5%. The AAP also ignored the statistics showing that there was a 61% relative increase (6% absolute increase) in HIV infection among female partners of circumcised men. It appears that the number of circumcisions needed to infect a woman was 16.7, with one woman becoming infected for every 17 circumcisions performed

Moreover, there were several methodological errors in these trials:

* The circumcised experimental group got more medical care, including education on the proper use of condoms
* The trials were terminated early when statistical significance was reached
* In one study, circumcised men's infection rates were increasing faster than the intact men's, until the study was terminated early
* The circumcised group could not have sex for 4-6 weeks after the circumcision; this was excluded from the analysis and distorts the results
* HIV was contracted through means other than sex
* Many researchers had cultural and religious biases

The findings are also not in line with the fact that **the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with high circumcision rates. The situation in most European countries is the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates.** Therefore, other factors play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This also shows that there are alternate, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs

[Critique of African RCTs into Male Circumcision and HIV Sexual Transmission](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278023840_Critique_of_African_RCTs_into_Male_Circumcision_and_HIV_Sexual_Transmission)

[Circumcision of male infants and children as a public health measure in developed countries: A critical assessment of recent evidence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441692.2016.1184292#)

[Sexually Transmitted Infections and Male Circumcision: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/109846/)

Even if circumcision did reduce rates of HIV transmission, which it doesn't, it would be a small reduction. [“The number needed to \[circumcise\] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298. The model did not account for the cost of complications of circumcision. In addition, there is a risk that men may overestimate the protective effect of being circumcised and be less likely to adopt safe sex practices.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

And besides all of that, **babies are not having sex.** They are not transmitting **ANY** STDs to anyone. By the time a person is old enough to engage in sexual activities, they are old enough to decide about such body modifications for themselves

**Balanitis** is extremely rare. Having a surgical incision in a dirty diaper increases the risk of balanitis. This risk decreases in all males drastically after puberty. It is easily preventable with good hygiene and most cases respond to treatment in under a week

**Phimosis** doesn't warrant circumcision. It can be cured by stretching the foreskin gently at regular intervals. For faster results, steroid creams can also be used. If stretching doesn't work, surgery like Z-plasty and preputioplasty can be done as a last resort. None of these treatments results in the loss of tissue. Moreover, some doctors misdiagnose phimosis in young children, when they're supposed to have foreskins which can't retract, until puberty, though in some cases the foreskin becomes retractable earlier. Improper handling of the foreskins of children can cause phimosis

[""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction ... allow\[ing\] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

**Smegma and hygiene** are ridiculous reasons for circumcision. Properly washing the penis is enough. If you don't wash your junk, it will get dirty, period. Foreskins aren't releasing a constant ooze of smegma. You would have to neglect your basic hygiene for some time to get a significant buildup. And even then, washing takes maybe a second or two. It's not rocket science

**The legitimacy of research supporting circumcision**

The literature review by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which supports circumcision, does not mention any of the functions of the foreskin, implying that it is useless

Ethicist Brian Earp [shows how scientific literature can be filled with bias,](https://quillette.com/2016/02/15/the-unbearable-asymmetry-of-bullshit/) how [medical literature can get biased with controversial opinions disguised as systematic reviews,](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1078529309478838272.html) and [how a small group of researchers with an agenda can rig a systematic review in medicine to make it say whatever they want.](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1079164114784714752.html)

**Opposition to circumcision by foreign medical organizations**

Other medical associations and doctors in the world, from [the Netherlands](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf), [Canada](https://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision), [the United Kingdom](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/children-and-young-people/male-circumcision), [Australia and New Zealand](https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/advocacy-library/circumcision-of-infant-males.pdf), [Germany](http://arclaw.org/sites/default/files/BVKJ_Statement_Official_Translation.pdf), Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Slovenia and South Africa have stated that circumcision causes complications, have also said that the evidence supporting circumcision is insufficient and flawed, and consider the AAP's views scientifically unsound. Some of them have gone on record in opposition to non-therapeutic circumcision of boys. Some doctors in the US oppose it too

**Functions of the Foreskin** 

[The foreskin has several unique physiological functions.](https://youtu.be/D_dzeDvx2QA) The foreskin represents at least a third of the penile skin. It protects the glans from abrasion and contact with clothes. It also increases sexual pleasure by sliding up and down on the shaft, stimulating the glans by alternately covering and exposing it. Not to mention that it is [highly erogenous tissue in and of itself.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif)

**Attempts to legitimize FGM**

Another issue with using ""health benefits"" to justify infant male circumcision is that the same poor reasons given for baby boys are the same reasons being used [in attempts to legalize and legitimize FGM on girls](https://youtu.be/GBH0g_Cl7Rk). They will try and use the logic that: ""If it is legal on boys because there are slight medical benefits, then it should be legal and acceptable for girls as well."""	12	False

Well, as a purely philosophical question, if taken literally, its almost trivially true to the point of being entirely uninteresting, because the reasoning applies to the niche stuff as well. Nothing is going to *perfectly* suit you. Even if some film was made for just 10 people with similar interests, by your logic it will be necessarily watered down as opposed to if it were just for you. Sure, whatever, but given that, I hope your view at least is somewhat related to the *magnitude* of the deviations we take from our ideals.

So here's another way to look at it. Lets say there are 7 billion people. In theory, each of these people have a unique, individualized perfect song, right? Now try to consider the distribution of these ""ideal songs"" based on any conceivable criteria you can imagine. What do you suspect this distribution looks like? Are they all really equally unique? Or are there large clusters of not identical, but very similar ""perfect songs"". Its hard to say, but how confident are you that if we could somehow synthesize these songs, there wouldn't be substantial clusters of songs that are very similar to Katy Perry? Sure, maybe ""I kissed a girl"" isn't Sally's perfect song, but if Sally's perfect song is just a *slightly modified* version of ""I kissed a girl"", that would seem contrary to your view, at least in spirit, in that its unlikely that Sally (and the potentially millions like her) would find anything she likes better by looking at more niche content."	2	False

That really is not appropriate. Men are raped, and it's quite arguable that it's harder for them to recover. When a woman is raped, *everyone* is there to support her. They understand the devastating effect that has on her, psychologically and perhaps physically. When a man is raped, while supports groups are of course available, the social response is significantly more subdued. He may even get mocked for being 'umanly' and *unable to defend himself*, or perhaps called a liar; responses a woman would rarely, *rarely* receive. It's awfully unfair to consider an entire *gender* unable of comprehending the rape of a person, inferably due to your presumption that we're *stronger* and would be able to defend ourselves to a larger extent. I hope this isn't news, but there are *many* who may be considered *effeminate* and are not physically strong, who can indeed fall victim to rape perpetrated by men, OR women, stronger than themselves.

&gt; imagine somebody much stronger than you catches you where no one can see you, holds you down, beats the shit out of you when you try to resist or run away, rips your clothes off and shoves his dick into your asshole.

Now, I don't want to undermine the devastating psychological and physical effects rape has on a person, but your mental construction of rape seems to be skewed towards the extreme a tad too extensively. Not all rapes occur like this -- many are conducted when a woman is severely drunk or passed out, for example. When women are raped under these circumstances, however morbid an act it still is, it's not as devastating as the situation you conjured up, I think that's clear. She may not have a clear recollection of the rape even occurring. 

Why is this important? Because the perpetrator is held to the same standard of brutality as the perpetrator of the situation you described. All rapists are just that; *rapists*. Whether the psychological and physical damage is fairly small, or large as you described, all rapists are tarred by society's same brush (except if they're rapists of men). Under law, there are degrees of rape, but society does not take nuance into consideration. Society responds to rape as the *absolute* most heinous crime one can commit (except perhaps for child molestation), regardless of the subtleties of the situation. Worse than murder. I do not think this is just, and I view the Western world's reactionary response to rape as infuriating.

It is worthy to note that this same response is given to those who are only *accused* of the rape of a woman. Innocent 'rapists' are perceived as worse than proven murderers.

&gt;We're talking anxiety, we're talking depression, all of it. You don't feel like a person. You have problems trusting other people. These are serious, serious conditions.

These aren't the consequences for the entirety of rapes. Many people do recover from the effects of rape, as they are supported emotionally, financially and socially by all around them.

Even worse than that, most politicians are pro life because they are simply playing to the emotions of people to get votes. They don't actually give a shit, but they present the image of being ""moral"" to praise peoples emotions and gain power. 

The third reason is, they use this medium because they keep people in poverty easier. A person with money doesn't have a problem going to another state to get an abortion, but the poor can't do that. They're forced to have the child, many of them keep it. They were already in poverty before, so now they have to stay in poverty to get enough welfare to keep their family fed. It's a massive gap between being poor enough to qualify for government assistance and having an income that can sustain a family. Republicans know this, and let's look at McConnell for exame. Kentucky gets more welfare aid than almost any other state because of the relationships he has in the government. They vote him in time and time again because of this, if they lose welfare most of Kentucky will suffer. Being forced into having kids keeps people dependant on that system, and eventually after having a kid many parents find they love their child, and where they would have supported and even got abortion before to save their own future, to justify their now locked into poverty state, they see abortion as evil and that nobody should have the right. Because they had a kid they love, and that they were forced to go through with it and had the child they care for, they feel everybody should.

It's far, far more than a moral stance. It's a power dynamic, it's a means of control. It's much worse than a moral pat on the back, that's probably the most reasonable perspective to be pro life, the other theories on it are much worse. Other than, as an individual who had to birth because of a state and financial position, they convert to pro life to make their situation palatable to themselves. The restriction forced them to have a child they now care for, so there is a seed planted for them to sympathize with abortion restrictions. Past that, it's also a ""I went through it, it was and is hard but I have a child I love so everybody should have to do it"" mentality. It's a coping mechanism, and emotional manipulation. 

Those are all the reasons I've found people to be pro life.

Again, this is based upon my belief that these situations become unethical when a decision is made about the death another person (being, fetus, whatever) by those involved without there having been a crime committed warranting death.  Extending the legal implications of this, assisted suicide would also be illegal and IVF would only be legal when one fertilized egg is brought to full term or all fertilized eggs were brought to full term or every attempt was made to do so. 
I do think abortion should be a punishable offense.  I'm not sure why as a society we are so willing to punish (and honestly ridicule, scorn, and judge) a mother who throws a child into the trash and not a woman who willingly chooses to have an abortion.  In my opinion, they are the same occurrence.  There is no greater, sicker crime in our collective minds than that of Medea to her children.  Yet, when it is done to an unborn child it is perfectly acceptable (generally) in our society.  I think this is hypocritical.  That being said, when an abortion is performed to save the life of someone involved (ie the life of the mother is at risk due to the pregnancy) the ethics of this situation no longer stand.  Instead of impartial individuals deciding upon the life of one person, whomever the decision authority is (doctor, spouse, woman involved) is deciding between two lives.  At this point, as long as a well informed, rational, and intentional decision is made, I believe it is ethical.  

I am not one of the individuals against contraceptives.  I believe it is responsible, ethically acceptable, and actually ideal when individuals choose to make that decision.  A sperm is not a person and an egg is not a person - genetically, a zygote is.  Avoiding creating life is NOT the same as choosing to destroy it.  Whatever methods are taken to prevent the creation of human life are therefore ethical and even in your case ideal and heroic in that they're being done to prevent potential harm to the life that would come to be.

I think it is one of the saddest things in life when parents realize for whatever reason that they can't or shouldn't have children of their own volition.  I'm sorry it's even something you've had to think about much less experience personally - especially given you've actually had a healthy child in the past.  I hope given you're situation that you and your husband are able to be a blessing to a child whatever decision you do make. "	3	False

That is still very consequential change though.

And it was a strong international push:

""After much debate, by the late-1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A disinvestment from South Africa movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks."" \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid#International_relations_during_apartheid)\]

""The disinvestment campaign, after being realised in federal legislation enacted in 1986 by the United States, is credited by some as pressuring the South African Government to embark on negotiations ultimately leading to the dismantling of the apartheid system."" \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa)\]

&gt; As for the EU's pressure for LGBT rights, it has been creating anti-EU resentment among some right-wingers in the EU. 

Just because people resist the changes doesn't mean that the EU hasn't impacted countries to protect human rights.

For example, the EU's influence was a key driver for changes in the UK:

""As a result of the Court of Justice of the EU’s decisions, protection against gender identity-based discrimination became a reality in UK workplaces and the rest of the EU.

In 1996, the European Court of Justice said that protection against gender-based

discrimination at work should also apply to people who had undergone or were planning to have gender reassignment surgery, the first European-level case of its kind. As a result, the UK introduced the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations in 1999.

The European courts have also made sure that same-sex registered partnersiv and transgender partners enjoy exactly the same employment benefits and are treated equally under pension schemes as married couples. The principles established in cases against one state apply equally in the other 27 member states.

Why does this matter? Because it shows that the European Court of Justice is strictly applying non-discrimination principles to LGBT people, making their life better in the UK and all over the EU. Of course, the UK might have introduced similar protections of its own eventually, but these progressive court cases helped secure equality for LGBT people in the UK much faster."" \[[source](https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/5_key_facts_on_the_eu_and_lgbt_equality_-_longer_version.pdf)\]

&gt; After all, LBJ did manage to push through significant and much-needed equality legislation, but at what cost? 

Again, just because there is backlash doesn't change the fact that positive changes did happen by influencing a key individual (rather than through getting lots of voters to change their minds).

If your CMV position is:

&gt;CMV: Activism is pointless unless you can change voters' minds

The above examples I mentioned show that real, significant change can happen through key decision makers, customers, and outside influences.

And also (as mentioned at the top of my first reply post) real change can also come through activism that aims to get people with certain beliefs to show up and vote (so, it's not about *changing* their minds so much as working to help ensure that their opinions result in votes)."	2	False

Anxious, when properly used, means uneasy and worried. The problem is that so many people got this wrong that ""ardently or earnestly wishing"" is now one of the possible definitions in the dictionary for anxious. This is because the dictionary is a record of how language is used and in many casual situations, people use ""anxious"" to mean ""eager"".  But in an academic setting using ""anxious"" to mean ""eager"" would still be considered incorrect and likely marked wrong.  It just isn't a proper definition of anxious, even though it is a common enough mistake that the dictionary has documented that as a possibility.


With that in mind, let's take a look at the definition of [irony](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/irony):

1.  the use of words to express something other than and especially the opposite of the literal meaning - This is more commonly referred to as ""sarcasm"".
2. incongruity between the actual result of a sequence of events and the normal or expected result - This is the one you're looking for.
3. incongruity between a situation developed in a drama and the accompanying words or actions that is understood by the audience but not by the characters in the play - This is an information asymmetry where the audience knows something the characters don't.
4. a pretense of ignorance and of willingness to learn from another assumed in order to make the other's false conceptions conspicuous by adroit questioning

So yes, there is a documented use of irony (#2) that reflects the definition you're using.  But many people would call that improper and only accept #1, #3, and #4.  Many people accuse others of getting the definition of ""irony"" wrong in that way, but it is such a common mistake that it is now document by the dictionary as one of the things a speaker might mean when using the word irony.

So I think people that say it isn't irony may be being more pedantic than you're giving them credit for and implying you're using the word ""irony"" completely wrong in the first place.

Anyway, even using #2, I don't think you can count, ""It's a free ride when you've already paid"".  I also think ""It's a death row pardon two minutes too late"" and ""A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break"" are stretches as they are more just unfortunate and than really unexpected."	4	False

For all practical purposes absolute zero is infinity unobtainable. Bringing the temperature down the ever lengthening row of zeros after the decimal become ever increasingly difficult to achieve. New properties of atoms manifest themselves as we lower the temperature. We know that as we near absolute zero materials become superconductors, helium turn liquid and has zero viscosity, and mater turns into a Bose–Einstein condensate. We don't know if absolute zero is possible, but there may be other states of matter to discover as we continue to slow the motion of atoms.

As far as an absolute hot, we only have to look at the big bang to discover the absolute hot temperature, talk about a bad day and a certain way to end the universe.

And yes a pyromancer does have limited ability, it involves e=mc2. The cryomancer would have the same limitation. If the cryomancer and pyromancer were fighting each other in most locations in the universe I would put the bet on the cryomancer. Most of the universe is much closer to absolute zero than the temperature of the big bang, and most of space is a vacuum.

Big Edit: If they were fighting they would be equal, no mater the location. The theory of relativity and laws of thermodynamics would not allow one to be stronger than the other using their powers. When the cryomancer lowers the temperature in one location he is making the area around that location hotter, forming energy into matter, putting together higher energy chemical bonds. When the pyromancer is focusing heat at a specific area, he is making another area cold, breaking chemical bond, or turning matter into energy. It would be more decisive if they fist fight."	10	False

This is (A) tautological and (B) irrelevant. It's tautological because the decline in US manufacturing is driving the change to a service-oriented economy. It's irrelevant because things manufactured in the US can be sold anywhere. So even if not a single thing made in the US was purchased here, that's not an argument against manufacturing. 

&gt; Which means in order to revive manufacturing, we will have to lose production from another industry (i.e. services, agriculture, etc.). 

This presupposes that the US labor force is at full employment. While the nominal unemployment is good, when you dive in a little deeper (to things not included in that measure, like labor force dropouts, part timers, and the underemployed) the unemployment in this country is still very high.

The distribution of household incomes has become more unequal during the post-2008 economic recovery as the effects of the recession reversed.[66][67][68] CBO reported in November 2014 that the share of pre-tax income received by the top 1% had risen from 13.3% in 2009 to 14.6% in 2011.[1] During 2012 alone, incomes of the wealthiest 1 percent rose nearly 20%, whereas the income of the remaining 99 percent rose 1% in comparison.[23]

In May 2017, new data sets from the economists Piketty, Saez, and Gabriel Zucman of University of California, Berkeley demonstrate that inequality runs much deeper than previous data indicated. The share of incomes for those in the bottom half of the U.S. population stagnated and declined during the years 1980 to 2014 from 20% in 1980 to 12% in 2014. By contrast, the top 1% share of income grew from 12% in 1980 to 20% in 2014. The top 1% now makes on average 81 times more than the bottom 50% of adults, where as in 1981 they made 27 times more. Pretax incomes for the top 0.001% surged 636% during the years 1980 to 2014. The economists also note that the growth of inequality during the 1970s to the 1990s can be attributed to wage growth among top earners, but the ever-widening gap has been ""a capital-driven phenomenon since the late 1990s."" They posit that ""the working rich are either turning into or being replaced by rentiers.""[73][74]

Based on that we would expect equal distribution for jobs that do not have physical requirements.

Indeed. So then we shouldn't expect significant gender differences in the amount of men vs. women in knowledge work / jobs that aren't primarily physical, because intelligence is the biggest factor in determining job performance, and there isn't a significant difference in intelligence between men and women.

&gt;Doesn't wanting a specific job affect succeeding in one? Like trying to get the job in the first place? Tbf I should have mentioned this in my initial.

There is a key difference here in attraction to certain jobs versus ability to perform jobs. Those are 2 different things.

If there is similar ability between men and women to perform certain jobs (as we would expect in all knowledge work, many service jobs, etc.), then we have to ask why there would be significantly less representation of women in certain types of knowledge work.

It could be because certain industries have been historically been overwhelmingly male, which could mean that women face more discrimination / barriers for advancement in such field due to prejudice, less networking opportunities, less female role models / mentors in those fields, or simply are less aware of those fields as they aren't usually presented as options to young women as often as they are to young men by their parents, school career counselors, in college, etc.

Regarding your link on personality, notice that the differences aren't huge:

""women tended to be somewhat higher than men in neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness"" -

... that is just ""*somewhat""* higher.

And of the Big 5, ***only*** conscientiousness is consistently related to job performance across occupations. \[[source](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/30374576/1991_barrick_mount.pdf?1356557968=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DThe_big_five_personality_dimensions_and.pdf&amp;Expires=1594267478&amp;Signature=YHhWgn~YQUPR8Qa8PyoxZbO1y2W1hEnUwivWvjvEDlEPlJg~xfljYotzlhyyIuGxTPocBh9yfzAbq8mNacyBVXBelle~OJmYc408D7vy2G8hnmQkG91pzQJJv6kf5pGLhnzK9uPRCEiolbbUxam7POaZJOpjYjyDEMZZy0UNKriShSkoeIKz8AmOn4hqPtEhrCr0KrVyKSgLHNZNsVn4869bd0rfJpYu5OMrRBKh5ZYIVoqaJuPeacI4uvd12LKP3DpxSP8ECuyae09jkS3plhxuPsGhNU-ga4300U5lTwjfWFzJwM-32rJQTc1dIwYqbD7TUANBWaUWUUms57dQkA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)\] And that is a quality women tend to be higher in ...

The relationship between job performance and the other 4 characteristics depends on the field.

But again, most of the other Big 4 are only weak predictors of job performance (that is, they predict performance to some degree, but usually not very strongly).

Tl;dr: So, given that:

a) there are only small personality differences on average in the Big 5 associated with men vs. women,

b) most personality characteristics are only small predictors of job performance (except for conscientiousness, which women tend to be higher on),

c) whereas intelligence is a very strong predictor of job performance (and there aren't significant differences between men and women in intelligence on average),

d) most jobs aren't intense physical labor jobs

It does seem kinda sexist to think:

&gt;there are traits more common in women versus men and these same traits make you more likely to succeed in certain jobs and industries.

when there is little evidence that there are such differences in qualities that have meaningful effects on job performance for most types of jobs."	3	False

Opiates, well, I don't know what I'd compare them to if you haven't tried them, but basically they are a different kind of depressant, the difference being opiates kill more pain relative to how fucked you are (i.e. compared to alcohol where to get significant pain relief you have to stone drunk). 


Most people think opiates are more euphoric and more addictive. Ironically though, the withdrawal from GABAergic depressants (benzos, alcohol, ambien, barbiturates etc) is a good deal *worse than that of opiates*. For one, opiate withdrawal rarely ever kills anyone, whereas GABAergic depressants are routinely life threatening in withdrawal. You can see why I am a chauvinist for opiates and stimulants and weed over GABAergics. 

&gt;Okay that's a lie I did DXM cough syrup in high school but I hated it 

Lol DXM isn't an opiate it's a dissociative.

&gt;And I've also heard alcoholics love benzos. How difficult would it be to alter that drug class to produce something with intentionally similar effects to alcohol?

There would be no reason to do this because the class of drugs is already extremely similar. Really the only major difference is that alcohol also produces a slight dissociative anti-NMDA effect at higher doses. You'd really have to try benzos to see what I mean, the effect is highly similar to being drunk, the difference is there is no ""full of alcohol"" feeling you feel me? No flushing and sweating and thirst and nausea and all those other things alcohol causes because of it's toxicity.

&gt;Essentially what I'm seeing in more stoner crowds is that they'll still drink even when they get high, but they'll drink considerably less. 

Exactly. This is probably a good thing seeing how low marijuana's toxicity is. However, to reinforce the point I was making, it also turns out that I smoke weed almost everyday. I can tell you that lack of toxicity is a big reason for why I use it so much.


Also if you liked my responses, would you consider awarding me a delta? You can give out more than one. I just want one TBH. And I think I did a better job than the guy who got one. What do you say?"	1	False

No one in my workplace is religious, the issue is never mentioned, people have an affiliation with their family heritage to the point that they may say ""my family is catholic, etc."" but non practice or outwardly believe in god as classically defined by any mainstream religion. Some may hold slight entertainment to the idea of higher power of destiny but this is besides the point.

I can pretty safely say (that barring one aunt) all of my family and friends are atheist or agnostic. 

Now this is not to say that religion is not practised here, within 500m of my house their is both a mosque and a church.

I have never seen or heard of an atheist (family, friend, acquaintance) confront or antagonize a believer. This is however not relevant to your opening statement as you are focusing on groups and organizations.

I have no real experience with groups promoting atheism outside of the net, however i personally admire the work they do from a distance.

[This BBC article gives a quite nice look at the sort of events happening inside the UK regarding the promotion of atheism, albeit not in my part of the country.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21319945)

I suspect a reason you feel atheist movements exist to antagonize religious ones, is because you are (being in the bible belt and all) at the forefront of their work. Where they can confront people who hold strong beliefs, but in a more stable environment than trying to promote atheism in say the middle east, Malaysia, Indonesia, south america etc.

Atheists groups however, do exist in these parts of the world, however they are very much using their on-line presence to forward their views as a necessity of personal preservation.

I do not doubt however that many atheists in your part of the world, are, for lack of a better term jerks. Their behaviour is most likely due largely to the fact that they hold a strong but unpopular opinion and feel they are young and have something to prove.

&gt; I'm only referring to young, straight, cis boys who do ballet, gymnastics, and play ""dress-up"". OR young girls who are straight, cis, but identify as ""tom-boys"" for a while. I don't think I need sources to back this us, as it's common knowledge that boys and girls can act like and have common interests in activities usually more appealing to the opposite sex. That is what I mean by ""gender-blurring"" behaviors. 

I agree that boys and girls can have common interests that are generally more associated with the other gender, of course. I don't think a single transgendered child who is serious about wanting to switch genders would base this urge entirely on an interest that they have which is generally more associated with the other gender. I think you'll agree that the dynamics between men and women differ in more ways than just our interests, but in our entire mindsets/behaviour, and I think a child who has spent some proper time around other peers of both genders can identify it when they feel far more related to one gender than to the other.

&gt;  I believe (I can look for sources later) that a prominent celebrity (like Gwyneth Paltrow or Madonna) hinted that they hoped their child was gay. 

I feel like this adresses not so much the stance of a child on their gender, as much as a few anecdotes about certain parents who had certain preferences for their kid's genders. I don't think anyone in this thread is arguing that parents should get to coerce their child into a different gender, and from what I'm reading here I don't think that was the intent of Gwyneth Paltrow either (parents often have preferences for a boy or a girl, that's not neccesarily something that is related to transgendered children I think). Of course, if she *were* to have those intentions, I'd agree that'd be problematic, but if we were to take away people's rights to do things because of a handful of individuals who wanted to exploit those rights, we'd probably be living in a non-democratic country.

&gt; Kids who learn music at a young age find learning new instruments (even into adulthood) to be much easier than an adult of the same age learning it for a first time. 

Kids who learn instruments at a young age do so because they have a natural attraction towards those interests, there are many situations of kids being coerced by parents into interests they don't like, and if you were to give them the choice of continuing those interests even after years of practice, they probably wouldn't continue persueing those interests despite their environment's influences (as someone who was the only kid in his friendgroup who didn't play soccer and had zero interest in it, I can somewhat attest to that). A kid who holds no interest in switching genders probably won't be convinced otherwise by their parents, and you can bet that medical experts will do a ton of research on a child (extensive talking with both child and parents, analyzing past child behaviours etc.) before approving such a drastic procedure as a gender operation.

In it, the hotel manager actively talks with leaders of the genocide, acting politely  and kindly. This allows him to have none of the sheltered to be killed and get his supplies in the hotel restocked. Even if it would be natural to be angry at auch a person, that doesn't mean you should be; when has insulting someone actually change their beliefs instead of just silencing them temporarily (""Punch a Nazi"" by youtuber Counter Arguments is a great watch that is helps explain this argument).
I would also like to point out that if, hypothetically, certain ethnic groups or religions etc were actually inferior (which isn't actually the case), wouldn't it seem reasonable to want them killed, especially if they unfairly held a higher social status: Nazis were able to take control of Germany because they placed Jews as a scapegoat for the economic depression Germany was facing, and many white supremacists and neo-Nazis come from poor rural areas where opportunities are low (this was the case for a school shooter from a post on r/beholdthemasterrace, who also faced bullying and problems at home). Even in the cases of racism and other forms of prejudice are people just ignorant of the facts, not inherently immoral. Answering your question directly, to white supremacists, black people are the enemy.
Finally, I would like to point out how meaningless political groups are: guns, homophobia, and libertarianism have very little to do with each other, as do pro-choice, legalizing weed, and socialism. While one side may be more correct than the other, even completely correct, isn't it strange how these rather meaningless political groups cluster: this is not the product of a ""logic mindset"" or something else more innate but individuals absorbing the ideas of those around them, with or without any evidence or reasoning. Basically, what is different about the way you obtained your beliefs makes you more correct? This is compared to how science is practiced, where those with conflicting hypotheses or theories work together, instead of against each other, to reach a meaningful conclusion (Hence, the in only thing that makes me a liberal is my stance on climate change and my atheism).
(TL;DR) In sumarry, respecting other's opinions, no matter how illogical, unethical, and immoral they may be, is better than getting angry; almost all people aren't inherently evil and their cause, which may be incorrect and immoral, is usually justified; and political groups rather than correlating with a mindset correlates with location."	3	False

&gt;And I believe the further right wing you go the more of what you earn is kept for yourself and who ever you choose (anarchy?)

Anarchism is about as far left as one can go. 
Anarchists are also usually socialists. This portion of the left has no government or money system. This also matches Marxism which houses the end state of society as stateless moneyless and classless. Also your boss extracts huge amounts of value you from you for your work so most capitalists are inherently benefiting from money they don't earn. This applies doubly so for landlords. 


On a fundamental level the left is about challenging and upturning current social hierarchies and the right is about maintaining or strengthening them. The Nazi's being all kinder kirche kuche and looking for a rebirth of a great Germany that never existed but was apparently taken from them by Jews, gays, communists, Romani, disabled people etc. fit perfectly into this notion of reinforcing a strict hierarchy and so belong to the right.

For example, a friend of mine is in law school and 1L GPA (and subsequent rank) is particularly important. She is doing the program part time and was still adjusting during the first semester. She did well but the curve put her lower in the class than she would like to be. She has viewed this semester as the way to make up the difference and get a GPA and ranking that is competitive for future jobs. If pass fail was mandatory, her top ranked classmates would coast to the best internships and journals on their first semester GPA even though she might have surpassed them if grades were still at stake. Having pass-fail be an opt in allows the grad school environment to stay competitive and give those who are struggling a way out without giving a free ride just to those who did better first semester.

I think it is also important to mention that there are MANY other things universities and professors are doing to help those who are struggling because of the circumstances. Deadlines have been moved, grading is more lenient, exams are being switched to open-notes. There are ways to help EVERYONE through this without only assisting those who were more successful first semester and denying those who have worked so hard this semester the opportunity to improve.

In terms of engaging the students - I agree that it should not be forced. Using grades to motivate participation is not ideal, for sure. However, the learning environment is undeniably different if half the students start not showing up to class because they can get enough of the material out of the slides to pass the tests. I am currently in a class that is taught by one of those professors who is most certainly brilliant but does not know how to teach. It has been a struggle of a semester for everyone and our first major test is this coming week. Having grades and GPAs still matter kept the class engaged during our first virtual lesson last week and made students invested enough to ask questions and clarifications that everyone benefited from. Yes the underlying motivation was understanding the material enough to get a good grade but if that then equates to more knowledge, I think it is worth it."	1	False

The computer interface and its associated avatars likely have more to do with this factor than you're giving credit for.

Is a high skill level simply the product of spending X amount of time practicing, and is that requirement for high skill only achievable by those with a certain amount of privilege afforded due to class, are those time requirements affected by genetic traits (such as intelligence) or co-ordination.

Then (let's assume for now skill is reflective of privilege required to spend time practicing) you'd have to show that higher skilled players were significantly more likely to attribute their success to their natural ability, than less skilled players do to their lack of success THEN you'll have to show that affects their treatment of other players online and you'll have to demonstrate the same accross several different games.

So let's go back to my first paragraph - How do you intend to demonstrate that player skill (assuming it correlates to class) is a more significant factor in community behavior, than a games design and structure of rewarding good/punishing bad behavior?

I sincerely don't think you'll be able to. I did my degree (Digital Art) dissertation on the affect of anonymity on disinhibitive behavior in virtual environments (Sorry - I've lost it) which spanned online dating communities through online role playing games and online shooters, and my findings were basically two-fold:

1 - Player behavior is largely dependent on the society/community of that game. If a player values that society, they are less likely to act in a way that causes their expulsion. (overt community punishment/reward on these issues a requirement in enforcing that).

Why are Creole or Geechee different from French, and what point would we say that a dramatic example like the one I linked is no longer English, but some sort of Scottish variant of English?

There are mostly interesting questions, but I don't see how any of them lead to the conclusion that languages have shifted or evolved *too far* to the point where they've crossed a line. For example, I don't see how knowing when, where, or why black people started saying ""I'm finna buy a car"" informs how acceptable or unacceptable the vernacular is. 

&gt;But then to look at that and say ""he's not even speaking English"" comes across as kind of a shitty thing to say. And that's what I don't know how to reconcile.

Well that's because you *do* know that he's speaking English. I'm sure you recognized that that post isn't in Spanish or Japanese or Czech. I don't see why you need to look at that and say ""it's not English"" when what you mean is ""I don't understand it."" You're having trouble reconciling this because you are wrongly assuming that the measure of whether something is English is whether *you* subjectively can understand it. 

To someone who doesn't understand basic AAVE, ""I'm finna cop a Rollie"" is not understandable, but clearly it's English. Materially, for our purposes, the difference between ""I'm finna cop a Rollie"" and ""Gies a a gobble ya gonk dafty wheelie"" isn't really about when the slangs diverged or why they did. The difference is a difference in *you the listener*, not a difference in the nature of the words. *That* is why there's no brightline test or clear point where we can say ""NOW it isn't English!"" It is all subjective to the listener."	1	False

I suppose it's because I know that not everyone will believe like I do. That's never been the case for anything. There will always be apathetic non-voters, and there will always be hardcore voters who see it as their patriotic duty. But the point is that just one more in either direction isn't going to change things. 

I suppose in a way you could look at this CMV as a form of political activism; if others here find my logic convincing (not the point of this sub, but lets just say) and decide not to vote because of it, and then influence others the same way, and then those others influence even more others the same way, *then* that might make a difference, because we're talking about thousands or millions of people, perhaps in states where their vote actually has power, deciding to be apathetic. But the same could be said about all those trying to CMV encouraging apathetic voters to vote, who influence others to vote, etc. 

But that's activism, not my actual vote. Indeed, I could champion the importance of voting and perhaps influence the election in that way, but not actually vote personally. 

And the power, the weight *I personally* give to others by not voting isn't significant. Less than not significant, it literally means nothing. The demographics in CA are just too blue.

A while ago I made a pact with myself to never be needlessly and directly responsible for the death of a living creature. This leaves me some leeway for things which are more or less necessary like eating food or smashing a black widow that's taken up residence in my home (being that the black widow poses a physical threat to myself).

But the idea was mainly to stop smashing insects/spiders without good reason. Given that the majority of spider and insect species in my neck of the world are non-toxic to humans and more or less harmless, I could no longer rationalize my knee-jerk reaction being to kill them just because they offended me by coming into close proximity with me.

Over time I've started to develop a certain empathy for those living creatures which I previously considered well beneath my consideration. Now I actually feel a little guilty if I accidentally kill a bug. The key difference is, if I killed a human I'd be broken up for years. When I kill a bug, I feel a little pang of guilt for a few seconds, then I move on.

Because even when I'm able to rationally accept that the bug has a right to life and that I should empathize with it, it's still intrinsically beneath my notice. It's too small. Too insignificant. Too unlike me.

So it's one thing to say that God can still care about us even though next to him we're just tiny insects. It's another thing entirely to try and quantify just *how much* he's capable of caring about us. It's entirely possible that he rationally recognizes our worth as living creatures, but doesn't rate our value as highly as we do for ourselves. We may yet be ants to him, that if he accidentally steps on he feels a little bad about, but in the end its just ""meh"" to him."	86	False

What makes student loans different than any other kind of loan? 

If tuition is not free, there should be public school programs where you can graduate debt free. Or, at least only using direct federal loans that offer income based repayment. Say, the flagship university in your state. Or make state universities open to all with federal subsidies to make it in state. Why should kids who grow up in states without good state universities not have the option to go to Berkeley, Michigan, UNC?

If loans were discardable, then either the government would have to improve the aid system to not shut out people or the market would come up with alternative offerings. They could offer a program that you pay X% of your earnings for x years. 

The other solution would be 0 interest loans. Borrow from the Fed’s, pay it back, but it doesn’t keep growing."	1	False

Moreover, for over a decade now there are people who practice a religion called Falun Gong who are persecuted and locked up. Most forms of religious expression are illegal in China and cannot be observed. There is no stability for the religious. 

Finally, China has the world's fastest rates of organ transplantation. This is because they murder and harvest the organs of political dissents and religious prisoners. Escapees from reeducation camps have alleged that their families are disappearing and that they're being killed for their organs. When they're admitted to the concentration camps in Xinjiang they have their blood sampled and go through a thorough medical exam and their records are maintained for the benefit of communist party members.

I don't think it's fair at all to compare the homophobia to other phobias. Homosexual people/the concept of homosexuality are not inherently dangerous, nor have they ever caused substantial emotional, psychological, or physical harm to humans in history ever.

  Evolutionary psychology logically explains why many humans have an inherent fear of spiders or snakes (basically a history of learning why interaction between us and spiders, snakes etc is bad), though the same cannot be said for homosexual people.

There's a lot of room for nuance, and a lot of room for people to get seriously violated when a very fine, and moveable, line is crossed. Grace was rushed into a sexual encounter before she had time to think, and faced with a sexual partner who presumably had inherent power over her by status, and arguably also by gender. That isn't to say Aziz intentionally exerted power over her (in fact I highly doubt that) or even that Grace felt he ""had power over her."" But, people generally aim to avoid disappointing others, and this certainly must have been exaggerated for Grace by the fact she was with a celebrity (even though we're unsure of her status).

Both partners in a sexual encounter have equal responsibility in making *sure* the other is consenting, and I would argue that that responsibility is *much* more valuable than the responsibility of either partner to be confident enough to explicitly say no. There was no question what Aziz wanted; he got her up on the counter and was about to grab a condom right off the bat. I don't believe Aziz did his duty to make sure she wanted sex. Maybe she was actually into making out and having a ""you could give me a backrub"" kind of experience, but consent to one thing is not consent to everything. Consent can even be revoked, but it can be difficult to come out with a firm ""hey, I changed my mind."" If someone straight up stopped kissing you, would you think everything was fine and just keep going? Saying ""hey let's chill,"" repeatedly drawing her hand away and supposedly being a little lackluster, and saying ""I don't want to feel forced"" all would've been pretty good points for Aziz to not *keep asking her for blowjobs and sticking his fingers down her throat*. No, it certainly doesn't sound like Grace was ever aggressively forced to do anything and this was not rape. But Aziz taking advantage (again, perhaps unknowingly) of Grace's complacency, checking for consent by performing sexual acts rather than just asking, is some form of unacceptable sexual violation, and potential social/sexual ineptness on Aziz's part isn't an excuse for that. My point in my last comment was that this can be considered a failing of society and doesn't have to make him a bad person, but that perspective doesn't make the situation any less serious."	3	False

No college (as far as I know here in my country) teaches Blender, and if you'd want to learn it yourself you'd have to learn through googling courses or tutorials. Not an easy way to learn sure, but if it was incorporated into school curriculums, I'm sure it'd be the standard. Why?  


That's where we get into your next point of view. No. Autodesk Maya was never a better product in regards to modelling, sculpting, retopology, animation, and even rendering. Blender is ahead of that gap you're talking about. It never was a superior software. It's only standard because of their poor business practices (making 3ds Max free at the beginning &gt; then buying off Maya as a competitor in 2005 and mass advertising, only to change the licenses for both programs when it became industry standard) and history. Because of it being freely available at the beginning along with 3ds Max and Cinema 4d It was seen as stand-alone softwares, each performing for a dedicated purpose in VFX production and companies digged that. Heck, even now Autodesk and Adobe is still trying to buy off Blender.  


Why is that important though? It's just history. It's useless in terms of productivity. Nope. Autodesk Maya's decline in development is due to this locked closed-source licence that Autodesk has put it through In the years since 2005 up to now, what big update can you give me that was ahead of its time, and game changing in terms of 3d development? Heck they didn't even catch-up on implementing quaternion rotations until 2018 which Blender had been developing as early as 2015 and was able to fully utilize just a year later. Blender's sculpting tools also had always been far superior. Albeit not on the level of Zbrush (without addons that is) and do I even have to talk about the spaghetti code of Maya causing unecessary crashes?   


Sure there is a dedicated team for Maya, but Autodesk's funding is not dedicated for Maya alone. Better support? Better IT Enablement?  Blender is open-source. It has no limits to the backing that addon developers and python programmers provide. Blender even have multiple communities dedicated to providing new content and insights on the current version. And those are just users, providing content for retail or just because they felt like giving back to the community. Look up MasterXeon and Bartosz Styperek. Just two of the prominent figures in Blender addon development in a sea of other dedicated developers.  


I would agree however that it's a bad choice to integrate Blender in established company pipelines for one reason only. They'd have to turn basically all their 3d artists into interns. Autodesk chose financial gain and business manipulation instead of staying true to the path of game development. They treat the industry as cold business, and that sickens me to the core. Because that's the same reason why industries tend to crumble. Because of companies looking to overthrow their competitors, instead of using the competition as a basis for the development of their product. A fed horse wouldn't run faster in a race. Advertising and manipulating the market to dress up their software to be the best wouldn't magically make it so. Starting companies is a whole different story though."	1	False

Maybe a broader campaign such as this with posters about various different mental illnesses could be a good idea, although it would absolutely lead to the biggest wave of hypochondria we’ve ever seen lmao

There’s another point to be made here too, which is that people with depression and/or anxiety are less likely to think they have any sort of disorder at all. As someone who’s struggled with both, I can confirm. It wasn’t until my early 20s that I realized my feelings weren’t shared by everyone else. I really thought my crippling depression and anxiety were natural symptoms of being a human, and I know others feel the same. In part because the disorders are so common but also because many use the words to describe mundane feelings. 

If you have schizophrenia, you know *something* is up. You may not suspect you have that exact illness, but a person seeks treatment for schizophrenia based on immediate need, not desire. 

BPD *can* be like that if it’s Type I and/or hurting your everyday life. Type II is a bit trickier to pin down, but will read as typical depression for many who have it. 

If your view is simply that there should be more awareness for less-common mental illnesses, sure, I don’t want to change that.

I also believe that, rather than praising these people, either because we genuinely believe they're doing good work or because we're afraid of being labeled racist ourselves, we should actively discourage it, because at best it accomplishes nothing, and at worst it has a slightly negative effect in that if those people are satisfying themselves with fake confrontations and fake debates, they're being just as derelict in their duty to fight injustice as the people they're lecturing, where they could be doing something productive instead.

If so, this seems more like a complaint about who holds power than about the power itself. If not, can you please clarify?

Sounds like you're close to answering your own question.

I think most anarchists, myself included, would argue there is a distinction to be made between 'government' and 'state'. With government being the natural organization of human beings into groups as an efficient or, likely, necessary means of survival. Of course, within even the most basic 'governments', power and rules or laws will develop as a means of maintaining social cohesion and ensuring group success. There may even be individuals within a group that wield greater power than others as a result of individual traits like physical or mental prowess.

Many anarchists see the 'state' as a perversion of humanities natural tendency to form societies, in that, 'states' aggregate power into the hands of a small group of people if not a single person (elite(s)). It's at this point that Lord Acton's adage; ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely"" comes into effect. When a small group of elites have an monopoly over the use of violence in a society, the remainder of the population is necessarily obliged to serve the needs of the elites at the expense of their own (see: every state since Mesopotamia).

As a personal aside; Anarchist theory works for me because it goes a long way in explaining the problems of our current social and political condition. It does so by starting with a hyper-critical framework that demands we take nothing at face value. In addition Anarchism, in my opinion presupposes that humans are inherently good, caring and altruistic. Our species thrived for 195,000ish years before the advent of the 'state' as we know it today. If a stateless life was indeed 'nasty', 'brutish' and 'short' it seems unlikely we would ever have come this fall in the first place. Some lives without the state would certainly be nasty brutish and short, but some lives within the state are just that as well."	13	False

&gt;But beyond that, your argument kind of aligns with the ""if you did it while you were drunk, you wanted to do it sober"" argument. Anonymity and alcohol remove inhibitions and considerations, and saying that what you do without those things defines who you are is just not true. Because your inhibitions and desire for social acceptance are a part of you too.

I have the mindset of the ""if you did it while you were drunk, you wanted to do it sober"" argument. But I don't see how it applies to this context? Alcohol actively dulls your senses, while anonymity doesn't. Your inhibitions and desire for social acceptance are a part of you wanting to be able to chat with people politely irl, but not when showing your true self online."	1	False

This makes it much easier for the president to govern effectively. 

The United States is a huge, diverse country. People in Massachusetts, Alabama, California, and Wisconsin have some very different cultural and political assumptions from one another. If you've grown up in one part of the country and move to another, you notice this pretty quickly. Your new neighbors think of themselves as true Americans and speak the same language (maybe with a funny accent), but they structure their lives based on different assumptions.

Presidents face the nearly impossible challenge of needing to simultaneously appeal to the whole of this diverse country. Even if a part of the country doesn't love his/her policies, they still need to respect him/her to some extent. They have to feel that the president is still their president. Otherwise, the union is weakened and may fall apart. This is a real risk. In the election of 1860, Lincoln became president with his support almost entirely from the Northern free states. The South seceded almost immediately afterwards.

The electoral college is a kludgy but reasonably effective way to force presidential candidates to appeal to as many different parts of this diverse country as possible. Candidates face two basic choices when they campaign: appeal to people who may not currently support you, and increase turnout and enthusiasm from those that already do support you. A pure popular vote system gives an advantage to the second strategy. Rather than spend a lot of time and resources convincing the few people on the fence, you can instead use those resources to get the most turnout possible out of the people already on your side. If you're a Democrat, that means appealing to liberal voters in California and New York to increase your vote share in those states from 65% to 70%. Even if that turns off moderates in Ohio and decreases your vote share from 50% to 48%, you are coming out ahead.

The electoral college puts on a limit on the effectiveness of this tactic. After you pass 50% of the votes in a state, there's no benefit to winning by a greater amount. So instead, candidates are forced to focus their efforts on convincing voters that don't already agree with them. If you're a conservative, you will want to moderate your platform to try to get your vote share in Ohio from 49% to 51%. Even if your base is less excited and your margin in Alabama falls from 70% to 65%, you are coming out ahead.

I think these kinds of tactical changes are healthy for having an actually effective government. With a pure popular vote, it would be possible to win the election by appealing strongly to a particular narrow segment of the country. Even if this alienates everyone else, as long as your segment can deliever 50.1% of the votes cast you will come out ahead. In contrast, the electoral college forces you to appeal to a broader cross-section. You can't win if 51% of the population loves you and 49% hates you. You need to get most of the country to be at least pretty ok with you.

Given how diverse this country is, I think having a reasonably broad appeal is necessary to being able to govern the country effectively. I think we are better off with a president who got 49.9% of the popular vote but has pretty even support across the country vs. a president who gets 50.1% of the vote but who the rest of the country absolutely hates. That's not perfectly fair, but it's a price I'm willing to pay."	72	False

I don't think it's the concept of Stranger Danger that has done harm, it's the way kids are taught to respond to the potential threat of an unknown person. It is too extreme. 

There is nothing wrong with being wary of people you don't know, but children should be taught to be polite, conversational and self-confident when interacting with strangers. They should not be taught to be scared. Rather than learning to manage the inherent risk in all situations involving the unknown, children are often completely sheltered from the unknown, and THAT is what has caused harm. 

It's reasonable to teach a child never to leave a place with someone other than the adult they came with. To confirm with a caregiver before opening the front door. To remain in the front yard/cul-de-sac with their friends. To always check with Mum/Dad before they accept a gift. That the only people who should touch them in certain places are Mum/Dad (up until a certain age). It is also reasonable to tell them that if they ever feel scared about something someone else is doing that there is no shame in running away and telling Mum/Dad. 

Those last three also apply to people they know. As I said at the beginning, the person most likely to hurt a child is someone they already know. The child snatching incidents that make the news and created this Stranger Danger myth are actually very uncommon. 

It is not reasonable or helpful to tell children to never speak to strangers or that strangers ""might be bad people who will hurt you"". 

I have worked as a teacher and as a nanny, and the most well-adjusted kids are those who are taught to manage risk rather than avoid it. It's not Stranger Danger that has caused harm, it's the delusion that avoiding strangers will remove any danger to the child.
