11	"&gt;It's all based on weight.

This is, interestingly, still true for certain coins. $1 weighs the same in dimes, quarters, or fifty cent pieces - 22.68 grams. I don't know the significance of that weight, but it's about 3/4 ounce.

But it's not true for British coins, pre-decimal or decimal. 

Coin | Weight | £1 weight
---|---|----
Quarter-farthing | 1.2 grams | 4608 grams
Third-farthing | 1 gram (variable) | 2880 grams
Half-farthing | 2.3 grams | 4416 grams
Farthing | 2.83 grams | 2716.8 grams
Halfpenny | 5.67 grams | 2721.6 grams
Penny | 9.45 grams | 2220 grams
3 Halfpence | 0.71 grams | 113.6 grams
Twopence | 56.7 grams | 6804 grams
Threepence | 1.415 grams (silver) | 113.2 grams
Sixpence | 2.83 grams | 113.2 grams
Shilling | 5.66 grams | 113.2 grams
Florin | 11.31 grams | 113.1 grams
Half crown | 14.14 grams | 113.12 grams

The higher denominations are, within a rounding error, close to the weight being a decent proxy for the value. You'll notice, though, that the weight of a British pound for those coins is actually four ounces. The lower values are wildly inconsistent in terms of weight-to-value.

&gt;Want to convert your coin for someone else's coin?

Only works for currencies where the value comes out to fractions of the pound.

&gt;Want to split the bill three ways?

Inflation has taken a lot of the value out of the smaller coins. It's not worth it for me to squabble over a difference in the bill of one penny.

&gt;with as few coins as possible? 

There's a trade off here: I can give exact change in a decimal system with a single coin as long as I have a coin for each $0.01 increment. I don't think people want to deal with that many coins.

17	"&gt;However, rocks have the problem of supply. If you are in an open plain instead of a mountain setting, then rocks are not going to be plentiful. In that case, your giant has to collect and transport rocks from another location. This decreases their ability in helping you transport other elements of your baggage train that would otherwise move much more slowly, or not be able to traverse difficult terrain such as rivers or steep slopes. Additionally, if they collect rocks ahead of time and pile them on the battlefield this presents two problems.

&gt;1. Your giant is now stationary. All their ammunition is in one place and they have to stay fairly close to it in order to re-arm. This creates problems when the front lines inevitably shift one way or the other, decreasing the efficacy of your giant. Alternatively, they could carry their bag of rocks on their back, but this would handicap them and slow their already pretty slow speed.
2. Enemy combatants now have a step stool up to more critical, and less protected, areas of your giant. If your giant is standing next to a pile of rocks they are throwing, enemies could potentially climb it and increase their likelihood of damaging the giant.

This is actually a rather good argument !Delta

OP probably feels constrained to act a certain way. It's possible that there is a lot of political and institutional power that backs up the crying subject. If the OP does not make decisions in accordance to the person crying, he might face sanctions. In this way, crying people (perhaps) direct a large body of power against someone like OP.

why? in the end, only people pay taxes. if mcdonalds pays  more taxes next year, they pass that cost onto their employees and owners (stockholders) in the from of lower wages or profits, or onto customers in the form of higher prices or a lesser quality product.

I believe that our sneaky politicians put the corporate tax in place to to raise taxes for individuals without them knowing. they manipulate the population into thinking corporations need to ""pay their fair share"", when in reality it is individuals paying taxes. they take advantage of those who don't or can't think for themselves.

One point I do want to make is that drug addiction and something like Internet addiction are not directly comparable.

28	"&gt; I think this highlights my concern about allowing the DNC to become a more conservative body.

In the grand scheme of things, the DNC is more progressive now than at any point in history. Biden and Pelosi were once among the most leftist members of Congress. By definition, the progressive ideas of today become the moderate views of tomorrow and the conservative views of next week. Every new generation is more progressive than the last, and the old eventually die off. So the progressives of today become the conservatives of tomorrow.

&gt; it is imperative that we choose leaders that realize our concerns and work to enact them in a meaningful way.

You can do that, but you aren't competing against Republicans here. You are competing against 6-7 generations of Democrats (people who are between the ages of 30 and 80). Vote blue no matter who gets you to vote for relative moderates in presidential elections, and them to vote for relative progressives in congressional elections. The young progressive congressional leaders of today become the presidential candidates of tomorrow.

&gt; The DNC is supposed to be a body concerned with creating a just society that supports all of it's citizens (to myself at least) 

It does that, but so does the RNC by their standards.

&gt; and I feel that it is slowly and methodically moving in the opposite direction.

It will always feel like that until your generation runs the DNC (or renames it and runs that organization).

&gt; An example of this would be the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. This was enacted by Bill Clinton and endorsed by many Democrats in the House and Senate. 

Yup, it was an relatively progressive idea during Reagan's time. Then it became a center-left idea during Clinton's time. Clinton had to veto 2 more conservative acts before he could negotiate with Newt Gingrich to pass this one.

&gt; The result was widely viewed as detrimental and resulted in a rise in the numbers of children living in extreme poverty ( UC Davis Center for Poverty Research ).

First off, it could have been worse. The Republicans wanted to pass things even worse for children in poverty. Next, Republicans saw it as a success because it saved money for taxpayers. Success depends on which metrics you use. Next, Clinton was able to pass other laws that benefited impoverished children (such as the Children's Health Insurance Program). Finally, not all ideas pan out. Sometimes you have an idea that you hope will work, test it out, and it turns out to suck. But hopefully, the successes make up for the failures.

Vote blue no matter who is not meant to be amazing. It's meant to be a tiny step in the right direction. Everyone fantasizes about get rich quick schemes, crash diets that will help them lose 20 pounds in a weekend, and political revolutions that will fix everything overnight. But real change is slow, boring work. But the upside is that it reliably leads to long term positive change.

33	"First of all there is no clear cut definition of ""white people"". Although it generally means people of pure European ancestry and genetics, there are an infinite number of people who skirt this definition. What about people from Colombia or Venezuela with mostly Spanish ancestry with some Indigineous admixture who look mostly European? Or people from Turkey, Lebanon, or Tunisia who have a large variety in phenotype who can look the same as Italians or Greeks? 

All of these people may look white just passing on the street and be treated as white in some scenarios, but they may experience other forms of racial discrimination due to their name or culture being considered of lower socioeconomic status and be treated any other non-white person in other situations.

Also, not counting the more obvious example of someone with a mixed background with a white parent and a let's say a black parent. In some situations they feel more connection to their white side, and in some situations they feel more strongly with their black side, and sometimes they feel alienated from either. There are many accounts of biracial individuals reporting these feelings.

That being said, ""person of color"" is a nice and convenient way to summarize people who suffer from some amount of ""non-European ethno-genetic injection "" (color) and racial discrimination. Replacing it with ""non white"" denies the fact that some people experience racism sometimes and then experience some amount of white privilege other times.

[The amount of people directly employed in agriculture has dropped from 70 - 80% in 1870 to less than 2% in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States#Employment). This is a process that is in different stages in different parts of the world; these differences are some of the most clear indicators of economic development there are.

43	"&gt; I'm at a complete loss as to how you can conclude that a fetus is not in the world just because we celebrate the day of its birth. What do you make of Jehovah's Witnesses who do not celebrate birthdays? Are their children *never* in the world because nobody has celebrated their birth? That seems absurd. Whether or when we celebrate birth is completely irrelevent to whether or not we are in the world. As long as we exist in the world, regardless of where in the world we exist--whether inside or outside the womb--we are in the world. If women are in the world, and wombs are in women, then wombs are in the world. In the same way, if wombs are in the world, and fetuses are in wombs, then fetuses are in the world. They exist in the world. 

What I was trying to say is, how can you consider the fetus being in the world, when it literally has no form of living, deciding or anything because it is fully dependent on the mother? What you say is kind of proving my point. Women are in the world, wombs are in the world, fetuses are in the world, yet I don't see any fetuses around me, walking the same streets as I am. Obviously, they can't do that, can they. So why do they have the same rights as the women walking the streets? This is where I cease to see the equality.

&gt; You didn't answer my question. Is this a good justification for killing a two year old? If not, then what's the difference? The difference is in whether you consider the two year old or the unborn to be innocent human beings. If it is, then you can't kill it just to spare it a poor quality of life. So the question comes down, not to whether it has anything to look forward to or not, but whether it's an innocent human being. If you're not addressing question, then you're not addressing the argument. You're just saying something that's irrelevant. 

You didn't answer my question either of these times. Obviously, killing a two year old is murder. No matter how old the person is, it's murder. What I'm getting at here is I don't see fetuses as their own people. Human? Biologically, yes. Deserving rights? No. That is the most basic problem pro life and pro choice see. 

&gt; You say I missed your point, but you didn't say where my analogy went wrong. So I'll just respond again with the same analogy. From what I see, you would be willing to take away the safe options, you'd rather the bank robber die than letting him rob the bank and maybe try to make honest money once he's gotten a good education."" Do you see the problem with your argument? Your argument only works if you've already assumed there's nothing gravely immoral about taking the life of the unborn. If it's a serious moral wrong, like robbing banks, then you're not justified in making it legal just so it'll be safer to do it. In what other area would you ever say that we should make it illegal to do something that's heinously wrong just so it'll be safer to do it? Maybe *you* missed *my* point. 

My point still stands. Fetuses do not have the same rights as people who can think for themselves. If a mother goes to rob the bank to provide for her unborn because she can't afford it otherwise, would that make the bank robbery legal? Because she's doing it for the child? Obviously not. So now she can't have an abortion but she can't provide for the child either. Both of them now might die from starvation.

The bank robber has a choice. He can work hard, put himself through school and get the money that way. He tries, but fails because his previous education is too low. He can try and ask his family if they would be willing to help him pay rent for the month, because he wants to put himself through school. But no one helps him, so he robs the bank and dies in the process.

A mother finds out she is pregnant. She used birth control every single time she had sex with her partner. The mother is 19 years old, she is a student who works part time. She informs her partner of her pregnancy and he leaves. Her family disowns her because they do not believe in sex before marriage. She has a part time job that barely pays the rent. She has to leave school. She tries to find a better job but fails. She can not afford to raise a child. She can not afford hospital care. She gets an unsafe abortion and dies. She never got to finish school, she never got to have children when she married.

In both of these cases, the ""bad"" thing was the last possible option. You shouldn't get to choose what other people should do. That is what I believe in.

&gt; Abortion does not involve removing a living baby, and just leaving it there on the table to die. No, they cut the fetus in half, suck out its brain, dismember it, fry it with acid, blend it up, etc. They kill it. They don't merely remove it. They kill it, THEN remove it. You don't stab grandpa, you don't cut him up, you don't stick him in a vat of acid, THEN remove his life support. You just remove his life support. And you do it because he's terminally ill and has no hope of coming out of it, unlike a healthy fetus who has every hope of going through every stage of human development. 

Yes, that is how abortions work. I don't stab grandpa, because there is the option of harmlessly letting him go. But abortions are also harmless, so your only point here is that they are ""brutal"". If they weren't, would you be okay with them? 

Right here you say that the fetus is healthy. But what if it isn't? Fetal alcohol syndrome, drug addiction, bad diet during pregnancy are all existing factors that harm the fetus. Would you be okay with a drug addict getting an abortion?

&gt; Thank you for that concession. Now should look into how abortions are performed. 

I do know how abortions are performed, no need to worry. I still don't find abortions wrong, because my perception of what is humane and what isn't differs from yours.

48	"&gt; So would you say that forgiveness may be impossible in a given moment

I don't know that I use such a limiting word like ""impossible"", but I do believe that for some people with traumas that struck them hard, having a goal of moving on very quickly isn't very realistic.  You wouldn't expect someone to get over the sudden unexpected death of a loved one in a week.

I wouldn't say impossible though. Suppose you took someone struggling hard with a trauma and they went and got a fresh start somewhere.  Moved to a different country, got a new job that keeps them very busy, introduce them to a new group of friends. A clean break and a whirlwind of activity could make the trauma fall by the wayside and give them no time to feel resentful.  By the time things slow down again, they may find it is no longer an issue or is something that can easily be compartmentalized into their past life.  But this type of approach isn't realistic for a lot of people to attempt and may end up backfiring if you end up super lonely in the new country and nothing but time on your hands to stew about the past trauma.  This could just end up isolating you from your existing support network that is needed especially if you don't find a new support network.

So, I still wouldn't say impossible, just not very realistic for some.

53	"The goal of feminism is to bring the rights and expectations of women in society to be equal with those of men. While women’s rights are historically less than they are today, make no mistake, there are still a lot of places where men are more powerful than women by statute and by socialization. Feminism still has a place. For example, #MeToo is a result of feminism.

As others have pointed out, egalitarianism is a similar concept that seeks to bring about equality for all. There are places in society where women have more power than men. Parental rights is one place where this is true almost everywhere in western law. Also, emotional expression for men is frowned upon by society but that’s changing. 

Both concepts can exist without excluding the other. Feminism is not concerned with dragging men down, but with lifting women up. Anyone who claims to be a feminist and makes it their goal to hurt men is not a real feminist. That sentiment would have more in common with movements like white power where they seek power rather than equality. However, power in society doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. Women can earn respect without reducing the respect men receive. Women can earn equal wages without reducing men’s wages. But it can also be played as a zero sum game where one side tries to tear down the other in order to increase relative power rather than absolute power. 

Feminism and egalitarianism seek to increase and equalize the absolute power and reduce the relative differences between groups by raising the position of marginalized groups, not by tearing down those in power.

62	"A couple of concerns:

&gt; However, recent work suggests that more open primary systems designed to encourage moderate, independent voters to participate have little effect on legislators’ ideologies (Bullock and Clinton 2011; McGhee et al. 2014). A possible reason for this null effect could be the fact that ideological donors remain a constant influence regardless of the composition of the primary electorate.  Thus, candidates still face financial incentives to remain extreme regardless of
the primary system in their state. We can further evaluate these claims by looking at the ideological congruence between legislators and voters of the same party, since these voters are the majority of the primary electorate.

There's a problem here, isn't there?  The researchers are trying to see if elected candidates are more extreme because of donors or because of primary voters.  To do this, they want to look at SAME PARTY voters.  But ""same-party voters are the majority of the primary electorate"" does NOT imply ""the median same-party voter is REPRESENTATIVE of primary voters,"" because of the thing they mention: primary voters are unusually extreme.

This is also a problem in that many voters are 'moderate' not because they're *truly moderate*, but rather because apathy and disengagement are negatively correlated with extremism.  In other words, people who don't care or know much about politics tend to rate themselves in the middle of scales.

I'm not an expert in Bayesian statistics, so I can't comment much about their model, but I buy their argument about the validity of their point estimates.

Also, let's think about things, a little.  Democrat senators are *more extremely left* than their constituent voters, and that makes them more similar to their donors.  So even if we do assume the donors are pulling the senators to the left, think about what economic and social policies exist on the left.  If you were correct, wouldn't these senators would get pulled to the RIGHT... towards free-market values and tax cuts for the wealthy?"	15	['are negatively correlated', 'would get pulled']	2	2	0.13333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are negatively correlated', 'would get pulled']	2	2	0.13333333333333333	1	31519343399	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/auph5b/_/eh9sx0n/	656238863	31519141587.0	2019-02-25 19:02:27	54874256.0	PreacherJudge	3	False	328	1	False	True	50.67

Indeed, in the case of unified characters, which is why my opinion is that such unified characters do deserve different codepoints, just as that &lt;ſ&gt; deserves a different codepoint, despite having been historically unified with &lt;s&gt;.

&gt; didn't expect that hehe. well disregard this point then.

Yes, if proper names actually had a canonical form of characters rather than being constantly altered I would have believed they were fundamentally different as well.

This is largely why I believe that *katakana* does deserve it's own codepoints from *hiragana* and is not comparable to simple italization, as some names are actually properly spelt in *katakana*, or even a combination, which is a proper part of what could be an identically pronounced name, much like “Stephen” and “Steven” are.

&gt; still, the overall idea that mixing the characters together would be problematic in the same way as 具 is problematic still kind of stands

I am not sure why it gives more problems than all the different typefaces of the Latin script though, provided, of course, as I said that actually different characters that became obsolete or otherwise merged do retain a distinct codepoint."	7	['having been historically unified', 'being constantly altered', 'are actually properly spelt']	3	3	0.42857142857142855	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['having been historically unified', 'being constantly altered', 'are actually properly spelt']	3	3	0.42857142857142855	1	34626323105	7	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/hjm5cm/_/fwnm9wh/	1060871062	34626282820.0	2020-07-01 23:50:55	487977330095.0	behold_the_castrato	1	False	198	5	False	True	42.75

82	"Whilst I wish what you said were true, the glaring issues, specifically with guiding principle 3 highlights some very real flaws in the paper.  Whether it's deliberate or accidental, you can't have a core principle that strongly suggests *all* trans people can compete safely with males by highlighting a form of medical transition used by transgender men, and not by transgender women, when, lets be honest, it's transgender women that people are worried about.

It highlights either a lack of due diligence or a strong bias.  I'm inclined towards the later, but that's just my personal opinion. The principle is misleading and actively decreases inclusion, whilst increasing risk to transgender women, and that's true whether or not it's bias or oversight.

The goal was to provide advice on how to deal with trans athletes, but I don't see any goal towards in inclusion in the outcomes.

83	"&gt;This is not at all what dominance is. Dominance, in game theory terminology, is simply a strategy (which just means the dollar value picked in this case) that always gets the best payout, regardless of what the other player does.

Fair enough, ""dominance"" in that sentence might be read as trying to ""dominate the opponent"" while dominance in terms of the article that the word links to, just means that the strategy is dominant in terms of beating any other strategy given a particular choice. That being said in it's result it's still just about control and winning the game, so it's not entirely wrong.

&gt;This is still not a zero-sum game, because there is a net loss of 2 dollars of value.

Correct, a zero or constant-sum game would actually not have a net negative, what I meant is rather the [""zero-sum-thinking""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking) (one players loss is another's gain and vice versa) when in reality it could also be a win-win situation.

&gt;Hmm, looking at this comparison, she is never going to pick some of our top choices, and similarly we are never going to pick some of hers. So, cross referencing, we get the following table.

If one applies that logic here, it begs the question why one hasn't applied it earlier and already ruled out the options that were detrimental to the opponent (0s and 1s), because if they were not going to pick those, why pretend as if they were? And instead picked those that were rationally the highest within their respective row. Which then would lead you to the diagonal payout matrix:


|  x  |   **$4**   |    **$3**   |    **$2**   |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **$4**  |   4,4   |       |       |
|  **$3** |      |    3,3   |       |
|  **$2** |      |      |    2,2   | 

And within that matrix it would be rationally the best option to pick 4,4. Of course if that were the case and you can somewhat reasonably assume them picking 4, then picking 3 would be the best option, aso. Which either throws you into a loop or forces you to irrationally trust (4,4) or distrust (2,2) the opponents choice.
With 2,2 being the choice where you are expecting the least surprises as you are sure to get at least what you expected (2) or better. While taking into account a pretty heavy loss if you take the travellers dilemma and set:

|  x  |   **$100**   |    **$99**   |    **$2**   |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **$100**  |   100,100   |  97,101     | 0,4      |  
|  **$99** |  101,97    |    99,99   |   0,4    |       
|  **$2** |   4,0   |  4,0    |    2,2   |    

Just changing the numbers here because due to coincidence the case of 2,x and x,2 would have the same or better outcomes as the cooperations (diagonal). However if you increase the numbers for the top payout that is no longer the case. Which in principle doesn't change anything in terms of maximizing your score disregarding the other player's choice, but massively changes the outcome if you take into account the other players choice and try to maximize your output. 

So I still have my doubts on the ""rationality"", to be precise on the idea that this is the only rational approach to that game. I highly appreciate your effort in exampling that though and I can certainly see a value in having such an algorithm. That being said, I still have doubts on the usefulness of those experiments with real people and especially given the idea that strategies outside of the Nash equilibrium are called and treated as ""irrational"". That's not trying to get caught up in semantics, but if you assume that there is no logic behind picking anything other than 2,2 then you're kind of making the conclusion before having run the experiment, aren't you?"	21	['might be read', 'are called', 'get caught']	3	3	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['might be read', 'are called', 'get caught']	3	3	0.14285714285714285	1	32533071784	13	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/crluzx/_/ey1cmug/	771963693	32524131930.0	2019-08-24 22:20:55	52616488742.0	Us3rn4m34lr34dyT4k3n	1	False	632	3	True	True	52.73

They have emotional and sexual needs to attend to, but they can certainly feed and clothe and take care of themselves in those basic respects. I agree that there's sometimes some opportunity costs to one's career to having children, but this can be mitigated by daycare, school, and/or having a stay-at-home spouse. Also, having a satisfying personal life is often essential to performing well at work.

2. Are you saying that self-fulfillment and happiness are overrated? Or that having relationships and children do not produce those benefits to the degree that justifies having them? I doubt you think the former, since it's ridiculous. So in the latter case, I'll say that while this may be true for you, you have no basis for saying it's true or not about anyone else. Tons of people get a lot of happiness from relationships and children. It's perfectly fine if you're not one of them, but don't project this onto everyone else.

Second, the ""unjustifiable"" downsides you mention don't hold up. There are tons of people with partners and children who still travel and retire and have comfortable incomes.

People don't get older and come to accept the downsides. People know the downsides for the most part, and they've decided that the benefits (often greatly) outweigh any potential drawbacks.

90	"&gt; That may be the difference here - in the US such restrictions are enforceable so long as you can produce a legitimate reason for such an exclusion.

Well then it wouldn't be ""unreasonable"" would it ;)

&gt; Putting aside the legality of marijuana for a moment, given the obvious debilitating effects of the drug on many cognitive functions and the difficulty in establishing when said drug was consumed using conventional testing, an employer would be able to put a fairly easy case together that an outright prohibition is the only way to ensure that their employees are not using the drug at times when it could affect their work. Such a prohibition is very likely to be enforced by the US courts.

I think the issue is one of an over-reach. Yes, ensuring that your employees are not impaired on marijuana during work hours is a valid objective. But that doesn't mean that you should be able to enact whatever kind of invasive policy that you want to ensure that objective. That over-reach would bring it into the realm of ""unreasonableness."" Not to mention the fact that there are other, less invasive ways of accomplishing this objective -- actually observing the work the person is doing, for example.

&gt; Perhaps, but I would rather leave that in the hands of the employer and the employee to work out for themselves rather than have the government get involved. A person is not entitled to a specific job and an employer is entitled to determine the type of person that they want working for their company. Many firms already show they don't care about recreational drug use (by not doing any form of drug testing) and I doubt that would change after legalization. If you are the type of person that wants to enjoy marijuana recreationally, then part of the outcome of that decision is you have to accept that you will not be able to work for some employers. That is a very reasonable tradeoff.

I don't necessarily disagree. The reasoning given by courts up here is that an employee very rarely truly understands the terms that they are agreeing to, and are almost never in a situation where the bargaining power between the two parties is equal. They want the job, they need the job, and will agree to basically anything -- even something grossly unreasonable -- in order to secure employment. This is an exploitable position and the court tends to sympathize with the employee's position.

I should say that it's a totally different ballgame for a senior person who negotiates terms of employment using legal counsel (or, for that matter, in the union context).

93	"&gt;	Why is a parent taking away their child’s autonomy ok?

Because they are a child and unable to make certain decisions for themselves, and parents are in a privileged position due to biology and law. Eventually this condition is expected to end and that sort of thing shouldn't be reinstated lightly. Certainly you can't just decide to give yourself parental authority over another adult.

&gt;	What is an example of invasion of privacy?

Hiding cameras in a bathroom. Finding out information which is both desired and expected to be private. Making up that information isn't an invasion of privacy because while someone can imagine what you look like on the toilet it isn't the same as filming you there.

&gt;	Am I a shitty person for lying to the Nazis about me hiding Jews?

Lying is still wrong but doing so in this case is good if you need to. If you could get the Nazis to not find the Jews without lying but you did so anyway then it is a bit shitty even if you are otherwise being heroic.

&gt;	Similarly, by lying about my sexuality, I’m preventing a greater case of immortality, which is that my privacy is being invaded.

Someone imagining they know your sexuality isn't an invasion of privacy. They can imagine whatever they want about you even without input at all.

&gt;	Do you think judging someone for being gay is immoral? If so why? After all, people are free to avoid someone they think is gay. That’s their right, even though it’s an incorrect judgement.

Someone has the legal right to be both homophobic and racist, but doing so is both incorrect and immoral. Immoral because you are treating people cruelly and unfairly.

&gt;	But I do have the right to withhold information about myself.

Sure. You don't need to answer the question. Lying isn't the same as withholding information.

&gt;	This is completely based on what information they value, which is subjective.

Right, and this is assuming you have decided they value the information at issue.

&gt;	If I ask you all sorts of personal questions that you don’t feel comfortable giving, I can just tell you that I value that information and you’re lying to me by not giving it to me.

In this case you are in a relationship where an extra consideration for what your partner wants is expected. If some random person wants to know my sexual history they have no business and I won't tell them, but if my SO wants to know then I should tell them.

I think it worths it. Because this child is already on the earth, but you biological child is not, untill you decide of course.

That's a bit different from your initial OP. You think that it's morally better to adopt a child than to have a biological one, but it's pretty different from ""not understanding why someone else would act differently"". 

If the question is 

* why not make someones life “better” just giving them the chance of a “normal” family?

then the answer can be 

* because it's easier with a biological kid, and people can be selfish sometime, and prefer the easier way

If the question is ""Why would it be morally better to have your own biological child instead of adopting ?"", then the question is totally different.

&gt; The other thing with genetics is true in some ways, but it wouldnt guarantee you your own child wont have “unknown” problems.

No it's not a ""guarantee"", but it gives you better probabilities, so it's understandable that people would prefer having better odds of having a ""great"" kid.

107	"I disagree because I don't think Trump is the person to worry about. I'll give quick reasoning here and expand after that.

***Quick reasoning:***

*Republican politicians and other people in charge of our country only follow Trump because he is the president. He can't do anything without their help. Trump can't steal the election, but the election can be stolen for Trump.*

If you think back to 2016, tons of prominent Republicans were vehemently anti-Trump. That includes people like Lindsey Graham who are now extreme Trump sycophants.

Even the people who opposed Trump after the election, eventually fell in line for the most part. Susan Collins always feels conflicted when Trump does bad shit, but she eventually follows along (with reservations).

I think the most anti-Trump Republican politician right now is Romney, and he's still voting with and agreeing with Trump 90%+ of the time. He comes out on occasion and disagrees with a bad thing, but he doesn't even disagree with most of the bad things or even all of the worst bad things.

The only reason Republicans back Trump is because he is the president and Republican voters love him.

The instant Trump loses, their support for him is gone. That doesn't mean they will be cursing his name, but it does mean they won't be coming out and saying ""No, he isn't racist"" every time he is openly racist.

If Biden wins by a small amount, maybe one or two close states, Trump cannot steal the election, but Republicans could. The could find a way to steal it. But all Trump could do is complain.

I could see that happening. I don't think it's likely (since they both have to try to steal it AND be successful), but it's possible. 

But I can't see Republicans succeeding in stealing the election if Biden wins by a large margin. If he's up by 70 electoral votes, it means they now have to do 800% more stealing. It means they have to win a bunch of legal cases that are all unlikely to succeed.

We should prepare for Trump to try to steal the election, but all we need to do to prepare for that is roll our eyes and preemptively get annoyed. Everyone's already done that.

Trump's not going to sue Florida to get ballots thrown out, the Florida GOP would do that. Trump will just throw a tantrum.

Biden and the Democratic party have already prepared for legal challenges. That work has already been done.

But it's not a guarantee that there will be any problems.

If Biden wins by a couple states, his thousands (not an exaggeration) of lawyers will be on the case. If he wins by a medium or wide margin, I can't see any way Republicans can realistically steal this."	31	"['can be stolen', 'is gone', ""'s already done"", 'been done']"	4	4	0.12903225806451613	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['can be stolen', 'is gone', ""'s already done"", 'been done']"	4	4	0.12903225806451613	1	35495942030	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jnh757/_/gb1d85q/	1188290923		2020-11-03 17:52:14	31756574.0	possiblyaqueen	4	False	466	0	False	True	73.17

111	"That's true although as other have pointed out, that's more to do with the culture and society than school itself. It is unfortunate and honestly, the only reason I'm so big into sports and physical activity stems from my elementary school days. I'm not that old (23) but I grew up in a time when video games were just becoming popular. My fondest memories are of recess when we would play sports and run around.

Coming back to your original post, schools are pretty powerful in how they shape students. School has had a major impact on my life (friends, teachers, etc.). I agree with you on that schools can and should try to get children to become more active but the result ultimately depends on the individual. Mandatory won't really change that. I've seen classmates flat out refuse to participate in gym or do so with minimal participation. It's a much bigger societal issue that schools can't solve on their own."	9	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	27616848285	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2wfjnr/_/coqcwil/	175405383	27616831732.0	2015-02-19 13:07:26		22pocketrocks	5	False	162	0	False	True	71.95
112	"&gt;Again, the existence/validity of such states or such techniques has never been demonstrated conclusively (to my knowledge).

I thought neuroimagery had shown several characteristics of the hypnotic transe state, which definitely proved it's existence (regardless of whether or not it is caused by hypnosis and should be called ""hypnotic"" trance). 

The articles I'm trying to read all need to be purchased unfortunately : [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016787609090027B), [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/archneurpsyc/article-abstract/650361), and [here](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198570097.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198570097-e-014#oxfordhb-9780198570097-div2-131)

So I lack the source, I give up on that I'm hope some other people could provide you what you want.

However I'm interested in discussing your opinion on the methods :

&gt;and yet, by some, it is automatically interpreted in favour of hypnotism, which to me seems thoroughly unscientific and simply a type of confirmation bias.

Indeed, if some hypnotists just try with 1000 people, keep the 100 people for whom something happened and claim it was hypnosis making it happen, it's unscientific.

However, it is unscientific because we can't know what is the cause putting these 100 people in trance.

Now : if you keep these 100 people and make 1000 hypnotists try to put them in the state and 100 people who know nothing of hypnosis try the same (double blind, the hypnotists don't know if the patient is ""hypnotizable"" and the patient doesn't know if the person speaking is an hypnotist) :

If 900 hypnotists manage to put the patient in the trance state, and only 100 non-hypnotists manage to do it. The fact that it is done in double blind takes out the placebo of people believing in hypnosis or not.

Can't you conclude that :  **A set of people exists (the hypnotizable people) , for whom the hypnotists have a statistically proved ability to put them in trans** ?

I don't say that such a study exist, I only ask for your opinion on this method because it is important to know if your logic even allows hypnosis to be proved in the first place."	10	['been demonstrated', 'is caused', 'should be called', 'be purchased', 'is automatically interpreted', 'is done', 'be proved']	7	6	0.6	1	['is caused by']	1	1	0.1	1	['been demonstrated', 'is caused', 'should be called', 'be purchased', 'is automatically interpreted', 'is done', 'be proved']	7	6	0.6	1	30639594428	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/90f70r/_/e2q0ud8/	544904523	30639470590.0	2018-07-20 10:18:55	51139344868.0	MirrorThaoss	1	False	328	2	True	True	44.27

1. What definition are you using for murder? Because killing someone in self defense is not considered murder. You seem to have the belief that killing can be justified in cases (which I can agree) but killing someone isn't by definition murder.

2. A question: would you rather someone come into your room tonight, and sexually assault you. Or would you prefer someone come into your room tonight and kill you outright?

3. Murder is, in my view, absolutely, 100% worse than rape. You say the suffering ""ends"". But many people would prefer to be alive and suffering than dead. And, in the case of rape, if you're so committed to ending the suffering, that option is still on the table. When you're dead, you don't have a choice.

That's not what that means.  There were protests and growing support for leftist movements, not just political violence.

And there was political violence in both France and the U.K at the time, neither of which succumbed to fascism.  Its conservative parties did not experience less violence under their rule, but rather they had **more power**.

Paxton again:

""British fascism had little space available because the Conservative Party succeeded in ruling...  from 1931 to 1945.""

The distinction is *not* in violence, but in the perception among conservatives that they would lose *power*.  Conservatives in the U.K continued to hold power, so they had no need for fascists despite violence in their streets.

The rise of fascism is not reliant on political violence.  It is reliant (again per Paxton) on:

""**The circumstances that favor the fascists - polarization within civil society and deadlocks within the political system**.""  Notice that neither involve violence.

""Resorting to direct mass action also risks conceding advantages to fascism's principal enemy, the left, which was still powerful in the street and workplace in interwar Europe.  **The only route to power available to fascists passes through cooperation with conservative elites**.""

And who was discrediting the existing regime?

""In the late nineteen and early twentieth centuries, thinkers and publicists discredited reigning liberal and democratic values.""

&gt;Do you think popular mobilization was peaceful activities?

Predominately, yep.

Both Italy and Germany experienced massive strikes of agricultural workers which were only broken up by violence perpetuated by fascists.  Violence used by fascists against popular (peaceful) mobilization.

Paxton:

""It was precisely in this direct [violent] action against farm-worker unions that second-stage fascism was born in Italy and even launched on the path to power.""

Indeed it was a *peaceful* general strike which had frustrated the Kapp Putsch in Germany in 1920.

Your reading of history as ""communists and fascists fought, so conservatives got scared and worked with fascists"" is simplistic to the point of simply being inaccurate.

&gt;I don’t view it as that problematic though.

The fact that they weren't reluctant but rather eager to use the power of the Nazis against the left?

You don't think that dramatically changes the context from ""scared conservatives who felt they had to ally with fascists"" to ""craven power-seeking conservatives who allied with Nazis because they would rather support fascism than lose political power to the left""?

&gt;I’m not absolving the conservatives in the Weimar Republic of wrong doing. They were terrible

142	"For the sake of argument, I agree with the idea of abolishing gender rather than reinforcing it. Gender roles should be considered expansive and not restrictive. I'm happy to turn that against cis women. Cis women often spend too much time in their lives fretting about appearance, makeup, and social group jockeying. I am often confused why they do so, except as a result of deeply ingrained cultural expectations that they themselves have internalized.

I've always been somewhat uncomfortable about trans identity because it seems (in popular culture anyway) they try to occupy and amplify the role they identify as rather than redefine it. In other words (cruder words), trans women often go for the super stereotypical girly girl look rather than something in the middle.

I don't think that makes anyone mentally ill. There is a natural variance in personality, beliefs, etc. across culture and time. People should be whoever they want to be. But wanting to live out the stereotypes of your gender is not something I understand well.

(And I'd be happy to turn it against cis men as well--toxic masculinity, taking offense at every perceived sleight, rampant individualism and loneliness--these are things directly caused by crappy gender norms.

It isn't necessarily the context that's the issue, it is the *content*.

I even teach (and research) at a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) and what I cover in the classes that are in the same area as my research barely skim the surface of my research and rarely ever discuss my actual findings.

That's because active research projects tend to be very specialized and instead, undergraduate classes introduce the fundamentals of topics.

I think it was something of a mistake to place most of the main characters in the same house, especially early on. Because it paints too insular of a perspective for the audience. On one hand it makes sense for Harry, since he was an abused child who has never felt like part of a family before, so the housing setup gives him one. But Rowling accidentally undermined one of her biggest themes by doing this, and by the time she tried to undo it with Luna and Cedric the audience had already grown accustomed to this badguy/goodguy rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin.

It would have been nice to gain a deeper perspective on more characters from the other houses, including Slytherin.

Here's an excerpt from that article when it discusses how the budget in terms of GDP went down since WW2:

&gt;These numbers aren’t based on money actually spent, but instead represent the sum of annual Pentagon spending as a slice of the total American economy. Because the American economy has grown faster than defense spending since World War II, the ratio yields numbers that show us dedicating 3.2% of the national economic pie to the military in 2014, compared to a 5.9% slice in 1985 during the Reagan-era defense buildup.

&gt;That’s true, but it’s also irrelevant. The key fact is that we are now spending more on our military than during the Reagan Administration.

&gt;For example, this percent of GDP measure obscures the fact that, from 1985 to 1986, the percent of GDP spent on defense rose from 5.9% to 6.0%, while defense spending went down from $287 billion in 1985 to $281 billion in 1986.

&gt;The economy shrank that year; the defense budget also shrank, but less so. As a result, the ratio showed an increase. The reverse can also happen: if the defense budget goes up and the economy goes up even more, which has been the trend, the percent of GDP measures will show an illusory “shrinkage” in defense spending.

&gt;Percent of GDP is an economist’s measure of relative growth, useful to them for technical purposes. However, others like to use the measure because it depicts what they want you to see. Ignore them; they are quacks and charlatans.

So again, why should we be basing defense spending on GDP?"	10	['statistic used']	1	1	0.1	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['statistic used']	1	1	0.1	1	29367822125	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6bqgme/_/dhouckt/	382507430	29367686959.0	2017-05-17 16:56:11		Waphlez	18	False	291	5	True	True	63.59

But let me also clarify why I still think it's inappropriate as a means of asking for more info from you (or others). As I said elsewhere: I don't mean to suggest that the language be changed broadly or that people interacting amongst their own cultures should change because someone from outside of that culture doesn't understand or might be uncomfortable. What I do think remains inappropriate about the situation I'm describing is that it shouldn't be judged based on its immediate cultural surroundings specifically because it is customer service, something that in most settings intentionally works to *not* be beholden to or reliant on them.

Here's a specific example. The place I got that sub was a Publix Deli. I happen to have worked as a temp in Publix's corporate offices in consumer relations. As an employee of Publix working in customer service, I was taught - just as I was when I worked tech support, just as I was when I worked in marketing, just as I was when training in public speaking, etc. - that you never assumed your customer or audience's background, and therefore you didn't use cultural mannerisms or language. Yet here's a another Publix employee, face to face with someone, doing exactly that, but it gets excused because ""that's the south!""

So maybe my question is: why does the south get a pass on that common rule? If I walked in to a party around here I wouldn't say: hey, please don't say ""honey"" to one another, nor would I argue a TV show that portrays a southern family shouldn't use ""sweetheart"".

189	"I think I’m still not understanding your position. Are you claiming that all intellectual property theft is criminal? Because it was my understanding that a certain subset of intellectual property theft is criminal, and that you think it should all be civil.

&gt;All you have to do is criminalize the appropriation of trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government/entity.

Right, and this is what 18 USC 1831 does. Which you agreed with. One of the elements is the theft of intellectual property. 

&gt;Similarly, you don't have to criminalize the ownership of guns to make a law that more harshly punishes armed robbery than un-armed robbery.


But the other element is based on the actor. Not the action. So, I don’t understand how this is relevant. 

&gt;To take the gun example further:

As I said, you tend to avoid physical object analogies for this CMV, so I’d really rather not. Why not talk about the example I’m giving of 18 USC 1831? 

&gt;gun ownership should not be criminalized, your equivalent argument would be to bring up the armed robbery example as something that rightly criminalizes gun ownership.

No, my argument is that criminality depends on what type of actor it is. So that would be like saying ‘it should be illegal for children to buy tobacco’ 

&gt;However, I don't see that as a legitimate example, since it doesn't actually criminalize the ownership or even the use of guns, but only the use of the gun for a specific purpose.

Why don’t you point to the statue you feel is legitimate? I did a search to try and find criminal statues for IP theft, I presented my findings, and you agreed with my position:

&gt;Yes, I think it should be a crime, but you don't need to criminalize trade secrets for that statute to be a crime.

I think you should point to the specific statue you think criminalizes IP theft that you don’t think is relevant, because I brought one and you agreed with it.

- (depending on nuance of meaning used) lack of privileging circumstances (e.g. regular killing gets kicked down a notch to privileged killing if it's done in self-defence in some ethical systems and/or jurisdictions; ask your regional expert for whether any of those apply and what terms are used for them).

Even though there is lobby, I trust doctors to only prescribe a patient a certain medication when they actually need it. If they prescribe it even when they don't need it either because they are paid to do so or they didn't do research on how that medication will affect their patients then that's a totally different problem, imo.

That said, I'd like to react to your 3. point.

My message is pretty much the same as of /u/_Hopped_. Let's take a person with ADHD which you say isn't justified because they are just impatient. First of all, how do you know how debilitating that ""impatience"" is? If there is a drug to help them focus so they can achieve things without constantly having to battle this problem, why shouldn't they take it? If there are side effects, they are informed, and so it's up to the patient if they want to utilise that drug. Even if they are diagnosed, they can still decide.

Please note, that I'm very heavily rely on that people make informed decisions when it comes to drugs. Not perfectly informed, of course, but with the aid of a doctor *they* have the decision and not pharma.

Also, the prevalence of mental illness is growing because it's easier to diagnose, there is less stigma, so patients aren't afraid to seek help.

Moreover, who is to decide what is serious? Even mild depression can have horrible effects on one's quality of life, and tons of people don't even get help even though most people suffer of it sometime during their life.

Regarding point 6, these drugs are not to treat mental illnesses. They only help stabilise the patient and in some diseases a very crucial part of treatment is some sort of psychotherapy.

202	"I can certainly try to explain my view here. In fact, I think it has a lot to do with why I am a compatibilist as opposed to a hard determinist.

I interpret the ""will"" as simply being an inner realization about *x* course of action. The ""will"" is a drive to take that course of action, whether it be from desire, belief, or reason.

The ""free will"" is the actual ability to act upon the will rationally. Humans have free will in the truest metaphysically possible sense because we can respond rationally to our wills, and even exercise foresight in our courses of action in order to maintain our control. We do not simply have direct control over other 'things' in our environment, we have the type of control over ourselves that allows us to maintain control.

I think that saying ""control is the form of free will worth wanting"" is quite the same as saying ""the 'will' = the compulsion, the realization itself; but the 'free will' = the ability to act rationally upon the will and exercise control"". Thus, the amount of free will we have in situations can fluctuate, but the amount of *will* we have cannot. You are always compelled to do something for some reason and/or based on some belief, even if that 'something' is just to sit there and stare into space.

Hard determinists think that free will is tenable only if we can explain how we ""will our own wills"", but I think that is a terribly circular criticism because wills/desires are, by definition, things that cannot be formed by the one who does the desiring. Why get all bent out of shape over the non-existence of something that is really not possible nor desirable in the first place? The 'will' and the 'free will' are different, and I believe we have both."	14	['are always compelled', 'be formed']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	['be formed by']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	['are always compelled']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	26794158000	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ihkjy/_/cb4jsmo/	91519054	26794140661.0	2013-07-17 13:06:22		Gehalgod	3	False	311	0	False	True	64.24

213	"&gt; It is still a fetus until birth.

So birth is the defining moment? I'm not convinced that's a particularly substantive difference.

In the example I gave, the baby could have survived without the mother for literal months by that point. Hell, there will be babies in the very same ward that were born earlier in their development. Could you elaborate on why birth is the key moment?

&gt; At that point, it ceases to be a part of the body and becomes its own person. Prior to that point, the fetus is a part of the body of the person carrying it.

That doesn't quite hold water. If that fetus *can* survive without the woman carrying it, why does the fact of it being born change anything? In the hours before and after birth, that baby/fetus is fundamentally exactly the same. Why does the act of being born confer the right to life?

Saying ""it was inside someone, now it isn't"" isn't substantive. Not when you can very easily remove the baby alive at that point, when it will then no longer be dependant on the woman who carried it.

Hell, as you later said, if the baby is aborted at that point then the woman still has to actually give birth, it's just that the baby she gives birth to won't be alive as a result.

&gt; Given that the woman is on the brink of giving birth, her having an abortion would still require her to go through labour and ""birth"" the aborted fetus. Why would a woman carry to term and then abort it last minute?

Does it actually matter why? You stated there should be no restriction or limitation on the access to abortion. As a result, the reason for it being sought isn't relevant.

But regardless, she might have broken up with the father earlier that day and not want to do it alone, she might be going through a depressive episode and decide that she cannot be a mother, or any other reason. Ultimately, for you to hold the view that there should be no restriction or limitation on the access to abortion, you should also beleive that her reason isn't relevant to determining whether she is allowed one. After all, that would be a limitation.

&gt; I doubt the realism of your scenario, but even assuming this occurs, it is ultimately the woman's right to abort the fetus: ""Hard cases make bad law.""

I fully agree that the scenario is *incredibly* unlikely, to the extent that I'll happily admit I doubt it will ever happen.

But that's the point, for you to declare there should be no restrictions or limitations on abortion access, you have to agree with giving access at the absolute latest time physically possible, and for the absolute worst reasons possible.

Whether that scenario is statistically likely is irrelevant, only that it is possible.

Hell, let's push it even further.

How much of the baby has to be born?

If a baby is ""crowning"" is it born yet? Because doctors register the time of birth as the time that baby has completely left the woman. So when would the baby be ""born"" in the eyes of this law?

236	"&gt;So in hard determinism you'd kind of have the same relation to ownership as you'd have in most of nature. Meaning the majority of animals don't give a shit about your made up thingy called ownership. The mold will claim your food regardless of whether you call it your property or not. The lion will still trying to eat you if you look tasty, regardless of your self-ownership. Your dog though might not attack you if you provide bigger utility to him being alive and friendly than being dead or hostile but the idea that another individual will respect your claim as something legit on your own or on objective terms is just ridiculous.

&gt;So the question whether it's fair wouldn't occur as it would just happen without your agency. Whether it's fair requires the ability of empathy to see the situation from the perspective of the other person and to act upon that insight. Which is something that fixed contracts and ownership kind of ignore as they give default answers and heuristics that are applied regardless of whether they ""work"" in being mutually beneficial or not.

&gt;I mean first of all that makes the mistake as to treat ownership as something ""objective"". It is not. Ownership is, at best a mutual agreement between two or more parties and at first nothing more than a violent claim to exclusive use.

Yes to all three of these! These are all exactly right. I am therefore proposing war on the basis of empathy. I respond to your comments with ""do you have empathy?"" ""Do I have empathy?""

It sounds like yes to both. So basically, I am trying to say ""a lack of free will implies equal happiness for all for an empathetic individual""

&gt;Yes. I mean if you run a simulation 10 times you might still have 10 different outcomes, so to say options. But the individual within the simulation, YOU so to speak, have no options as whatever option you chose would have been the only option you could have ever chosen, so no there would be no YOU and there would be no CHOICE.

yep you got it for sure

&gt;The thing is without an internal sense of agency, you'd be just reacting to external stimuli, nothing more nothing less. So you wouldn't really be responsible for your action, but you also wouldn't be in control of your actions either. You would simply exist and act the way you act with.

&gt;Though the act of punishment assumes that an action is a conscious action and that applying a different rewards would change that action. However if you action wasn't deliberate but merely based on randomness, it won't do anything (concerning that end). Though you'd probably still do it in the errand assumption that it was deliberate.

&gt;So in order to have ethics you kind of need the ability to be in control and have agency at least to some degree.

I disagree with the third quore. It would seem all you really need is to have empathy or not. A sociopath will not have ethics. The question is, would all empathetic individuals respond to the gold mind question equally?

As for punishment, yes! Because we are all selfish and sometimes greed benefits more than selflessness. We fall into it. So we have to create punishment BY OURSELVES. There is no higher power, no ethical authority beyond us. We have to hold one another accountable by imposing punishments on people who act in a way unempathetically. In fact I think your first paragraph is spot on. We really do just react to stimuli. We have some internal processing surely, but all evaluations for things outside the self are just reactions.

Is empathy a sufficient foundation for the establishment of fairness?"	38	['are applied']	1	1	0.02631578947368421	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are applied']	1	1	0.02631578947368421	1	33822462706	15	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/f7tpnf/_/fjd0r8y/	920136219	33812911302.0	2020-03-03 11:38:53	368796734866.0	Needcompass	1	False	630	7	False	True	64.3

253	"I really have no idea what your view is. Are you saying while legal, it was unfair or bad for the Democrats to push to a mail-in voting system instead of the usual in person voting?

Also you seem to not exactly understand the system so I'll try to clarify.

&gt;From my understanding the way the election process in US works is an external firm looks at existing voting numbers to ensure gerrymandering does not benefit either party and a 'close fight' for the election

Well it varies by states, sometimes it is a neutral third party, other times it is whoever controls the state government, that is in charge of drawing districts.

Also the ideal distracting is not having every district be a close fight based off of previous elections, but rather have the state divided into districts that are as compact as possible, as opposed to when districts are gerrymandered where they are stretched out to pack all of one party into a certain district. I won't be surprised if you don't understand that, it's kinda complicated, I can go more in depth. Also you use the word gerrymandering when you should be saying redistricting. Gerrymandering is a specific type of redistricting that is designed to give one party an advantage. In the ideal system, there is no gerrymandering. If the redistricting isn't benefiting either party, then it's not gerrymandering.

&gt;There is no doubt in my mind that lack of compulsory voting, the Tuesday vote, requirement of 'adequate' identification of voters are all moves to ensure the values of the middle and upper class of older individuals are prevalent in representation. This in some ways is catered for in the gerrymandering process.

You use gerrymandering incorrectly again here. This time, you should be saying voter suppression. Gerrymandering is a type of voter suppression that has to do with drawing districts, but you are talking about other types of voter suppression, not about drawing districts. Also I wouldn't really consider not having compulsory voting voter suppression.

&gt;To the best of my knowledge there was never a reassessment or 'redistricting' as to 'even representation' for the expected additional turn out and additional representation impact of a primarily mail in ballot.

Huh? WHy would there be? I guess you are still operating on the assertion that every race has to be as close as possible? Well I already addressed that's not what redistricting is for so I'll move on.

&gt;Given the undeniably close election results, I believe a lack of mail in support would have resulted in Trump victory. While this does not impact the final voting result (all states can pick whatever method of voting they chose suitable so, it's more an ethical than legal question), and additional representation is not a bad thing, it does pull into question the grander and again, undeniably terrible voting patterns of the US, which has resulted in runaway spending on campaigns, and dumb publicity contests for a two party system.

I mean, in the end, it wasn't that close. it just looked close on election night because many of the Republican votes were counted before the Democrat votes. Also, I mean, ya if you just deleted every mail in vote after the election, sure, Republicans would win, but just not having mail in ballots doesn't automatically mean Republicans win.

254	"&gt;We don't know the answer to that question, but based on current trends, the problem is that ""new jobs"" havn't become a significent sector of the economy in the last 200 years, and so there's no reason to think they suddenly will now.

I have to disagree on that one since one of the most important and rapidly growing sectors right now is information technology. Something that didn't really exist until late 20th century therefore saying nothing changed in last 200 years is bit of a stretch. Through last 200 years we went from agrarian society through industrial one to finally modern society which is mostly based on services which are pretty big changes in my opinion. And these changes will occur even  faster considering technological progress. In year 2216 we may even learn how to hop from one dimension to another or something even more ridiculous.

257	"Ok, let's start with the simplest case - in the US, we have gobsmackingly huge amounts of land.  And significant chunks of that land have a population approaching zero per square mile.   Animals live unmolested, including a significant number of large predator animals.

These large predator animals can represent a grave and immediate threat should people enter the predator animal's territory.  Bears, wolves &amp; mountain lions will, on occasion, attack humans, especially small humans.  For the purposes of explicitly addressing your ""allowed to keep them in their home"" requirement, people also own and live in cabins in the woods and great forests of the western US as well.  

In those situations, having a gun available to drive off or kill the attacking animal before it eats your child seems both sane and prudent to me.   

Second case... for the vast majority of human history, the physically strong dominated and ruled the physically weak.   Partially because of this, men were the only people who counted - women (smaller and weaker) were often viewed as property, or, at best, second-class citizens.  Women were forced to live in submission to the men in their lives, for their own protection.   Handguns represent a tremendous shift in that power dynamic - for the first time in history, small, physically weak women were able to effectively defend themselves against large, dangerous men.    Even if only a small fraction of women carry guns, because they're hard to detect, the overall deterrent effect on rape is huge.

262	"&gt;To answer your last question: my view on politics and shit is extremally basic, it comes from right wing= communism and left wing= nazi's (I remember becaues ruskies are on the right of the map, and what was nazi germany was on the left).

uh, where did you even hear that? the left means anti-capitalism, the right means capitalism. communism is on the left, and nazis are on the right.

&gt;I prefer capitalism over communism because of freedom, what I think of communism is that everything is controlled by the state, if the state wants 100 kalashnikovs built in the year 1955 they will be built, if they want 500 T-55's they will be built. The state controls the economy, as well as jobs. So they have 500 new kids straight from high school, they will get factory jobs. They do not look for jobs.

the state does not control everything in communism. communism is an economy where everything is owned collectively by the people through democracy, and there is no money, classes or a state.

&gt;With Capitalism it's let the companies decide. Do whatever you want, turn a profit if you're smart enough. So woz and steve have a great idea for a phone and they market it in a special way and make millions. 

the world has shown, as you say, that when companies decide they typically do evil, terrible things. nestle uses literal, actual slavery to get their cocoa, and other companies fund warlords in africa to keep fighting eachother so they can use child slaves to mine silicon. not to mention sweatshop labour, rampant abuse of workers and animals, and a complete disregard for the earth's environment.

&gt;I prefer capitalism because there's free will, you pick your job, you pick your lifestyle.

there acually is very little freedom in capitalism. freedom in capitalist systems is only given to the rich, as the poor are not given a choice. the rich can decide if they want to drive a limo or fly in a leer jet. the poor have to decide if they want to work for 12 hours, or starve to death homeless (which is not a real choice.)."	19	['is controlled', 'will be built', 'will be built', 'is owned', 'is only given', 'are not given']	6	3	0.15789473684210525	1	['is controlled by']	1	1	0.05263157894736842	1	['is controlled', 'will be built', 'will be built', 'is owned', 'is only given', 'are not given']	6	3	0.15789473684210525	1	27921839028	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ftgex/_/ctrxwvo/	207967065	27921828752.0	2015-08-05 00:40:09		ajrhug	0	True	363	4	False	True	70.84

264	"&gt; Why do you believe individuals should be responsible for their own actions and not for the actions of their group?

Because it's not their ""group"". 

If we were talking about a criminal gang or a terrorist org sure, it'd be fair to hold people responsible for the actions of the group. They joined and supported that group, so the are indirectly responsible. 

But in this case we are talking about a group of people who just share some genetic traits. They are not responsible for the actions of other members of this ""group"" in any way. 

As the user you replied to said, black people is a group only in the mind of racists. 

&gt; would it then become reasonable to preemptively search someone from this race when entering a bus?

Are you a man? Should the police have your DNA in case you rape someone? Should bouncers check your pockets to make sure you are not carrying rape drugs when going into a club? Would you be ok if all women assumed you are a rapist and treat you like one? After all men commit the majority of reported episodes of sexual violence.

I'm italian, should I be treated like a Mafioso even if I'm not from that part of Italy and I've never met one? 

So to answer your question, no it wouldn't be reasonable. It would literally be a racist policy. A text book one at that.

Also race is almost always the wrong way of grouping people. It's just an easy one because you can see it. The correlation between crime and race is low. The biggest factors are poverty and exposure to violence during childhood. The reason black people commit more crimes on average is because they tend to be poorer.

This is a huge potential for value (though I don't think that have hundreds of millions yet.)

&gt; Most other platforms of the type derive revenues from selling market targeting services to advertisers/salespeople but snapchat does not seem to do anything like this.

Snapchat released a media service called Snapchat Discover, to sell adspace targeted at its users. Now its many users are mostly younger teens/tweens (12-20), which is an *incredibly* valuable demographic, one that is notoriously difficult to understand, one that is disappearing from facebook and twitter, and one that will have an enormous influence on the buying habits of young professionals in the next 3-7 years (because they will become them). Just the thought of getting insightful behavioral and demographic data as well as an ad-targeting platform with access to tens (soon hundreds) of millions of these users is worth billions.

I don't know about the $15B figure, because I don't have all the info, but there is absolutely an enormous potential value in the company, given its demographic. The $15B estimate is a bet that they have a good plan, and the resources to actually maintain a hold on their demographic and deliver the data and targeting everyone hopes for.

275	"Legality is downstream from morality, so in this case illegal killing is necessarily the same as unjustified. My point still stands, because if it was a justified killing it would not be murder it would be something else. A justification is something we must give in a judiciary system to turn a immoral/illegal act to at least neutral/legal act. In fact, if you truly are protecting someone then it cannot be considered illegal killing (unless the killing was unnecessary), it would be self defense. Calling something illegal begs the question, it assumes something is actually unjustified and hence immoral, otherwise it wouldn't be illegal.

You are conflating different types of good and bad in this case. Cheating is defined (afaik) as breaking an agreement or trust of your *partner*. Whether it is sexual or not. Cheating is necessarily *bad* towards the person getting cheated, but not necessarily *bad* against society. We have to separate these, something can be bad/good for you whilst simultaneously being bad/good for society.

Let's put it this way, if we define cheating as unjustifiably breaking your partners trust, then it is necessarily bad. I would assume this is how most people view and use the term cheating. The moral bad is baked into the definition. Because if someone gets sexually assaulted, we wouldn't consider that cheating (let's not get stuck on this specific example though, sexual assault is complicated aswell).

277	"Up until this point, I have been laying out the  reasonings for the US’ decision to hit cities, but I haven’t discussed the role this played for the Japanese. In order to do so, we have to talk about Japan’s strategy. Japan’s official strategy was known as Ketsugo and was essentially a commitment to an armistice. Their goal was to force the US to a conditional surrender through a Vietnam type situation. Essentially their goal was to intercept Downfall (the Allies invasion strategy) and throw as many lives at it as possible. It was a strategy known as “The Glorious Death of One Hundred Million"" by the Japanese. This was because the US issued an unconditional surrender which put the Emperor in jeopardy and they would not budge until the Emperor was secured (hence why it wasn’t until the Byrnes note that the Emperor surrendered and is why he was never tired for war crimes). That point is very important, but only relevant to the bombs in so far as it meant even with them they were planning to face total destruction. Some argue that it was an issue of loss of life, but as many other tend to point out, the Bombing of Tokyo killed just as many if not more civilians and they were planning on total war Vietnam style. The only things the bombs would have successfully done to the Japanese was weaken the strength of their ketsugo strategy in the eyes of the Emperor as they had no means to prevent these attacks. This however did note require a city to be hit. All it would have required was a demonstration, and if that did not work, we could have hit an Arsenal. 

It is not as though this idea was not considered. Both committees considered pure military targets, Truman wanted military targets, and even other officials like  Marshall sought with a meeting with the Secretary of War to prevent that:

> “Marshall argued generally for not using the weapon on Japanese cities but on a “straight military [target] such as a naval installation,” in the words of the meeting minutes.2 If a city was chosen, it should be a “large manufacturing” area, he urged, and the United States should at least provide a substantial warning about the weapon in order to spare noncombatant lives.”

The US additionally chose to give no warning. It is commonly said that the Japanese were warned of the nuclear attacks prior to their usage but this is not true. Most people cite the LeMay Leaflets, however these are firebombing leaflets which is clearly shown by the image used. 

The text goes as follows: 
“Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or a friend. In the next few days, four or more of the cities named on the reverse side of this leaflet will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories, which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique that they are using to prolong this useless war. Unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America’s well-known humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives.
America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique, which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace, which America will bring, will tree the people from the oppression of the Japanese military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan.
You can restore peace by demanding new and better leaders who will end the War.
We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked, but at least four will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”

This has nothing to do with a nuclear attack and there is very little evidence to suggest that Hiroshima and Nagisaki received them as they were not considered firebombing targets at the time. 

An additional leaflet that gets cited is one that was made following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that had an image and a direct warning of a nuclear strike. This would have been good, however it was not dropped on Nagasaki in time. Due to constant alterations, the leaflet was not prepared fully and delivered until the 10th, one day after the attack on Nagisaki. You can read more about it through this link (https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/04/26/a-day-too-late/). It is by Alex Wellerstein and is pretty well sourced. 

Tl;dr - The effects of the bombs were not dependent on a city being hit. The US specifically chose stead with civilian targets, with less than 10% of the people killed in either bombs being military. This was not necessary to accomplish the same effect of undermining Ketsugo.

It is entirely possible people have been raised to provide a specific response to specific subjects without having ever been exposed to it.

It’s a similar phenomenon to homosexuals that are raised to hate homosexuality in religious/regressive areas, and they go so much of their life never really realizing their own sexuality, or hating themselves for the thoughts they may have when looking at members of the same sex. 

However, these same people when exposed to porn would _certainly_ end up gravitating towards homosexual porn. Even though they would have responded on the survey that it disgusts them.

It is entirely possible that this result here:
&gt; switching to a novel genre of explicit material (46.0%), use of materials that do not match sexual orientation (60.9%) and need to use more extreme (violent) material (32.0%) “

Is not a function of cause but simply exploratory self discovery.

Like. I’m approaching middle age. I’ve been around the block a time or two. Things that _actually_ disgusted me two decades ago still disgust me now.

I will tell you briefly what it is. The state of nature is a situation of all against all - we all want different conflicting things. In order to secure our safety, any rational individual would recognize a contract not to go about murdering eachother in an indefinite struggle to achieve our varied desires is wise. We trade freedom for security because the pros and cons of living in the state of nature vs. living under a social contract weigh heavily in favor of the latter. People aren't trying to kill you, and it enables cooperate efforts that also make you safer against the elements that an individual faces outside of a society.

The implicit contract is in the fact that signing this social contract would be the only reasonable choice a rational individual would make.

Now, I am not a social contract theorist, my aim isn't to defend except insofar as to make sure you don't misrepresent it.

292	"Hmm... I'm trying to think about how to focus this down so we don't just keep typing walls of text at each other. I usually prefer to try and keep discussions like these focused in so we're not talking about three different topics at once. If I miss something here that you want addressed please feel free to ask me in your response. 

To me, it seems the most relevant point is your last one about JKR. Her problem is not misgendering people, it's more the philosophy she traffics in and the kind of inability to support transgender people without bringing up language that is meant to exclude them. One can talk about sexual assault without derogating transgender women as being men in a costume. The LGBT community and women face high sexual assault rates than cisgender straight men, I would think some allyship could be built here but it often feels gender critical/TERF responses are often to circle the wagons and I don't really see the necessity.

You mentioned that people like John Maclean and tomboys are wearing costumes and maybe you don't mean it this way but to me it sounds like you think there is some kind of insincere artifice in how they present. I don't think costume is fair language because a costume comes off but John Maclean presents how he does in his daily life by his own accounts. Tomboys are still tomboys whether they are out in public or at home. Drag queens, however, take off their drag. I reminded of one drag queen (Jasmine Masters) who said something along the lines of:
&gt;I don't want to date nobody who wants to date me like this [in drag] because this comes off... and you ain't doing nothing with this!

Misgendering as an accident is not unethical, I can agree with that. The larger issue is how the attitudes around misgendering foster stigma against transgender people. Like whether you realize it or can understand it, you kind of skirted a line of expressing a sentiment that is shared among a lot of transphobic people: that transgender people are delusional or that they are being deceptive/manipulative in a way that traffics in pernicious harm. I realize you are not explicitly saying that but when I hear you talk about leering and indecent exposure in locker rooms I can't help but hear that. 

Like we allow gay men in men's locker rooms and lesbians in women's locker rooms. Being naked in a locker room usually does not qualify as indecent exposure because we generally understand nakedness happens in those spaces. Personally, I think men and women being naked together should be less sexualized and carry less stigma but that obviously is going to take a lot of work before we get there. 

Regardless, I think that perhaps where we seem to diverge is you seem to think the ways in which we delineate gender socially must come from a scientific observation on the part of an individual but I don't see how that's true. It's why I brought up transgender people who pass and are gendered correctly in society. A tomboy transgender woman who passes is still called a woman by people who look at her. This is what is meant by descriptive language. You look at how a community uses its language and go by that usage regardless of what a prescriptive guide might say is the ""correct"" usage. A lot of transgender women and men are just called women and men by their peers. There's no getting around that practice whatever it comes from. And you are right woman = adult female is how people use the word but I don't see how a transgender woman is an invalid type of adult female anymore than I see an adoptive parent being an invalid type of parent. If all this just comes down to looks, then I would just wonder what value is there in leaning into the divides we have around gender that tend to characterize people as sex fiends."	31	['is meant', 'could be built', 'is shared', 'are gendered', 'is still called', 'is meant', 'are just called']	7	7	0.22580645161290322	1	['is meant by']	1	1	0.03225806451612903	1	['is meant', 'could be built', 'is shared', 'are gendered', 'is still called', 'are just called']	6	6	0.1935483870967742	1	34523237204	22	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/h7dt9o/_/fuy8sb8/	1040326764	34522173624.0	2020-06-15 19:33:16	11350051.0	videoninja	2	False	675	1	False	True	64.85

295	"I think there should be a third circle of 'violence/looters' which intersects each of the other two circles. There's no overlap between genuine protestors and bad actors because on your definition someone cannot at the same time be both a genuine protestor and a bad actor.


Although we can't get exact figures, we can make some pretty good general approximations. There has not been widespread looting or violence so we do have a general idea about the relative proportion of people to violence/looting. For simplicity I'm also going to limit this to just looting, because equivalent arguments also apply to violence.


Let's say that there are 5000 protestors in an area and reports of a small number of stores in that area being looted. 


We can safely say that the looter circle is smaller than about 500 people, because there's not enough loot in a small number of stores for more than that number of looters. The number could be much lower.


We can surmise, almost by definition, that bad actors on average are substantially more likely than genuine protestors to loot. And unless the bad actors were extremely ineffective, we can also surmise that there are substantially less of them than genuine protestors. I'm going to conservatively give them a 50% success rate which puts the bad actors at not more than a thousand (500 / 50%, which would mean 0% looting by protestors). At this point we can say that at least 80% of the people were genuine protestors and not more than 10% of protestors turned to looting (if in fact all 100% were protestors, otherwise it would be lower).


Don't fall into the 'both sides' trap. If more than 90% of people are trying to protest peacefully and don't turn to looting/significant violence then it shouldn't reflect badly on protestors unless they can prevent it but don't. It's unavoidable that some people will resort to selfish or counterproductive actions and at that point it can be taken as a given that they stand apart from and at odds to peaceful protestors even if their conduct does not automatically make them 'bad actors'."	14	['being looted', 'can be taken']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['being looted', 'can be taken']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	34384437899	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/gv9c4t/_/fsnlu2z/	1019962541		2020-06-02 14:30:28	58583921.0	OrYouCouldJustNot	8	False	356	0	False	True	55.88

297	"&gt;If I were tasked with reducing the results of supercomputer simulations into a browser experience, I would attempt to capture results of different permutations as a simple time-sliced truth-table, or perhaps an approximate equation between timed boundaries. I suspect this could be done? 

Personally, I don't think these simulations can be properly distilled so easily. Even the authors admit it is meant to get people thinking about climate change policy more then actual simulation work. That is stated [right in the manual](http://www.climateinteractive.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/En-ROADS_Reference_Guide_v62.docx):



&gt;Purpose and intended use

&gt;The En-ROADS simulator is a simple energy system model intended for interactive scenario exploration. __It helps users to think about__:

&gt;* Dynamics of capital stock turnover

&gt;* Growth, energy intensity and carbon intensity (elements of the Kaya identity) as drivers of emissions

&gt;* Implications of technological lock-in to particular technologies

&gt;* Effective combinations of supply-side vs. demand-side, or technology-driven vs. incentive-driven policies

&gt;* The scale of economic and emissions changes required to meet climate goals

&gt;In the interest of simplicity, the model includes only simple structures for economic feedbacks, primarily the effect of energy prices on the growth rate of the aggregate economy and the impacts of climate on the economy.  Due to the lack of rigour to date in calibration of these feedbacks, ***it is not yet suitable for exploring optimal tradeoffs between mitigation and climate impacts.***


Not to be used for *serious* scientific predictions IMO. More of an educational toy. Good for raising awareness amongst the public about how important climate change is.


&gt;As to the IPCC reports, Mann himself talks at length about the backroom politicking and power-struggles behind single words in the Policymaker Summary section. I have also read accounts of scientists claiming the most recent report was too tame.


A few people's  claims vs the international body who is recognized  authority on climate change. I haven't read his book or seen these specific claims you mentioned, but strong claims require strong evidence. Remember that *everyone* including Mann and these scientists, has their own agenda (book sales, research grants, etc). Climate change means money from government and environmental groups  these days too. Wanting to save the world and self interest can go hand in hand. I would want a pretty high standard of proof."	20	['were tasked', 'could be done', 'can be properly distilled', 'is meant', 'is stated', 'model intended', 'be used', 'is recognized']	8	7	0.35	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['were tasked', 'could be done', 'can be properly distilled', 'is meant', 'is stated', 'model intended', 'be used', 'is recognized']	8	7	0.35	1	36418771753	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m0yzoc/_/gqaso4p/	1331888412	36418679796.0	2021-03-09 03:46:12	260079011274.0	Canada_Constitution	1	False	374	10	True	True	44.95

I really disliked how people feel entitled to call something a bug when they don't even understand the inner working. It's like calling the non-perfectly uniform distribution of a pseudo random generator a bug. Or even worse calling a bug the fact that 1 2 3 4 5 6 happens as a sequence because it's too unlikely.

But from the point of view of that person, their obvious expectation has been violated... So yeah, discard what I said about the wider definition of a bug. I'm annoyed by things that will always happen so I should reason myself.

316	Sure, lying is a problem, but again, if you get your facts from comedy, you have a bigger problem. I love Jon Stewart, but if I'm going to use something I heard on his show in an argument or in making a decision, I will fact check it first, because I know he is a comedian. Regarding the Otatmeal article you linked to, while I agree that the reaction of the author was a bit angrier than necessary, you also need to have some context on the whole Edison-Tesla thing. For geeks of a certain stripe, the Edison-Tesla rivalry in which Edison is a douche and Tesla is an unrecognized genius is already there. The comic is taking on an already existing narrative and not breaking any new ground, and this needs to be taken in to account when considering it's humour. The point is not that Edison was god, but that his contributions were arguably greater than Edison's, and yet he is virtually unknown despite being a purer scientist, while Edison is universally praised despite being ethically and morally corrupt. In any case, I do agree that comedians who try to make a truth claim that is patently false and get called out on it should simply ackowledge that they were wrong. A better example of this is Bill Maher and his documentary Religulous, which (while I do agree with the basic message) has a lot of inaccuracies about various religions. 	8	['be taken', 'is universally praised', 'get called']	3	3	0.375	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be taken', 'is universally praised', 'get called']	3	3	0.375	1	27407671487	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j9ryn/_/cl9tinz/	153301199	27407648783.0	2014-10-15 00:14:26		aardvarkyardwork	2	False	242	0	False	False	49.18

Its obvious this rehabilitation your imagining is in a prison of some sort not just on the streets for most violent crimes.

It seems like your recognizing that prison is a horrific place that functionally scares some people straight that are in short times, and is so awful it ruins people when they are in for a long time, but that's not because we treat minor crimes different, its because we treat them the same and the impacts of our shit prison system is magnified on long sentences, so fix the system don't make wonky non-legal deliniations on who gets rehabilitation or not.	4	['is magnified']	1	1	0.25	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is magnified']	1	1	0.25	1	39094578503	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t238au/_/hyjwhtz/	1757029062	39093998808.0	2022-02-26 17:51:08	55715150143.0	Bookwrrm	2	False	209	0	False	False	26.85

Suppose you believe that the universe has a creator. It's going to make sense to try to figure out what kind of being that is, how it interacts with people, etc. This is essentially what specific religions are: trying to figure out how we relate to that creator. Now, it's definitely true that some people are *wrong*, but it's disingenuous to say that they haven't really examined their beliefs, or something like that. In fact, many religious people will tell you that they know that's it's possible that they are wrong on specifics of what they believe about God."	8	['was handwritten']	1	1	0.125	1	['was handwritten by']	1	1	0.125	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	29400565937	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6e86d1/_/di8c5v5/	386693173		2017-05-30 13:18:21		Salanmander	7	False	139	1	False	True	64.85

Yup, that's why we should focus on the specific thing we're talking about. If this will affect someone who can get pregnant, then we can say ""If you are able to get pregnant, you should go for X checkups regularly"", vs ""If you are a woman, you should go for X checkups regularly"", which would also wrongly include infertile women who wouldn't need those checkups.

If it's about health issues related to uteruses, then we can say something like: ""If you are experiencing pain around your uterus, some causes could be..."" instead of ""if you are a woman ane experiencing abdominal pain, some causes could be..."", since this might be a woman without a uterus (trans, intersex, had a hysterectomy) who is experiencing that pain and might otherwise end up with a wrong diagnosis.

Same go for ""asian men beat their wife"", ""asian men are more misogynistic"" and other unscientific bullshit. People don't want to appear discriminatory and self-hating so they will use up all the excuses possible.

&gt; asian men are perceived as competition

Historically asian men saw many success in the West. One of the first hollywood heartthrob is an [Asian man](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Sessue_Hayakawa_1918_%28Fred_Hartsook%29.jpg). Mysterious asian merchant and young white girl was a popular novel premise. However, the rise of Japan/China and Yellow Peril made asian and asian men specifically the biggest threat in the West and along with it a barrage of anti-asian propaganda that you still feel nowadays. For example, the entire cyberpunk subculture are clouded under the fear and anxiety over a Japanese dominated world.

&gt;black as non-worrysome/non-competiting entertainment

Black was considered a threat before. And white men did try their hardest to suppress black-white couples. They just failed because black people fought back.

First of all, most of my points are going to rely on the fact that having a similar background (whether you end up with the same worldview is inconsequential) gives a sense of kinship. I see this as a self evident truth, but others might not.

If you don't fit in with the majority culture, public schools will be useful but you will still be alienated to degree because your own background won't be relatable to others. If you're in a minority, especially one discriminated against, you often have to build a persona for public school.

If you move around a lot as a child, you nearly always don't have much in common with your peers (unless you happen to be gifted in whatever skill makes you popular). Having people with a similar cultural background allows for better integration into the local group.

The additional thing that public schools kind of miss is mentorship. Sure there are mentor programs but again, you need a similar background to make that initial connection on which you can build a relationship and that rarely happens when you pick two random students.

361	"In the Judeo-Christian tradition, a divine being created a people with a free will. Omnipotence flows from this creation. If you create a world with certain physical laws, the fact that you can create those physical laws implies you had the power to decide on different laws and have the power to break those laws.

If God created the physical universe, is there any way he cannot be seen as omnipotent? This depends on your view of omnipotence. 

By including a creation with free will, God has already chosen to limit his omnipotence. Under free will, people can choose to do terrible things, and if God wants to remain consistent with the choice to give people free will, he will not be able to force a change. The question comes whether you consider the self-imposed limitations to mean that God is no longer omni-potent. Presumably, a being that creates the world and its physical laws has the power to force people to do as he desires. To that end, God is omnipotent and has chosen to limit himself by not forcing his will on people. 

What flows from this is likely that by choosing not to force his will on people, he cannot be omnibenevolent. The Judeo-Christian tradition teaches that God is good, that his benevolence is greater than a person's understanding. No teaching that the Judeo-Christian God is omnibenevolent would be consistent with actions of God in the Old Testament, the basis of belief for the Judeo-Christian God, in which God kills large numbers of people, and had to be responsible for the deaths of innocents. Given that these actions are described and considered truth by people following the Judeo-Christian God, no logical claim for omnibenevolence is consistent.

Omnipresence and omniscient follow from omnipotence.

It sounds like the issue you have is the inconsistence between a God who could choose to prevent suffering or evil and the omnipotence of the Judeo-Christian God. It's completely conceivable that an omnipotent being would choose to abide by his own limitations, the offering of free will to his creation and physical laws that can lead to suffering, and would therefore allow evil in the world, even as a good being. The teaching of God's goodness do no imply omnibenevolence, but instead that he doesn't relish in the suffering and does have a plan for salvation.

I'll add this isn't exactly my belief, as I'm leaning towards atheism at the moment, but this is consistent with Christian teachings."	19	['being created', 'be seen', 'are described']	3	3	0.15789473684210525	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['being created', 'be seen', 'are described']	3	3	0.15789473684210525	1	30118637765	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7wx1nd/_/du3uxmt/	478552729	30118582529.0	2018-02-11 23:29:49		I_want_to_choose	3	False	414	0	False	True	57.81

367	"&gt; Current race issues are more a relic of the past than actual racism

Just because the racism is no longer explicit and said aloud or codified with racist language - that does *not* mean racism is a relic of the past. In fact, it is more insidious now because it is a silent actor that requires people put effort into understanding the subtext. So lots of people can sit around denying that racism exists (or is codified) while in fact we have a school-to-prison pipeline system, a judicial system, implicit bias in teachers/doctors/prosecutors/employers/store clerks.....that adversely affects certain groups.

In less hyperbolic terms, you basically said nobody admits that they want to keep power away from minorities. But that's exactly what voters suppression laws and gerrymandering do. A vote is a form of power. If politicians can ensure that their opponents can't vote (or have a much harder time doing it) - they can protect their own power. And, actually, recently a court struck down gerrymandering in North Carolina for being **blatantly** racist.

 If we look at reality as primarily mental, than our consciousness would not be *in* the body. Rather, it would be the other way around: our body would be *in* consciousness. In that case it wouldn't be logical to expect consciousness to be dependent or tied down to a mental object that exists within it.

These are some good points, but they're specific to Europe, or at least Europe-influenced countries.

I think it's important to understand that this isn't what's happening. In Canada, it is illegal yet authorities have been instructed to not enforce the law in these cases. It is exactly what DACA under the presidential executive order from Obama was. 

If you're talking about moral hazard from future expectations, that's a different argument. In that case, you really have to account for the moral hazard introduced when DACA recipients (adults who came as children through no moral agency of their own) were promised amnesty in exchange for identifying themselves and being tracked as they met certain high standards for DACA eligibility. In reneging on that contract, we would introduce a moral hazard in punishing people who committed no crime for trusting the government with their information. That's a huge issue either way. 

So it comes down to doing the right thing really. With moral hazards in both direction, which do want to be true - that people guilty of no crime get punished or that they get mercy?

This is a very revealing answer. I don't mean that in an insulting way, I just think its important. 

*Not meant for them.*

I gotta admit, I don't know what that means, but I think this is a very persuasive thought in a lot of people's minds. That somehow the bounty of this country is *meant for* Americans. What's seems tied up in this concept is the idea that there's some *virtue* to being an American, as opposed to being from some other country. And that if you're from some other country, and we, as Americans, haven't granted you permission to come inside (i.e. you don't have a visa), that you are therefore not worthy of what we have.

I guess I just don't believe that. What this country has might be *available* to me, but it's not *meant* for me. That's my view on things. Not sure it makes a whole lot of sense, though, as I'm just sort of describing it on the fly.

&gt;I'm sure there's a lot about government, and the economy, on a large scale that I don't understand, I just feel that it will end up costing money to allow and even encourage people to evade immigration law and just show up here.

The question is ""should we cut off poor people"". I kind of feel like the answer is no, and I feel like you *also* think the answer is no. You don't seem like a bad or heartless person.

Mushrooms, on the other hand... they're gross looking.  Not wholesome at all - you kinda wonder if it's a poisonous mushroom.  You don't know what dose you're getting.  Etc.  If the government makes the pill form cheap and easily available, prosecutes dealers who sell the mushrooms, and/or sponsors a little fear/uncertainty/doubt campaign about lookalikes and about unscrupulous dealers dyeing random mushrooms blue to make a few bucks?

394	"&gt; Individuals will have to pay for these dash cams (through taxes).  Why is the perfect driver penalized for the false insurance claims and accident litigation for people he isn't directly associated with?

Dashcams will recue insurance costs offsetting the price.

Even a good drive can get in an accident. Having footage will reduce court costs.

Besides, good drivers are penalizes RIGHT NOW for false claims. Claims raise insurance rates for EVERYONE. 

So my plan is actually great for good drivers.

&gt;Are there times when aggressive driving is acceptable? Does every instance of aggressive driving need to be stopped? If a driver's reactions cause them to jerk aside or otherwise evade in a haphazard manner, might not the added moment taken to consider whether or not they'll be sued by the government impede their ability to avert disaster? Finally, should we make aggressive driving illegal, or simply fine people for instances of it? If we shouldn't jail people for aggressive driving, then we are accepting that aggressive driving, while problematic, is not such a problem that we must remove citizens from the streets, and therefore, the government doesn't need to be ""all up ons.""

You miss my point.

I am not proposing penalizing aggressive driving by itself.

What I am saying is that people will drive better if they know that in case of an accident - their bad driving will be necessarily revealed.

&gt;Dashcams are cheap, but bureaucracy is not. A government program to ensure the purchase, registration, and maintenance of dashcasms will need to have jobs created, which require salaries, which taxpayers will pay. Can you justify making the good driver pay for the mistakes of drivers he or she has nothing to do with? 

Same goes for, say airbags and seatbelts and a million other required car features.

396	"&gt;fossil fuels like coal and natural gas

There is a huge difference between coal and natural gas. In a country that still gets [38% of it's energy from coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_of_the_United_States), a platform of moving to natural gas is a good thing environmentally.

Natural gas releases only [59% of the CO2 per kWh of energy](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=74&amp;t=11) that coal does. Changing over all coal power plants would reduce the countries CO2 emissions by 600 million tonnes, which, based on the [2015 total CO2 emission of 5271 million tonnes](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=77&amp;t=11), is a reduction of 10%. This is not small, and is well worth doing. It's equivalent to replacing 600 TWh of coal production with solar, which is 20 times our current total solar capacity.

Pollution levels of things like [Sulfur and nitrogen oxides](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/switch-to-natural-gas-slashes-power-plant-pollution/) are hugely lower for natural gas as well, which, for human health, is probably more important in the short term. 

The ideal end goal is to have all energy coming from sustainable, non-polluting, sources. However, we have to realize that it isn't possible to just flip a switch and convert everything over. These processes take time. Is is valuable to, while still pursuing solar, transition towards low-carbon by improving the things we can, even if they may not be renewable.

Perfect is the enemy of good.

399	"&gt;Calling it rape culture leaves me feeling like society thinks rape is the norm and therefore acceptable. I will agree sexual assault is far too common, but I still think the majority of both genders agree rape is wrong.

I think you're missing the boat here. More specifically, when you say that ""both genders agree rape is wrong,"" you are making a significant oversimplification of how society conceptualizes sexual violence. Much of society tends to conceive ""rape"" in very narrow terms—something that occurs when a stranger forcibly assaults another stranger, for example. Yet the type of stranger rape you see on television shows is relatively uncommon. 

Let's abandon that stereotype and think about a much more typical scenario where rape can occur—a person who is intoxicated and unable to give consent. Much of society wouldn't consider this rape. Instead, the victim might have been asking for it, or they should have known better than to consume alcohol in the first place. Why do you think so many survivors remain silent? And why do you think so many perpetrators of rape knowingly get away with it? There are tremendous social and cultural forces at work that create an environment that is highly susceptible to many kinds of sexual coercion and violence, which in turn necessitate the terminology of rape culture.

&gt;I feel calling it rape culture is an excuse, a blanket statement to make us feel like we have an identifiable enemy, and a way to create tension between the genders which will NOT solve the problem.

Absolutely not the case. Elucidating rape culture is useful because it draws attention to the fact that there are systemic (read: widespread) structural forces at work that incentivize sexual violence and disempower survivors. Calling rape culture for what it is allows us to identify these forces and work to reduce their influence on individuals' behavior.

403	"&gt; 1.) In North America start ups don't tend to pay a lot of taxes. The majority of the their workers are contractors, they don't generate profits until later in their development, and they generate an incredible amount of debt which can be used to lower both the tax burden of the company and the investors.

&gt; 2.) Startup actually tend to encourage centralization or clustering. Clustering is where company and individuals that have a shared interest (Fin-tech, Robotics, etc) group together in an area. This reduces cost, allows them to have a shared worked pool (I hate my job, but I only have very specialized skills, good thing there are other companies that need these skills) and increases innovation. Most North American countries focus on clustering, with the government providing support for particular schools, universities, and incubator to be built around a particular topic.

I get what you’re saying, but I’m not sure how this counters my argument.

&gt; 3.) Generally speaking it makes more sense for the government to offer Start Up Financing, space in the form of incubators, and trade missions, then it is to reduce their tax burden. It's far more economical for the government to take a empty floor of a government building and call it a Incubator, and push investors through it, then it is to give tax benefits to renting an office.

The Nazis on the other hand were demonstratively willing to destroy artifacts rather than move it. That was Hitler’s order for France when it was about to be liberated, to destroy anything of social value like the Eiffel Tower. It was a basis for war crimes tribunal after the war, even if Germany thought it prudent to prevent cultural appropriation by the Allies and Free France…

That’s my main point. What’s your framework for making these decisions. I brought up crimes against humanity. The modern Rome Treaty which is basically the International Criminal Court defines the crimes nations agree to. One is destruction of cultural property. The first conviction was a few years ago:

&gt;	On 27 September 2016, the International Criminal Court, or ICC, convicted Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi of **intentionally directing** attacks against religious and historic buildings in Timbuktu, Mali during the 2012 occupation by Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. As a leader of the Hisbah, or the Manners Brigade, Al Mahdi ordered attacks on mosques and shrines with pickaxes, chisels, and heavy machinery. His actions were a war crime under the Rome Statute – the international law establishing the ICC – and his conviction was never in real doubt.

It’s actually an idea from the Civil War:

&gt;	It is a settled principle in international law that the deliberate targeting or plundering of religious, historic, and cultural sites is prohibited during war. The American Civil War established the precedent. In 1863, at the height of the conflict, Abraham Lincoln commissioned German-American legal theorist Francis Lieber to draft general legal guidelines for the Union Army’s operations. The ‘Lieber Code’ and its proscription of the seizure and destruction of what we now call ‘cultural property’ was incorporated into the Brussels Declaration of 1874 and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Violations of these principles in the First World War led to calls for a new treaty, which were interrupted by the Second World War.

So the question is, is possessing your own nation’s cultural property **deliberate** destruction, even if the nation is in danger of violence?  No. That’s not what the world agreed to, and I’d argue it’s easily taken advantage of by nations with no say to the property and no treaty law to point to.

425	"Hello, I have a pertinent scientific explanation of G-d. Please review the science below if you would like, and the section where I directly relate the explanation of science to religion has a bold header. Thanks!

It is quite long, but I cannot cut more and have the explanation make much sense. I will post the rest as a comment to my original post.

Ok, so here is some theoretical science. For reference, I will refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu5URbh-Lh0) video's explanation of String Theory, taken from Hawking's conceptual model I believe. Sorry if this is too simple, but if you need to skip lines here and there, feel free! I do not know what your prior knowledge level is.

There are 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal. That is to say that right now, everything you see is in 4D. It exists in 3 directions total (height, depth, and width), and it exists for a period of time. Anything which does not satisfy these conditions, cannot exist according to the laws of Physics, as it would have no manifestation. Even graphene, the thinnest substance ever made, contains 3D, even if one is negligible in a macroscopic frame of reference. Another property which matter must possess, due to its inherent and infamous relationship from Einstein's work, is energy ( E = m * c^2 ). We will come back to this.

For now, let's talk about the additional dimensions as outlined in string theory. First, I will define them, but before even that, we need a fundamental understanding of Quantum Mechanics. ""Quantum"" comes from ""quantized,"" which means ""reduced to its most fundamental form."" Particles are the smallest building blocks in the universe. Physics on that level is much different than physics on a macroscopic level (or on an astronomical level for that matter!). Some known discrepancies include uncertainty, tunneling, and other weirdness, and all of it stems from a fundamental aspect of nature that cannot be seen in macroscopic objects.

Superposition is a linear combination of states. I will explain what this means by using an electron as an example. We can never know exactly how much momentum (how fast a particle is moving with respect to its mass) and where the particle is at the same time. This is an inherent principle which has been proven time and again, so I won't get into it here, but looking up Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a good place to learn more. Instead of trying to know both, we consider an electron to be a probability curve in QM. An electron is represented by a wave equation. Think of a sound wave (i.e. speaker's vibrating). The sound is created by a specific pattern of sounds flying through air and being received in the vibration of your ear drum. Every time the speaker pushes outward, the sound wave crests, and every time it pulls back in, the wave troughs, /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ like that but curvier. So when we say probability wave, we mean that the probability is bunched up in certain places, finite states where it is possible to find an electron. This is actually how all particles exist. 

Ok, so maybe this has made no sense so far, but bear with me for an example. The double slit experience goes something like this: a single electron is fired at a wall with two slits in it, ---  -  --- something like that. Then, you put a film of some kind on the other side to catch and record an image of the electron. You would expect the electron to go through one slit or the other, and appear as a dot a straight line from one slit or the other, right? But no, instead, it goes through both slits, interferes with itself (since it is a probability wave, it can do this. Think of two ripples in a pond), and then creates an interference pattern on the wall behind it. Weird right? Weirder still: if you take a picture of the particle as it goes through the slits, then it will go through only one, and produce a single dot on the film. This is because, as soon as the particle is observed by a macroscopic object, it collapses into one state or the other.

So here is the wave equation: s1 = slit 1, and s2 = slit 2. Electron = c1 * s1 + c2 * s2. The two coefficients c1 and c2 represent the probability of each state being the one which the electron collapses into (in case you care, in an isolated system, this equation can be normalized, and actually looks like this Ψ = 1/sqrt(2) * [s1 + s2], meaning that the actual probability of each state is abs( 1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2, or 50%). 

This means the the particle is literally in two places at once, and falls into one or the other quantized state when you look at it.

You cannot see this in macroscopic objects, because with a whole bunch of wave equations doing this, the system decoheres very quickly, and collapses into one state. This is why we cannot tunnel through walls by running into them with a high momentum, many times, while particles can (there is a finite probability that they are already on the other side of the wall)!

But while we cannot apply this to macroscopic systems of atoms, we can apply it to time. Now we are entering back into string theory. The 5th dimension is a wave equation where each state represents the events that can possibly occur. The past is the part of the wave equation which has already collapsed, meaning that the probability of past events is 1 (or 100%), while all future events are superimposed and have a finite probability. Impossible events are still contained, but have a negative or 0 probability (depending on your coordinate system). 

Ok, so now, let's talk about something even weirder, quantum entanglement. Take another particle, and say it decays into two particles. Now, I need to introduce a concept called spin. In a similar fashion to how charge is the property of a particle which interacts with an electric field, spin is the property of a particle which interacts with a magnetic field. It is called spin, not because anything is actually spinning, but because the property mathematically behaves like linear momentum. Two particles in a system need to have different quantum numbers (charge, spin, etc) or else they would be the same particle (remember, the universe doesn't care about space like we do! The wave equations are intertwined, and there must be a way to tell the difference, or everything breaks down. If two particles have exactly the same numbers, then they are the same particle!)

So let's take a particle which decays into two electrons if left alone and has a spin of 0. These electrons are technically the same particle (in the sense that their wave equations are the same). Electrons can either be spin up or down (i.e. + / - 1/2). If you send these two entangled electrons shooting away from each other very quickly, one to me, and one to you on Jupiter, and we each observe one, then we know something about the other's particle. I know your particle must be spin down if mine is spin up and vice versa, because they have to add up to 0. How is it, that if I observe my particle first, I can accurately predict the outcome of your observation? This cannot be so, since the information the second particle needs to collapse would have to travel faster than the speed of light, which you can rest assured is impossible (as it requires infinite momentum). Einstein referred to this as ""spooky action at a distance.""

There are many theories for how this is possible, but I will focus on the one which is consistent to string theory. The entanglement collapses faster than light because once one it observed, it collapses in the past. That is not to say that it goes back in time, and moves forward as a pre-collapsed particle (this would have measurable implications which we do not see in experiments). Instead, time itself is superimposed, and when one particle collapsed into a state, it forced the two possible observation states to also collapse into a state. Therefore your particle is now in the opposite observation state as mine, and so your 4D event is selected via this probabilistic collapse. This is a satisfactory explanation, despite disagreement in the scientific community as of now for which is THE explanation.

Let's move on assuming it is correct, because this is the same understanding that we get in discussing the 6th dimension. If you could somehow fold the 5th dimension through the 6th, then you get this same behavior. Think of it like this: an ant is very small, and so is, for all intents and purposes, two dimensional if placed on a large flat sheet. Let's say the ant gets near an end, and you fold the sheet back, so that it crawls onto the middle, and then unfold the sheet. If the ant is not aware of the 3rd dimension, then it will seem to have been magically transported to a new location!"	80	['substance ever made', 'be seen', 'has been proven', 'is represented', 'is created', 'being received', 'is bunched', 'is fired', 'observed by a macroscopic object, it collapses into one state', 'can be normalized', 'are superimposed', 'are still contained', 'is called', 'are intertwined', 'be spin', 'is superimposed', 'is selected', 'have been magically transported']	18	17	0.2125	1	['is represented by', 'is created by', 'observed by a macroscopic object, it collapses into one state']	3	3	0.0375	1	['substance ever made', 'be seen', 'has been proven', 'is created', 'being received', 'is bunched', 'is fired', 'can be normalized', 'are superimposed', 'are still contained', 'is called', 'are intertwined', 'be spin', 'is superimposed', 'is selected', 'have been magically transported']	16	15	0.1875	1	26739898558	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f93x1/_/ca88try/	86085397		2013-05-29 14:47:08		[deleted]	2	False	1548	0	True	True	60.35

They are probably not acting on some high calculated plans to enslave humanity under their whim. However, just because we are not their prisoners, does not necessarily mean we are not being taken advantage of. To think that they are not affecting any of our policies and laws would be naive.

It is not a conscious decision to be evil by the elite, it is their subconscious and primal basic need to amass more wealth that leads to their actions and influence.

The reigning 0.01% has always been the same 0.01%, and throughout recent years we've only seen them get richer. And the rest? Sure there has been a lot of social mobility and the bottom line of poverty has been slightly raised, but the average wealth and living standards of the masses (with regards to advances in social, commercial and technological benefits) have been slowly but steadily dropping. And the point about humans having always been inclined to stick themselves in their bubble. I agree, that is basic human nature and has always been that way. However, technology, although not the cause of this social behavior, is severely enabling it. What has changed is not the problem itself but its scale. Now people have a readily available area to confine themselves into to avoid outside influences and opinions. Before, you still talked and worked with your colleague who may have been of another political party everyday. You still had to eat lunch with him, and chat with him during breaks. Now you can just take out your phone and ignore him. As he will you. Surrounding yourself with others who share your opinion is not harmful or wrong by itself. However at our current scale, it may be. 

Last thing, your point that democracy is the best representation of human society. I don't deny that. However, I find myself wondering. Just because it is the best representation of human society, does that automatically mean it is in the best interest of human society?"	42	['being taken', 'are driven', 'is fixed', 'has been slightly raised']	4	4	0.09523809523809523	1	['are driven by']	1	1	0.023809523809523808	1	['being taken', 'is fixed', 'has been slightly raised']	3	3	0.07142857142857142	1	30919544025	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9m1im4/_/e7cp4ux/	581217916	30917928584.0	2018-10-07 17:22:00	177919246764.0	foolme_bear	1	False	590	0	False	True	74.49

10 months? More like 3 years unless you use your phone for graphics intensive gaming. For the majority of people, their most used apps work fine on a Galaxy S4... the only thing keeping them back from doing so is battery life which lasts only 1.5 years. 

Anyways, A and B are not mutually exclusive. I think the way technology is headed, planned obsolescence is a feature not a bug. Companies are trying to maximize profit by maximizing consumption of products while making things easier to use *and* easily disposable/replaceable. Thus it *is* planned obsolescence on a wide scale though that's not necessarily a bad thing.

435	"Sorry, this is my mistake. I should have said: the new genders, requesting new pronouns (like Ze, Zer) are at best a fashion statement, and worst: trolling. And the reason I think this is because anybody who has the abstract feeling that the words ""male"" or ""female"" don't apply to them, must have a 50s style opinion of what these words means.

How does being neither male nor female manifest in these people? I refer to trans women as women and respect their gender identity. But what's a Zer? A zoman? And how does that manifest? 

Do they feel differently than they think men and women feel? They're a unique snowflake and behave in interesting unique ways that makes them not a women? That in their heart, they know: woman doesn't define me?

How can I bring myself to believe this is compelling or legitimate in any way?

Edit: myself and the trans community usually use the same vocabulary. Trans women and men use the words ""woman"" and ""men"". I'm specifically talking about the new wave of people inventing their own words because they're interesting or something. Why? Because you like your dick AND makeup? Men can wear makeup, bro.

One of the examples there was how most of the dialogue in the original Star Wars took place as an extension of what was happening. They were in a crisis trying to fix the ship and running around and shouting and dialog JUST HAPPENED. It was possible to do because they were actual sets.

In the new ones, since everything is done with green-screen, the maximum distance they can cover is couple of meters.

437	"I want to add a little bit of perspective to this from a side that you don't necessarily see as much. As a grad student I helped a professor put up a course through coursera and as part of that, I got to go to an informal lunch presentation with the university president, a bunch of deans from different colleges, and one of the co-founders of coursera, Daphne Koller.

One thing that you'll notice if you try a coursera class is that they've basically got the teaching part down pat. the classes are great and you learn a lot. However, becoming a degree granting institution would put a ton of onerous requirements on them that they are not equipped to deal with. The administration at my school have no problems with students learning through coursera, they think it's great. They're concerned with the degree granting aspect, since what you're really paying for when you go to a prestigious university is the degree.

At this point, no one really knows what's going to happen going forward but Daphne stated that they have no plans to become a degree granting institution. Instead,the way forward seems to be through partnerships where websites like coursera offer classes, but universities are still the ones that offer degrees, possibly by validating/offering credit for classes taken through coursera. This turns into a win-win for everyone since:

1. coursera still gets to give classes for free and benefit from free, volunteer instruction from professors at great universities
2. universities can save on classes offered by having students take them online instead. students still enroll since they want the degree
3. students can take free classes from great instructors

Right, but my point is that if you're trying to understand why the NBA of November 2019 is less popular than the NBA of November 2018 (and honestly right now you are arguing that it's less popular than, like, April 2019?), you should look for things that have changed substantially over the course of that year. The changes you don't like in the game have been going on for many years, and have corresponded with the league being more popular than it has been since Jordan retired. It's the exact same argument you start your ""West Coast Imbalance"" section with - the same logic applies here.

&gt; Well there is no ""recent boom of interest"" Adam Silver has done a great job marketing the league overseas and on the internet, but people are not watching the actual games. That's bad. There's no way around that.

471	"&gt; By your account then, design language isn't something as easily encapsulated as a GUI look-and-feel, as that entirely disgregards the applications themselves.

Yes. That’s oversimplified. 


&gt; Do you disagree with Wikipedia listing Aqua and Metro as design languages?

Yes. Those are examples of design languages. It seems like your discounting the *schemas* that change between Aqua and Metro. 

Their window management scheme is different. Iirc, Aqua had a “desks” concept. Metro has a much different full screen interaction. 

The chess example Wikipedia gives is a good one. 

&gt; Usually, design languages are not rigorously defined; the designer basically makes one thing in a similar manner as another. In other cases, they are followed strictly, so that the products gain a strong thematic quality. For example, although there is a great variety of unusual chess set designs, the pieces within a set are usually thematically consistent.

You can have all kinds of style differences in chess pieces that communicate the same exact thing. 

Or a better example might be non-visual interfaces. Consider the Amazon Echo series. They all share the behavior of listening in when you say a “wake word” and they all indicate this with a cyan and blue light bar. If instead of a “wake word” we made it wake in reaction to being shaken and indicate they’re listening with a “hello” along with the blue lights would we have changed the visual style? Not really.

475	"&gt;However, dreams must be put in realistic terms.

I definitely agree with this. I think someone who is interested in philosophy should try to become a professor, rather than hoping to get a job with a bachelor's degree. Yet, unfortunately, the rhetoric in our society is ""do your dreams, it'll all work out!"" And many college graduates never got to here the advice that dreams should be tempered with realism. That's one reason why *48% of college grads* aren't in jobs that use their degrees. Sure this problem is mostly isolated to the people who were misinformed-- *but that doesn't mean it isn't a problem, especially when there are so many people who fell victim to this misinformation*.

And one thing that I think a lot of people overlook-- just how hard it is to predict the future. [Here](http://www.cnbc.com/id/39541097/page/1) is a list of 9 jobs that could belong to bachelor's degree holders, yet, because of the changing economy, are rapidly disappearing. You graduated 10 years ago-- 15 years ago, when you were thinking about your major, could you have predicted everything that changed by now? Of course not! You were basing your decision off of what you knew at the time. Likewise, many people pick jobs that later are made obsolete. It isn't their own fault-- it just happens. But that doesn't mean it isn't a problem.

&gt;I feel like there are many paths to success, and not all of them involve chasing your dream directly. Learning life skills through pursuing a career in one field can give you the ability and the capital to succeed in another field later on. What I hate is the idea of wasted potential, where people pursue very limited opportunities unsuccessfully for long periods and waste opportunities for growth in other ways. There are stigmas to getting a job outside of one's dream path, but having money and learning skills for success can create a foundation later on if the initial attempts at one's dream do not work out.

I agree with this as well, but with one caveat-- if someone has already gone through college, and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, done piles of work, to get a degree in their dream field, it is devestating to them to have to become, say, a barista. I hate how Americans discredit and look down upon jobs that don't require bachelor's degrees, but if you've put in that money, and that time, you expect to get a well paying job that utilizes the degree you have. And if you don't, it is beyond disappointing."	21	['must be put', 'should be tempered', 'is mostly isolated', 'are made']	4	4	0.19047619047619047	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['must be put', 'should be tempered', 'is mostly isolated', 'are made']	4	4	0.19047619047619047	1	27860248484	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3c0rc5/_/csr9tb8/	201589349	27860231878.0	2015-07-03 16:25:38		bytor99	7	False	430	2	True	True	68.6

You are literally *so wrong,* to the point you couldn't be *more* wrong, that you can no longer participate in the game. The thing is, God understands that due to how we broke the system in the first place (through free will) means we can't keep the straight and narrow, and his solution is basically ""Accept that you're imperfect and that you need my help."" 

That might sound prideful, sort of like a narcissist's plan to make themselves feel good, but in God's case it's justified - again, his nature is what sets the definition for ""good,"" so by definition he is perfect.

God laying down the smack isn't an instance of him being cruel or heavyhanded. It's an example of him giving someone *exactly what they deserve* - the fact that he allows anyone to exist at all, given sin, is due to his mercy and desire to redeem us."	13	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	27401281044	9	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2iuj8x/_/cl60jro/	152590065	27401129047.0	2014-10-10 17:49:05		xthorgoldx	13	False	267	0	False	True	66.17

But I do know around 25% of undocumented immigrants are not working per the internet. I also know that conditions in some places like Mexico for example, are a lot worse than most of the US. So I only meant that people may still come and find a better life and job than what they had where they started, even if the influx in population makes finding work harder, poorer populations becoming larger, and other effects I don't know much about. Maybe it's a non issue. 

To your first comment. What do you mean like in Europe. Do you read the news. The immigrant and refugee crisis in Europe is devastating countries and economies and it is 100% not self regulating. In places like France you have huge immigrant populations that hate the French and create a breeding ground for turmoil and hate (though largely due to historical prejudice). In the UK they are tightening immigration policies to force ppl out because the have an excess. Countries like Greece and other eastern Europe countries are plummeting financially, and not because of immigration and refugees but that is piling on top. 

I just didn't understand what you meant.

Cool with 10s of thousands of people living in your state but not paying taxes while your state has some of the highest taxes in the country and is struggling financially?

Let's say ""This is my story that I wrote, I would like some critiques"" and on the inside was ""Helen Keller and Adolf Hitler have an incestuous orgy with their parents.""  Is this story idea worth the time to be viewed and discussed?  I'd argue it isn't.  So, ideas that are obviously bad and need to be fixed are downvoted, and ideas that can't be constructively critiqued.  In this situation, how exactly do you critique the idea.  The most you can do is comment ""This is a bad idea,"" which is what a downvote conveys.  Content that is worth critique, that needs critique, and that is worth the time to view and discuss is upvoted, while the opposite is downvoted.  

A story idea that is downvoted w/o critique is largely unhelpful.  But it does tell the OP that their idea is generally disliked.  This is helpful in itself.  Imagine if the OP posted their idea, got no feedback and no upvotes.  They'd assume that their post was just ignored, or not seen.

484	"Well, I don't have a scientific study to back it up, but I'm reasonably confident that most law enforcement officers would not go along with an illegal use of control.

As far as the viral videos you've described, are you sure that the person recording is more knowledgeable than the law enforcement officer they are recording about the laws? Could the LEO be at a loss for what to do or agitated because the person is just refusing to comply with the lawful orders?

The problem is, the laws across the country vary widly.  Some states (almost half, https://www.flexyourrights.org/faqs/when-can-police-ask-for-id/) have stop and identify laws.  This means that if they have reasonable suspicion to believe the subject is committing a crime, the subject has to identify themselves.

Now, we generally only see one side of the video...that of the person wanting to provoke a response from LEO's.  We don't see the discussions amongst LEO's about the call for service.  We don't know what was reported by the calling party.  We don't know what other articulable facts are known by the LEOs involved either.

Because of this, we have to ask if the LEO you are describing is actually overreaching with their authority.

Further, I am involved on many different gun forums, and like to speak with people regarding firearms, and the applicable laws.  Most times, you see people involved in these discussions recommending that citizens be cordial, but not to speak with a LEO without a lawyer present.  They suggest giving the bare minimum needed to end the encounter, with as little discussion as possible.  This is one of the common recommendations on ar15.com, which is a large gun forum with 496,219 registered members on it.  I'd say that's a few more than just identifying one or two people randomly dispersed that are critical or suspicious of law enforcement, and very much pro-2A.

As far as your BLM argument, I think there is a very large distinction between being critical/suspicious of law enforcement, and propagating the theory that cops frequently and intentionally focus their efforts to violate the rights of people of color, or that there is inherent bias in law enforcement against the same.

The Blue Lives Matter movement started after several people claiming affiliation with black lives matter started to intentionally target and shoot/kill law enforcement officers following the Alton Sterling shooting in Baton Rouge, LA.  The ""organization,"" ""following"" or whatever you want to describe the blue lives matter title as does not form a distinction between any other groups of people, but wanted to raise awareness that law enforcement was being targeted.  Black Lives Matter is specifically singling out law enforcement as the cause of their problems.

485	"&gt;Toxic masculinity is one of those buzzwords that I keep seeing through my reading of today's culture wars.

First of all, yes, the term ""toxic masculinity"" is misapplied and overused just like pretty much any other term on the internet and especially those related to gender issues.  I would argue that ""culture wars"" is even more of a ""buzzword"" than toxic masculinity, but that's really a different debate.  

&gt;Personally, though, what's wrong with ""toxic"" masculinity?

So, obviously aside from the abuse example, the problem with ideas of masculinity that could be called ""toxic"" is not that they promote dominance, confidence, sexual aggression, or ambition.  The problem with the kinds of masculinity you see referred to as toxic (by people who aren't just lobbing accusations at any male who they disagree with) is that they have a much greater tendency to promote the devaluation of women.  

The Red Pill community here on reddit (and elsewhere to some extent) is a great example.  On the face of it, it's about people ""taking the red pill"" and waking up to the fact that they need to ""increase their sexual market value"" by being more confident, working on their appearance, and not being afraid of judgment.  If it was purely a subreddit promoting male sexual dominance (in an ""alpha"" sort of way, not in a ""rule the world"" kind of dominance) then there wouldn't really be much controversy around it.  Hell if it were just a subreddit for pick up artists it probably wouldn't be much to talk about.  But the problem with The Red Pill as a community is that it promotes a seriously unhealthy idea of women and relationships.  Users regularly refer to women as ""plates"", as in ""how many plates can you keep spinning"" because they are regularly manipulating multiple women into sleeping with them without any commitment.  Many in the community regard commitment to any one woman as a sign of weakness, never mind marriage.  Some have even stated that women are incapable of love in the way that men are, and as such do not deserve love from men.  There are even discussions about how women are just naturally suited to subservience to men, how women are genetically less intelligent, and how women are all sluts who desire to be raped.  

This kind of thinking also devalues men who do not follow the same line of thinking.  People on the Red Pill will refer to men who have different ideas about masculine sexuality as ""Blue Pill"" men or ""White Knights"".  It devalues men too, just to a lesser extent than it devalues women.

Does that represent all men?  Certainly not.  Does that even represent everybody who frequents that community?  No, it does not.  But when people talk about toxic masculinity, they are referring to ideas about what a male should be that tend to de-value women *and* men  I'm all for promoting men, but not at the expense of everybody else."	22	['is misapplied and overused just', 'could be called', 'are just naturally suited', 'be raped']	4	3	0.13636363636363635	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is misapplied and overused just', 'could be called', 'are just naturally suited', 'be raped']	4	3	0.13636363636363635	1	29273702411	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/64t5gf/_/dg4t1cb/	370875615		2017-04-11 16:46:41		I_am_the_night	33	False	492	2	False	True	57.2

Like adding black characters who only personality trait is being black/woke or a Gay character who only role is to be gay and nothing more. These are obvious forced diversity because the story would of been the same without them. 

Like for example the Roosterteeth show ""Rwby"" it started out great but after a certain point the show only cared about shipping all thier girl characters with girl characters even to the point were the plot declined. 

Another example would the the Comic Malfunction on ""DC comics"" and ""Marvel' comics were they are constantly changing people's gender,sexuality,and race to be more diverse. They even Hired people for being a certain color because to them ""only black people can write black people"".

The difference between creative freedom and forced is how the show started. Did the show start with a all male cast and then later changed into a all female cast because women don't have enough Representation, Then that's forced. Is this a totally New IP with no background whats so ever and all the characters are gay,then it depends on what the author said about thier show.

503	"It's the nature of sexual misconduct accusations that there is often little evidence to support it. Most cases of sexual harassment and rape happen between people who knew each other prior to the incident, often in a private environment. It's the nature of those incidents that there are only two people present and that there is often no objective evidence of what happened exactly later on. Let's say there are two people in a room, one suddenly starts fondling the other, who breaks free and leaves the room. We all agree that this is not okay but there is absolutely no way the victim can ever prove that this happened. 

You're making proof a requirement when proof is often not available. In a court of law that means that you cannot be convicted. But society is not a court of law. When the accusations seem to have merit (the victims don't have anything to win, there are multiple victims reporting independently from one another etc) it is prudent to believe them even if it's not enough for a conviction. 

Yes, this ultimately means that people (usually men) are under constant threat of being wrongfully accused of a crime. But on the other hand people (often women) are under threat of being victims of actual sexual harassment. This situation is not ideal but there is no way of finding a perfect solution.

514	"&gt; I also believe that cities should not be allowed to obtain insurance for police misconduct settlements so that the costs can not be spread by the insurers beyond the applicable locality. This is common practice today. 

Insurance companies can actually be a really good force for getting cities to address their police corruption / misconduct issues (and have done so in the past) \[[source](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/insurance-companies-police/529833/)\]. In fact, they are likely more effective at getting these changes than forcing tax payers to pay for the costs, because private companies who insure cities for police misconduct are able to demand specific reforms of police procedures, whereas voters vote based on a whole host of factors and aren't just focused on the 1 issue of police misconduct, nor do they have nearly the amount of leverage over cities that private insurers have. 

So, if your CMV is:

&gt;CMV:Local governments are not internalizing costs of police misconduct. Rioting and looting are chaotic, yet predictable, manifestations of these externalized costs. Localities (not insurers or businesses) where police misconduct occurs should fully bear cost of damage to internalize them.

Consider that localities bearing the costs of riots likely won't be as effective a source of police reform (since they will be paid by public taxes - not directly by police). And if the costs are beyond what the locality can pay, they will be paid by the taxes of higher, non-local levels of government  / by citizens that aren't in that locality, and thus can't demand reforms in that location through their voting.

Insurance companies, however, can demand specific reforms that cities are responsive to."	12	['be allowed', 'spread by the insurers beyond the applicable locality', 'paid by public taxes - not directly by police', 'will be paid']	4	3	0.25	1	['spread by the insurers beyond the applicable locality', 'paid by public taxes - not directly by police', 'will be paid by']	3	3	0.25	1	['be allowed', 'spread by the insurers beyond the applicable locality']	2	1	0.08333333333333333	1	34368792012	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/gtsmxa/_/fseahn0/	1017503758	34368738557.0	2020-05-31 02:53:32	49737010.0	thethoughtexperiment	1	False	269	2	True	True	36.02

The latter part of your sentence is exactly what I'm digging at. A special interest group of course cannot represent *all* interests, but in representing their own, they need to avoid negatively affecting other groups, else judging whether their group has been a net positive impact on society is difficult.

&gt;The methods the special interest uses are irrelevant since if they work people are convinced and ""convinced people"" are the unit of truth in democracy, not facts.

I think you're getting at a means-to-an-end thought from the perspective of a special interest group. I agree that a group doesn't *need* facts to get their work done, but exactly my point is that in the absence of facts, they can still get their work done. And work done which implicates policy change on the basis of feeling is much less likely to target a problem and net a positive outcome than work done on the basis of fact."	6	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	30329481495	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8d9evn/_/dxle1p3/	506003603	30329451066.0	2018-04-18 19:26:09		eadala	1	False	189	2	False	True	52.53

Can other people tap into this energy or sense it or observe its results on your mind and body? Because if not, I'm curious to know what you believe makes you so special, and if others can, it's clearly not subjective, and should be able to be studied scientifically, not to mention you keeping the secrets to yourself seems rather selfish.

&gt;I have ideas for mechanisms and processes, and while these ideas may be unverifiable because they are not observable, I think the fact that I do believe in these mechanisms makes them different than magic

That seems like an odd bit of logic: you know it's not magic because you believe in its mechanisms?  Plenty of magical beliefs have clear mechanisms and guidelines, but that doesn't mean throwing salt over your shoulder actually wards off ill fortune. Seems like you think magic would just be too silly to believe in, so clearly the thing you believe in can't be magic.

&gt;Hmm. I don't know. Maybe because, as you said, somewhere deep down I'm afraid of dying in a godless universe. Or perhaps I just like having a story behind everything. 

I can respect that level of self-awareness. I do encourage you not to be quite so afraid of potential truths though: the mysteries of the universe are wondrous enough without adding the supernatural, and a garden can be beautiful even without fairies hiding in it.

&gt;I respect people who come to a different conclusion from that argument, and I would ask those people to also respect the conclusion that I came to.

What do you mean by categorizing people based on ""gender?"" As we mentioned before, people use gender/sex to mean any number of things interchangeably at baseline.

Feminism rallies itself around gender equality through the lens of women's liberation. Intersectionality posits that we need to make sure we are looking at all women's concerns to make sure feminism is remaining true to its goal. Feminism and men's liberation follow similar philosophies and ally with each other for political rallying because people feel something (whether rationally or not) about their identities. 

And I mean identity in a very broad term. How people define themselves (black, Asian-American, Libertarian, a butcher, a Democrat, an egalitarian, etc.) means something to them even though some of those labels are not necessarily based in completely rational thinking. I think there's such a thing as trying to over-rationalize things because humans are not rational by their nature. I wouldn't say we're illogical by nature either to be clear but so much of our behavior is just gut instinct that isn't necessarily rational in the moment.

They taught me ways to cope with loss and deal with my mental illness. One of the ways they helped, specifically, was by helping me to reduce my dependance on alcohol. I use to go to class drunk, if at all. I was falling behind and my therapist was critical to my recovery.

Because of them, I had the tools and knowledge to make positive changes in my life and now I'm getting ready to graduate with a Master's in a few months. My life literally turned around.

All healthcare services are critical, and not all students are fortunate enough to have private care. I was one of these students.

560	">If someone knows how to strike, doesn't matter how big and strong the opponent is if they don't know how to strike.

Sure, but size still is an advantage. The person not knowing how to strike is still better of being bigger, right? 

>Look at Ronda rousey. She was dominant in women's MMA. Very accomplished grappler and judo medalist in the in the Olympics. People thought she was unbeatable. As soon as she went against accomplished strikers she looked like a complete amateur.

But being big and a good sticker aren't exclusive, so I don't get this argument, since it would seem like even these strikers would benefit from more mass and muscle. 

Also, professional fighting is difficult to bring into this since they have weight categories, so they never have giant people going against normal people, like things are in the normal world. 

One classical example of what I am pointing out, if you are interested in look up, is the Ernesto Hoost vs. Bob Sapp fight.  Bob has literally no technique at all, where was Hoost was an expert, but still Bob beat him up by just the mere power and size difference. Like after watching that fight, it is really hard thing to argue that size wouldn't have been an advantage for Bob and that, had Hoost had the size of Bob, he would have easily won. 

>I wrestled for 8 years, I've seen plenty of times smaller wrestlers dominate larger stronger wrestlers though superior technique and skill.

Sure it can happen, but it doesn't mean the size wouldn't have been a benefit to them. Like I think you would agree that even you would be a better wrestler if you would have more muscle mass (naturally), since muscles at the end of the day, are the things which move your body around and hence able you to do what you want to do."	16	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	44234442348	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/188bq0b/_/kbk1m5o/	2674495595	44234258020.0	2023-12-01 13:23:23	371775291429.0	T12J7M6	1	False	317	3	False	True	77.98

564	"The issue is that the government incentivized a certain organization of health care financing, and this approach means the health care consumer rarely has the incentive to shop around. In theory, a necessary first step in developing a market for transparently priced health services requires consumers who have to pay out of pocket. There has been some movement in this area for competitively priced clinics in bigger cities, but these cities also have pretty competitive health care marketplaces that work in a similar way. The biggest issues for coverage rates are in rural areas where it is hard to find a doctor in the first place, nonetheless a doctor who is priced competitively. 

National or State regulation of service prices is probably the only way to get the prices down, but that would require some substantial cuts in wages, in a field that isn't able to supply enough workers to maintain the status quo. Add to the political difficulties when the American Medical Association has a bunch of doctors talk about how they will have to stop practicing medicine after payment cuts, and you might see the writing on the wall.

565	"I honestly think a massive walk-out is the only thing that could work. The current generation of voters has clearly showed they don't give a flying fuck about school shootings anymore. It's background noise at this point.

From what I've read/seen online, the walk-out isn't so much about solidarity with the victims, it's about the fact that many people do not feel safe going to school anymore. If I was a parent and my child honestly did not feel safe going to school, I don't know if I could force them to. I wouldn't feel safe going to school at this point. When I was in high school, everyone knew ""that guy"" who was a little off and could potentially shoot up the school. I think every school has ""that guy."" And if my child was refusing to go to school out of fear, you bet your ass I would be on the phone with my state representitives every day until this gets resolved.

The fact that the Florida shooter was known to police and school officials, had multiple police calls regarding his behaviour, and had been reported to the FBI but was still able to purchase a rifle shows that there isn't much more that people at the community and local level can do. Denying guns to people with known mental illness is the least thing the government can do...and that was a restriction that Trump got rid of last year.

Also consider that about half of the high schoolers now will be voting age by 2020. Younger people tend to swing liberal as it is, and the older conservative generation is dying out. A lot of the social issues of the Republican platform do not sit well with the generation currently in high school. They've grown up following gay and trans people online, they know how ineffective abstinence-only sex education is, they are more comfortable with immigrants and foreigners due to exposure to different peoples on the internet. If the Republican party wants to stay relevant in the long term, they need to at least out in some reasonable gun control. How they react to a national student walk out will stay in the minds of these young future voters. Do the conservatives enact some gun control, or do they rely on (armed) police and truancy laws to force students back to school?

You are right that there are a lot of students who will use this as an excuse to skip school. I'm sure some political talking heads will harp on that point. The fact that a lot of chatter online is centering around walking out on the anniversary of the Columbine shooting, which is also the unofficial official weed smoking holiday (April 20th) will be brought up and argued over ad nauseaum. But ultimately it doesn't matter...large numbers of students walking out and refusing to go to school will be a huge problem that the government will need to solve. Either on a state or federal level, there will need to be a definitive response to this. Are the adults in charge going to fix anything, or are they going to do nothing? The one's who do nothing will be getting the boot as soon as the next generation comes of voting age. It is, understandably, a huge deal to them."	26	['gets resolved', 'was known', 'had been reported', 'got rid', 'will be brought']	5	4	0.15384615384615385	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['gets resolved', 'was known', 'had been reported', 'got rid', 'will be brought']	5	4	0.15384615384615385	1	30141053919	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7yjg3n/_/duh7e1r/	481277507		2018-02-19 02:59:22		SpaceObama	12	False	555	0	False	True	68.3

575	"To preface, I don't believe art should be censored and I believe strongly in the freedom of expression and speech, even if it makes other people uncomfortable--and the audience similarly has the freedom to react. Artists should not be immune to criticism or backlash. 

I grew up in a town near Newtown and I know families who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook shooting. I don't wish to co-opt their pain or make their tragedy mine (it's absolutely not), but I've seen it from a closer vantage point than perhaps the average citizen. 

I do feel a visceral disgust seeing someone who is (presumably) completely removed from that community wearing a sweatshirt bearing its name. I feel angry when I see the model, a full-grown man, in that sweatshirt when 20 kids had their lives cut short just for being at that school at the wrong time. I see the artfully-placed holes and think about what's missing: the copious blood, the lifeless bodies, the reality of a shooting. I sympathize with a friend of mine who lost a family member, who I know still feels the pain of that day whenever Sandy Hook (or really any shooting) comes up, no matter how benign, and how she must feel to have it in the news, again.

Maybe this disgust and anger is not ""justified."" Why does it need to be? One of your other comments mentions that this outrage should be directed at mass shootings in general or people who can change the gun laws. That implies that you can only be outraged at one thing at a time, which is just not true. The fact is, after Sandy Hook, people did direct their outrage, and it seemed like there were legislators listening. Connecticut passed a major gun legislation bill. Within six weeks after the shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and proposed 12 congressional actions regarding gun control. (Unfortunately, due to a number of factors, the 2013 Assault Weapons Ban did not pass.) None of it changed the fact that 26 people died.

I can feel outraged at the lawmakers who care more about their support within the NRA than the lives of Americans. I can feel outraged at the lack of accessible mental health services for troubled people. I can feel outraged that there is not a consistent way to report suspicious people. I can also feel outraged that a fashion designer chooses to use this event to make a vague statement that seems to be more about being newsworthy than actually saying something. 

All of this to say: I do believe artists have the freedom to express themselves, and fashion falls under that umbrella. He is under no obligation to justify his art.

You're a teacher, you've seen the bullying cycle - one of the most interesting pieces of research I've seen is that bullies tend to interpret neutral events (a stray ball hits them) as hostile (""that kid threw the ball at me!"") and respond with retaliation. That's the mini version of the second abuser. A lot of times those kids grew up in environments where everyone actually *was* kinda out to get them, and that's their worldview. So they go through life accusing everyone else of being the bully, and their own bad behavior is always justified because they're always acting in self-defense.

Basically, if you think every single person in your life is out to get you, yeah, you may be the bully/abuser. 

I still don't think kids cause or deserve abuse. Kids didn't ask to be born, and they have so little control (physically, legally, etc) over their life situations that there's just no way to say ""it's their fault for staying with that abusive mom!""

587	"I don't think your view is defensible as-is, because there's such a wide variety of films that are ""documentaries"". Let's take, for example, the film Meru. Award-winning documentary about an incredible mountain climb.

&gt;Someone has an idea for a documentary, they get the idea approved

Not really. One of the guys who climbed Meru is also a filmmaker, so he brought his camera along. It's very obvious that he didn't know what the film would be like, or even that there would be a film at all, in the beginning. He certainly didn't have to get approval from anyone else for the idea.

&gt;and it is the filming of the documentary then consists of the filmmakers trying to justify their conclusions by manufacturing visual and auditory evidence. 

Again, really doesn't apply to Meru at all. The film doesn't really have any ""conclusion"" - it's just about whether or not they could climb the mountain. They did, and the evidence of that is the footage of them doing it. Nothing was ""manufactured""; it's just a visual recording of the shit that happened as they were doing a cool thing.

&gt;No opposing views are taken into consideration unless their purpose is so that filmmakers can show how their view can stand scrutiny, when in reality they are avoiding their harshest or most sensible critics.

Again, doesn't apply at all to Meru.

Meru is only one example, of course, but there are thousands of documentaries out there that I could say the same thing about. I think what you're talking about is op-docs, which are basically opinion essays in video form. But even among those, you seem to be describing shitty/manipulative ones. Many of them do present multiple points of view or otherwise expose themselves to critical perspectives (and in the end, any film that's released to the public is open to criticism from all sides). I'm sorry you saw a shitty documentary, but I don't know why you're trying to pin its sins on the rest of the genre. What you're arguing here is like saying all rap music is terrible because one particular subgenre kind of sucks.

I do think it's important for people to remember that with any doc, they're seeing someone's perspective, because by the nature of the medium the director/editor has to choose what to include, what not to include, what music to set with it, etc. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's biased or shoving some point of view down your throat while ignoring contrary evidence. 

&gt;This is the opposite of science

Documentaries are films. It's storytelling, not science. 

&gt; most documentaries try to invoke emotional responses in order to get the audience on their side.

Most documentaries try to evoke an emotional response because that's what makes for an effective film, same as fiction films. Sure, some documentaries are also informative journalism, but at the end of the day, entertainment is often the primary goal.

&gt;If you want to change my view I would recommend pointing out some review process which is inherent in all documentaries. Or a review process which says which documentaries are trustworthy and which aren’t.

Uh...movie reviews? Any publicly-released documentary that's worth your time is going to be reviewed by a number of critics, as well as lots of regular viewers on various websites. Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Amazon, etc...you can easily read reviews of any major documentary from tons of different people and perspectives, and unless you're going on opening night, that information is available before you watch the films.

i somewhat agree with you But if it is based on time and I buy a beer and pay with exact cash shouldn't I be paying next to nothing? 

At a restaurant you are tipping a waiter, bus boys, cooks, and hosts. The reason it works is at nicer restaurants there are more employees doing the same job. You pay more for your meal and your higher tip goes to more people. 

Obviously the best case scenario would be to just have a livable wage. 

Here is an interesting thought though. In cities that are raising their minimum wages to $15 an hour am I still going to be expected to tip well? It seems to be that food service employees are going to be ridiculously well compensated for a job that takes no skills.

595	"I quite agree with you to a point. Blaming someone else when you have agency does come across as blame shirting here, but it depends on what angle you use and if you think it's common practice or rare or non existent. 

Let look at a more loaded example. There are people in abusive relationships that can leave without losing their safety or health, if they don't feel that is true though they won't. They may stick around for various other reasons also. Does it feel right to assign blame to them? Would you say the abuser has control over them?

Same with addicts. It's a tough one. They are responsible for doing what they are addicted to but that thing also has control over them. Do we assign blame to then and if so to what degree? Is it their choice to keep doing that thing, is it an unimpeded choice? Is it a little more complicated than it all their fault or none of it is their fault?

I don't believe that sex is used to control men in general, in healthy relationships even less so. Compromising is not controlling and is good in healthy relationships. That's not to say it does not happen at all, I belive it does happen.

That's how addiction works, its not rational. Seeing those things in that case does take away some of your power. That person has to put far more of their power into saying no than you do.

597	"&gt; Let's start by looking at the first group, the advocates who want to ban rifles like the AR-15. This group is interested in curbing mass violence like we saw in Vegas, Sandy Hook, Orlando, etc. They're not really interested in solving the problem of inter-personal homicide which makes up the majority of homicide deaths.

I understand the desire of these groups, and I understand a knee-jerk relation to an emotional stimulus, and I think most gun owners feel similarly. What I get hung up on is taking measures which sound good, but don't offer much in the way of results. Time and time again, we've witnessed events where motivated individuals have been able to exploit vulnerabilities leading to terrorist attacks. Timothy McVeigh did it in 1996 with barrels full of fertilizer and diesel fuel and killed over 200 people. 19 men highjacked airliners and killed over 3000 on 9/11. Pressure cookers in the Boston bombing. Pistols in the columbine and VA Tech shootings. A shotgun and pipe bombs at the most recent. Charles Whitman killed 17 with a bolt action rifle. Banning AR-15's is, at best, an ineffective half measure that'll drive the price of my collection up, and at worst a stepping stone to scream ""it wasn't enough"" when the next mass shooting inevitably happens. We'll wind up spending a ton of money and political capital that could have otherwise gone toward treating the underlying causes of individual strife. 

&gt; I will say though that I think it's faulty to attribute the badness here to white privilege, it's better attributed to neo-liberal individualism

Honestly, when I read that, I thought neo-liberal individualism was euphemistic language for white privilege. I might have to give you a delta right here.

&gt; First you assume that collection would be performed by local authorities. It would make more sense, and would be safer, if this gun collection was carried out by an expanded ATF.

Honestly, I can't ever see this being politically feasible. Talk about ""'gubmint troops in blue helmets come to take the guns away."" That's where you see the second American civil war.

If there is a gun grab, it's gonna happen at the local level.

&gt; The second is the assumption that gun enforcement would turn into a rehash of the war on drugs.

If there is an outright prohibition, I don't think there is a doubt. The incentive between giving up my gun for $250 or possibly nothing, or filing off serial numbers, packing them in grease, and burying them in my yard until they ripen to a price of $10k per rifle might not be too difficult for a lot of people. Talk about guns flooding into the hands of criminals. Also, what happens when an illegal gun is invariably used in a legitimate self defense scenario? Do you imprison the person who was otherwise minding their own business and shoots someone who intruded into their home because of plastic accessories that the gun happens to have?

&gt; Guns are the implements in larger crimes, whereas drugs themselves are the crime

It's interesting that you bring this point up, because the working theory behind criminalizing drugs is that using them Influence the individual to commit crimes. The same lines as prohibition and the temperance movement, except this time Harry Anslinger struck the fear of god into the hearts of white men coast to coast by declaring that marijuana (also a racially charged name, which was also the invention of Anslinger) would cause black men to go into a frenzy which led them to ravish white women. And by the way, the prohibition of marijuana began with a tax stamp.

&gt; The third faulty assumption is the idea that these government regulations would inevitably come out of social programs.

Assuming there are 300 million guns in private hands, and the government buys each back at $250, you're looking at spending somewhere in the neighborhood of $750 billion dollars. Where else would the money come from? And that's not counting the additional law enforcement effort going into such an operation. And all that to do what? Turn thousand dollar rifles into $2 of scrap metal? I think there are much more productive ways to spend tax payer money.

&gt; Your last point is I think you're strongest and the only problem I have with it is that it assumes that these gun control advocates are ok with the conditions of public city schools, which is hard to show.

By virtue of the fact that this is how inner city schools are running today, I don't think they have much of a problem with it.

If you can parse neo-liberal individualism from white privilege, I'll give you the delta.

609	"&gt; If a preacher says to his very devout followers “God does exist”, he is making a claim which he intends to be objective. His followers will interpret it as objective. But is it really objective? I wouldn’t really say so, since it is not based on any good objective data.

But whether a claim is objective or not doesn't depend on whether it is based on data. For example, I can thoroughly shuffle a deck of cards claim that ""the top card of this deck is red"" and, while this claim is not based on any data whatsoever, it is still objective. It is objectively either true or false. So lack of data can't be used to say that a claim is not objective. And thus we have no good reason to believe that the preacher's claim is not objective. (Although we do have many good reasons to say that his claim is false.)

&gt;So if it isn’t objective but he thinks it is, then isn’t that similar to what I’m saying about morality?

The problem with this is that if you allow for the possibility that a large community can be uniformly wrong about what their language means (despite communicating effectively among themselves), it is difficult to find a good basis for having any knowledge about language at all. How can we know anything about the meaning of language, if what a statement is intended to mean, how it's understood, and what its effect is in the world, can all be uniformly wrong in ways we can't detect?

&gt;Similarly, we tend to talk as though our taste in food is factually correct (ice cream is delicious; eggs are gross!), but that does not make it objectively correct.

I don't think very many people actually would interpret these as objective statements. ""Delicious"" and ""gross"" are both adjectives with a subjective meaning. In fact, preferences about food are the _archetypal_ examples of subjective statements, so it is hard to believe that people are actually intending them to be objective."	15	"['be used', 'is intended', ""'s understood""]"	3	2	0.13333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['be used', 'is intended', ""'s understood""]"	3	2	0.13333333333333333	1	29943481122	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7jlers/_/dr7kpwi/	456174856	29943422239.0	2017-12-13 20:11:36		yyzjertl	2	False	339	3	False	True	69.31

614	"Do you believe in objective truth as a concept?  In other words, is there anything that we can evaluate in terms of ""good or bad"" and arrive at an objective truth?

Basically, I seem to agree with your premise but not where it leads you.  I agree there's no objective truth in broad terms like ""the movie is good"" or ""the movie is bad,"" but I disagree that that doesn't mean his opinion isn't better than yours.  If we're making any sort of practical evaluation (who should we hire to give a lecture about the film, who should we fund to make a film, who's essay should we read on the film) we're always going to choose Tarantino.  

I also disagree with (what I think are) the implications of what you're putting forth.  Basically, I agree that there's no absolute truth with regard to ""is the movie good or bad,"" but that doesn't mean we can't evaluate how accurate each person's claim is by considering what evidence they put forth, how they analyze that evidence, and whether that analysis stands up to scrutiny.  In other words, we decide how right they are by looking at the work they did.

This is somewhat tangential, but I want to offer some explanation of what made me comment on this post in the first place.  As I've said, I'm a poet.  I've dedicated a large amount of my life to reading, writing, exploring, and thinking about poetry.  I just returned to school for a doctorate, but prior to that I was teaching.  I'm certainly not into the idea of creating some hierarchy, and I think there are *huge* historical problems, particularly among critics (a little less perhaps among poets), with establishing a group of gatekeepers who get to determine what does and does not have value.  However, it's also really important to acknowledge that the creation of a work of art is just that, *work*.  I think that artworks have a tremendous ability to help us understand the world, understand ourselves, and understand the relationship between the two (for my money, this is a basic role of art).  The language of ""art is subjective"" tends to be used to trivialize the work that is art.  Why would you dedicate yourself to poetry, it's all subjective anyway?  In other words, ""objectivity"" is always privileged as better or more valuable than ""subjectivity"" in our society.  

The truth is that of course part of analyzing an artwork is subjective.  When I am reading a poem, I am (or at least I try to be) cognizant of myself (the subject) who is doing the reading.  And part of my evaluation is determined by that subject (again, me.)  So yes, I am being subjective.  But part of my response is also based on the object (the poem.)  I'm looking at line, sentence, image, metaphor, rhythm and meter etc.  So part of my evaluation of the work is without question objective.  Honestly, I think that the subjective/objective binary is not a particularly useful one.  I find other binary's more useful (so in the 90's there was a rise in thinking in terms of situated vs generated or absolute vs contextual evaluations.  Recently I've been thinking a lot in terms of internal vs external.  To what extent do we evaluate a work of art from inside it and to what extent do we evaluate a work of art from outside it).  These are obviously related to the concepts of subjective and objective, but they're not the same thing.  

And lastly, if we want to say that it's not objective evaluating artworks (because there is definitely a subjective component) then we also have to say that it's not subjective (because there is definitely an objective component).  Again, for me this leaves us in a position where we should acknowledge the subjective/objective binary just isn't particularly useful."	32	['be used', 'is determined']	2	2	0.0625	1	['is determined by']	1	1	0.03125	1	['be used']	1	1	0.03125	1	32484777781	14	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/crbr0l/_/ex8liyd/	771491973	32484424370.0	2019-08-17 17:46:04	37642367.0	disguisedasrobinhood	1	False	645	0	False	True	59.43

Or look at all of the gender stuff going, the pushes for gender-neutral words. Those are cultural changes, that say a lot about how society is progressing. 

And you're still also contradicting yourself - you're admitting, again, that even fashion has evolved. Now into individualistic fashion instead of ideological ... but that also says something about how our culture evolves.

&gt;  I don't like it when people act like ""white people"" as a whole act a certain way and that if I am white- then I probably have that problem. 

But ALL white people have that problem, because all white people could be racist against non-white people.  

What I suspect (and I think this ties to your joke thing too) is that you see discussions like this about YOU AS A PERSON and not about you existing in a social, cultural, and historical context.  I saw a quote earlier today, let me paste it below:

&gt; For white people, their identities rest on the idea of racism as about good or bad people, about moral or immoral singular acts, and if we’re good, moral people we can’t be racist – we don’t engage in those acts. This is one of the most effective adaptations of racism over time—that we can think of racism as only something that individuals either are or are not “doing.”  In large part, white fragility—the defensiveness, the fear of conflict—is rooted in this good/bad binary. If you call someone out, they think to themselves, “What you just said was that I am a bad person, and that is intolerable to me.” It’s a deep challenge to the core of our identity as good, moral people.

The point is, you think the point of talking about racism is knowing who the racists are, so you instantly make it about you: ""I'm not racist!!!""  But to the people you're talking to, the point is making it so there's an egalitarian society.

Are they though? The park presumably isn't such a hot spot of danger during the daytime that you need to warn women to watch their backs, right? So the insurmountable challenge to keeping the park safe is a handful of hours and a few lumen of light!

People aren't warned against ""random acts of violence"", if they were truly random then they could happen anywhere and at any time. You would be in just as much danger in your own bathroom as walking through the park at night. Instead if the warning is about the park it is because there is a notably non-random concentration of violence that tends to happen there.

&gt;  I suppose I thought the naive part was that she wouldn’t have had to have warned her daughter about these attacks.

I don't think that Person A ever thought that she didn't need to warn her daughter, she was complaining that it wasn't a problem to be addressed in her time growing up. A serious risk of attack in a notable part of the city and things like better lighting and increased police patrols hadn't been tried already? Is it really naive to think that a decade or two is enough time for that to happen?

&gt; I agree that more can be done to make women feel safer on the streets but I am unconvinced that protesting would be the solution vs say better lighting

653	"&gt;Have you ever had a mental illness? Do you know what it feels like? It is called an illness for a reason. 

Yes I have been diagnosed as many things.  I am not dismissing the SYMPTOMS in and of themselves, I am stating that the labels, which are used to describe a set of symptoms that occur together can be harmful.  For example, your description of depression is not the same experience that everyone diagnosed as depression has.  The DSM tries to lump everyone into this category the best it can, but it does a lousy job.  Maybe even you'd agree with that much.

I know that people with mental illnesses are a threat to themselves, but I was addressing the poster's counter argument which was ""A mental illness is an abnormality that affects a person's function.""  My point was the word ""abnormality"" is defined by the mental illness (and society for that matter) itself.  It's a circular argument.  ""People with mental illnesses have abnormalities"" is a meaningless statement.

Your abstract doesn't show any causal relationship... I promise you I'm not trolling and would admit if I was convinced of the causal link.  I am not even as hard headed as I make it seem, I've just looked at both sides of the argument and find holes in each.  I've done research for years trying to find a clear cut experimental study which shows that direct causal relationship.

Honestly... how do we know that the symptoms that make one feel ""depressed"" are not expressed as altered levels of serotonin and dopamine instead of the other way around?  I know that there is A RELATIONSHIP and even correlation between brain chemicals and one's mood, but the oversimplification of depression is CAUSED by a ""chemical imbalance"" is irresponsible for anyone to say.  If that were the case, wouldn't medications be a cure all?

&gt;My learning disabilities does not only affect my education. The reason why I got diagnosed was because I nearly crashed from lack of attention. It affects my driving deeply and I cannot safely drive (whether another person is on the road or not) without medication. My processing disability causes numerous of other things. I am more clumsy. My body does not learn as easily when it comes to physical labor as others. I need to use a certain training method for my personal needs. You honestly have no clue how learning disabilities work if you think they only affect school work.

I was using the example of school to point out that context plays a huge role in how we diagnose and these labels are thrown around.  Please try to see the point of what I'm saying before trying to dismantle it.  I understand you have learning disabilities, but that is such a blanket term.  You experience certain difficulties and my recommendation to the mental health field would be to approach those difficulties individually instead of trying to lump them under a label.  

 &gt;Please tell me, if the chemicals do not cause delusions and hallucinations, how do delusions and hallucinations actually happen? Do they magically happen?

I think ""I don't know"" is an appropriate response.  Science only pretends to understand.  They don't know the first thing about the mind and what consciousness is, yet they want to deem certain subjective experiences as ""abnormal"" and others as ""normal"".  By your definition the mental illnesses are only illnesses if they impair functioning.  So if a person hears voices but functions fine, are they schizophrenic?  Do they need treatment?  What if they hear music?  

&gt; If a person's behavior is out of their control, it is out of their control. 

It's not that black and white.  People don't lose all control of their mental faculties.  There is still active decisions they make that are under their control.

You don't have to sign in on another website, you still sign in on youtube, or if you have chrome you're automatically signed in the whole time. 


&gt;Secondly, the comments system is now broken to the extent that many high profile youtubers are disabling comments on their videos.

Just because people are disabling their comments doesn't make them innately bad. 

&gt;Allowing the posting of links was a serious mistake

How is allowing people to post links a mistake?

&gt;as was removing the character limit

I don't view this as too much of a problem, regardless this is a quick fix that people can just let google know about. 

&gt;Also, the comment ranking algorithm seems to now favour the most controversial comments, meaning that the top comments on a particular video are now usually just insults.

This once again can be fixed quite easily by google. But on top of this, I don't go to youtube to see what the top comment is, I go there to watch videos. This really isn't too much of problem.

&gt;As for the real names thing, Google has no way of checking if the name you entered when creating your google+ account was accurate, so people can still post anonymously in practice, thus making the whole exercise a giant waste of time.

I read somewhere that google has a system to filter out BS names, I may be wrong though.

I’m saying there are social benefits to being publicly attractive, both for the attractive person and their partner. This provides a reasonable motivation for flaunting one’s attractiveness in a socially acceptable way.

681	"So there are definitely some reasons to be suspect about the possibility of foul play in the disappearance of flight MH370, but we don't have enough evidence to say that this was absolutely the case. While the aircraft's power was temporarily switched off, this was not necessarily an intentional act, and could have been the result of a mechanical power failure. This scenario seems somewhat supported by the fact that when the plane seemed to regain power, only the navigational system, but not in flight entertainment, tried to reconnect with a satellite. This would happen automatically if there was some kind of mechanical emergency, as the plane would try to prioritize power for critical systems.

Secondly, I would like to challenge that the turn out into the Indian ocean was an intentional attempt to avoid radar. Modern planes use something called a ""fly-by-wire"" system, that prevents them from engaging in maneuvers that could cause an accident. As such, if the pilots were for some reason unable to control the plane (loss of oxygen, failure of the control panel, or even perhaps even hijacking), it could easily have made a gradual westward turn on its own. Furthermore, we cannot conclusively state that, even if the pilots were in control, that this turn was turn was made for nefarious purposes, and not in response to a mechanical problem.

Finally, and in some ways the most importantly, despite intensive investigation, we haven't been able to find any evidence that a crime occurred in the disappearance of flight MH370. Were this a terrorist attack, we would expect that some group would have taken credit for downing the plane, but none did. Furthermore, while the presence of two Iranian nationals with stolen passports was concerning, investigators ultimately concluded that these two individuals were likely asylum seekers, not criminals. In addition, close examination of the crew and other passengers has failed to turn up anything suspicious.

So, on the whole the MH370 incident is weird, and there were initially good reasons to that the crash may have been intentional. However, after years of careful investigation, we have no reason to suspect that foul play was involved. While, in all fairness, we can't fully eliminate this possibility, it is no better supported by the evidence than a possible mechanical failure.

703	"I completely agree with you that ""the wall"" shouldn't be built, but there is actually a legitimate case to be made that a wall is effective enough to warrant deeper explorations into some form of physical border security. 

CNN broadcasted a stat this morning that showed a significant drop in illegal border crossings in prominent areas after fences were extended over the last two decades (I can find it if you really want but it's CNN, a liberal outlet admitting this so I think it's probably fair). What this means is simple - it works. If someone is really that concerned about border security and preventing illegal crossings, a wall is a natural, effective solution. To people whom border security is their number one priority, spending a large sum of money on a wall seals the deal very very well. It doesn't matter how low illegal immigration numbers have gotten to these folks, and they're willing to let the government do whatever it takes to get that number as close to zero as possible. 

EDIT: I really don't get why I'm being downvoted lol. I'm in no way supportive of Trump's wall and I understand the racism and poor geopolitical knowledge behind the wall idea.

Unfortunately, the people don't have a voice at the federal level. The only reason Obamacare passed is because it was a bipartisan compromise and that's why it's so sloppy. Hence why it would be so difficult for your idea to gain any traction in congress. 


&gt; If you're accepting Poles and Greeks instead of Mexicans to do your dirty work, you'd get pretty strong support from the politically incorrect right.


Probably somewhat true. Except dirty work goes to the highest bidder, and Poles and Greeks won't go as low as poor Mexicans. The minimum wage in Mexico is less than $5 USD per day. That's tough to compete with.

Consent

The embryo certainly cannot consent to any medical procedure. While we can sometimes overwrite this issue by having parents give consent, this doesn’t apply to things done for others. For instance, you cannot force a child to donate an organ. Likewise, undergoing a genetic change for society is likely unethical.

Alternatives

If the technology necessary to perform human germline genome editing  at a level safe and effective enough for medicine is ever established, the same tech would be applicable to somatic cell editing. This avoids the issue of consent and other issues raised in the paper I linked.

725	"the absolute best example is the use of the term ""jew"". 

When you describe someone who is jewish as a ""jew"", it can have absolutely no problematic value. a sentence like, ""the guy in the synagogue is a jew"" is perfectly descriptive and not offensive in any way, and therefore is not racist. But the history of oppression against jewish people makes it possible to easily use the same term to describe someone in a racist way. 

This sensitivity exemplified by an example like this is exactly why so many people are confused about using the word ""jew"" even to describe someone who is objectively jewish in religion. You recognize the importance of context and the association that history and power relationships have on language and meaning. The word is exactly the same, but the meaning has gone from being neutrally descriptive to being racist. 

And you can't deny that the context matters. And it is that context that the person you are referring to, who denied the white male from going to the social activist meeting, was referring to (i didn't read the article, I'm just going on your description), and why it was not racist to do it. they were from a community that was historically oppressed, and the white male is from a community that was the historic oppressor.

730	"- So you’ve just started dating someone, and it seems like it’s going really well. They seem really into you: They’re thoughtful and attentive, they’re great in bed, and perhaps most shocking of all, they text you back immediately. But then things start getting a little weird. They’re calling constantly. Their texts are incredibly emotive and emoji-laden. They’re constantly giving you compliments. And they want to meet your parents, even though you’ve only been on a handful of dates.  “Lovebombing” is a term that is used by therapists to refer to someone being overly solicitous or affectionate in the early stages of a relationship. Lovebombing is commonly used by people with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), which is characterized by a constant need for praise and attention and an inability to handle disappointment or criticism in any form. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzv7xx/heres-why-narcissists-tend-to-come-on-too-strong-early-in-relationships

- Roughly 50 percent of marriages end in divorce.  In long-term partnerships that do succeed, romantic love tends to fade into companionship and a love more akin to friendship than to that of a couple in love.

- Neediness is the enemy of long-lasting desire (an important component of romantic love), according to psychologist and Mating in Captivity author Esther Perel. In a popular TED Talk, Perel asks, ""Why does sexual desire tend to fade over time, even in loving relationships?""

Neediness and caretaking in long-term partnerships -- which can easily result from looking to the partnership for safety, security and stability -- damper the erotic spark, Perel explains. But if couples can maintain independence and witness each other participating in individual activities at which they're skilled, they can continue to see their partner in an ever-new light. So if you're looking to keep that spark going, give your partner the space to do what they're good at -- and make sure to take the opportunity to observe them in their element, when they are ""radiant and confident,"" 

- My view is I have been on both sides of the coin.  Some relationships I came on too strong and others I was more cautious while my partner came on too strong.  I think you have to find a balance with where your partner is at.  Maybe they want to take it slow because they were hurt in the past or maybe they can come on too strong which can be a turn off if the other person isnt at their level of intensity.  Love is a two way street and involves 2 people.  You have to find balance and take ques on where the other person is at in the relationship.

735	"&gt; It's not morally wrong, 1/4 of a million people died from drugs last year and the number is rising, we can't just make drugs legal without also fixing the socio-economic reasons as well or we are going to see the number of deaths skyrocket.

In a previous post you say 80% of overdose deaths could have been prevented if people had access to clean, quality drugs from an open market. If you follow this reasoning then it would seem that drug related deaths should actually plummet by making drugs fully legal.

As for deaths caused by driving under the influence. Wouldn't you rather offer people a more convenient means of transportation? For one, I'd rather invest into public transport instead of draining a huge amount of labor from society by forcing people into rehab. Keep in mind that in addition to skilled therapists there's also a ton of opportunity cost lost by people being forced to undergo therapy, I wouldn't be surprised if offering free bus rides for drunk people actually ends up being cheaper overall. But there are also self driving cars right around the corner which would also solve DUI driving (I think the timing for self driving is probably comparable to the time it would take for your reform to be implemented).

737	"See for example the BLM murals painted of Floyd, lionizing him. It doesn't matter who he was really, to them. What matters is the image of the white cop choking a black man. It could have been any black man. That's why he is a symbol, and in their narrative of good versus evil, the cop is evil, the black man under their boot is a saint or martyr. I'm not saying there's necessarily anything wrong with this, its just how martyrdom works for any political group or religion. Although I suppose usually more of the person's character is factored in and its not just motivated by the pure image or act. 

I agree that the cop's escalating tactics (and lack of de-escalating tactics) made an erratic nervous response more likely. But this case is different from Daniel Shaver. He was given contradictory commands that he could not possibly fulfill. Like put his hands behind his back but also crawl forward. Like people have described it, it was a game of deadly Simon Says. Shaver did the best he could be was still shot because the situation officers set up was fucked. Floyd is different, in that the orders they gave him were clear, and he gave all sorts of reasons why he couldn't or wouldn't follow them. I agree that the officers played a part in setting up the situation for him to fail. They should not have been so quick to draw a gun on him. 

But one of my points is that this is not just simple nervousness - Floyd's emotional state (in addition to being influenced by drugs) was definitely influenced by the perception that police were going to shoot him because he's black. My argument is that entering in the situation with this narrative, it turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is not to blame him or the narrative for his death, morally or legally speaking. But to acknowledge the narrative as a causal factor. Think about it. If Floyd did not think police were going to shoot him because he's black, do you think he would have been in that emotional state? How much more likely would you say it would be that he would have just did what the officers said calmly, avoiding his ultimate fate? 

I agree that officers need to be better trained on how to deal with people with the potential erratic behaviors you described. But if you are capable of a calm and collected response then it is reasonable that that generally leads to better outcomes with the police. If someone is behaving unpredictably, that makes your job more difficult and it increases the risk of something bad happening. Ideally, police should be able to handle these stressful situations without doing something wrong or illegal, as I believe Chauvin did. But I am talking about likelihoods here. Cops are not perfect and not behaving erratically to the extent we are able to is a very important factor in preventing things like this from happening. It should be part of the message, but it cannot be, because again BLM treats Floyd like a saint who couldn't have done anything wrong or ill-advised at least. 

What I am trying to get at is the full web or chain of causal factors leading up to the ultimate result. It seems that people in this thread are dead-set on analyzing the situation only from a moral/legal standpoint of responsibility. Which is important, but also limited. I think this is also part of the harm of the BLM narrative, is that because it is like moral crusade, it prevents rational analysis of factors which could actually lead to preventing black men from dying at the hands of cops in the future. Even if your moral crusade is just and righteous, you should not monopolize all discussion and debate, that the only way to view what happened is through your lens. 

In fact, what I am saying is that moral crusade of BLM in itself contributed signficantly, in a causal not moral way, to Floyd's death. There is a straight line you can draw from the all-pervasive narrative of racist cops, to Floyd's perception of what was going to happen to him, to his mental state, to the cops reaction, and to what actually did happen to him. Granted, this is not a proximate cause by any means, and I'm not saying it was a primary one either. I also think that this chain of causal factors definitely intersected with a chain of causal factors on the part of police, who have their own narratives and interpretations about a large muscular black man with a criminal history. But if you are really interested in preventing people from dying at the hands of police then you will be open to looking at all factors."	40	['is factored', 'was given', 'could be was still shot', 'was fucked', 'being influenced', 'was definitely influenced']	6	4	0.1	1	['being influenced by', 'was definitely influenced by']	2	1	0.025	1	['is factored', 'was given', 'could be was still shot', 'was fucked']	4	3	0.075	1	34888668137	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/i6r6nw/_/g0zt8mh/	1099737212	34886512322.0	2020-08-10 11:07:39	13875765.0	DistortionMage	1	False	808	0	False	True	67.89

I wouldn't phrase it in that way, because even though sophisticated adults with a level of nuance can understand that you actually mean, ""why do you think that person is exhibiting those behaviors,"" a child may think that the person they are seeing throw a fit is a terrible person.

So I would approach the situation less (or not really at all) with judgement and more with logic. E.g., ""What do you see that person doing? Is that an acceptable way to behave? What should that person be doing? How would you avoid acting in that way if you were upset/sad/angry/frustrated like that other person? Is that person bad/mean/terrible because they are acting in that way?""

>Second, most gun owners own multiple guns. You can't defend yourself with multiple guns at a time.

No, but you can use different guns in different situations. I might want a 9mm or small-caliber handgun if I am walking through a rough area of the city. If I'm out on a hike in bear country I might take a larger caliber or shotgun instead. Think of it like learning hand-to-hand self defense. One move might work in a certain situation but not be as useful as a different move in another situation.

>Third, defensive gun use in bona fide criminal scenarios are rare. For the vast majority of people, if they're shooting a gun, it's not for self-defense

The only studies on this that I know of are pretty flawed, so I can't say one way or the other. That aside, getting in a major car accident is pretty rare for a given person, but I wouldn't say that means they can't be wearing a seatbelt for safety reasons.

>You can't say you need a gun for self-defense and also say that violent crimes would be at the same level if gun ownership decreased

Why not? 

>If all 3 are part of your reason for opposing particular gun control legislation, and someone makes a valid argument about why this law will be effective and why it won't impact your ability to defend yourself, then your view in the legislation should be changed.

Why? Let's say I have those three reasons for opposing a gun control bill. You make a compelling argument that makes me decide one of them isn't a good reason to oppose the bill. Why do the other two that you didn't address just vanish automatically? If I hold three reasons to oppose a bill and any of them on their own would make me oppose it, removing one but not the others isn't going to make me support it. 

And what about the people supporting the bill? Does the logic follow to them? I would argue most of them have what would be considered justification under your definition for creating and trying to pass it. If politician X says writes a gun control bill to ban semi-automatic rifles because they are scared for their kids safety and they think that they are more dangerous than other firearms, then someone proceeds to convince them that those particular guns aren't more dangerous than some other kinds of firearms, they should immediately stop supporting the bill?"	28	['be concerned', 'should be changed', 'would be considered']	3	3	0.10714285714285714	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be concerned', 'should be changed', 'would be considered']	3	3	0.10714285714285714	1	43964391592	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j8xme/_/k739hns/	2632375094	43961092260.0	2023-10-30 12:11:48	58907102348362.0	Ill-Description3096	1	False	543	6	False	True	68.7

748	"How do you want to define movement?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's try something broad, and you can tell me if you disagree: A movement is a loose association of people who have a goal of some social or political change and are actively trying to bring that goal about. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we want to talk about a movement we can talk about a consensus for what the people are trying to achieve. The problem with ""antiwork"" is that you basically have capitalists who are trying to achieve work reform, communists(and others) who are trying to replace normal work with being productive in local communities, and another set of communists who are looking for a (nearly)fully automated future with no real labor.

&amp;#x200B;

So you read through these posts and discussions and you hear competing communist theories and concepts, some of which are incompatible, and you hear them being mixed with capitalist ideas and concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

A movement doesn't need to be monolithic to be criticized, but there needs to be some consensus to call something a movement as opposed to just being a forum for discussion.  Within this forum you have two ""movements"" one trying to reform the capitalist system, and the other trying to enact some form of socialism/communism. While they may even both call themselves the same movement, it is sort of improper to conflate the two.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be like me saying the ""education reform"" movement and including both people who want to increase public funding as well as those who want school vouchers. They're both education reform, yes, but criticism against school vouchers wouldn't apply to those who simply want increased funding for schools."	5	['being mixed', 'be criticized']	2	1	0.2	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['being mixed', 'be criticized']	2	1	0.2	1	40057120568	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/voytbc/_/iegz41k/	1916386536	40056840294.0	2022-07-01 13:43:50	219407544174.0	1Random_User	2	False	277	0	False	True	51.82

The reason that you and I and the vast majority of people in the world can't understand how gender works without being biological is that we are essentially gender-blind;

Imagine explaining to a color-blind person what color is. What's the difference between orange and green? How do you explain that?

A color-blind person likely can't even begin to understand or imagine what it's like to see colors or have a favorite color. 

We aren't ""cis"" people; i.e people who identify as the ""same"" (which doesn't make sense since gender isn't sex, then how can they be the same? But anyway) gender as our assigned sex;

We have no gender identity at all.

Gender identity is this thing that exists within their internal world; it may truly exist, and maybe some people who aren't trans even have this feeling of a gender identity; we just can't understand or fathom or comprehend it because we don't experience it."	8	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	42503764623	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/138awta/_/jixn6of/	2372126878	42503568436.0	2023-05-05 03:56:11	52939491.0	idevcg	22	True	182	0	False	True	56.79

fails.

761	"For me, the value of a gift comes not from the monetary value of the gift, the utility of the gift, or even whether I like the gift or not. Instead, the value comes from the other person's intentions. For example, they saw something in a store that reminded them of me, and so bought it for me as a gift. Or they knew a special occasion was coming up, and so they spent time thinking about what I like and searching for something they thought that I would appreciated.

Giving cash is a cold, heartless transaction. I don't need to know about the other person's likes or dislikes to give them cash. I don't really have to put any thought into it at all. However, a gift card can still have thought behind it. For example, my grandma knows that I like reading books. However, she doesn't quite understand my taste in books, so rather than picking a specific book, she just gave me a gift card to Barnes and Nobles. She gave one of my cousins a gift card to her favorite clothing store, Rue 21. Due to gaps in generational knowledge, she may not know enough about what is considered trendy for clothes in modern times. However, giving a gift card rather than cash shows that she thought about what my cousin valued and gave a gift based on that.

Moreover, the ultimate mark of a good gift is something the person would like/appreciate, but would not buy themselves. For example, my dad is very cheap, and if you gave him 200 dollars he would most likely not spend it at an expensive restaurant. However, if you gave him a gift card for an expensive restaurant, he would be forced to treat himself to an enjoyable experience. Or, say you had a friend that does not normally do makeup, but she has an exciting date or formal event coming up and you give her a gift card to Sephora. If you want someone to have that experience or item they normally would not spend on, and buy a gift card for them, that still shows that you are thinking about the person. It shows that you care. Giving money, in most cases, does not show that you care, and when it does, it is usually in the context of giving money for a specific end/purpose anyway."	20	['is considered', 'would be forced']	2	2	0.1	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is considered', 'would be forced']	2	2	0.1	1	33541578546	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/eqc7hg/_/fepsfn6/	890766052		2020-01-18 04:41:38	212351410430.0	KoalaTea94	40	False	399	0	False	True	76.56

768	"That is a tricky question! I would say a lot if it comes down to intent and/or the concept of ""implied consent"".

Consent can't be given retroactively because John shouldn't in good faith assume that Jane would want to have sex with him. However, if she has said she is ok with unconscious sex (specifically. not just sex), then John is acting in good faith and doing his best to respect Jane's wishes.

It's the same reason we say that drunk people can't give consent. If you're trying to sleep with someone you met who was already intoxicated, the good faith assumption for you would be to wait until they're sober, because you know they aren't in a state to consent (unless you talked it over both sober beforehand).

That said, this is slightly pedantic- I think while it's ""technically"" rape, if Jane is totally fine with it, she shouldn't feel obligated to press charges or whatever. But it should still be classified as rape because it signifies that John didn't act in good faith, even if he got lucky. (If you prefer to distinguish, you could say legally it's not rape, ethically it is)

To use an analogy, you couldn't walk up to someone and give them a vaccine without consent. That'd still be a violation of their autonomy, even if they'd agree to the vaccine if you had asked.  The important part is that you didn't know ahead of time if they would be ok with it.

A lot of it comes down to the fact that there are a lot of times in real life where implied consent has to be used. Even if you don't consider the sex angle, for say, something like surgery. We accept that if someone consents to the procedure beforehand, the surgeon should finish the entire thing. Or similarly to use the vaccine example, if someone consents to the needle, they don't have a chance to change their mind (Because it's essentially instant).

The tldr version is because as a society, we need preemptive consent for some things. You don't ""need"" retroactive consent, so the default should be assumed that it can't be given. There's just some things that simply cannot be done without the concept of preemptive consent. So the choice is either not do those things, or have some reasonable standard for what a reasonable person would consider ""good faith"".


Overall, i think it's not too different from other cases. For example, the difference between murder and manslaughter often comes down to mens rea (basically, intent)

772	"Here's why you need to neuter your cat:

1. Unaltered cats have a hormonal urge to roam in search of mates. When your tom gets the urge, he will do his damndest to bolt out the front door and into oncoming traffic. At best, your cat will impregnate another cat and create litters and litters of unwanted kittens. At worst, your cat will die because he was hit by a car. At even worse than that, your cat will get hit by a car, and not quite die, but cost you either hundreds of dollars to be put down, or thousands of dollars of surgery.
2. Unaltered toms spray. Your cat hasn't discovered the couch yet, but eventually he will, and his piss will cause an eye-watering stench in your home. It's fucking gross, dude.
3. Unaltered toms also have an increased risk of kidney disease. When cats have kidney problems, they become averse to the litter box, and start peeing all over the house. Sometimes, that urine is also bloody. Oh yeah, and kidney disease can kill your cat.
4. Millions of cats are put down every year. Letting your cat breed freely only contributes dozens of more cats every year to this death pool. Neuter one cat, prevent hundreds of cats from being killed during the course of one lifetime.
5. Neutered toms need fewer calories in their diet. You actually save money on pet food in the long run by neutering him.
6. Cats, as much as I love them, are a disaster for birds. Hawaii used to be a paradise of birds. Then settlers brought rats and cats with them. Now a lot of native bird species are extinct or critically endangered. That's an extreme example, but studies estimate that cats kill billions of birds in the US every year https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-kill-more-one-billion-birds-each-year

782	"&gt; Does this apply to everyone or only minorities? 

Generally appropriation is the taking of a non-dominate cultural element by the dominate culture without attribution or respect. 

&gt;And the point I was making with police brutality was to show an actual issue vs a made up issue to make people seem racist for no real reason

I mean that's just begging the question. Would an example of cultural appropriation be helpful? Here's one I posted earlier today in a different thread:

&gt;I think the social context and results are very important when determining appropriation. For example, when Van Gogh just repainted a bunch of Japanese wood blocks and drew nonsense Kanji on the sides [here](https://www.zazzle.com/van_gogh_flowering_plum_tree_after_hiroshige_wood_wall_decor-256345248764627735) , that to me looks like appropriation. [Here is the original.](https://www.amusemuseum.com/english/ukiyoe/images/ukiyoe_img_02.jpg) 

To me it looks like Van Gogh just copied someone else's work for personal gain without attribution, and to capitalize on the 'foreignness' of Japanese woodblocks at the time.

You start dumping the trash on the street corners, bears are going to eat it and get ENcouraged to stay there. Putting people and the bear at bigger risk.

You may not care if things get hit on the highway but they can cause damage to cars, accidents, and even kill people. Raccoons are fairly small but deer are not, and they can wander just as close to freeways to eat your banana peel as a raccoon- and if you hit one, you can total your car or even die.

Yes, raccoons and bears already wander into towns, which is exactly the reason we *shouldn't* litter there, not a reason we should. This is already a problem, making it a bigger problem is not the answer.

792	"Heya! You've gotten this plus a bunch of other replies that address most of your original post. The only thing that doesn't look like it's been covered extensively is the topic of voter fraud in the primary.

There were several accusations of voter fraud or tampering in the primary, but I'm going to focus on the big one which I think is likely the source of your question in the OP. The genesis of that accusation is derived from the idea that Clinton outperformed her exit polls in some states, and a group called Election Justice USA published a big report about it which alleged fraud on that basis and got a lot of Twitter traction. The reason that these accusations haven't been taken particularly seriously by many news outlets is the following:

1) Election Justice USA is not an organization with any particular gravitas; they did not exist (or at least had no public presence) prior to this primary, and they are neither composed of nor backed by anyone that is a recognized expert in the field. I think their dedication is admirable, and citizen activism for the cause of a fair and accountable electoral process is awesome, but having read the entire report, they seem a little out of their depth. Their evidence for voter fraud relies on more than one logical leap of faith, and the statistics and procedural elements of the argument don't really hold up to scrutiny. That's worth mentioning, because from the public information available on the authors of that report, it does not appear that anyone with a background in statistics, polling, or political science worked on it.

2) To get into specifics, that group's argument is essentially this: Exit polls differed from the election results by greater than the margin of error in several states. Also, it is possible to hack voting machines. Therefore, the exit poll/election result discrepancy must be caused by hacked voting machines. At no point do they even attempt to demonstrate a causative link between the two. 

They also use some suspect statistical methodology. For example, they argue that the exit polls were accurate because they matched the Republican results pretty closely, but somehow managed to exclude Republican primary outliers without doing the same for the Democratic primaries. Furthermore, even if you take the statistical analysis at face value and accept every one of those conclusions as true, the only thing you've determined was that the (single source, uncorroborated) polling data didn't match the official results in some cases. The statistics make no inference as to the cause.

3) Polling organizations, including the one cited in that report, use their own statistical manipulation to attempt to model the elections more accurately. They weight and tune their own data to things like demographics to attempt to control for some inherent randomness in who agrees to take their survey. One possible explanation is that there was a factor in the Democratic primary which the polling firm failed to control for (which is notoriously difficult and this wouldn't even be close to the first time this has happened). An example of this would be unusual enthusiasm for one candidate over the other, leading to an oversampling of that candidate's supporters, who might be more likely to agree to the survey.

Of course, a different explanation is that there was massive voter fraud across 10+ states, affecting multiple primaries across several months, all staffed by non-party-affiliated poll workers and certified by non-party-affiliated state election boards. And that this effort to defraud voters successfully changed the result of a 3.7 million vote margin election, none of the hundreds of people staffing it found any concrete evidence, nobody ever communicated about it in any of the now-public e-mails from the alleged fraudulent parties, and this was all pulled off by an organization with a track record of being bad at basically anything having to do with cybersecurity. I happen to find that exceedingly unlikely, especially given the overwhelming number of simple explanations for exit polls being wrong.

793	"Just a couple points:

&gt; (1) Currently, statutory rape is a crime which requires no scienter, that is, it is a strict liability crime such that one could be found guilty even if one believed that the minor was over age. However, many young people, especially girls who mature faster than boys, physically look like older adults even though they are below the age of consent. Therefore, it seem unjust to punish someone when they did not intend to break any laws.

Can you point me to a state where a man can be prosecuted for sleeping with a girl that he did not know was over the age of consent? If you sleep with a girl who is *obviously* under age and she simply didn't tell you as much then why should you get away with it? If you sleep with a girl who looks like she's 18 and she either told you she is 18, implied she was 18 via her social media profile, or met you at a place she should not have been able to get to without being over 18 you're very unlikely to be prosecuted - assuming you did not otherwise find out she was underage and continue to sleep with her anyways.

&gt; (2) Biologically speaking, a 15 or 16 or 17 yr old girl is sexually mature (barring anomalous health issues). There is no inherent reason why such a person would not be ""mentally"" ready or able to ""consent"" to sex when the entire history of mankind and genetic heritage of the human race indicates that such person is indeed ready for sex.

So why lower the age to 13 or 14 if they aren't sexually mature until 15, 16, or 17? In regards to human history and how it relates to current law, in many states a 13 year-old girl can still be married to a man in his 40's with parental consent. People don't do that, though - because it's not socially acceptable, normal, or desirable.

&gt; (3) Sex is an amazing experience, and is particularly amazing for teenagers who have raging libidos. By denying the ability of young people to partake in this pleasurable experience, we are drastically lowering the overall level of human well being, which is immoral from a utilitarian perspective.

Getting wasted and playing cards with a bunch of friends is also an amazing experience, but we have the drinking age for a reason - to protect young people from themselves. Young people are inexperienced and, as a result, have a tendency to make some pretty bad decisions.

Additionally, we are not denying young people the ability to have sex. In the United States at any rate it's legal in every state (that I know of) to sleep with someone that is within 4 years of your age. That means that an 18 year old can sleep with a 14 year-old, and a 17 year-old could sleep with a 13 year-old. There is nothing stopping anyone from sleeping with people close to their age in their teenage years.

&gt; (4) In addition, for older people, sex with attractive young people is also an awesome experience, and by denying the ability for older people to engage in sex with youthful teenagers who are willing participants, we are drastically lowering the overall level of human well-being.

If you ask a rapist whether or not raping someone is an awesome experience I bet you they'll tell you it is. If you ask a pedophile whether or not oral sex with an 8 year-old is an awesome experience I bet they'll tell you it is. Just because something is awesome for one person doesn't mean it's awesome. This isn't a good justification for anything."	21	['could be found', 'can be prosecuted', 'be prosecuted', 'be married', 'Getting wasted']	5	5	0.23809523809523808	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['could be found', 'can be prosecuted', 'be prosecuted', 'be married', 'Getting wasted']	5	5	0.23809523809523808	1	29757413376	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/75b2er/_/do4sn40/	432177651		2017-10-09 15:52:21		ASK_ME_WHY_IM_EVIL	13	False	624	4	False	True	62.11

795	"I'm going to elaborate a little bit, even if you've awarded the delta. I'm in my 30s and have been called 'a good example of an ally' by various people in the social justice world. I'm a feminist, raised by a feminist, and married a feminist. As far as how to comport oneself as a white man in these spaces, I get it as much as anyone can. 

There is a MAJOR problem in progressive politics right now, and I've seen this change over the past 20 years. It is absolutely consumed with identity, and the *divisions* of identity. It's about being separate and distinct, and not about working together.

There's such a huge, longstanding problem of white men taking over activist spaces and making it about them that we're dealing with an over-correction. Privilege, which we all have in some way, is treated as a sin and you need to repent for your sins daily but can never be rid of them. It's weirdly Catholic. We should just be respectful and work together. Checking your privilege should be about being woke, not guilty.

So as the poster above said, educate yourself. Find some of the great feminist books and read them. Cunt by Inga Muscio was a great eye-opener for me even if it's very early 00s. I dunno your age, but realize that an 18 year old with an angry blog is gonna be way more exaggerated and over the top than necessary. From where I am, it's just kids figuring shit out. 

If you get a perspective of history and understand the theory, the current trends in social justice will feel like trends, and hopefully won't hit so hard personally. 

Edit: I am going to mention ""Shut up and listen"" mentioned later in the thread as one of the most important things anyone can do. Although I wanna work with people, you gotta also show respect and not take up the oxygen. Shutting up and listen is the first, most important step.

But the point of my analogy was to illustrate that by this logic, people should watch cyclists because they want to watch someone ride a motorcycle around a track or down a highway, not to watch a circus. The circus will *always* be more appealing to a general audience who aren't fans of the sport.

820	"thank you for your reply!

i'm not really going to respond to the first half to your comment, since quite honestly i agree with it and have agreed for a long while, since (like you said) conservatives and progressives are both the yin and yang of society. that being said, i'm going to respond to the things you mentioned about trans individuals, since i have a few things to say about that.

i mean no ill will in general, i just take the matter of trans people EXTREMELY seriously, given i have lived through that hell myself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I would call a trans individual by their pronouns, out of respect, but I do not think people should be forced to use their pronouns. (Being consistent, if someone used the wrong pronouns for me despite being cis, I think they have that right.)

they shouldn't be forced under the guise of ""you will be imprisoned"", i wholeheartedly agree with that, but they shouldn't be immune of social consequence either (you probably agree with this though, hopefully)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I will not believe that a trans woman is the same as any other woman and I reserve the right to believe that.

i don't think this is inherently bad, but it does become a toxic line of thinking when you turn it in a way to make trans women somehow inferior to cis women. trans women aren't cis, but they are still women, just with different life experiences and all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Should trans individuals have access to locker rooms of their chosen gender rather than their biological sex?

i think it depends. ignoring how the whole ""gay/lesbian people are predators"" thing went down in the 90's, whoever a trans person passes as should be what bathroom they belong in.

it would be weird for [this person](https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.channel3000.com/content/uploads/2019/12/tori-opener_1572963392921_39590754_ver1-0.jpg) to belong in the women's changing room, and for [this person](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJs-MjScjJqnZsMktuRFI3zKy9XPMihesm6g&amp;usqp=CAU) to belong in the men's changing room.

(of course, there are nonpassing trans people, and in those cases i genuinely have no clue as to what solution there should be, so i'm just going to eliminate them from the argument and speak only on passing trans people)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why is it taboo in our society to talk about people who detransition and their stories?

its not ""taboo"" per se, moreso ""car accident survivor wants to ban cars"".

obviously transition doesn't work for everybody, and i wholeheartedly want detransitioners to share their stories and contribute to the conversation, since they are definitely still people worthy of respect and love, but i don't want genuine trans people to suffer and lose treatment options just because a few cases went terribly.

we shouldn't force treatment on people, but we also shouldn't deny it to people who NEED it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What about the massive spike in transgenderism in the population of teenage girls and particularly within friend groups as described in Abigail Shrier’s book (which many are trying to censor)

it can be due to a multitude of reasons, but i firmly believe it's mostly because of trans people being more accepted and people knowing the term to it.

it would be impossible to find a trans person in the past since, well, you could've gotten imprisoned or killed for it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What about giving puberty blockers to children and teens before they really understand all the consequences?

puberty blockers are designed to be a halt on puberty, which is actually made to give teens and children time to make up their mind and fully decide and learn if they are trans or not.

then, and ONLY then (after 16 or so), when the child has made up their mind, they will be allowed permission to start hormones (and can stop at any time, since the negative effects of hormones on a cisgender child occur WAYY earlier than when irreversible changes even begin to occur)

obviously they are nowhere near perfect, but it would be unwise to have a cancer patient die just because the only treatment is [literal mustard gas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5325736/).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What age does a child have to be before they truly can understand they are transgender and when is it just a kid saying kid things?

we truly don't know, which is why the process of medical transition is so cautionary and airtight.

though, i do believe the whole ""its just a phase"" thing is EQUALLY as damaging (if not more) to forcing kids into transitioning, since you are actually forcing your kid to be cisgender and are forcing them to suppress their possible identity, which can be dangerous since it'll mean they would go into denial and spend 60% of their life completely miserable but not knowing why.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Unfortunately when this issue is discussed most people brush conservatives off as bigots and say they have no respect for any transgender people.

mainly because, to an extent, it's true.

there are definitely some people out there who are just super cautionary and aren't bigots, but there are also people out there who want to hide their ""trans people are disgusting and shouldn't transition since it makes me uncomfortable"" beliefs underneath the guise of being super cautionary.

it's something people take extremely seriously because of the 41% suicide rate (which people do mock and make fun of) being aggravated due to people not respecting the identity of others enough. denying someone the ability to transition, regardless of age, could very well cost you someone's life, because after all, why live when you aren't even going to be your true gender in the first place?"	15	"['should be forced', 'be forced', 'will be imprisoned', ""could've gotten imprisoned"", 'are designed', 'is actually made', 'will be allowed', 'is discussed', 'being aggravated']"	9	5	0.3333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['should be forced', 'be forced', 'will be imprisoned', ""could've gotten imprisoned"", 'are designed', 'is actually made', 'will be allowed', 'is discussed', 'being aggravated']"	9	5	0.3333333333333333	1	35722159052	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/k7inzw/_/ges1ubw/	1221951740	35722005401.0	2020-12-06 02:29:03		[deleted]	3	False	926	8	True	True	50.6
821	"It's honestly less about some politician getting down someone's throat about the issues being discussed or even the quality of teacher.  It's more about Billy coming home from school with a newly acquired pro-choice perspective which pisses off his parents who believe he has been indoctrinated in some liberal public school agenda.  Or, Sally comes home believing that we need to complete racial profiling much to the outrage of her liberal parents who think she has been sucked into her old white teacher's conservative thoughts.  I understand the intellectual case of wanting little Billy and Sally to have the freedom to learn both sides of an issue and make an informed decision of their own, but far too many parents are only interested in such freedom to the extent that Billy and Sally still come out on the other side agreeing with them.  Rather than making school a constant battlefield between parents who aren't keen on their child being pushed one way or another, the school makes the call to distill the mechanics and purpose of government out of the underlying beliefs that inform what is done by government.

822	"&gt;It shouldn’t take so much interpretation and careful study.

There's a reason it's hard to get a law degree. Like I said, a plain reading of the law isn't going to give you a full understanding, especially something as complex as Constitutional law.

&gt;If the argument is that 14 applies 1 to the states, then that argument needs to point specifically to what part of the 14th amendment does this.

It does, particularly Section 1 of the 14th Amendments.

&gt;If it takes significant concerted effort to understand and justify, it’s probably not an intended effect.

First, this is why people study law, again. Law isn't a layman's practice. Second, some of the writers of the 14th amendment DID intend for incorporation. In fact, the main author of the 14th amendment DID want the 14th Amendment incorporated.

https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&amp;doc=43

&gt;I still don’t see how 14 can be construed to apply a restriction that is explicitly stated to be against the United States Congress, to the states.

For a 10-second answer, ""The 14th amendment says no State shall deprive a person of liberty, and many of the rights in the Bill of Rights are so fundamental to our country and our ideals that removal or restriction of them would be denying liberty of those citizens"".

I don't think you're dumb or wrong.

If they meet the criteria, they don't have to be full-on Nazi level to be on the list. Again, you can disagree with the SPLC criteria to define a hate group, but given the plain language the SPLC is right to classify them that way.	7	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	30609462757	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8y3ipf/_/e2830md/	541000563	30609452650.0	2018-07-11 20:36:00	32192419956.0	mysundayscheming	9	False	130	0	False	False	69.52

That's a problem, because there are a million ways to be a good person, and no human can possibly do them all. Besides, goal-oriented character is a huge trap. Every time you fail, you'll feel like a hopeless mess, and you'll just be more demoralized.

You know how you be a good person? You just *do it.* If you see an old lady who needs help loading groceries in her car, ask if she wants your help. If you see someone drop their wallet on the sidewalk, give it back to them. If your neighbor needs someone to babysit their kids or watch their pets while they're on vacation, ask if you can help. But don't do things because they makes you good. Do they because they are good.

But if you want criteria, keep them broad. Show up every day, do your best, and try to be a little smarter and wiser and stronger and kinder than you were before.

Argument:

The child isn't actually able to make that choice yet. It can barely even think. It has not chosen to continue living, its parents have made that decision for it which as you said is outside of the parents' jurisdiction.

 Should the absence of a choice be considered an affirmative by default? If so, why isn't this the case for rape victims? If a person is passed out drunk, and is unable to make the choice to have sex or not. Should the rapist automatically assume the affirmative even though the victim is unable to make that decision?

&gt;It is no longer within the jurisdiction of the parents to make decision about that heaping mass of cells life anymore.

If this is true, why is it ok for a parent to choose which school the child goes to or which doctor they visit? Shouldn't the heap of cells have a right to make decisions about its own life when it is able to do so?

841	"&gt;Consolidation

Aren't those loans hard to come by other than for student loans?  And they require a good credit rating, which the person may not have.

&gt;What goal would a person have which the Snowball method actually achieves better than some combination of Avalanche and/or consolidation? I can't think of any.

Remaining motivated to actually pay extra towards debt instead of whatever else.

Someone planning for a decline in income might prefer this method, too.  Maybe a married couple moving down to one income so one spouse can stay home with the kids.  Or a person who has sporadic income (contractors, consultants, web designers, etc.).  Or a person looking to lower their monthly expenses so they can switch to a lower paying job that they like better.

&gt;If the goal is to pay off their debt quickly, then by definition, they will want to spend as much money as possible each month paying down their debt.

I think this is a downside to the avalanche.  Say you tell yourself ""I'm going to spend $500/month paying off debt.""  With the avalanche, assuming you remain motivated, you'll stick with that $500/month.  However with the snowball, you're going to more quickly run into loan payoff amounts of $650 or $585 or whatever, and you'll be motivated to scrape up some extra money to pay it off in full right now.

&gt;It's fiscally irresponsible

There's been a few comments like this.  I think it's extremely harsh.  Whether a person is doing the snowball or the avalanche, they are still paying off their debts sooner than they are being asked to.

However, if God, who creates reality, says something about morality, your various moral beliefs are more like the flat earth example in that they don't correspond to reality, even if you can come up with your own. If this is the case, then morality is not subjective, people who disagree with God are just wrong.

&gt;Hip-Hop isn't a sport where whoever can rhyme the most words wins

I fundamentally disagree with this principle. We're speaking about hip hop specifically, and lyrical competition between rappers is a *massive* part of the culture. 

&gt; It's about being honest with you (really how your narrator) speak, think, and perceive the world.

So as long as you're honest about yourself in your lyrics, you're a skilled lyricist?

&gt;in Apologies, I think Cole is trying to get at a certain amount of self-criticism. He starts off by criticizing people who want a picture with the president, but then realizes that he's not in a position to say that because he'll never even get a chance to see the president, and he recognizes that he does this often.  

I absolutely agree, but he could convey this in a more skillful way lyrically. 

&gt;In the lines you quoted, he nods at Jay Z and Kanye (sat on the throne), Public Enemy (My uzi weighed a ton), and Dr. Dre (my nigga need medicine).

I had no idea about the mentions to other rappers in that line, thank you for bringing it to my attention! That is the type of hidden meanings and lyrical complexity that makes a great lyricist. He was able to create hidden meanings while maintaining a logical flow.

""seen"" in this scenario is the reference to the fact that it was an observable fact that the debate in 1902 occurred, not a reference to a youtube video. I apologize if English isn't your first language, but it is pretty common to use the word ""seen"" in this sense.

&#x200B;

For those who don't want to read the thread, here is the tl;dr:  
Anti-vaxxers in 1902 thought the smallpox vax caused cancer. They used a gish gallop and distorted facts to win the debate. Turned the anti-vaxxer into a celebrity. He went on to get mandatory smallpox vaccine rules removed. A decade later, the state where this happened  had a smallpox outbreak that killed nearly 500 kids(and harmed thousands more). The claims from the debate by the anti-vaxxer were almost entirely objectively false, but that doesn't matter in a debate. What matters is how you present.

Because anyone who does research on this knows it.  I think I originally phrased it more harshly than I mean... What I'm saying is, Jussim has a result that's true, and he's motivated to phrase it as very important and very counterintuitive (because these things are rewarded by journal editors).  I don't mean that he's being outright deceptive, just that there's misleading things about focusing exclusively on the direction of the differences.

Another thing about Jussim's view of stereotypes is that it's inherently relativistic.  That is, they only make sense comparing one group to another.  But I don't see any reason to believe this is how stereotypes work in the real world.  People don't think ""Social scientists are more likely to be liberal than police officers,"" they think ""Social scientists are a bunch of liberals.""  

Anyway, two citations I'm familiar with:

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10463280240000037

http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550616671998

Both are kind of statsy, but I thiiiiink the basic gist of each is clear.  The first one goes over the basic size/distribution thing I was talking about.  The second one does a really cool thing where it isolates the CONTENT of inaccurate stereotypes... showing not just THAT people exaggerate, but WHAT people exaggerate about different groups.

857	"In general you are looking at an implied premise with many of these videos i.e. there isn't really cause for an altercation for any legitimate reason so it often is presumed to be racist. 

Below are several examples that many find there isn't a reasonable justification, or why, an individual confronted others, or called the police, outside of racism. 

If by appearance alone people are saying, or implying, other people do not belong in an affluent area, upper end hotel/community, the implication is usually that the person is making that determination based on race. 

Every situation is obviously different however, a common trend in many of these videos is that there is a lack of justification for the confrontation. When there isn't a logical reasoning behind the confrontation, especially when the entire premise is related to the affluent nature of the area. 

I don't think the 2 examples you provided fall into this category as the people confronting individuals seem to have some significant issues with mental health. 

That isn't the case for most of the videos that I have seen of this nature. Many of them follow more closely to the following links of someone ""not belonging"" in an area. Most people aren't dumb enough to overtly state that they don't belong there because of ""random racist belief"" so they default to 'never seen them', 'suspicious', etc. Without any valid argument of them not belonging, I think the impression is typically tied to a racist belief. (In many of these videos I don't think it's a stretch)

861	"then i thank you for your consistency. 

one question, however, based on your answer. stipulate we are assuming people are making a good faith argument, that is, we believe vegans value animal life (not hate meat eaters), and we believe pro-life people value life at conception (not hate women). 

both of the arguments are *moral* arguments. 

* ""animal life is sacred; that is, it enjoys the privileges that human life enjoys, other life, specifically plants, do not enjoy."" 
* ""human life at conception is sacred, that is, it enjoys privileges that other human life enjoys.""

these are philosophical arguments, not scientific ones. what can science teach us about the relative *value* of animal biology vs. plant biology? even perfect science could only speak to us about mechanisms that differentiate biology based on types. it can't make a value judgement. the same is true for life in utero. 

further, these claims will be productive insomuch as the participants share some common ethical foundation. the reason is that, even in the absence of evidence, we might agree on ""truth"". however, if we don't share a common ethics, we won't even agree on what truth is. you could make a perfectly compelling utilitarian argument but that will do nothing to move a deontologist. 

and lastly, even if science could perfectly assess the differences, you would have a taxonomical problem. at what point is a biological entity a plant vs. an animal? the existing taxonomies are of no real use to us b/c these are meant to generally speak to differences... here, this forces us to have a value taxonomy. what exactly are the biological traits that de-value an organism, that is, allow for eating? 

* is it photosynthesis? well... the spotted salamander photosynthesizes; can i eat it?
* sea slugs eat photosynthesizing algae that continue to do this in its gut, and it reaps the benefits. can i eat those? 
* then, there are plants that don't photosynthesize... can i not eat those? 
* can i eat all non-animals? what about animals that blur some of the boundaries? for example, can i eat sea anemones? 
* are all animals off limits? insects? if so, why? what scientific evidence answers the ""why"" question?

i think we'd find the more science presents evidence to us, the more we'd find these plant vs. animal (and we haven't even discussed fungi) are blurry at the boundaries. this makes answering the moral question harder, b/c that is seeking a truth.

It's not like say with legalizing weed where the weed then goes to the manufacturers and away from the drug dealers so it's not like going out and buying legal weed would be right next to the cocaine dealer. Loli is still being made by the public. Same with child pornography.

Because while not all pedos like real child pornography, most of them would probably be fine with settling for the legal loli *until* they could get their hands on real child porn.

1- day trading is often no more profitable than a casino sure. But it’s also not as profitable as long term investment in a company or index that is tied to several companies. That’s just banking on progress 

2- a good company knows that putting the consumer first *is* putting the shareholders first. Consumers provide the profit. There aren’t many ways, especially long term, to appease shareholders without pleasing consumers. 

3- not really. After the IPO the business isn’t really making money on shareholders unless they decide to sell more stock (which they only do if they’re either desperate or booming, which is easy to discern). Businesses have to make they own money to keep operating. Stock sales are basically seed money. 

If a stock tanks because the company sucks then people will lose their job because the company sucks, not because the stock tanked. If a stock tanks for some reason and the company is very well run and they are confident in their future they can buy back their own stock, wait for prices to rise, and then resell it for an additional profit. Stocks aren’t real put directly tied to people working at the company.

I think the stereotype of bible thumping conservatives is more acceptable to attack and thus makes people less likely to view the South and southerners with the same regard as the rest of the country. 

The Pacific Northwest definitely has the hipster stereotype and they also have the somewhat notable Cascadia secessionist movement. Some feel that their region is culturally different enough from the US that they want to leave. As a Southerner who knows what happened in the Civil War, I find the idea of secession from the US ridiculous probably as the vast majority of Americans do, but I feel like people may react to the Cascadia movement differently (more positively) than they would to renewed Southern secession attempts. 

So I guess two questions I have would be: Do you view PNW secession as being treasonous like Southern Secession was?

If you delineate political views via a spectrum of left-right, then you get two parties. One party where a majority of your views align left, and another party where a majority of your views align right. Roughly speaking, if half of your views align left and the other half align right, then you're centrally aligned. That's centrism.

879	"This isn't how any of this works.

&gt;Insurance premiums usually demand a small amount of money monthly that you probably could have saved up by yourself anyway. But you might be thinking about people who can't afford minimum wage and think ""What about these guys?"". They can't pay for their insurance premiums. They're already living paycheck to paycheck and can't save up money either way.

These premiums are payments associated with the risk factor of the insurance you bought. If you're likely cash out your insurance(eg, you're a bad driver) you'll pay more in premiums because you will cost the insurance company more.

Think of it as gambling(because that's what it is). If you have a 1:100 chance of having a house fire, your insurance will be lower than someone with a 1:10 chance of having a house fire. 

You don't *need* to buy insurance in most cases(thus saving on the premium), but this means if you end up with rotten luck you'll be paying out the wazoo.

&gt;This is where the free market comes into play. For example, if almost no one can pay repairs for their car if they get into an accident, corporations would be forced to sell cars and car parts at a lower price. Everything would be much more affordable for the average person. 

This isn't even remotely how this works. First of all, insurance claims makes up a tiny minority of new car purchases. Second, cars have a cost to produce- if it costs $9K to produce a $30k vehicle, the price will *never* fall below $9k unless the manufacture changes their process. 

&gt;The government would indeed step up big time and give out a lot of money in the short term. However, in the long term, the government would end up paying only for people who are chronically and terminally ill. The rest of the population can afford more stuff, so the government can limit its spending on the poor without many consequences.

Why is the government paying for basic insurance? If I don't get renters insurance and I accidentally cause damage to my landlord's apartment, why are taxpayers footing the bill?"	20	['would be forced']	1	1	0.05	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['would be forced']	1	1	0.05	1	29553225296	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6ppt8h/_/dkr86kw/	405991745		2017-07-26 15:11:03		MrGraeme	7	False	359	3	False	True	71.04

We have laws against peeping into windows, but not against looking in while passing innocently. This seems to me to be a similar situation. 

We can legislate against all activity on private land (without the owner's explicit permission), or we can legislate merely against malicious activity on private land. Which law maximizes the rights of all concerned parties is the really interesting question we're debating. 

But I'm inclined to argue in favour of the law that trusts people to not damage the land they're passing through and not stare at me when I dance in my underwear.

885	"&gt;I'm just skeptical of the scale and speed at which this can be done to the point where it actually unburdens other neighborhoods. Like, it's not worth it for developers to fight tooth and nail to buy and demolish every San Francisco mansion they can get their hands on to build apartments that will take decades to hit a profit at affordable prices.

It's the fighting tooth and nail part I'd like to be rid of and is what I'm talking about.  Even in relatively high income areas you end up with unlivable teardowns that would be better of turned into multi-family homes. You don't necessarily have to blow up otherwise useable housing.

As far as time scales I don't know.  Gentrification takes what, like a decade or so?  Seems comparable.

&gt;I mean that there aren't that many places where zoning restrictions are the only thing keeping developers from building more housing. Regardless of the zoning, if you want more housing, and more multi-unit housing, then you need to buy enough property to make that happen.

If you live in DC that is the reason haha.  If you make it illegal to build tall buildings then you're going to have a hard time with housing.  They're being built... in places like Fairfax. I'm getting a little pissed thinking about it now.  I had to spend an hour and a half getting into the city because they don't want some tall buildings?

&gt;I'm more thinking of examples like Detroit

I don't think most cities are like Detroit.  Either way, I think limiting discussion to cities that aren't as distressed as Detroit is reasonable. We can't cover all possible scenarios.

&gt;The land costs for a wealthier neighborhood in San Francisco ends up sometimes making it not worth it for developers because the target clientele won't be able to afford those apartments even if they're built. Knocking down an old Manhattan mid-rise in an in-demand and well-off neighborhood to build a new high rise isn't going to make the prices go down enough to stop gentrification elsewhere in the city

I think making gentrification less bad is still something to consider.  It also diffuses price pressure which is a major concern with gentrification.

It's also worth noting that old buildings can be expensive on their own. The place my condo in was built in 1910 and they had to pay $6000 last year just making repairs to the foundation. Housing isn't supposed to last forever.

&gt;I might have just misinterpreted your point slightly, but I'm talking about the concentric ring issue. Regardless, unless we're allowing for complete stagnation of housing markets, the movement of people within cities and metros is inevitable.

I know where I live this makes affordable housing really challenging as the neighboring counties hate us. They've even limited public transit to stop cityfolk from getting around.

I agree. I'm proposing we think about making places in general less expensive instead of just concentrating on poor or blighted areas. Ie., making it easier for people to move into essentially white neighborhoods instead of just the reverse."	27	"['can be done', 'be rid', ""'re being built"", ""'re built"", 'was built', ""isn't supposed""]"	6	6	0.2222222222222222	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['can be done', 'be rid', ""'re being built"", ""'re built"", 'was built', ""isn't supposed""]"	6	6	0.2222222222222222	1	36662890073	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mpr8ny/_/guc4z15/	1373517214	36662794453.0	2021-04-13 01:20:27	643873291035.0	Fit-Order-9468	1	False	515	5	False	True	62.48

890	"&gt;This is exactly what I mean. I believe they start with that for a reason in class because it does tend to hold true.

It objectively does not hold true. [Under Econ 101/102 theory, profit is impossible](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031815/why-are-there-no-profits-perfectly-competitive-market.asp). They teach you Econ 101/102 first because you have to start somewhere. Econ 101/102 purposefully makes false assumptions and excludes hundreds of other factors that affect the real world because college freshmen need to learn the basics of the market before they can learn about many, many factors that affect it. The most significant of which is the fact that the real economy is no where near the level of perfect competition that 101/102 requires, and it never will. I thought I knew everything after aceing Econ 101 &amp; 102. I was sorely mistaken.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For example Elon Musk personally investing Billions in his companies to keep them going. He wouldn't be willing to risk losing that much without extremely high returns if works out.

In many respects, he likely made these investments *because* of high personal tax rates. If he had put his payout from the PayPal acquisition into his bank account and spent it, he'd have to pay a really high personal tax rate on it. By funneling it into investments that he expected a higher return on, he was able to pay less in taxes than he would if he kept it as personal income. In this way, a high marginal income tax rate on huge amounts of wealth actually encourages more investment, not discourages it.

Elon Musk is also definitely not an average economic actor. I wouldn't set macroeconomic rules based on these select outliers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My understanding is you would still lose money.

This understanding is not correct.

I think we're talking about two different types of risks/investments. I'll break them both down:

1. Building an Oil Rig - You write off the cost of building new private infrastructure up front. If Shell has $1,000 of revenue, and they want to build a $800 Oil Rig, their tax bill for the year would be $200, because we only tax profit, and building that oil rig is a cost. Sure, the oil rig could turn out to be a dud. But you're still gonna build it, because you don't have to pay taxes on the money you spent to build the oil rig
2. Principle loss on an investment - This doesn't apply to most companies, because most companies aren't trading securities from other companies. But, for like a bank, yes, any principle loss is written off of their taxable income. If they invested in a stock that cost $1000 in year 1 and it falls to $800 in year 2, they can subtract $200 from their taxable revenue. It counts as a cost, like the oil rig does.

This is how companies like Amazon make HUGE revenues, but pay $0 in taxes. Because they pour all their profit back into building more warehouses, hiring more truckers, etc. Amazon has its problems, but its one of the few corporations who is conducting bussiness as capitalism intended, and that's why they are SO successful in retail. Most are bleeding waste, in the from of profit.

&gt;I'm actually from the UK btw and you are right we have higher tax rates here but our encomy still functions and I do feel sense of security with having the NHS. There is no super high tax for the elite like you are proposing though.

I love the NHS, and I wish we had it. Honestly, I'm debating you from more of an American's perspective. Still, for all the reasons I've mentioned above, I believe our economic policies should generally be redistributive, regardless of what country you're in. That's why the UK still lags behind countries like Denmark and Sweden in those aforementioned metrics of wellness, but exceeds the US.

You being in the UK is great though, [**because you have a great case study in how even proposing to lower taxes can actually send an economy into a tailspin**](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/uk-pm-liz-truss-trickle-down-economics-is-dead-after-u-turns.html). Rip Truss.

Overall, UK's taxes are higher than the US's- [33.5% of total GDP in the UK](https://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-united-kingdom.pdf), compared to that 24% rate in the States, and you guys are objectively better off for it.

So, from the first set of links, imo Soichi's composition is way more fitting than Koji's for 2 main reasons.

1) Koji always has that crotchet (4 beats to the bar, 4 to the floor) rhythm going on underneath whereas Soichi uses lots of syncopated rhythms (Offbeat), having a steady beat just gives it a popish sound which completely doesn't work for a boss fight imo, the use of syncopation makes it much more exciting.

2) The only reason you could tell Koji's was a boss theme would be due to the melody, the on the beat rhythm implies pop song and the synth strings always ascends which implies adventure, not a boss fight.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree with saying the Space T.V Fortress is lazy for that, why use anything else if that works fine?

But I completely agree with you on the second round of clips, Koji definitely blows Koichi out the water there.

How is it even provable without going into someone else’s mind? Maybe I’m just unaware, but it doesn’t seem the necessary technology exists to definitively prove what someone else is experiencing. I guess in my non-medical opinion much of psychiatry/psychology is about treating the negative behaviors and feeling of the mental ill individual.

900	"&gt; Of note, this shows the drastic spike in births that are occurring outside of marriage since the 1960s.  This correlates to a drop in levels of church attendance.  

Yes, also in the same time the number of sea-fairing pirates has also dropped, and so has the number of mammals living in the wild. Maybe one of those is responsible? Maybe it's down to the singing of sea-shanties? During the same time period the teen pregnancy rate, and the murder and violent crime rate have dropped precipitously. Maybe that's down to not going to church so maybe we *shouldn't* go?

Correlation does not imply causation.

&gt; But the impacts of this distance from religious perspectives on sex and marriage is damaging to society.

How? You can't just assert this to be true and that makes it true. A hell of a lot of stuff is a lot better since the 1960s.

Besides, so what if the childbirth outside of marriage rate has increased? Why is that a bad thing exactly? Society has shifted so that instead of being a social pariah if you got pregnant outside of marriage, nobody really cares anymore and that *doesn't matter* except to religious people who think marriage is actually important.

&gt;  the LGBT community doesn't really have ""community centers"" like the Church

???? are you serious? The LGBT community is incredibly self-supporting. As much as the church people would like to ban them, LGBT community stuff is very very strong. You can go pretty much anywhere in the world and find a community who will accept you. 

Unlike in the Church however, the tenants of the LGBT community is that we will accept you for who you are, just treat people around you nicely.

905	"I somewhat agree, with some caveats.

In terms of ""smoking"" whatever substances, I completely agree, and I've talked about my opinions on this in detail in some other comments. However, vaping is a safer* and less obnoxious alternative. I would ban all smoking in public or commercial spaces, both indoors and outdoors except in designated, sealed rooms, that vent far away from people. But vaping is fine so long as people keep their distance (even indoors to an extent). Edibles of course suffer none of these concerns.

I would argue there are too many other benefits to legalization to let the issue of smoking get in the way, especially while tobacco remains permitted. Whatever laws control tobacco, I would welcome applying to marijuana as well. I think it's hypocritical of Singapore to permit smoking while classing marijuana how it does, and the death-penalty as a possibility for trafficking is honestly barbaric (as is the death-penalty itself in my opinion). 10 years for possession is also insane. Marijuana users are not murderers. The penalties are way out of whack with the actual consequences of the drug. It's also hypocritical they plan to produce synthetic compounds simply to profit from the demand for the drug, if they have no intention to decriminalize. Eww. (As an aside, it's [clearly possible](http://webehigh.org/singapore-singapore/) to get it, if you want it, and because it's comparatively rare, it's quite easy to get away with using)

906	"I’ll take a somewhat specific angle on this. Speaking on behalf of a friend of mine who is part of the LGBT community, but broadly speaking on behalf of marginalized groups in general. One of the problems with small communities is how strong the will of that community can be influenced upon those within it. If you have a small community that is anti LGBT, black, Asian, etc, they can hold an enormous amount of negative influence on these groups. If there’s only one baker in that town who doesn’t like gay people, you’re straight fucked if you want a wedding cake. If there’s a few other shops, odds are they’ll either hold those same homophobic views, or the rest of the town will then exert their influence and no longer support them if they support you. There’s no workaround to this problem. This can manifest in jobs, schooling, services, etc

Smaller communities are also much less diverse. You get people who hold the same views they create their community and that’s it. You might have the odd traveler through the town, but they’d be an anomaly and treated as an oddity at best, discriminated against and treated poorly at worst. This also effects the flow of information, ideas, and culture. Want Chinese food? Might be shit out of luck. Want authentic Indian? Well this small town might now have the diverse population to support it, or like I’ve said at worse actively fight it

Small towns more easily become insular, discriminatory, or apathetic to views outside of the norm for that community, and can exert greater harm to those who do not fit the mold

I agree with a lot of your points, but I’d like to bring this up as possible negative sides that you might not have thought about, or at least to say for those who do not fit the mold of these smaller communities, they would not be happier.

Many audio books use a royalty model, so a % of each sale goes to producer, % to narrator, % to author, etc. They make more money overall charging more because then the split is larger for them. It's all about total sales.

If they charge less they are leaving money on the table.  

Example:

They charge $10 and sell 500 = $5,000

They charge $4 and sell 1,000 = $4,000

So, in this case they charge more. The price will always be set by how they can make the most money.

917	"Great reply, and my apologies for not getting back sooner. I can't give it all the details I might if I had more time, but let me at least share a few thoughts:

Revelation 20 is apocalyptic literature, so the idea that it is speaking directly as an instruction manual or tour guide of the end of the world is far, far from its meaning, so I don't take the meaning of Revelation 20 to make any implications about what hell will actually be like or who will be there, etc. As GK Chesterton wrote: ""though St John the Evangelist saw many strange monsters in his vision, he saw no creature so wild as one of his own commentators."" Though I will offer that, even if it was the case, that passage asserts a specific few will be tormented ""for ever and ever"", not everyone else that is thrown in after.

For the other verses, I think you are exampling the heart of my point: that there are different perspectives that deeply inform how we read scripture. Your perspective seems to me to be more: God's grace saves us from sin so that we go to heaven when we die. Mine is different: God's grace saves us so that we might live into God's truth instead of the world's truth, that we might prevail against the powers and principalities of the world and live the life abundant that Jesus calls us to. And then, when we die, return to full communion with God.

Take for example your assertion about Matthew 7. You state that this disproves hell will be empty, but I would suggest that passage doesn't address afterlife at all. What part of ""small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it"" says eternal life? Not only is that passage surrounded by other examples about how to interact with people and the world in our daily lives (i.e., the sermon on the mount), but it simply says ""life"". And, as I said in my original post, Jesus talks so much more about life abundant here and now than he does about eternal life. To me, this is an example of a different approach to scripture and faith that, at some level, seeks to impose our balance, our ideas of quid pro quo, on God.

&gt;This is essential, in my mind, to understanding the gospel. How can it be such good news that Jesus died for our sins if they weren't going to be a significant issue to us later? Jesus, who is God, came down and suffered and died in our place because there was no hope for us otherwise.

And this is what I'm trying to address. Your perception is that the reward is only significant ""later"". There is no hope for us otherwise, yes, but the idea that our hope is limited to eternity is still a short-sighted vision, and one that I would argue is contrary to the New Testament.

Take James, for example (maybe not the best one but it comes to mind because I'm teaching from that right now). The entire thesis of James is that there are two realities, and that as Christians we are called to choose one. The first is that of the world: a closed reality with limited resources where a person's value comes from what they have attained socially, financially, in virtue, etc. Then there is God's reality, the truth, which instead invites us to acknowledge that all of us are equal in God's eyes, that God is the true resource of everything good and God gives abundantly and ungrudgingly, that pursuit of those worldly hierarchical standards causes us to fall away from our true selves, and we instead participate in - or, his metaphor: birth - sin which leads to death.

This may be a bit of a roundabout way of coming at it, but maybe it will help as a thought: I recently watched Come Sunday, the story of Rev. Pearson who came to believe that there is no hell and that all people will be in heaven. I am not presenting his interpretations as mine, but as I watched that play out in the movie one of the thoughts I had was this: while I can understand some people being dismayed at the theology that challenges what they've always believed, I wonder why anger was so often the response? And I genuinely wonder if this doesn't get to the heart of all of this: is a theology that is overly focused on heaven and hell about God or is it imposing our need for hierarchy and punishment on our enemies? Is there some sense - as I laid out in my first post - that we feel angry there might be people in heaven that we have decided don't deserve to be? And is that consistent with the character of God revealed in Jesus?

More quickly on your last two points: first, the idea that nature points us to God in way that is sufficiently revelatory on its own has not been an orthodox belief for centuries. I don't know if it started with Aquinas, but he is perhaps best known for his writings on this idea, saying that nature does indeed point us toward God, but it requires more than that for us to know the incredible Christian story.

Second, on the Mark 3 verse which states ""whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin” is interpreted in varying ways, so let me share mine. I interpret that as essentially offering a unique perspective on the belief that God loves us so much that we will never be forced to love God back. It remains a choice. So the only sin that will ""never be forgiven"", the only sin that grace doesn't cover, is the refusal of that grace. So I would suggest ""eternal"" there is not saying: if you do this God will never forgive you and you're fucked, but instead: for as long as you choose to not accept God's grace, God will respect that."	35	['will be tormented', 'is thrown', 'is limited', 'are called', 'being dismayed', 'be forgiven', 'is interpreted', 'be forced', 'be forgiven']	9	7	0.2	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['will be tormented', 'is thrown', 'is limited', 'are called', 'being dismayed', 'be forgiven', 'is interpreted', 'be forced', 'be forgiven']	9	7	0.2	1	30400115223	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8hw86q/_/dyrfz13/	513786482	30395353285.0	2018-05-10 13:23:45		benmrii	1	False	1030	1	False	True	69.45

I would argue about the ""deeply disturbed"" part - disgusted, perhaps. 

And surely, but generally, what is upsetting about it is getting to know the information - if you tell someone that you are doing that, I assure you it is much more upsetting that you have the audacity to say that to their face than it is that you do it.

And again: it is different from voyeurism. If you do not tell anyone about your fantasies, there is absolutely no harm done, since *everything* is in your head. In the invastion of privacy that comes with voyeurism is what makes it wrong if you're not caught, especially when considering that you willingly take the risk of being caught, which defeats the entire comparison between the two.

There is no harm done with fantasizing, there is no sensible way to police it and there is nothing to gain from feeling bad about it, since the lingering fear that *someone* might do it will always prevail.

Neurology. 

""Allies"" parroting that ""gender is a social construct"" has contributed some of the worst damage to society's perception and understanding of trans people.

It's not wrong, gender is socially constructed, that just has absolutely nothing to do with someone's personal sense of gender. Gender identity is not a social construct, it's neurological, a sex trait. 

The full picture is ""gender is socially constructed, **so society should move towards basing it off gender identity**"". Instead it gets portrayed as ""gender identity is based on gender roles"".

937	"&gt; Maybe the word ""period"" is a bit too strong, but my point is that a right to life ought to be inalienable just like any other right. However, bodily autonomy is also an inalienable right, so in the case of rape, where a tacit responsibility does not exist, abortion is fine because the woman is exercising her bodily autonomy.

I don't know what mentioning inalienability is supposed to resolve in this dispute. The question at hand is whether ""never being conceived is preferable to be born and then killed"". Whether the right to life is inalienable does not answer this question.

&gt; I'll grant you they are not independent. Do you want a delta for that? What I meant was that conception and abortion should be treated as two distinct events, and just because conception + abortion does not deprive the fetus of anything does not necessarily entail that abortion alone is justified because the act must be weighed by itself with any competing rights or responsibilities.

I never said that the lack of deprivation necessarily entails that abortion is justified. In fact, I've explicitly stated the opposite. Hence why I said ""Again, my replies at the top here are only addressing your claim that ""never being conceived is preferable to be born and then killed"". This is a _separate_ question from whether abortions are prohibited for other reasons (e.g., consent, responsibility, etc.).""

&gt; We have to draw the line somewhere. One can imagine a similar analogy where shooting someone in the head 1 second before death is murder, but 1 second after death is just being mean to a corpse. That doesn't mean murder is a meaningless concept.

This is not a case of arbitrary line drawing. One is killing and one isn't. The outcome of your actions on the victim are different (although the difference is only a second). But in the case of the blood transfusion, the outcomes of plugging in are identical, i.e. the outcome is that a person is dependent on your body due to your voluntary action.

&gt; Except, once you connect, it is no longer a dead body. It's not that dead bodies have more rights than living persons, it's that living persons derived from dead things have a right to be provided for if you intentionally give them life.

You would be giving dead bodies more rights. Because on your view, dead bodies have a right against being plugged into and disconnected (in the manner so described). But for living persons, there is no such right.

Also, when you say ""living persons derived from dead things have a right to be provided for if you intentionally give them life"" is clearly not something that we apply generally. Let's say that I revive someone that I know will require a blood transfusion in the future. We wouldn't say that they are entitled to my blood _because_ I revived them. More realistically: let's say a couple has voluntary sex knowing that there's a risk that the child will require blood transfusion from one of the parents after birth. We wouldn't say that the child is entitled to a blood transfusion by the parents."	29	['is supposed', 'being conceived', 'should be treated', 'is justified', 'must be weighed', 'is justified', 'being conceived', 'are prohibited', 'be provided', 'being plugged', 'be provided', 'are entitled', 'is entitled']	13	11	0.3793103448275862	1	['must be weighed by']	1	1	0.034482758620689655	1	['is supposed', 'being conceived', 'should be treated', 'is justified', 'must be weighed', 'is justified', 'being conceived', 'are prohibited', 'be provided', 'being plugged', 'be provided', 'are entitled', 'is entitled']	13	11	0.3793103448275862	1	41593343845	12	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1075v32/_/j3vlpid/	2188813214	41591963446.0	2023-01-11 08:55:17	27591097.0	jay520	1	False	530	4	False	True	62.58

I'm still trying to figure out, and this is gonna make me sound like a real piece of shit, but you seem like a reasonable person, *why* people hate being raped. Pregnancy risks are mitigated by technological access, and abortions are fairly accessible in this day and age, so I doubt that's even one of the top reasons for why people react with such vigorous disdain to even the thought of it. Nothing tangible is lost in the process. Beatings and bruises are all incidental, and nobody focuses on them, and even if they did, I've experienced worse injuries in fights, but I wasn't traumatized or anything. So I'd like to know what's it, exactly, that's causing these incredible feelings of horror at bodily autonomy being compromised."	19	['being murdered', 'being stolen', 'are interrupted', 'could be spent', 'being raped', 'are mitigated', 'is lost', 'being compromised']	8	7	0.3684210526315789	1	['are mitigated by']	1	1	0.05263157894736842	1	['being murdered', 'being stolen', 'are interrupted', 'could be spent', 'being raped', 'is lost', 'being compromised']	7	6	0.3157894736842105	1	26674990454	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bccy3/_/c95lmd2/	79518603	26674975226.0	2013-03-31 02:39:59		a_terriblehumanbeing	1	False	316	0	False	True	63.09

943	I have never used Fahrenheit before. For me when i see a negative i think to myself 'There might be ice, is should wrap up accordingly'. When it's a big negative 'It's going to be very cold, maybe i shouldn't bother going out/wrap up very heavily'. 20 degrees is a good day, nice and warm. Far above 20 is too hot and won't be enjoyable. 20's need sunscreen. 10 is mediocre and normal. Summer is 15-20, Winter is +-0 and Autumn i don't really pay much attention, but closer to Summer, and Spring is closer to Winter. For me, that is intuitive. Why? Because i grew up with it. Sure Fahrenheit has more gradations but i find Celsius has more than enough at relevant temperatures anyway. Below 0 is cold, above 0 is fine. I find that a lot more useful than above or below 32 is hot or cold (had to google freezing point in Fahrenheit). I am sure you find Fahrenheit intuitive, that's because you are used to it. Celsius is unarguably better for science and knowing when ice will appear (+- numbers easier to spot than +-32) The rest is subjective, hence making Celsius superior, and better for standardisation, which i think is necessary. 	17	['are used']	1	1	0.058823529411764705	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are used']	1	1	0.058823529411764705	1	29544518503	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6p21l1/_/dkm1kdj/	404882821	29544476499.0	2017-07-23 14:07:46		the_potato_hunter	3	False	207	0	False	False	74.49

948	"**10^10 years**: You're about half as old as the universe and Earth (and the rest of the solar system) is long gone. Has the problem of traveling faster than light ever been solved? Can you zip between stars with your warp drive, or do you just accept that trip will take a while? You've certainly got the time to travel, and if you're going at relativistic speeds it doesn't even seem to take that long to you. By now lots of good books have likely been written, so hopefully you'll have something to keep yourself busy on your voyages between stars. 

**10^11 years**: The galaxies in the Local Group begin to merge together into one giant galaxy. Guess you'll have to come up with yet another galaxy name. 

**10^12 years**: Half-Life 3 is released. It doesn't live up to your expectations. 

**2 x 10^12 years**: Remember how you had to keep coming up with galaxy names? Well, the universe is constantly expanding and all other galaxies have receded beyond the edge of the observable universe. So, since there's only galaxy sitting in the middle of a black emptiness that stretches billions of light years in each direction it seems kind of redundant to bother naming it. When you meet new alien lifeforms and civilizations you try to tell them that the universe used to be full of galaxies just like the one you're in now, but it seems a little farfetched to them. 

**3 x 10^12 years**: You and whatever's left of humanity and the other races you've met clearly have amazing powers to have lasted this long. You may as well get a hobby. Why not find a planet with primitive intelligent life and convince them you're God? Get a few friends together and get followers on different continents, and see whose worshipers dominate the world. Best RTS ever. 

**10^14 years**: Star formation ceases. The stars that currently exist burn out one by one, leaving dimly glowing dwarf stars, fast spinning pulsars, black holes, etc. The night sky (assuming you're even on a planet right now) grows darker with each passing aeon as the stars wink out of existence. You've been around a long time, and you start to feel an emotion you almost forgot the existence of; an existential fear of your ultimate fate. 

**10^15 years**: You're having a hard time finding a welcoming planet. The ones that haven't fallen into their parent stars have been flung into interstellar space, drifting forever in the cold darkness. Perhaps you and what's left of the other intelligent races have undertaken a massive engineering project to keep the light of life burning in a dying universe. You and the others build an artificial star at the centre of a Dyson sphere, a solar system sized construct surrounding your new sun. This is the last bastion of civilization and intelligent life, a flickering candle in the infinite darkness. Memories of everything and everyone that ever was is stored in vast libraries. You and the other immortals try to discover new physics to stave off the inevitable. 

**10^18 years**: You stare into the abyss, wondering if there are other bastions of civilization like yours that exist beyond the edge of the observable universe. 

**10^20 years**: Similar to the fate of the planets, stellar remnants are flung from the galaxy or begin falling into black holes. The One Galaxy grows smaller and denser, increasing the speed of this process. You and the Immortals are mindful of this and carefully plot the trajectory of your home. Perhaps you're somehow finding fuel for it to keep the star at its centre burning, or maybe you have to keep making new ones. As the last galaxy dies, you're concerned that you can't keep this up forever. You continue your study of physics; no new discoveries have been made in aeons, but you keep looking for loop-holes in the laws of nature that might save you. Many others have decided this is futile and have accepted their fate, leaving your collective to drift lifeless among the remains of the stars. You press on. 

**10^40 years**: You know protons, one of the subatomic particles that (along with neutrons and electrons) make up the atoms and molecules of all matter that you interact with? Most of them are gone by now, having decayed away in a slow but inevitable process. All regular matter that's left is a rare resource. If you've somehow, miraculously, against all odds made it to this point, you're most likely alone. Everything is cold, dark, empty, unforgiving. 

**10^100 years**: All that's left in the universe is you (somehow) and black holes. How are you even still alive? The vast majority of your existence, so much so that everything else is barely even worth mentioning, has just been you floating in darkness with nothing but black holes for company. Even they are starting to vanish as they evaporate through Hawking radiation, shrinking in mass and then winking out of existence. 

**Beyond**: There are still some photons, electrons, and other things flying about, but the universe is so vast and empty that they hardly ever interact with each other. It's uncertain what the future holds at this point, but you won't be around to see it. Some of the electrons that were once part of you are still around I suppose, somewhere, but it's impossible at this point that anything that could be considered ""you"" could remain. Perhaps other universes exist or will come into existence, and if there are an infinity of them then some entity very much like you could very will exist in them, but the ""you"" that you are now will be gone, irrecoverably, forever. The light of life in the universe has guttered and been extinguished. 

**tl;dr: Maybe you can beat cancer and AIDS and aging and go live among the stars, but you'll never escape entropy.**

954	"""the critique and denial of metaphysical beliefs in God or spiritual beings""  The idea that atheism is a passive or non-belief is just nonsense.  Atheism is a *rejection*, which is itself a belief.  

[From this link](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#DefiAthe):

&gt; If, however, “atheism” is defined in terms of theism and theism is the proposition that God exists and not the psychological condition of believing that there is a God, then it follows that atheism is not the absence of the psychological condition of believing that God exists (more on this below). The “a-” in “atheism” must be understood as negation instead of absence, as “not” instead of “without”. Therefore, in philosophy at least, atheism should be construed as the proposition that God does not exist (or, more broadly, the proposition that there are no gods).

There *are* (in the paper) some more modern philosophers who are accepting the attitude that atheism isn't a proposition, but they are an exception, and not the rule.  It looks like ""Antony Flew"" originated the new ""psychological state of disbelief"" definition of atheism, but that it has some pretty unresolved flaws as relates to how if atheism is a psychological state, then ""no proposition can count as a form of atheism because a proposition is not a psychological state"".  You can personally believe how you want, but Flew's argument was clearly semantic and flawed.

EDIT: Just to be clear, the *flaw* I'm referring to in Flew's argument is that he's using a definition that very obviously begs the question."	10	['is defined', 'must be understood', 'should be construed']	3	3	0.3	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is defined', 'must be understood', 'should be construed']	3	3	0.3	1	37950215039	5	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/q2ay4e/_/hfmktbz/	1575990590	37950051253.0	2021-10-06 14:21:43	3689894.0	novagenesis	1	False	251	1	True	True	46.0
955	"The main argument I have against you is this:   

Psychotherapy, hypnotism, and just about every cognitive attempt you can think of (including a slurry of drugs) has been used on transgendered people. Those things don't work. Even if you can be technically right in some way, it just doesn't matter. I don't care. If you claim it's a mental illness, that's fine I guess (although hormone levels ARE proven to be different in transgendered people), but that doesn't mean that you have any room to refuse the empirical evidence: the evidence that shows transgender people are able to live properly and healthily after a switch, but not after **any** other treatment.    

See, this is especially insane, because that would make this the FIRST mental illness with a physical cure. Not a treatment- a cure. So if you choose to believe that something which can't be successfully treated the way that mental illnesses are, and can be successfully cured with physical changes, which no mental illness can... Then congratulations on the mental gymnastics?    

Any mental illness with a delusion in no way gets better if you feed the delusion. The mental state you are in will constantly degrade if you feed a delusion. Transgender is a complex problem, but hormone differences and treatment reactions alone are proof that it isn't.    

Oh, or there's this study: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395610001585#sec2.1 . It shows that Female to Male Transsexuals have brain matter (physical and neurological - not a psychological thing) that resembles Males (those sharing their gender identity) much more than it resembles Females (those sharing physical sex).    

Physical brain differences, impossibility to treat with therapy, impossibility to treat with psychoactive drugs, and ability to cure with hormone therapy and sex reassignment is a REALLY insurmountable case to try to argue against with pure speculation and opinion.   

To be a little cheeky:

The statement doesn't really make logical sense otherwise, I think we both agree on that.

Kinda like how the phrase ""black lives matter"" is really ""black lives matter *too*."" The ""all lives matter"" movement is really just a failure to understand that we wouldn't have this movement if the implicit too wasn't there. 

I suppose it's arguable that these people should just say what they mean, but I also think that we should be willing to give the most charitable interpretation of people's words if we want to claim to be empathetic towards others and cognizant of our biases.

This is getting a little far afield of this CMV, since it's based off of a specific conversation with your friend. I really don't know if she meant her words literally and absolutely, or if you were very clear that you were talking only about the actions and very clear that it wasn't about judging them as a person, or if either of you even had the nuance in mind at the time.

I would argue that going forward, if you encounter someone saying that white people shouldn't or can't criticize minorities, the best response isn't to reply, that their statement taken literally makes no sense. I'd actually just clarify similarly to how you did just now. And you may find yourself agreeing with them on many points rather than arguing.

There has been some speculation that the gunfire in the initial raid started after an ATF agent accidentally discharged his firearm and that prompted a response from the davidians. There is also speculation that a team of agents sent to kill dogs on the compound initiated the firing, and the davidians responded to that.

Damore's own words, emphasis mine:

""I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and **abilities** of men and women differ in part due to biological causes"" 

&gt; What effect does this have on the gender distribution at... 90? 100?
In this way, a relatively small general difference may produce a relatively large particular difference.

Except you are picking the wrong end of the scale. It works both ways. Google is hiring the most talented women in the world. But the memo cites sources that study the average population, not the people who are at the most talented end of the scale. It might even turn out that the differences reverse when we get to that end of the scale. The whole point is that the Damore cherry-picked facts and used confirmation bias to attempt to make a point. That's not scientific research. It's just ""sciency"".

&gt; Saying this serves no purpose. Either you defend propositions or you don't.

Nah, I can both point out how his sciency attempt falls flat at the same time as claiming that the science is a minor point when compared to the people skills and human relationship issues he failed even worse at.

&gt; Averages don't inform of individuals.

There goes the entire scientific basis of his memo. I'm glad we are starting to reach agreement on this.

I'm not saying they aren't allowed to be annoyed and express displeasure when people try and tell them they should get married, I'm only saying it is insensitive to compare this to being black or gay in the US, because it is not institutionalized discrimination and is no worse than the flack someone would face for going even slightly against the grain (being an art major, liking a ""nerdy"" subject, being a vegetarian, what have you). There are no laws or educational practices supporting the idea that everyone needs to get married or they will be sad forever.

As far as your first point, I guess what I really want to see is statistics on how many people who claim to be asexual at a young age continue to feel that way their whole lives. I definitely am not claiming that there is no such thing as an asexual, I absolutely know there are people who are genuinely asexual, I just get frustrated when people deny that there could be underlying emotional causes in many cases. I know three people who at a certain point in their lives thought they were asexual. Of the three, one was on depression meds and when he was happier/off drugs he had a higher libido, and the other two had huge hangups about personal appearance which they discovered was keeping them from enjoying sex. One of these people is basically a sex fiend now that they are more confident. So I think mainly because of my experience, I have a hard time believing the teenagers/young adults who seem to be pigeonholing themselves before exploring other options.

But among all this I also recognize how much of a hypocrite I am since obviously I know I'm gay and I was young when I knew it, so who am I to say these people don't.

It is also might be important to note that I am mostly discussing teenagers/young adults who are still physically/emotionally developing.

993	"Thank you for your input.

You summed up my viewpoint correctly, except the utilitarian part. I still am not sure whether the best decision is the one that maximizes the total anmount of well-being, the rest is, however, correct.

to the point with dog in a box: I could as well construct a mechanical device that would monitor its enviroment for electrical current and temperature; and try to move itself according to it. That in my view would be the same as the case with dog. As I said in OP, I see a difference between a mere signal and a complex concept of actual suffering. 

I therefore view it as not necessary to empathize with either the dog or the machine, because it's inability to actually suffer. Furthermore, I think my point with killing still stands.

I totally agree with the statement that consciousness is not binary. There is the problem with drawing the line, and I chose to solve it by creating a grey area between ""definitely conscious"" and ""definitely not conscious"". However, by my current observations I must say that most animals and most mentally handicapped fall into the ""not conscious"" area. An example with the grey area would be Down's syndrome, where I would chose to let an adult person live, because I simply can't be quite sure. 

to the point about abortions: If I chose to oppose abortions because of that, it would than imply that we must give our best efforts to creating new conscious entities. I could use a metaphor here - You have no obligation to give a child a candy, but you have no right to take it once they have it.

Just to add something I forgot in my OP: I think that my view is the extreme absolute. I would not torture a dog nor kill a baby, but I just have no rights to tell others not to. I accept that some people (in my view irrationally) chose to empathize with non-conscious entities, and I often chose to do so as well. The point is, they don't have to.

If my POV is correct, and you still chose to give animals rights, it's OK. But if it is incorrect and you chose not to give animals their rights, you are a monster. That's why I need some more insight. 

I hope I did not miss any important points.

997	"A lot of philosophers would simply say it's nonreducible. Affect refers to an emotional experience, positive refers to the valence. Sorrow is negatively valenced, joy is positively valenced. We like, find appealing, are attracted to, etc. things with a positive valence. The opposite holds for negative. You might say that what I've described is pleasure and not happiness, but the two are obviously linked, and hundreds of people have written thousands of books debating the issue, and it remains unresolved, so it's unlikely for us to resolve it here.

If you want to push the question further and ask what it's like to experience positively valenced emotion, I would respond by saying something like ""what's it like to see the color blue?"". I just take it as presumed that we all more or less know what it's like to do so, even if we are sometimes or even often mistaken, and even if some people can't experience it (e.g. being colorblind or being the equivalent for positively valenced emotion). These errors and difficulties about experiencing the color blue don't lead to me conclude that we can know nothing about the color blue.

This is why I think your argument grounds out in extreme skepticism, since the exact same questions you are raising about our knowledge of happiness can be raised about our knowledge of any mental phenomena; and since all of our knowledge is derived from and dependent on mental phenomena, it would require that we deny the whole of knowledge for us to deny knowledge of happiness for those reasons."	11	['is negatively valenced', 'is positively valenced', 'are attracted', 'are obviously linked', 'can be raised', 'is derived']	6	4	0.36363636363636365	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is negatively valenced', 'is positively valenced', 'are attracted', 'are obviously linked', 'can be raised', 'is derived']	6	4	0.36363636363636365	1	29617264794	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6uia3t/_/dltcrru/	414038441	29617238152.0	2017-08-18 17:23:40		Daotar	1	False	261	0	False	True	57.81

999	"&gt; The killing of the informant Marquez was the motivation behind the shootout at the docks.

Is this independently verified? From what I see in the [script](http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/usualsuspects.html) here's the relevant passage, with my annotations:

    INT. RABIN'S OFFICE - DAY - PRESENT
                                  KUJAN
                Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?

                                 VERBAL
                Wha- No.

                                  KUJAN
                He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
                Department. He swore out a statement to
                Federal Marshals that he had seen and
                could positively identify one Keyser Soze
                and had intimate knowledge of his
                business, including, but not exclusive
                to, drug trafficking and murder.

This is true, Kujan just learned this from another cop who produced a DOJ file on Marquez.

                                 VERBAL
                I never heard of him.

                                  KUJAN
                His own people were selling him to a gang
                of Hungarians. Most likely the same
                Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
                back in Turkey. The money wasn't there
                for dope. The Hungarians were going to
                buy the one guy that could finger Soze
                for them.

...but this is speculation. This is Kujan's working theory about what happened. We see no evidence, before or after this assertion, that corroborates the idea Marquez was getting sold

                                  VERBAL
                I said I never heard of him.


                                  KUJAN
                But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his
                extradition advisor. She knew who he was
                and what he knew.

                                 VERBAL
                I don't

                                  KUJAN
                There were no drugs on that boat. It was
                a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the
                one man that could finger Keyser Soze so
                Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he
                knew he could march into certain death.

... and there's no basis for this idea either. Kujan has been in the police building the whole time only talking to cops and Kint. This is his theory at the moment, informed by Kint's fantastical story about KS.

                                  VERBAL
                But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent
                us to kill someone?


                                  KUJAN
                I'm saying Keaton did.

... and we see it is indeed a working theory. Or maybe it was Keaton? I don't know that was ever decisively ruled out.

&gt; Marquez was found shot twice in the head. During a crazy gunfight, someone took the time to kill the known informant Marquez execution style. This is verified completely independently of Kint's interrogation.

Yes we can independently verify Marquez was shot in the head, but not ""execution style"". From the script:

                                      BAER
                A boy came across a body on the beach
                this morning. Thrown clear when the boat
                burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys
                from the F.B.I. just identified him.

We don't know that ""someone took the time to kill the known informant Marquez"", that's based on Kint's subjective flashback.

&gt; Knowing this directly contradicts several of your main arguments in multiple ways: 1) it gives us some information independent of the unreliable narrative of Kint (that there was indeed an informant who would be sold for $91 million) and 2) it demonstrates that Soze is powerful and cunning enough to execute a hit (either to protect himself or more generally to protect his business interests).

For the above stated reasons I don't think there's a basis to believe the gangsters were selling an informant, nor that Soze killed the informant, nor that it was a hit.

&gt; From there some of it is guesswork, but it's not that hard to figure out. Kint/Soze engineered a lineup to make contact with criminals.

How do you figure?

&gt; During that time, the only people who could have potentially identified Keyser Soze, Marquez and Edie Finneran, were killed.

Wait, how could Edie identify Soze?

Why didnt they get the same actors from dissidia and the movies? Sephiroth's voice actor in english is doing hyundai commercials ! 
  
I guess i wanted commitment, either be full action or full atb. I was hoping for a more FF15 experience and less crisis core. Or alternatively,  a full scale back to ATB. A jump button would have been nice, useless ,but creature comfort.  A PC release would be great too, i own a ps4, but now im stuck wondering if i wait a year to buy a PC version or not. 
Maybe beinh able to get some gear and try comboing myself would have been nice in the demo, configuring materia , is not something you get to try in the demo. And it urks me because recreating something identical isnt hard. Especially since theres a lot of fan content out there that did it already.

Yeah , so commitment, be something specific,  something cool not middle of the road generic. anyone can have fun with a bit of imagination. 
Hell i went out of my way to play the visual novel that was japan only, on cellphones. Why not go all out do a Halo Reach of Final Fantasy and have stuff like dissidia for combat. Embrace the totally over the top anime nature of it. 
 
Im looking at something like DBZ Kakarot, and i feel thats what i wanted but FF. Maybe im still sore that the new dissidia was garbage.
    
Theres a quote i heard from a Gamefreak employee that sticks out with me that really emphasizes where my issues are. When asked why gamefreak hasnt made a pokemon snap 2 despite the constant demand they said "" we dont have any cool new twist to put on it, and if we cant make it unique why make it a all?""
  
I guess im just not convinced yet that this needed to exist, in this form. Why not make it VR? Why not make the combat a new system? Something utterly new and mindblowing. Like the first time you see the FF10 grid system or learning god damn triple triad.
  
Like i played on Normal and because i played the original i knew when the boss would jump out( why not have a fake out in the official game? Play on expectations !) And well...i mashed dodge, attack in sequence, and that was it.  Being able to dodge made it faaar too easy.

1016	"&gt;If Liebeck's lawyers were being honest they would've marched into that court room and argued that the existence of hot coffee as a consumer product should be banned. In my view that's what anyone who thinks Liebeck was owed money should be arguing.

Is it impossible to have a cup in which cream and sugar could be added without opening the lid and exposing the user to a dangerous beverage? I don’t think it is, if anything, you could do that with an internal stirrer, and a one way chamber for pouring in things (open the top area, add in milk, closing the top area enables you to open the bottom lid, adding milk to the coffee). Then you have a straw that regulates how fast liquid can exit the cup.

Ok, so it’s clear we can make design choices that mitigate the risks of the product. The question is, if the company can do this, and doesn’t, does the company have any liability for that decision? It seems reasonable to think the answer is yes. 

A car is inherently dangerous. Lots of people die in cars every year. But if a company chose to make design choices that increased the danger of the car (say by using substandard airbags), should they bear liability for their choices?

Now, we can get into questions about how much the superior and safer lid increases the cost of a cup of coffee, and eats in to the profitability of the coffee. But the cost of that is weighed against the liability risk right?

Other things can be similar. I enjoy a much broader range of music than children do, from classical music to Rage Against the Machine. I enjoy a much broader range of movies than kids do.

And my point is that not every 15 year old is equally mature, I'm entirely sure that some 15 year olds are perfectly capable of being adults, because people are different from one another. The courts recognize this fact, which is why you can get amancipated.

I ""identify"" vs ""am"" acknowledges that the identity you're claiming is complex. Things like ethnicity and race and gender and sexuality, even little things like what fandom you belong to or where you draw the line of who is ""family"" or not, can be totally ambiguous at the edge cases, so it's easy to get into semantic arguments about what's a ""true"" Scot or bisexual or woman or cousin or weeb. When you say you ""are"" something, the implication is that there's some standard criteria for that and you're saying you meet that. Which most people won't call you on, but with a big enough audience there's always someone who's gonna say ""no fuck you a real ___ needs to be this and that and the other thing"". Think about how many people said Obama wasn't a ""real"" African American. The fact that there can even be an argument about that demonstrates how complicated identities can be. When you say you ""identify"" as something, you're sort of taking that definitional power out of society's hands and explicitly giving it to yourself. You're saying, ""look, I know this is complicated and I don't want to get too into it, but a part of my personal outlook and background and how I view myself is that I consider myself to be a ____"". And yeah, people can absolutely use that to say absurd things. There's nothing sacred about using one verb or the other - please call out people who *are* using it in a bullshit way if you feel like it. The utility of the phrase is just that it shows you understand that identities aren't black and white and maybe it helps you escape a semantic argument.

As for your second question, it totally does imply choice, but the thing is, they're both a choice. You're choosing to say you ""are"" something just as much as you choose to say you ""identify"" as something. Again, we're talking about group identities with fuzzy definitions. You can't ""know"" for sure if you belong or not because it's not objective. Either way what you're really saying is ""my personal definition of this group includes myself"". The latter phrasing just acknowledges that that's the case. 

So to sum up, it better explains that you know shit be complicated. It does imply choice but in a way that acknowledges that you'd be doing so no matter how you said it. It's (slightly) safer from people calling you out on the nitty gritty details. Still won't save you if you try to claim a totally bogus identity.

As for the OP, I can no longer see their post. But, again, I believe it is you who has confused some terms.

You specifically offered: ""Isn't it the job of every parent to teach children about religion?"" In what respect? As it relates to ""...teach their children that it is wrong to kill another person, save for very specific instances""? The answer to that is most assuredly, ""No.""

And how is it that you know: ""This (teach their children that it is wrong to kill another person) was not true back in certain eras of history.""? Surely, you're limiting your discussion to recorded history. Do you have any citation(s) supporting your claim? I can give you a citation that states otherwise.

It doesn't (and didn't) take religion to understand murder is antithetical to human well-being. Our predecessors, even ten thousand years ago, were not savages.

1034	"I'm not so sure about that. Any observation about derivatives can be turned into an observation about integrals; e.g. think about

    \int (2x+2) e^{x^2+2x+3} dx

which is traditionally something you would do via substitution. One can observe that if `u = x^2+2x+3` (the exponent) then the derivative of `u` is `2x+2` (the first factor), or alternately observe that if `v = 2x+2` (the first factor) then the integral of `v` is `x^2+2x+C` (the exponent). More generally, the standard presentation is

    \int f(x) dx = \int f(g(t)) g'(t) dt

and the alternate presentation is

    \int f(x) dx = \int f((\int g(v) dv)(t)) g(t) dt

1038	"It's a bit harder to find good examples of strategy on YouTube, because hockey's highlight reels tend to focus on other skills like speed and coordination, but it still plays a huge role in the course of a game.  

When one team is in the offensive zone (trying to score,) they need to maintain control of the puck while they set up opportunities for themselves.  The common ""base"" setup is one player at each corner of the blue line, one in each corner/slot, and one directly in front of the net.  The puck then gets cycled between the four outer players.  Their job is to look for and create scoring opportunities.  

On the other hand, the defenders usually commit one player to match each player in the corner, at least one in front of the net, and one or two to cut down on passes and shots from the blue line.  The offensive team cycles the puck amongst themselves outside the slot, and tries to draw in defenders towards them.  If done successfully, one attacker will beat or partially beat his corresponding defender, requiring another one to step in to prevent an easy shot.  This, in turn, leaves another attacker even more open for a pass somewhere else.  Then they can either try to score, or pass again for a better opportunity depending on how the goalie is positioned.  

Every player must constantly think about where they should position themselves in order to make this work.  The defensemen at the blueline also need to keep an eye on any opposing players trying to rush, while doing all this.  If anyone doesn't, there will most likely be a turnover and major opportunity for the other team.

[Here are two plays that show what I mean.](http://youtu.be/TNrwJ1lGy50?t=47s)  In the first one, it's worth noting that everything happens in less than then seconds.  Rather than stop the game, decide on what play to run, and then run it, everyone is deciding what the best possible move is as the game is still going.  Try pausing the video after each pass or shot, and see if you can figure out what each player (individually) is going to do next.  

Sometimes things happen so quickly, there isn't enough time to actually set up - usually on turnovers or pucks that bounce oddly.  In the same video as above, but the next play (at 1:00), you'll see this (it gets played twice, by the way).  It's really easy to focus on the puck here, but watch the clip three times, and watch a different player each time.  Do the same thing as before, and notice how each of them does something different in order to make the goal happen.  As lucky as the original bounce was, it wouldn't have gone anywhere if not for #19 putting himself in a passing position and then drawing in the defence, and #23 reading the play and positioning himself behind the defensemen and out of the goalie's reach.  And once again, this is all happening on the fly in about six seconds - no huddling around a clipboard and deciding in advance what'll happen.


So, in my opinion at least, if football is chess, hockey is speed chess.

My point about effort/time investment by you does not have anything to do with their interests or hobbies.

I agree with you, those traits are the right traits to look for and value.

The problem is, as that comic illustrates, is that actually *identifying* those traits is not an effortless task. It takes a significant amount of time and attention to identify it, except in cases where you have good luck. Like in the comic, the people aren't *taking* the long amount of time and effort to identify those traits.

1053	"You make a good argument.  I have some clarifying questions that will help me decide if my mind has been changed, because I am on the fence right now:

Do I have self-ownership in that my body and my life are my own property?  If so, then what is the basis upon which I have been granted it as property?  Surely it can't be because the rest of society has decided that I own it.  If someone should take that away from me without my consent, it could be nothing if not murder.

Perhaps my definition of property as a communal agreement, is wrong.

If I own my life as property but the rest of society can claim my property on the basis of a social contract, this means that the rest of society can claim my life too.  In the same way, since they can claim ownership over my life, they can claim ownership over my labour, all of it if they so choose.

Based on my current definition of property and my newfound understanding of that definition's implications to the social contract, whether I can be said to own myself or not, I must submit to slavery or even death, should the majority will it.

Also imagine that most people who read only one of the books tended to believe in the idea argued for by that one book (people who read both of the books sometimes did and sometimes didn't). If you chose to read only one of the books, then you would be effectively choosing to believe whatever idea was endorsed by those books. This can be applied more generally to choosing to seek out evidence for particular ideas and ignoring evidence against particular ideas.

Now you might say that this isn't truly choosing to believe in that idea, because you aren't directly choosing it - rather, you're choosing to do an intermediate action (intentionally exposing yourself to biased evidence), and that intermediate action inevitably results in you believing the idea. Maybe you don't think this is equivalent to choosing to believe an idea, but I disagree. 

When people drink a lot of alcohol and consequently get intoxicated, it makes sense to say that chose to get drunk. Of course, this doesn't mean they consciously flipped a switch in their brain that immediately caused intoxication.

The reason it is not possible to be both pro-choice and pro-life is because you have to be on one side or the other for the majority of scenarios.

You are pro-choice if you believe women should have the choice up to third trimester abortions, because you are supporting abortion in most cases.

Coates is saying that the reason the little guy gets to feel big is because there's still someone beneath him.

1077	"&gt; You said you checked out his channel the other day. I don't think you could have gone through a sizeable amount of his videos enough that you could say the point of his channel is to ""decry how the SJW and feminists are ruining comic books"".

Sure, but I can use context clues to piece together his objectives. Let's take a look at his most recent videos. Of the [20 videos he's posted in the last week](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlzSqLSGj8GIOeT5jrQsJA/videos) (yeah, it will never be possible for me to go through all of his videos), 9 of them have the term ""SJW"" in the title. 

Here are some of the titles of his videos:

* This is what you get when an SJW Writes G.I.Joe
* SJWs LITERALLY CAN'T EVEN With C.B. Cebulski
* SJW Stories are Endings, Not Beginnings
* SJWs Like Aubrey Sitterson and Max Bemis Drive Away Fans With Their Pro Wrestling ""Heel"" Personas
* MARVEL RISING - SECRET WARRIORS Is like Paw Patrol for SJW Purse Puppies

&gt; How about let's just stop with the assumptions. By arguing that ""is it a bigger assumption than the one you made,"" you're also saying that it's okay to assume as long as the other person assumes, which isn't productive at all, and is indicative of strawmanning the other position.

My point in my response to your comment was to point out that you are taking one panel and attempting to use it as evidence of a full-on characterization of a new character. I provided an assumption (since I don't have the wrest of the comic at this time) to point out that yours lacked evidence.

This would really only work for very mundane and repetitive tasks.

Likewise, you can't expect the employer to teach them the foundations for that job or even why they are doing it a specific way when it is the schools job. Take an engineering internship for example. Most employers would like you to have taken at the very least the classes that are fundamental to engineering (thermodynamics, Physics I &amp; II, etc), so that they don't have to explain to you their basis for their rationality outside of ""you learn this in X class."""	12	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	31015092733	8	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9tm51l/_/e8xl2pp/	593937417	31015043665.0	2018-11-02 17:42:31	50527699866.0	the_real_guacman	2	False	218	2	False	True	70.02

By selling the rights to the loan.

The government doesn’t have the shares. It has the right to take the shares if the loan isn’t financed or is underwater. It sells that right to banks.

&gt;Does the community have the right to *force* people to help out the community? 

Without question. This has always been the case, and enforcement has taken many forms. Banishment, imprisonment, fines, execution, etc. You don't have the right to fuck things up for the rest of us, and the community has the right to self-defense against your actions. If inaction or selfishness on your part is sufficiently disruptive, the community has every right to defend itself from you. You can't stab a community, but you can hurt it in many other ways.

On the matter of Thomas, things get hairy. He *does NOT* have choice of community in this instance. He was born black, and no matter how much he disagrees with other black people that won't change. No corner of society is going to suddenly consider him a different race. There is consensus in the larger group that encompasses these smaller communities. If segregation were suddenly reinstituted, he wouldn't be exempt just because he didn't work against it in unison with other black people. (Obviously that's an extreme hypothetical).

So since his membership is assigned at birth, just as with many other forms of group membership, Thomas *can* betray a group that he doesn't personally identify with. Not to say every society *must* enforce race-based subgroups, just that this particular society does.

And then, as I mentioned above, the black community has a right to self-defense against the damage that Thomas's dissent causes for them. That takes the form of public shaming, and they are justified in doing so.

Edit: treason is a great example. Obviously you wouldn't commit treason if you agreed with your nationality, but on the same token it wouldn't be a crime if your membership to that nation wasn't enforced regardless of your agreement."	20	"['were suddenly reinstituted', 'is assigned', ""wasn't enforced""]"	3	3	0.15	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['were suddenly reinstituted', 'is assigned', ""wasn't enforced""]"	3	3	0.15	1	30606246087	16	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8xms86/_/e2662mf/	540219750	30606065635.0	2018-07-11 00:15:10	68515242.0	Whatifim80lol	1	False	299	1	False	True	64.0

I think people in general vastly overestimate the advantage that the electoral college gives Republicans. Over the past 6 elections The electoral college benefited Republicans in elections in 2000, 2016 and 2020, it benefited Democrats in 2004, 2008, and 2012. A perfect 50%/50% split.

I also think you're underestimating the ability for people to adapt to rule changes. For example in the 2022 most pitchers in MLB took more than 15 seconds  on average to throw a pitch. In 2023 MLB introduced a new rule saying that pitchers only get 15 seconds to throw a pitch or the batter would get a free ball. Did this result in hundreds of extra balls being thrown by pitchers who got timed out? No, the pitchers just threw the ball sooner instead. Same principle applies to the presidential election, it's obvious that both parties strategies would not work in a popular vote election. So this rule change would result in significantly different behaviors from both parties that would result in different election results."	11	['being thrown']	1	1	0.09090909090909091	1	['being thrown by']	1	1	0.09090909090909091	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	44166681206	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/181qb2e/_/kafp9bq/	2663418758		2023-11-23 11:27:19	70144036.0	PM_ME_YOUR_NICE_EYES	2	False	190	2	False	True	62.48

1129	"&gt; I am however equating it with goods exchange. It is exactly like a guy paying people off with money to get to the top. Women have the advantage of using sex to do it.

It is not the same as good exchange, because not everyone feels like sex is a good (you obviously do, but you have to admit that this is not a commonly held position). The idea that sex is or *should be* a currency is not an accepted one. There is also a difference between someone saying ""I'm going to use my sex as a currency"" and someone saying ""The only currency I'll accept from you is sex"" (but we'll get into this with your store analogy).

&gt;What I was suggesting was that the stigma and shock related to the news and the extensive media coverage is blowing things out of proportion. And therefore Harvey is not as evil as you think.

The fact that you're saying this *even after* the forcible rape allegations have been pointed out to you makes me suspicious about your motivations. Setting the forcible rape allegations aside, the man had a clearly established pattern and threatened women to not talk about his behavior, indicating he knew he was doing something wrong. When multiple women talk about locking themselves in the bathroom and him masturbating *to completion* on the other side of the door, its very clear that what we have is someone who gets off on having power over others and creating a sense of fear in them. Setting all the sex stuff aside, he threw Nathan Lane against a wall for making a joke he didn't like. The man is clearly a brute. So why hang your hat on him?

&gt;I open up a store for a very specific item (that people want but not need) but I only take payment in sex with only people I consider attractive. Do you think it is wrong?

Well, yeah. It's ethically sketchy and 100% illegal. But either way, this analogy is flawed because, again, many (if not most) people do not consider sex an exchangeable good. Also, someone could presumably go to another store and use money to buy the same goods you're wanting to exchange for sex. Weinstein wasn't selling goods, he essentially saying he would make or break women's careers based on whether or not they would accept his sexual advances. Well-connected or established actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow were able to continue working with other companies in the industry, but those who were trying to break in or were only just getting recognition like Sophie Dix found themselves either pushed out of the industry or decided to leave because it was too dangerous/toxic. Your analogy doesn't imply that if your customer refused the terms of your agreement, you would use your power as a business owner to make sure they couldn't procure the goods elsewhere.

In another response you said ""I feel that every woman who chose to privately enter a room with Harvey Weinstein more or less knew the risks and benefits involved,"" which I would also like to respond to. The thing about rumors and gossip is that people are never sure how much to believe. Clooney said he'd heard rumors but thought they were just people trying to insult the actresses by implying they didn't deserve their success, so he didn't put much stock in them. Many of the women who have come forward have said they heard whispers, but because Harvey was able to silence so many victims there was nothing substantial to prove the danger he posed. Imagine if an early-career actress said ""Sorry, I don't want to meet with this man because I've heard rumors that he is a creep"" -- what kind of consequences do you think that would have for her career, where early-career actresses are a dime-a-dozen? And based on what, gossip that we're told we shouldn't believe because gossiping is bad? It's also important to note that he would set meetings in legitimate public places and when the women arrived they would be told the meeting had been moved somewhere else (usually his hotel room) and he would also begin meetings with an assistant (usually female) present and then dismiss them. He contrived situations that would feel plausibly legitimate *and then* turn the tables.  It would be like if all the goods in your store were priced with certain amounts of money, and when the customer gets to counter you said ""oh, i know that says $24.99, but it will actually cost you a blowjob and a foot rub. and by the way, if you don't give me a blowjob and a foot rub, I'll make sure you're never able to shop anywhere else.""

Weinstein is a classic sexual predator who used deception, manipulation, and threats to create situations in which women's careers (and therefore their economic futures) were at the mercy of his sexual advances. He got off on the power he held over them and used that power to prevent them from seeking appropriate recourse or warning each other about how serious of a danger he was. This is not the equal exchange of goods for sex, this is sexual predation.

1130	"Perhaps it's worth reading what Laura Bassett has actually said

&gt; In 2017, I wrote a personal essay about a much older, married cable-news host who inappropriately flirted with me in the makeup room a few times before we went live on his show, making me noticeably uncomfortable on air. I was afraid to name him at the time for fear of retaliation from the network; I’m not anymore. It was Chris Matthews. In 2016, right before I had to go on his show and talk about sexual-assault allegations against Donald Trump, Matthews looked over at me in the makeup chair next to him and said, “Why haven’t I fallen in love with you yet?”

&gt; When I laughed nervously and said nothing, he followed up to the makeup artist. “Keep putting makeup on her, I’ll fall in love with her.”

&gt; Another time, he stood between me and the mirror and complimented the red dress I was wearing for the segment. “You going out tonight?” he asked.

&gt; I said I didn’t know, and he said—again to the makeup artist—“Make sure you wipe this off her face after the show. We don’t make her up so some guy at a bar can look at her like this.”

&gt; Again—Matthews was never my boss. I’m pretty sure that behavior doesn’t rise to the level of illegal sexual harassment. But it undermined my ability to do my job well. And after I published a story about it, even though I didn’t name him, dozens of people reached out to say they knew exactly who it was. Many had similar stories.

Now perhaps it's just my sensibilities, but publically objectifying a women there to do an interview about sexual-assault- doesn't strike me as particularly appropriate behaviour. And in the original blog [Me Too, I Think? When Sexual Harassment Feels All Too Normal](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/me-too-sexual-harassment-normal_n_59ef6e98e4b0bf1f883628ac)


&gt; Compared to what Harvey Weinstein is accused of doing ― and Bill Cosby, and Bill O’Reilly, and the president, and all the men making headlines ― this is the kind of story that barely feels worth telling. This man didn’t sexually assault me, or masturbate in front of me, or text an unsolicited dick pic. He didn’t ask me to be his girlfriend or threaten to ruin my career if I didn’t sleep with him. He’s not my boss or manager. I’d have to consult a lawyer to figure out whether his remarks can even be considered sexual harassment, legally speaking. Maybe he’s just an asshole.

&gt; But his behavior affected me; it undermined my ability to do my job well. He treated me like a sex object. He made me feel like less of a journalist, that I was a nobody, that my thoughts mattered less than my body. He took advantage of my anxieties and amplified them at a vulnerable moment in my career.

&gt; This is the kind of harassment women face regularly ― the kind we’re unsure how to name. The kind that doesn’t rise to the level of something we would report, because it would just make the workplace more uncomfortable for us and put our own careers at risk, not theirs.

It's also worth noting Bassett is just the latest in his [long, and well documented](https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/951936341989888001) history of saying inappropriate things to/about women."	25	['is accused', 'be considered']	2	2	0.08	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is accused', 'be considered']	2	2	0.08	1	33848986406	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fex697/_/fjst92e/	932055019		2020-03-07 14:58:09	11555414.0	gremy0	5	False	550	8	True	True	62.58

I mean that is quite literally the notion that I'm receiving, to be fair that could result from inaccurate and deceiving language but I'm not fully convinced that's all. Not to mention that this begs the next question of why one should use that language if it is deceiving or more precisely why one doesn't explain the terminology that is used.

&gt;I don't think they do. People might use the word ""optimal"" when informally talking about this kind of thing, but I'm pretty sure the actual mathemeticians in the field are well aware that when discussing the Nash equilibrium, they're talking about a very particular mathematical concept, and not necessarily a real world ""dominant strategy"".

Oh, I'm pretty sure a mathematician is well aware of the drawbacks and benefits of their model. But mathematicians wouldn't run those experiments as they are not really interested in the real world, they rather explore abstract constructs and their meaning and limitations of it. So the closest they would get to an ""experiment"" is a) aiding a scientist by explaining their model or b) running a simulation (computer enhanced thought experiment). 
The group that I'm far more concerned about is those ""secondary math users"" who haven't understood jack shit but are all hyped about something and try to apply it to everything whether that makes sense or not. 
Those economists are the people I'd actually suspect of being surprised by something that is not at all surprising or deliberately misusing terms like rational in order to obfuscate that they didn't really grasp how and why that might actually be cool but also what the limitations are. 

&gt;The paper cited in the experimental section of the Wikipedia article just appears to note that real human behaviour is different, and attemtps to characterise/quantify how it differs.

Maybe I should read that more carefully.

1149	"You know what I learned recently? 

Basically, a single town in Connecticut consumes almost 99% of the US’s PCP illegal drugs. 

The dealer for that PCP is a single person that can be traced back to CA gangs. (The info is on the Stuff You Should Know podcast titled PCP.) 

It’s not directly related but follow me- the US only has a PCP problem in one little town in the smallest US state (or 2nd or 3rd smallest state) and PCP isn’t really used outside of this town anywhere else in the WORLD, they can trace it to its single source, and they can’t stop it. 

I don’t think a paper trail of the money involved will stop it either. It’s a roundabout example so I hope you are following my thought process. 

Another example, before my husband and I were married and had 6 kids, he was in prison for drug related crimes. He’s great now, completely turned his life around, is a contributing member of society, and has only gotten speeding tickets since he’s been out. Complete 180 success story. We even adopted a kid. He’s a fantastic father and husband. He’s rocking his dad bod, wears New Balance 550’s ironically, and loves to BBQ on the weekends and say stuff like “That’s a nice steak!” and “Those coals look hot enough now!” 

Anyway, when he was in prison, he did his best to keep his head down and stay out of the bullshit but he was an “indigent inmate” so he said he had a few side hustles to get some food and shoes and socks and stuff. (Don’t go to prison in SC. It’s like a 3rd world country. He came out 50 lbs underweight.) 

Honeybuns were the most common currency inside (so that would be the equivalent of cash) BUT he told me about the hustles the lifers had they were ALL Green Dot cards. They shuffled money around so fast between multiple cards, with help from the outside, that it couldn’t be traced. Need a cell phone? It’ll cost $300 to *this* Green Dot card. Transfer the money and you get the phone. Same with cigarettes and drugs and ANYTHING else you wanted. Green Dot card digital money transfers. 

That’s why I know for a fact it won’t work. 

Talk to someone that’s been to prison, not jail, and they’ll tell you the same thing- digital money transfers.  It’s probably more sophisticated than Green Dot cards now but this was a long time ago. 

I see where you’re going with this and I think in theory you’re on to something. However, in practice, it won’t work. There’s ALWAYS a way around it. If the local drug dealers don’t figure it out, the 1%ers will. 

I think it’s great you’re thinking on this, though. 

Knowing what I know from what I’ve learned from loving someone who used to suffer with Substance Abuse Disorder, I don’t think we can legislate our way out of this. 

I think the way we fix the very serious drug issue is by throwing money at the problem. We need to be able to offer therapy to address the trauma and chronic pain/medical issues that led ppl down this path. 

We have to break the generational trauma, poverty, etc, etc, etc. Drug abuse is only a symptom of systemic societal failures. 

Substance Abuse Disorder is a medical problem that we’re criminalizing instead of treating."	41	['can be traced', 'isn’t really used', 'be traced']	3	3	0.07317073170731707	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['can be traced', 'isn’t really used', 'be traced']	3	3	0.07317073170731707	1	43113722438	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/156n87a/_/jt0sp52/	2490274630	43113483369.0	2023-07-22 14:38:44	2251841654025.0	biglipsmagoo	1	False	573	0	False	True	81.93

1152	"&gt;I feel like you're making the same mistake many centrists make and conflating two very different things just because they happen to operate in political alliance.
&gt;
&gt;- there's triangulators and technocrats, which is what your post is discussing. These are people who either take the view you talk about and seek the middle ground between all the poles, or do something a bit different which operates in the exact same way which is to claim that they are not at all political or ideological and are purely pragmatic and managerial - which ignores the fact that there is no such thing and that if you try you just end up unknowingly adopting the ideology of the centre of gravity
&gt;
&gt;- there's the political ideology of centrism which is the ideology of Giddens, the Third Way, Blair, Hawke, Jospin etc... and is about using neoliberal means for social democrat ends. Which is a political and ideological position.

I like this distinction but I don't know yet that it is really a distinction with a difference so to speak. It reminds me in a parallel sort of way of the difference between a naive true believer and a cynical grifter: while there is a difference in intention, the actions and outcome are much less distinct.

&gt;Conflating the two has a number of harmful effects. The mainstream media for example strives to be objective and impartial, but somewhere along the line it confused impartiality for triangulation so now we have a mainstream media that is hugely subjective and partial and biased towards centrist ideology, but somehow still believes itself to be objective because it wrongly conflates receiving criticism from both sides with not having a bias. In addition the centre has become intellectually lazy because it thinks it doesn't need to justify its position but can just average out the positions of others - which ignores the fact that both right and left refute the ideological logic of centrism.

This reads to me as essentially overlapping with the criticism I present in my OP. The presumption of standing outside or above politics, claiming to take the best parts of both sides, while disclaiming both sides.

&gt;Now in terms of your charges, I suppose you could maybe argue that some of the people in the first group who claim to be non ideological while espousing centrism are being misleading (although I think they mostly mislead themselves) and you could maybe argue that some of the people in the second group who use the existence of the first group to coast along without feeling the need to justify their beliefs are guilty of a very mild form of what you call maliciousness. 

Contingently agree.

&gt;But in general I don't think that's a helpful way to characterise either. Better to say that centrism - proper centrism, the second type (since the first type is just unwittingly following the second) - is an ideology just like any other. It's as intellectually valid as any other:

Is this premising that all ideologies are equally intellectually valid?

&gt;I don't personally ascribe to it and I do think its adherents have become intellectually lazy due to the existence of the first type, but it's a perfectly coherent belief system. It's probably got no more or less malicious or misleading followers as any other ideology.

1160	"The numbers on your first point don't work out (also it would be nice if you gave a source). The 134k is children born per year, assuming that is a stable number (and isn't discovered) and assuming the child welfare system takes care of children until they turn 18, that makes 18x135k=2.43 million underage people with false paternity, so 6 times as many as children in the welfare system.

I also don't really see how it's relevant to the discussion, even if there are other problems plaguing children that doesn't invalidate the importance of the false parenthood thing.

With all that being said, personally I think putting that big importance on blood ties is kind of medieval. A tie we actively choose (friendship) is usually stronger/more important than ones we keep out of circumstance (work friends). Similarly my bond with my spouse (chosen) is more valuable than that with my sibling (given). Ironically, ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"".

I think there's a ritual aspect to the expectation of a child, seeing hormones and the body change etc. that definitely build a bond for a parent. Putting effort into raising the child, consoling it, dressing it etc. all have a symbolic weight to them that (for most people) strengthen the bond. But which sperm arbitrarily fertilized the ovum which led to that pregnancy, and whose DNA that sperm was carrying seem far secondary compared to other aspects.

That's not how double-effect works. Double-effect only applies when the negative or rights-violating outcome is a side-effect of the main course of action, not when it is a necessary component, as is the case for killing and eating someone.

&gt;Saving my platoon is an unfortunate second effect of the action of endeavoring to save them.

Those ones didn't correct for reverse causation as far as I can tell, but here is one that did, [A study that found that gender diversity increased productivity in countries with positive views on diversity](https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-gender-diversity-makes-firms-more-productive).

&gt;Critics may argue that causality might go the other way: it’s possible that high-performing firms simply attracted a wider range of talent. However, we performed a number of checks that helped rule out reverse causality.

&gt;In one of these checks, we tracked performance changes after an organization added more women to its workforce. By tracking patterns of hiring and performance across time for the companies we measured, we were better able to disentangle cause and effect between these two variables. Because performance followed hiring, not the other way around, we supported our results that diversity led to better financial returns.

&gt;In short, we didn’t find evidence that firm performance led to diversity. Rather, we found that diversity was a driver for these companies’ success.

As for why this happens, there are a lot of theories. The study I just linked has a few theories about why that is. One of them is quite interesting: [Diverse leaders are more likely to listen to employees from minority groups](https://hbr.org./2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation)

&gt; Without diverse leadership, women are 20% less likely than straight white men to win endorsement for their ideas; people of color are 24% less likely; and LGBTs are 21% less likely. This costs their companies crucial market opportunities, because inherently diverse contributors understand the unmet needs in under-leveraged markets.

&gt; By correlating diversity in leadership with market outcomes as reported by respondents, we learned that companies with 2-D diversity out-innovate and out-perform others. Employees at these companies are 45% likelier to report that their firm’s market share grew over the previous year and 70% likelier to report that the firm captured a new market.


There have also been laboratory experiments that reached similar conclusions. [Here is a study where juries were instructed to determine the sentence of a Black defendant:](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-05169-005)

&gt;Deliberation analyses supported the prediction that diverse groups would exchange a wider range of information than all-White groups. This finding was not wholly attributable to the performance of Black participants, as Whites cited more case facts, made fewer errors, and were more amenable to discussion of racism when in diverse versus all-White groups.

1169	"&gt; I would ask for total abolition of mandatory enlistment, but, that’s not going to happen. 

Agree wholly, but I understand there are places where this won't happen for various reasons.

&gt;Women in today’a society are the primary care givers to many children. In black communities, fatherlessness is 70%, meaning that single mother make up a large majority of the care givers in that community alone. This would leave, in case of war, millions of people without mothers and fathers. 

In some countries that require enlistment, from my understanding, there are programs available where children can live on base with their parents, or the parents can be placed in more technical jobs that allow them to commute to and from home, depending on the child's age.

&gt; Also, if war would to happen, who would hold down the fort. If all the 18-25 year olds, who hold most of the jobs in retail, food service, and entertainment, were to go off to war, that would leave thousands and millions of job openings, crippling the job market. Now I’m sure that there is some sort of solution for this, but I, not many of the people talking about this issue, can think of one.

This is a good one. In my opinion, I feel like a wartime scenario would lead to a restructure of the job market, similar to the first and second world wars, where jobs would be temporarily and/or permanently transferred to those exempt from and/or banned from service.

I agree with everything you said up until here. At this point you snuck in an extra assumption that was not accounted for. It would require an adherence to something like physicalism or materialism, where our consciousness, emotions, memories, etc. behave in the same way as the spatial engagements being mapped out in physics.

Yet even if we make the assumption you are claiming, I would say that free will exists in the probabilistic way you are describing. When presented with a probability distribution for living our lives, what does the selection process look like that chooses one of these possible paths? If this selection process is wrapped up in things like consciousness, emotions, memories, etc. then to me it seems like free will exists, it is just a constrained free will.

Although if that is true, why do they not do it now? Or is it that I don't see it, but they do do it?

Also, I agree. It kills me to say it because I really like it, but Google is a monopoly, and an extremely dangerous one at that. Knowing this, and knowing the power they hold, are they not usinig that power out of moral standard (confucionist philosophy), or is it due to constant scrutiny and suspicion from the public?

1190	"I've heard it said that we should eliminate the minimum wage because it correlates with an increase in employment. The reasoning is that with cheaper labor costs, employers are able to higher more people for the same price. Even though eliminating it may reduce income for those struggling as it is, it would incentivize employers to hire more people. So it comes down to the question of whether we should allow for an overall reduction in the standard of living for those whose income may be reduced, in exchange for raising employment across the board. 

While you have argued that the market would set a living wage in the place of minimum wage, wouldn't a living wage be better than no wage at all for those who would otherwise be employed? Additionally, with easier access to employment from the cheaper wage costs, employers could theoretically end up competing for potential employees, and thus offering incentives to encourage people to work for them, such as an increase in wages.

I was under the impression that your point was about a legal paradox because you started off by stating something was a legal paradox and describing this as a problem. So I continued this discussion assuming it was about the law. And I made the following claims:

* That the legal situation you described was not, in fact, a paradox.

* That even if it were a paradox, the appropriate way to resolve a paradox created by conflict between a single recent law and longstanding precedent based on the constitution is to overturn the law, not overturn the constitution.

Now it seems like you don't care about what the law says or what precedent says. I suspect you don't even care about this supposed paradox (think about it: would your views about abortion change if the Unborn Victims of Violence act didn't exist or was repealed?). You just care about your personal moral beliefs. And this is perfectly fine, but in this case: why start the conversation by pretending to care about a ""legal paradox"" when this supposed paradox doesn't actually affect your views on abortion at all?

You either have to deport or legalize. You can't leave these people in a shadow class for perpetuity. It's much more likely that the muscular deportation regime in place now could better handle an increase in migrants trying to cross illegally rather than doing the impossible and cruel act of rounding up 11 million people and deporting them disrupting a ton of families and economic production in the process. 

&gt;Where's your proof? Also I would prefer something concrete and not a study that has the potential to contain bias. Though, ultimately you're not trying to change my view, if you could substantiate this with hard numbers, I would concede this point. However, I do live in an agricultural town and I'd be hard pressed to find people that aren't illegal working the vineyards.

This makes no sense. That you live in an agricultural town with illegals in the vineyards is a non sequitur. 

Go back and read the case I laid out to you and then reread how this is a ""service economy."" Don't you think it would be difficult to pull people, who by and large for the majority of the population, don't live near agricultural production and are used to participating in a service economy and set them to work doing manual labor? Americans live in cities in suburbs, and the country is urbanizing fast. It would take a long time to get people to move to where they could easily work in agriculture. Migrant farm workers are fairly skilled at their difficult jobs. Most Americans have no experience. The fact is that any attempt to force migrant workers out and replace them would seriously disrupt food production.

&gt;Cruel or not, the fact of the matter is, that we have laws that need to be adhered to. If you don't want to obey our laws, you can either stay in your country or find one that won't deport you for illegal entry.

Relatedly, why should extremists be allowed to hijack a movement? There will always be crazy people, but allowing their presence to smear the broader group is lazy and wrong. It’s not like protesters can kick people out of the group. Many of them probably didn’t even see the Confederate flags.

1199	"I think you're just mistakenly understanding what the point is. And you're right, it's *not* obvious! That's what makes it an interesting example. And again, your truck / hat example is a *very* different example. So you're wrong to expect ""consistency"" there, because it's a different case with different considerations. 

Here are two other ways to try and highlight what the book is trying to explain.

Imagine the hat and the tractor are sold by the same store (it's a fancy cowboy hat). If you're going to buy them both anyway, it makes zero difference whether you drive to the store on Tuesday to save $49 on the hat and then pay full price for the tractor on Wednesday, versus driving to the store and paying full price for the hat on Tuesday and then saving $49 on the truck on Wednesday. In both cases, the result is *identical*. The irrationality is that most people have a bias towards the version that saves money on the hat. But there's *literally no difference!*.

Second, this mindset of relating the savings to the total cost can be easily exploited. If $49 is such a small percentage of the cost of the tractor that it doesn't matter, why stop there. What if it was a $99 sale. Seems like your reasoning would still apply. The $49 is a great sale on a $50 hat, but who cares about a $99 sale on a 50k tractor? But if you think like this you're just throwing away money. Because of you go get the $99 tractor sale, you can buy the full price hat on the way home and you come out $50 on top! The extra savings on the tractor, despite being an insignificant percentage of the tractors cost, we're able to net you the hat *and* $50, which is *much* better than a $50 hat for $1!

1201	"To add to this concept - this *must* be evaluated on a strict case by case basis. Many many years ago, I did probono in NYC and saw/lived the criminal justice system. 

First off, Reddit has this idea of some innocent stoner getting 2yrs in jail for a joint. Reality is *never* that simple and clean. In 99% of cases of “guy with a joint”, the cops issued a summons and the case was dismissed as part of an ACD deal (eg, do 8hrs of community service, go to school, stay out of trouble for 6mo, and the whole thing is expunged). I represented over 200 of these cases, and this is the end result in literally 99% of marijuana cases. 

When people get *real* penalties for pot, it’s usually as part of something far more sinister. Here’s a hypothetical that’s similar to cases that very frequently popped up in NYC in the 90s/00s: Guy with gang affiliations gets shot and police are notified to watch for retaliation. Cops monitor rival gangs and see two rival gang members in a car in rival/hostile territory. They are obviously up to something. Car runs a light and cops pull over the car. Searching the car, they find a loaded gun in the trunk. They also find pot in the car with the two guys. The cops can’t establish possession of the gun so the can’t charge it. However, if they release the two gang members, there is going to be a murder. 

So what happens? The DA maxes out the charges where they can - they absolutely throw the book on the pot charges to keep the two guys off the street. So the two guys get 6mo for the pot. Hopefully that’s enough time for things to cool down and nobody gets murdered. This scenario gets repeated with depressing frequency. 

The problem is that 10years later people go back after the fact and look at just the charge and punishment and say “OMG - 6mo for some weed?? That’s racism in action!!!” But reality is vastly more complicated than just a cursory glance. You have to dig into the casefile/jacket which is really hard to get access to.

You could call it functional in a basic way, but it's not like seeking short term rewards is a result of the sort of deeper thinking that we generally understand as rational. It's just an unfortunate situation where the person's biology is problematic with the context it ended up in. Something can be adaptive in one context, and not in another. 

Context basically always matters when using language like dysfunctional, since we're adaptive creatures. There's certainly a reason a brain will reward spikes of energy, but in a modern context we could call it maladaptive if it does so to extremes that result in problematic behavior.

There is no ideal normal human organization parameters that it can be said to be either operating within or not which we could refer to and describe it as functional by virtue of that alone. We can call it dysfunctional simply because it is resulting in harmful behaviors(or more specifically perhaps a persisting pattern of harmful behavior). If it's prioritizing your needs it's doing so poorly within the context it's in.

Most people are capable of controlling their short term desires/urges to some extent to reduce harm or in the interest of longer term positives - and an addicted brain is clearly interfering with that very important ability in the modern context in a way that may cause the person a great deal of harm. 

I also wouldn't describe becoming addicted as training yourself. You're not aiming to become addicted, it's almost more like the environment/substance is the trainer except there's no intentionality. Your computer analogy doesn't really capture what's happening accurately either - a substance would not be software it'd be more like electricity(an energy source) and your brain would be running dated software which doesn't use it right and the result is damage to the body(hardware). The environment I'm not even sure what computer terms you'd use for. Really it all just doesn't apply well enough. I get what you mean and why you described it that way but it's not quite right from my perspective. 

Admittedly, the language used even by official sources can be problematic as well and have to read in a certain way with certain caveats. 

What's happening, put more simply, is that external factors(a substance, possibly combined with environmental factors leading to excessive use of the substance) have caused a person to behave in damaging ways to their body. Diseases are, by at least one widely used current definition, damaging conditions of the body which were caused by external factors. The evolutionary reasons the brain can have the particular problematic response to these external factors doesn't make the condition resulting from the response not a disease.

Policies that restrict rights get passed in collectivist societies because they're usually proposed on the promise that they'll target minority out-groups. Those groups are often the first line of defense against policies that might threaten your liberties in the future. 

It's true that Belarus is far from an even comparison to the US, but that's part of my point. Diversity is a major part of what allows western liberal democracies to stay that way.

1210	"&gt; Does queer politics adequately describe gender, but fail to meaningfully disrupt it? 

This is the question I find most interesting.  I strongly dislike the GenderQueer movement.  A large part of this is that I have never met anyone who described themselves as ""genderqueer"" who I didn't personally find deeply narcissistic, histrionic and, to put it bluntly, an obnoxious spastic. 

More than that though, I think genderqueering is actively counterproductive.  I love citing this one particular video clip from Jackson Katz's Tough Guise, a documentary on toxic masculinity (though it predates the development of that term).  This is the section: [Upping The Ante.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOIIUQehzDI)

Through the clip Katz keeps repeating ""there's something happening here"" and ""there's something going on"" -- yet he is never able to identify precisely what that ""something"" is that is driving this trend towards hypermasculinity.  And while Katz's documentary focuses on masculinity, during the same period you can see an equal trend of hyper*feminization* in women's fashions, girl's toys, etc.  This is the same period in which ""waif chic"" developed, the same period that saw the pinkification of girl's toys, the rise of ""Princesses,"" etc.

I think I have identified the ""something"" that Katz keeps going on about, and understand why Katz himself can't see it:  The something going on is *feminism*, and more specifically it's *genderqueering.*

While genderqueering wasn't identified and labeled as such until Butler published Gender Trouble in 1990, the trends Butler sought to support were already very active in culture and had been for a good twenty years or more, as can be seen in the androgynous fashions of the 70s, and the masculinization of women's fashion in the 80's (in which the pseudo-masculinity of shoulder pads became the fad du jour).

We all know about gender *dysphoria*, but we rarely stop to consider it's necessary opposite: gender *euphoria*.  A rough definition of gender euphoria would be "" is an affective state in which a person experiences pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness stemming from the successful performance of gender.""

Genderqueering, by attacking and dismantling gender signifiers, complicates gender euphoria.  The less masculine and feminine signifiers there are, the harder and harder it becomes to successfully perform gender.

In the 1950s, all it took to perform masculinity successfully was to wear a suit, have a job, and keep your hair trimmed short.  Boom, easy peasy, no need to work hard at displaying your masculinity.

By the 1980s, women were wearing suits, working jobs, and trimming their hair short, which meant that a male person who did these things was not necessarily performing masculine gender -- he was performing gender neutrality, he was androgynous.

So where is the cisgendered person in this increasingly androgynous society supposed to turn for that sense of gender euphoria that makes him feel he is successfully performing as a man?  In *hypermasculinity*, which notably consists of a collection of traits that women cannot easily co-opt for themselves.  Huge, swollen muscles come much more easily to men than women.  Litheness comes more naturally to women.  Thus those with a strong tendency towards cisgender identification engage in increasingly harmful and counter-productive displays of gender *because these are the only options remaining*.

It almost seems to suggest that the optimal happiness of society would be best served by the authoritarian imposition of *trivial* gender signifiers.  Allow women to work for equal pay, but make it a criminal offense to wear slacks.  Allow men to be stay at home dads, but make it a criminal offense to grow your hair out more than three inches.  Women have equal rights to men, but mustaches are now mandated by law!

I believe this would tamper the excesses of hypermasculinity and hyperfeminity.  Men would be able to point to their lip and say ""Obviously I'm a real man, I have a mustache!"" instead of living in constant state of anxiety over whether or not they are successfully performing gender.

That's why I think genderqueering is inherently wrong headed.  If gender is performative, then gender is also necessarily *communicative*, and if gender is communicative, then gender is a form of *language*.  And if some group of activists declared themselves *against language* and said that they were going to deliberately ""delimit the boundaries of human expression"" by ""queering"" language -- i.e. calling dogs ""cats"" to challenge the orthodoxical categorization of house pets -- you wouldn't call them ""language anarchists,"" you'd call them ""useless idiots who are just making everyone's lives more confusing and miserable."""	34	"[""wasn't identified"", 'can be seen', 'are now mandated']"	3	2	0.058823529411764705	1	['are now mandated by']	1	1	0.029411764705882353	1	"[""wasn't identified"", 'can be seen']"	2	1	0.029411764705882353	1	29286866718	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/65od9w/_/dgcn6zi/	372332084	29286013501.0	2017-04-16 18:59:59		orionbeltblues	21	False	750	1	True	True	49.86

Even further, this kind of meme is brought up to stem the tide if public censure and social stigma, not necessarily proving anything.

What banning the shift means is that essentially either outcome is more likely to be exciting- either the runner beats the throw to first because the fielder was not in the ideal position to make a play on the ball, or the fielder makes a great athletic play and gets the out. It's not just about there being more runs- it's about the individual moments being more fun to watch.

1219	"&gt;I think the question at the heart of your concern is ""How widespread and pervasive does a behavior or mindset have to be among a group before it is acceptable to say that the entire group behaves or thinks that way?""

I think this is the biggest problem I have with the concept of white privilege.

Let me preface everything by saying, obviously there are people born into better situations than other people and people who essentially luck out their whole lives, 'privilege' is very clearly a real thing.

With that out of the way.  What you're doing is using the same logic and reasoning that racists use to justify their beliefs.  And the conclusion that you're drawing, ""white people have it easier than anybody else and society should actively be working to change that,"" is just as racist as a white supremacist saying ""black people are criminals.""

The idea; ""How many members of a group need to be a certain way before you can say all of them are that way.""  Is an extremely unhealthy, unscientific and anti-intellectual way to think, but people are happy to do it because it superficially makes sense and can easily be twisted to support their existing beliefs.  I believe if you tried to use another race as opposed to a political party you would have a hard time making it come off as non-racist.

Another huge problem I have with this is something Dara O'Brien touches on with his ""racism is better than astrology"" bit.  The gist of which is that racism is better than astrology as a predictive tool, just down to the fact that there's a higher potential level of precision/accuracy when you split people down into races than when you split them into astrological signs and assign attributes.  The point is, both of these are inaccurate and pretty much completely arbitrary ways of grouping people.  If you really want to accurately group people socio-economically, race is a dumb way of doing it compared to something like current geographic location of residence, which neighborhood you live in, etc.

Any time you use race to group people, you end up inadvertently lumping in huge swaths of members of that race who have nothing to do with the actual group you're really talking about.  Especially when you use terms as vague as ""white,"" ""black,"" or ""latino.""

When you talk about people who benefit from white people, you're really talking about well off WASPs.  You're not talking about poor irish catholics, you're not talking about jews, you're not talking about czechs, poles, all sorts of slavs, scotts, greeks, italians, syrians (who are very much white), egyptians, or even copper stealing meth heads in mississippi, etc.  Yet when you talk about how society should change to counteract the advantages that these rich WASPs get, you're making negative claims about and suggesting solutions that would negatively affect all these other groups of white people that already largely face a ton of problems.

So if you want to say ""in general, white people benefit from certain privileges that other races generally don't benefit from.""  That's not necessarily inaccurate, but that's about the most charitable thing you could say about that statement.

1229	"If you're interested, this is actually a fairly settled issue, check out Marsh v. Alabama, or search for ""quasi-public"" spaces. 

Basically, if a private property owner holds itself out to be a public place, it has to allow freedoms that normal public spaces have to provide. In the Marsh case, the Supreme Court found that a company town (a town where all the property was owned by a single company) could not prevent Jehovah's witnesses from handing out pamphlets. This was on 100% privately owned property, but according to the court's rationale, since the property owner had taken steps to hold itself out as a public space, it took on the responsibilities of a public actor (i.e., government).

This rationale has been extended to certain types of shopping centers (especially the more modern kinds with open public recreation areas). I can't remember the case off hand, but an outdoor mall that allowed a certain political group to stage a protest but denied another got sued and the courts found that they had to allow both since they had voluntarily entered into a public role.

So Ave Maria is likely to run into the same issues if someone presses this issue.

There are plenty of things that would not work without social media. Crowdfunding is effectively impossible to the degree it is realised today.

Pooling knowledge, tutorials on basically anything, decentralizing human knowledge - all of that is effectively impossible without social media.

What you need to consider: ""social media"" isn't only Facebook, Twitter and such - it's also reddit, Youtube, any and all forums... from what I can see, public communication over the internet would basically cease to exist. Any communication would need to be between individuals, which would destroy not only social media but most of the internet as we know it.

It's not clear why only innate or genetic things would fit that criteria - do, for instance, people have a choice over their environment at the age of 6 months?

Sorry, it just occurred to me that you misquoted my argument. The far stronger and far simpler answer to your challenge is: environmental factors *do* fit that criteria. *""it is less justifiable to limit the rights of people by virtue of something they had no choice in""* is the core idea behind the legal principle of mitigating factors. Past circumstances of individuals, including abuse, are routinely considered in sentencing. 

Notice how you misquoted that line. You said,

&gt;""your underlying moral argument argument is that *it's wrong* to limit someone's rights for ""by virtue of something they had no choice in.""

I never made such an necessary categorical claim. I said it was *less justifiable.* In other words, it is a factor we consider, and it is part of the legitimate basis on which we can, without being inconsistent, believe that sexual incest should be illegal but other other types of sexual relationships that may produce children with congenital genetic disorders should not. This is true to the extent that we feel that it is **more** *less justifiable* to limit the sexual reproduction rights of those who were, for example, born midgets simply by virtue of them being midgets than it is *less justifiable* to limit the sexual reproduction rights of those who suffered, for example, child abuse influencing incest attraction simply by virtue of their child abuse influencing incest attraction."	14	['are routinely considered']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are routinely considered']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	28290733138	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/453h6e/_/czvklea/	250425014	28290580473.0	2016-02-11 00:41:29		teddyssplinter	1	False	287	2	False	True	47.32

&gt;Are some kinks acceptable and others not?

I think you’re misusing terms here. A “kink” like enjoying rough sex or something is just a preference. A “fetish” is something you require for orgasm. Kinks are perfectly fine as long as everyone is consenting. A fetish is not. It’s like this, if being choked gives you a stronger orgasm it’s fine. If you cannot orgasm unless you’re being choked, then that’s unhealthy. Again, a lot of this is about degrees which is why I brought up the difference between rain and snow. They’re both water falling from the sky but they’re also very different. Just like how a little choking may be enjoyable during sex however if the only way you can orgasm is to tie a belt around your neck during masturbation, it’s not a healthy thing anymore. 

By this logic what’s the difference between having a beer with dinner or having a beer with breakfast? It’s just a beer why does it matter what time? Yet both those activities have clear differences in underlying desire to do them

&gt;Why do we consider a race fetish to be racist but a gender orientation to be fine?

Because orientation is the gender you’re attracted too and as I explained above, as fetish is something required for sexual fortification. It’s also a little different because extreme racial preferences tend to be less about physical attraction and more about something deeper. Like some men have an attraction to asian women because of a perceived submissiveness.

This is exactly the cause for me being on the fence in the first place. SOME lives, and SOME viewpoints could be worth it over the inevitable death due to being socialized to face such non-existence as a rite-of-passage. It comes back to socialization (a whole other moral topic).  But, are such lives (which haven't been formed yet) WORTH the lack of choice in an individual being born? The real immorality I find is the **lack of choice** of an individual to choose whether or not to exist. My second point was that it forces them to experience death. So, your question can technically break down my second point, assuming that people being socialized to think that their life was worth no longer existed and facing death is moral. But, this is considering the fact that they were FORCED to exist and that they must face this death (which may or may not be worse than the life they lived).	11	['am stumped', 'being socialized', 'been formed', 'being socialized', 'were FORCED']	5	5	0.45454545454545453	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['am stumped', 'being socialized', 'been formed', 'being socialized', 'were FORCED']	5	5	0.45454545454545453	1	31172990269	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/a52y2k/_/ebjld8d/	613197308	31172942904.0	2018-12-11 02:24:01	93042487949.0	We_Broke_Up	1	False	194	0	False	False	78.99

1260	"Personally, I usually use the phrase ""no one is perfect"" as something that is humbling.  Believing in the concept of perfection is a dangerous idea because if you start believing you are perfect at something, then you will stop trying to improve.  Instead, I like to reinforce the idea that no matter how good you are and no matter how much you have your life together, there is always something you can be doing to make it better.  It might be a small thing to improve, but that is still an improvement that will only happen if you acknowledge you are not perfect.  This especially applies to people operating at a world class level in whatever they are doing.  They might be the best in the world at what they do, they might even be the best of all time, but if they acknowledge that perfection is impossible they can still push themselves to be even better.

&gt;To CMV, tell me why I'm wrong, why does no one have a perfect life?

Because there is an almost infinite number of ways that something can go wrong with someone's life.  All it takes is one thing to go wrong and now they are not perfect.  Sure, a theoretical perfect life could exist, but it is so unlikely that if such a life can be shown I would call it a statistical anomaly.

Keep in mind, that there is a difference between a really good life and a perfect life.  A person might be content with there life and enjoy themselves, but if they have small problems to deal with those are still problems and so their life is not perfect.  A person could have a life that is free of all of the issues you deal with and live a life that would be vastly preferable to your own while still not having a perfect life.

&gt;big feet then his life wasn't perfect because he would have a harder time finding shoes. Really? There are people with foot fetishes out there who will pay people with big feet.

Maybe for them the fact that they can land foot fetishists does not outweigh the fact that comfortable shoes are hard to find.  Not having proper shoes can actually cause a number of issues and can lead to chronic pain problems.  Maybe for some people, the upsides to their imperfections makes them worth it, but that still means they are not perfect.

I have an example of this with myself.  I have pretty severe ADD but I wouldn't give it up because I have learn how to turn it into an asset.

&gt;Shouldn't ""society"" always try to remove barriers that prevent good people from gaining social benefit rather than granting it to bad people? 

I'm not trying to argue the point here, I'm ot OP but I'm intensely curious about something you said. In your example, a single black person in a town of presumably white people, what ""barrier"" exists?

I have trouble accepting this kind of rationality because it begs the question ""What should we change?"". It seems obvious to me that we can not outlaw people selecting a mate based on personal preference of race. Without doing that how could we possibly remove a ""barrier"" and what ""barrier"" would we be removing exactly? 

I think you're likely to respond with something like ""we can encourage people to be more open minded about dating the black person"" and sure.. that holds rationally but that's going further than ""removing a barrier"". That's not removing anything. That's attempting to inject a positive assertion into a population of people to change their perspective. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it likely wouldn't be a bad thing, but it's fundamentally different than ""removing an obstacle"". 

I think if you're the only black person in a town of white people and you're upset no one will date you because you're black that's a real problem but not all real problems need solutions or have them even. I'm not really saying much of anything here other than I think that despite the fact that you've reached a conclusion that I agree with I believe your logic is faulty. You can't improve society by excluding others or by forcing inclusion. Society improves when people interact and exchange ideas and experience voluntarily.

1280	"&gt; Maybe you should note my definition of free will is from the dictionary. If we’re not both working off the commonly accepted use of the term this is more semantics. 

I was very clear in my first post at the top: 

&gt; If you define ""free will"" as having the agency to decide the actions that you take, then yes, humans do have free will. Humans do make choices and decisions, and have the power to perform actions based on those choices and decisions. Those actions then affect the universe around them.

Fate is complicated. Depends what you mean by fate.

Google says: 

&gt; the development of events beyond a person's control, regarded as determined by a supernatural power.

In that case - fate doesn't affect free will, because humans still have control over events. Not all events, but some events.

Google also says:

&gt; be destined to happen, turn out, or act in a particular way.

Well - things are destined to happen, and you are destined to make certain choices. If that's your criteria for ""free will"", then you don't have ""free will"", but neither do you have any meaningful definition of ""free will"" anymore either... and the idea becomes meaningless.

&gt; would you still believe you had the freedom to choose one of the other options you seemed to consciously consider

If my will desired one of the other choices, and it could do so and act on that choice, then yes. But it won't, because if you know my will very well, you know what I'm going to pick.

If I'm given the choice of ice creams, I'll pick chocolate. Am I free to choose one of the other options? Sure. *If my will was different, and wanted vanilla instead*, then nothing would impede it. It's not constrained. It would have freedom to do so. But if you know me well, you know that won't happen, because you know my will won't pick vanilla, it'll pick chocolate.

1286	"I was going to say ""homophobia( and transphobia) is actually far more normalized than racism"" but felt it's would be a vulgar oversimplification.

Soviet Union... Soviet Union was critical of segregation in USA, Native genocide and South African apartheid( manipulation and criticism of geopolitical rivals but still). In 1961 the university in Moscow was named after first Prime Minister of independent Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well many streets throughout Soviet Union. Asian and African countries gaining independence from Western European was in generally celebrated. A lot of Soviet propaganda posters depicted people of various races hugging. At the same time, male homosexuality was criminalized in USSR, there was prison term for it.  You can say Soviet fight against racism and colonialism was actually fight against geopolitical rivals, masked as empathy( and that's indeed not totally wrong) but a country, so critical of Western countries, for some never criticized them for being too conservative towards sexual minorities. For me, it's much easier to imagine a boomer from former Soviet country teaching racial equality than supporting gay marriage.

Disney Princesses... Disney created their first Disney princesses, Middle Eastern Jasmine, in early 90s. Shortly after it, they created Native American and Chinese princesses( Romani Esmeralda, while isn't official Disney Princess, was created in 90s too). Currently five of twelve Disney Princess are WoC. In 2021, we still don't have an explciitly LGBT Disney princess. In kid's media PoC aren't as underrepresented than LGBTQ+ people.

I think Conservative Christians are more likely to be accepting of PoC than of LGBTQ+ ( I am not saying they are typically accepting of PoC though).  Paul, author of the one of the most homophobic Biblical passages, also wrote this ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"". Sure, some may recall examples when Bible was used to justify racism. But it was mostly a willful interpretation of ambigious parts of Bible( like speculating that God marked Cain as murdered by changing skin colour). Even in the books, written in the past, and probably even in history you can find white devout Christians, even fanatics, speaking against dehumanization of PoC, calling them ""brothers"". I can imagine some devout Christians have a position like, ""good Japenese/African/Native American is Christian Japanese/African/Native American, while good gay/lesbian is celibate gay/lesbian"", I think it must be a rather common position. All parts of this position are problematic( I am anti-Christianity) but I'd argue that LGBT people are expected to make a much bigger sacrifice **here** than PoC are, they are expected to rid of more inherent( at least IMHO) part of identity. Such people( not all conservative Christians of course) will respect PoC Christians much more than white atheists( also white agnostics and other, more rare kinds of white non-Christians. Of course, they will likely respect celibate gays/lesbians more than straight non-Christians or even Christian-identiftying but promiscous straight people but their standards of chastity is higher for gays and lesbians than for straight people.

And Muslims, Muslims of course...

And, as other people pointed here, PoC are more likely to be supported by their parents, neighbours. Of course, it depends on other factors( e.g. whether you are monoracial or biracial, a biological or adopted ).

Talking about rights of non-cis people, trans activism is even more radical( radical not in sense ""bad"" but in  ""different from conventional beliefs, more challenging of conventional beliefs"" sense) than LGB activism and seem to divide even progressive people.

You can't look at it as good media/bad media; that's overly simplistic, and a false binary. All media has strengths and weaknesses. Mainstream media has some big weaknesses: too much spin, too much fluff, ideological slants. But mainstream media also has some big, unique strengths: access and resources. (And there's probably something to be said, too, for the fact that many people still view mainstream outlets as central to the media landscape - that makes knowing what they're saying valuable sometimes.)

Can you watch CNN/Fox/whatever and credulously accept everything they say? No. But they do have some unique advantages, so they're worth watching *with a critical eye* in circumstances that play to those advantages: during breaking events, and when they get big interviews, and when they run their few true investigative segments, etc.

Whether their slant is *wrong* or not is somewhat irrelevant. Sure, a lot of what they do is wrong. But they're not *lost* to extreme political bias as you stated in your post - or at least, you shouldn't let them be lost to you as long as they can still be *useful* to you. *That's* the line you should draw: between media that can be useful to you and media that can't.

I agree 100%, and that's what makes the situation so hard to analyze. 

&gt;I think the idea of reappropriation plays a huge role in how various black communities justify and circumscribe the use of 'nigga.'

Id ask then, how much of this point of view is what they thought all along versus a manufactured opinion created for the purpose of justifying behavior to critics i.e. an excuse? Im very skeptical, because people grow up using the word even before being taught the history. But I will admit there are people who sincerely hold that viewpoint. 

&gt;And that would have an eventual effect.

So this part Im not sold on. I speculate that the word might become less vulgar in such a situation, and maybe be replaced with other words. I think however as long as their even exists an isolated black community, that speaks to some underlying racial tension in society.

1310	"I'm trying to explain how their definition of ""woman"" now works, by explaining how they have relabelled the group that everyone originally knows as ""women.""

The gender community is trying to change the meaning of the word ""woman."" They need to change the meaning of the word ""woman"" so that statements like ""some women have penises"" can be true, so that ""MTF transgender individuals are women"" can be true.

However, they still need to talk about the original group of people known as ""women,"" which does not include people with a penis, does not include MTF transgender individuals. Reason being, this group has shared features and experiences which are meaningful in daily life and in actual social and political relationships. That group is frequently oppressed and discriminated against on the basis of SEX, their observed physical bodies, which are uniquely able to (as a class) create the next generation of human beings. These people have been forced to bear children, denied political suffrage, denied education, excluded from the banking system, all this in various places, because of their observed sex. Nothing to do with their identity. No member of this group in 1915 could walk up to the polling booth and say ""I am not a woman though"" and be handed a ballot. No members of this group in Afghanistan today can just say ""I'm not a girl though"" and be allowed to walk the streets bare-faced and attend higher education. It's only members of this group who will EVER have to worry about an unplanned pregnancy, or need access to abortion.

So we need to be able to talk about this group of people. The transgender community too needs to be able to talk about this group of people, because FTM transgender individuals belong to it and have certain shared experiences on that basis, and MTF transgender individuals are crucially NOT part of it and yet have a desire to outwardly appear as if they were, to have people think they are, at a glance on the street. (If they were truly members of that group, they would not be transgender.) They talk about ""passing.""

We know that the transgender community still needs to talk about this original group, because indeed they made a weird acronym for it. ""AFAB."" 

Despite all the coy endless questioning and insisting that ""no one can define 'woman'"" and ""if your mom had a hysto is she still a woman?"" that they engage in, none of them have any problem at all telling you who is ""AFAB"" and who isn't, exactly as the rest of the world has no problem actually identifying who is a ""woman"" (original definition), i.e. who is a member of the group described above.  No one has any problem figuring this out when it's about denying a child inheritance in favor of her brother, no one has any problem with ""who is a woman"" when it comes to browsing PornHub. 

And despite all the ""if your mom had a hysto is she still a woman?"" attempt at a ""gotcha,"" no one would ever bat an eye at saying the obvious ""of course your mother was AFAB."" No one ever argues over the boundaries of that word because we all know them from our earliest days -- it's what we all knew as ""women"" until very recently.

So yes. I'm happy to just keep on using ""women."" 

The problem is that everything that was labelled ""women"" is now being forced to use the new definition, the one that says ""some women can have penises"" and insists on including a portion of AMAB people with specific beliefs about gender in it. This is an attempt to deny the importance of SEX in daily life (and as a side effect, denies the reality of SEXual orientation).

They are relying on people hearing ""woman,"" imagining the old definition (which we all know, which excludes people with a penis, and which they call ""AFAB"") and imagining that they are AFAB.

But the public has caught on, and so now when people really want to specify they are referring to the original group, they're starting to use the term AFAB on dating sites and the like. Because that's how language works -- if a word is being made to mean something different, people will move to the new label that still describes the original concept.  Once ""some women can have penises"" then the word ""woman"" is no longer sufficient.

FWIW you can find posts by people (usually MTF transgender individuals) upset that people outside the community are using the word now, all over Reddit. Because people are insisting on talking about the original group of people, who don't have penises, and once again drawing the boundary, around SEX.

Alas, sex matters. And so this euphemism treadmill trundles on."	32	['is frequently oppressed and discriminated against', 'have been forced', 'be handed', 'be allowed', 'was labelled', 'being forced', 'is being made']	7	6	0.1875	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is frequently oppressed and discriminated against', 'have been forced', 'be handed', 'be allowed', 'was labelled', 'being forced', 'is being made']	7	6	0.1875	1	39474284674	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/_/i4tywzm/	1819686757	39473202439.0	2022-04-15 10:56:32	18645312.0	itazurakko	2	False	802	0	False	True	64.54

1314	"Well, to clarify first, this isn't based solely in physical continuity. Physical continuity assumes the parts are all the same. This is temporal continuity, which means all of the physical parts that have made up the person are connected by temporal means. The atoms that made you as a baby are pretty certainly not present in you now, but they are still connected to you as you are now by temporal means. 

Psychological continuity isn't the only determining factor. It certainly can be a factor, but isn't the only one. Let's try a small thought experiment. Say there are two different places in a universe. Each one progresses (obviously with different atoms) exactly the same way in terms of experience. This means all things which exist in one spot have a perfectly exact clone in the other. The stars are made up exactly the same, the planets move exactly the same, the people act exactly the same. Literally everything exists in the same way as the clone with the exception of being in different places in this universe. 

Considering this, psychologically, you are the exact same as the clone of you in that other place. Is it you though? Can it be you if you are both existing at the exact same time, even though you are both in completely different places? 

Take it further. What if we put a small temporal delay between the two spots. What if your clone is a fraction of a second behind you? Is it no longer you because your experiences, while still the same, have temporally diverged? What about if you are both put a video chat with one another. You both then act exactly the same, speaking at the same time, saying the same things. Are you both the same person, even though you are both actually having different experiences physically, even if those experiences have the exact same psychological effects? What about if you are both put in a room together, and with the exact same motions, shake hands? You both had the same experience psychologically, but you both also shook hands with someone else. 

The blueprint view has a problem here. Technically, both versions of you are made up exactly the same, but it is impossible to say both are the same person when they are technically having completely different (even though exactly clonal) experiences. You have to be able to say that both versions are both different from one another and the exact same. 

This is where the idea of temporal continuity helps establish identity. Each version of you is a unique, although clonal, person because each has a unique series of temporal parts. Those temporal parts are cut off though during teleportation because temporal continuity no longer exists. If that teleportation is delayed by 2000 years, then there is a 2000 year period in which that person did not exist.

1). Yes, people believe that if they clear the snow from a parking spot that they are entitled to it and for some reason other people go along with that.

2). Nothing.

3). I don't know of a reasonable way to determine this.  As you can already see, this whole idea is ridiculous and filled with holes.

4). Yes for a lot of streets the area is just how you describe.  Of course some people have garages and paid parking spaces in Chicago.  I would never think it is ok to park in someone else's garage(why was it even open?) or paid parking space.  However, I don't have either one of those things.

5). It just sucks is all.  It's a pain in the ass after a long day of work.  It's not the end of the world it's just a bummer.

6). Well yes I suppose this could be a possibility.  However, I more thinking of a 2 or 3 apartment unit, which is what I live in and many of the buildings on my block are the same.

1318	"&gt; Studies show that except at the extreme low end where pay is floored by minimum wage, payroll taxes are passed to employees in the form of lower pay. CBO analysis, for example, assigns the employer portion of payroll taxes as having been paid by the worker.

I think the point in this argument is that employers will no longer have to pay their portion of the employee's health insurance premium.  My employer pays 8.8% of my salary on their portion of health insurance every month, so a 6.2% tax would actually be a 30% decrease in what they're paying toward health care each month. 

It might actually help reverse the current incentive to hire two part time employees instead of one full time employee, since you'd be paying the same either way.

1326	"Obama's Peace Prize was a ridiculous award, but that doesn't mean we now need to further cheapen it. 

The Nobel Peace Prize was founded as something new and unprecedented. It has overcome any early doubts and taken up a vital role in international development and diplomacy, as the Gold Medal for ending conflicts and bringing people together. It draws people's attention to the good things that are going on in the world, and the people who work tirelessly to achieve them. 

Many laureates are not well-known figures, and the conflicts that are ended may have received little coverage. It's beneficial to shine light on achievements in areas like women's rights in Liberia and the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia. 

The prize comes with two main benefits: money and publicity. It gives a sizeable income from Nobel's legacy, and tells the world about the person and their actions. 

Trump already has money and fame. This kind of prize would bring him little benefit, compared to someone you and I have never heard of, struggling in an underdeveloped homeland. 

While he may have been at the head of actions that promoted peace, he has not made any particular conflict his life's work. 

Any US president will have some achievements during his term of office. The country has a vested interest in resolving conflicts, which it addresses through a strong military and foreign policy. Obama got a Nobel Prize, Jimmy Carter got one, even Al Gore got one - for 'environmental activism'. There's a danger that the prize might come to be seen as a sinecure for senior American politicians. 

The Nobel Peace Prize was not designed to reward powerful people for being in power. It is a donation and a badge of honour traditionally given to people who achieve peaceful outcomes not through status and wealth but through a lifetime of perseverance. Trump does not qualify.

&gt;Included in the definition of “indirect expropriation” is government action that “interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations,” according to the leaked document.

The court wasn't ruling on whether a presidential pardon makes it as if the crime never happened from a standpoint of guilt, they were ruling on whether you can punish someone for a crime they committed and then had been pardoned for. The court ruled that, if a person accepts a presidential pardon, then they cannot be punished by legislative action after accepting the pardon, as that would constitute an ex post facto law, which are prohibited by the constitution. 

Burdick v. US is congruent with this ruling, as it addresses guilt, not punishment. The Burdick ruling established that accepting a presidential pardon by necessity must constitute an admission of guilt in the eyes of the court. Additionally, the Burdick decision clarified the difference between presidential amnesty and presidential pardon. 

""There is a distinction between amnesty and pardon; the former overlooks the offense, and is usually addressed to crimes against the sovereignty of the state and political offenses, the latter remits punishment and condones infractions of the peace of the state.""

Several comments have emphasized this idea in a way that I think is important and this one is personal, clear, and frank so I’m going to award a delta here. !delta

One message I get loud and clear is that for many and perhaps most trans people, “trans women are women“ is not expected or intended to be literal in the sense of female-bodied. I also get the message that it’s painful to be pushed to discuss the topic in stark, ill-suited language that doesn‘t reflect your experience or identity. I could have emphasized more clearly in my original post that I recognize and agree with the solidarity and even the deference to personal self-knowledge implied by “transwomen are women“ in this sense. I tried to articulate this distinction, but for many people I’ve totally missed the boat on this and argued against a position that is not widely held.

Can you elaborate?


&gt; For one thing, human capital's a great predictor of wage level, and the people with the highest human capital are those who didn't earn it all but inherited it because mom or dad is a CEO at the company. 

This is largely untrue.  The vast majority of millionaires in the US is first-generational, however that is not the subject of my post, and therefore will not comment further.

&gt; We give thousands of dollars in bonuses to people in sales positions, where charisma, hard to learn and broadly heritable, matters far more than how hard you work.

Sales is not a low skilled job, even if you have natural abilities that you may use.  I'm not sure what your point is.

&gt; And you should be familiar by now with how women get paid less than men for equal work, often simply because it's men setting wage levels to begin with, which in some industries is the difference between livable and not.

Again, this is off-topic of the post.  I'm all for equality between genders/ages/etc.  If a task can be completed to the same degree of quality and timeliness, there is no need for wage-discrepancy.

&gt; I think your bootstraps argument is simply incorrect, but perhaps this thread is not the place to disabuse you of it. If you need an introductory indicator that economic value doesn't track wages as snugly you suspect, you can read good empirical research on how wages have been stagnant as productivity has increased since the mid '70s.

Humans are social creatures. Some people like the freedom to bounce around and have intimacy with many people (sexual or otherwise). People who can easily connect with many other people sometimes prefer to not be tied down by one person and their needs, and that's perfectly ok. 

But most people prefer to have one person with whom they can confide their issues with, share intimate, 1-1 experiences with, and explore each others feelings and desires.

1348	"&gt;As a rule I'm sure people believe it does indeed apply to both sexes so that the fact that it tends to be said in defence of women highlights that men are mostly the culprits.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So is it OK to objectify women or not?

It's not OK to have a whole culture in which women are regularly  treated as objects that exist for the pleasure of men, on the basis of their sex.

The problem is that Internet discourse is infamous for losing the distinction between ""this societal trend adds up to an overall negative"", and ""You said a bad thing so you are a bad person who singlehandedly made the world unjust"".

When academic gender studies types write an essay about a culture of objectifying women, the point is not that someone looked at a pair of tits once, but that there is a transparent inbalance in how men's and women's bodies tend to be treated by the public.

Which is actually not that different from what you are going for here; Observing that as a whole, women are more likely to be reduced to body parts, and men don't experience that, and that this is part of a larger imbalance where our overall viewpoint is disproportionally dominated by the perspective that priorizes common male interests.

The difference is that those academic types would NOT focus on who is individually guilty for it, but on describing the societal trends that led to it. Sociology doesn't deal with ""for some reason, women happen to regularly choose to do this and that"", or with ""men are such assholes, they keep doing such and such, just because they can"". That would just be a big fat coincidence.

1351	"It addresses the flaws, because it maintains that morals exist in and of itself, while utilitarianism only draws upon utility. The issue of your utilitarianism is: it ignores fairness and basic rights. But before you refer back to the same response, that's not all:

* What you are saying about utilitarianism in respect to the fact that ""there is always going to be a right answer whether we know it or not"" is the same concept as moral universalism in certain theories of deontology, in that there is always a morally correct answer whether we know it or not (actions are not independent from situations in moral universalism, unlike moral absolutism). It is just a question of whether or not it's moral because of utility specifically or because there is just an inherent morality including fairness and basic rights. You can really only change your view of utilitarianism if you switch the utility morality to inherent morality; otherwise you need to adopt a ""mix"" theory. So here's where the two can converge.

* The outcomes of deontology and utility are not mutually exclusive. For example, in the 1 innocent saves 10 lives, it may on the surface seem that saving the 10 gathers the most utility, but in the long run it may not be. People might panic because they now feel very unsafe, and it can cause a lot of grief. Your form of utilitarianism (Bentham's utilitarianism) is very myopic, or short-sighted. It excludes the fact that basic rights, fairness, etc. is in fact a part of the human psyche and in itself determines utility as well. 

* Following up with that, check out J.S. Mill, who supported both a form of utilitarianism but *also* individual rights and liberties and hated tyranny of majority. He believed in natural rights and therefore believed they generated the most utility in usurping the ""feelings"" of the majority. So for him, even though 1 life is ""less"" than 10 lives, it does not generate more utility if we murder the 1 for the 10 in the very long run. This is because all forms of pleasure and pain are different: murder of the one individual will cause a lot more grief than manslaughter of 10, especially under those circumstances in which the entire public can empathize with the 1 and picture themselves in that situation. He also prioritized pleasure from, say, learning, than pleasure from eating, even if a person ""feels"" the same or can't distinguish intensity of the pleasure. Bentham, on the other hand, did not distinguish between different pains and pleasure, like you are doing now (I don't think you necessarily intended to do this but based on your arguments it is implied). So in a way, Mill was both deontological and utilitarian since he believed that certain pleasures were inherently better than others, even though he proscribed himself as utilitarian.

To address your last point, you cannot really separate utilitarianism and implementation, because utilitarianism is a theory on what the right course of action is to take. What I am saying is that the implementation is inherently impossible for humans, therefore the theory is heavily flawed because it assumes an ability that humans do not have. I draw again to the comparison to communism: as a ""theory"" it seems to be the best form of government to promote the common good, but it cannot ever work due to implementation. I suppose you can say that they are untouchable if you ignore all human flaws, but considering that morals are mostly uniquely human, what is the point of saying a theory is the most ""morally just"" when the theory describes humans as something humans are not? I think utilitarianism is a theory that expects to be implemented, in any case; otherwise what is the point of making a theory that emphasizes utility? It would be an ironically useless theory of maximizing utility."	24	['is implied', 'be implemented']	2	2	0.08333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is implied', 'be implemented']	2	2	0.08333333333333333	1	26708416742	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ddpxl/_/c9pi292/	82941321	26708380101.0	2013-04-30 05:26:40		jennerality	3	False	651	0	False	True	46.2

1353	"First, antitrust law and the economics of monopoly is wicked complicated, so complicated that there at at least an entire field of economics (Industrial Organization) and two fields of law (Antitrust, and Mergers and Acquisitions) dedicated to it. Second, if by "" follow Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman"" means you're reading their popular literature, like Krugman's blogs and Friedman's TV shows, know that you're reading advocacy, not economics. As far as I know, Krugman hasn't written anything scholarly on monopoly, and the field has changed *dramatically* since Friedman was active, if he even wrote anything about monopoly. Finally, learn some fundamental economics. Seriously, at its heart, antitrust is about consumer welfare and how that's impacted by things like deadweight loss and foreclosure from markets. If you don't understand these concepts, much less how they are calculated, you aren't going to be able to understand what's going on in antitrust law.

On to your view. The fundamental thing you're missing is that antitrust is about consumer welfare. Restrictive Practices, Exclusive Dealing, Tie in Sales, Predatory pricing, largely aren't prima facia illegal, they're only illegal if they *reduce consumer welfare*. Economics is wicked complicated, so determining if something reduces consumer welfare isn't a trivial task, and different administrations will target different things. For example, look at what the [FTC has to say](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-supply-chain/exclusive-dealing-or) about exclusive dealing: "" These arrangements are judged under a rule of reason standard, which balances any procompetitive and anticompetitive effects."" 

On to your specific views:

&gt; 1.Antitrust laws reduces innovation by fining large companies for being so successful 

No, they don't. They fine companies for harming consumer welfare or actively inhibiting competition. You can derive that from your own post: None of the antitrust categories have anything to do with market share or income or size. Only activities that preclude other companies from competing in the market via means other than producing a better product at a lower price.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 2.Increasing taxes works better than regulations especially antitrust regulations because companies can innovate without being limited by regulations 

By what mechanism will taxing increase competition? Note that targeted taxation to hinder a monopolist or promote a competitor *is* regulation. This is more of a question of how is the regulation enforced than whether or not regulation is happening.

But, taxes are a fly swatter: They are not very specific. But, monopoly is wicked complicated: An activity by one company may be anti-competitive, but the exact same activity by another company may be pro-competitive. So you really want a more nuanced way of determining how to deal with behavior, which is what regulations enforced through the courts do.

There's certainly room to argue over *which* regulations and *how much* regulation. But regulation verses taxes is a non-starter.  


&gt; 3.monopoly is good even in communist state there is no competition, in communist or even socialist state the only player is Government 

I don't even know what you're talking about here. What makes monopoly good, how are you even defining ""good"" and wtf does communism have to do with anything?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 4.Contrary to popular opinion monopoly enables the economy of scale which reduces cost and increase profits 

I think you're confusing some concepts here. There are multiple sources of monopoly, ""[natural monopoly](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/natural-monopoly)"" is one type resulting from increasing returns to scale *at all output levels*, meaning one company can produce all the output to supply the entire market at the lowest cost. But that ""at all output levels"" is a hard constraint. There are economies of scale (increasing returns to scale) at all different levels, and there are very, very few cases where increasing returns to scale holds for all output levels. Utilities are an example because of the nature of physical infrastructure to large numbers of people, but they're such a common example because there are so few other examples available. 

So, no, point 4 is flat out wrong. For most products and services, diseconomies of scale set in well below the output level required to supply the whole market. This is why companies have more than one factory, for example.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 5.government don't need to own the private sector to legalize their monopoly they can increase the taxes(51% tax to gdp means even the private players are state businesses because 51% of their dividend/profit goes to Government) 

I have no idea what you're talking about here, what does government ownership of the private sector have to do with monopoly and where does total tax income as a fraction of GDP have to do with anything?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 6.Concern regarding monopolists won't innovate or will produce less output is not correct their greed has no limit they will keep innovating to satisfy their greed 

This is demonstrably false. For example, Ma Bell wasn't an innovator: You had two choices for a phone, white or black, and that was it for something like 4 decades. While they had research departments, most of that research never saw the light of day until it was copied/stolen/recreated by other companies.

Research is risky: It takes a lot of money to bring a new product to market and there are no guarantees that you will make your money back. Monopolists are in the exact situation that they do not need to take those risks. Why gamble when you already have a money printer?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 7.people focusing on antitrust laws forgetting the main problem which is tax avoidance done by these companies and the rich 

Do you have a cite on that? Most of the focus on antitrust is because monopolies create an economic deadweight loss and reduce consumer welfare.

Lots of people upset about her on Time. Let's look at that article. [https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/](https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/)

""Thunberg has no magic solution. But she has succeeded in creating a global attitudinal shift, transforming millions of vague, middle-of-the-night anxieties into a worldwide movement calling for urgent change. She has offered a moral clarion call to those who are willing to act, and hurled shame on those who are not. **She has persuaded leaders, from mayors to Presidents, to make commitments where they had previously fumbled: after she spoke to Parliament and demonstrated with the British environmental group Extinction Rebellion, the U.K. passed a law requiring that the country eliminate its carbon footprint.** She has focused the world’s attention on environmental injustices that young indigenous activists have been protesting for years. Because of her, hundreds of thousands of teenage “Gretas,” from Lebanon to Liberia, have skipped school to lead their peers in [climate strikes](https://time.com/5682404/global-climate-strike/) around the world.""

She got lucky in getting famous. That's usually how it works heh. It just kinda snowballed after skipping school one time. But she's a great face for the climate change cause, because if climate change is ignored, it affects children the most. She's also a surprisingly good speaker for a 16 year old. She also happens to be a great face for being successful as someone with Asperger's or autism.

And in case you think it's just so super easy to go around on a private yacht talking about climate change: ""So many people have made death threats against her family that she is now often protected by police when she travels."" She is making very rich and powerful people angry, but is not relenting.

1356	"Of course philosophical and moral ideas rest on some set of assumptions-- and sometimes facts.

For example, I am a vegan because I want to be treated nicely and so therefore I try to always treat others nicely, animals included.  I'm also vegan because, through science, we can clearly observe facts like animals do not want to suffer and die, as well as facts like humans do not need to eat animals in order to be healthy.  

It's not about some nebulous ""life is sacred"" thing, it's about the fact that I can see that animals suffer and die when we eat them-- but we can choose not to.  If I can reduce suffering and death without incurring any suffering on my own, why wouldn't I?  I don't need a god to tell me to do that.  In fact, most gods and religions don't care about animals at all-- the central axiom of many religions is that we are the greatest thing ever and that every other non-human on earth (and sometimes some humans, too) are pieces of shit to use as we desire.  At the end of the day, no one needs religion to be nice to their dogs, do they?

&gt;I don't think that generally people need religion to live a moral life. But I do believe that some set of assumptions, which are embodied in different religions, is necessary for a rigorous system of morality.

1360	"&gt; I'm proposing a system where the only defense is to challenge the conjecture and extent of a defendant's direct involvement to a crime. I fail to see how this state of affairs is any more dehumanizing than the current justice system.

That seems like an alternative way of saying 'innocence is not a defence' (a statement which you essentially talked yourself into needing because you're trying to erase the distinction between guilt and innocence). Also, it is more dehumanising because it treats the suspect more like a cog in the machine with no/less of a personal responsibility for personal actions, and no regard for the personality of the individual, instead treating the individual as an extension of society (rather than the society as a mere collection of individuals). It's a worldview that carries disturbing subtexts of collectivism. 

&gt; Total coherence is not a necessary feature to criminal justice, as I have shown that the current system is at least somewhat incoherent because it uses an invalid conception of culpability. So, saying my proposal can not work because it is not totally coherent is wrong.

I would argue against *reducing* coherence. I'd say the current system (especially the part dealing with 'active' crimes which require mens rea, rather the 'utilitarian concern legislation' crimes like drugs and negligence) is rather coherent, so long as you don't just assume that out of the versions of culpability/guilt/innocence conceptions you *have* to take the dualistic version.

&gt; The existence of materialist conception of culpability does not prove that it is a logically valid concept.

What's invalid about it? It's a way of building it that determines guilt and innocence through desert rather than through freedom of will. This actually solves the issue you have with the dualistic approach to culpability, but you seem to just not want to accept a non-dualistic variant of the tool that serves the same purpose / concept that fills the same niche.

Self interest and virtue seem quite at odds. 

&gt;Well positive discrimination by definition is basically seeing something that is wrong and working to try and fix it... Usually its actually seen as a good thing despite having the word discrimination in it.

Positive discrimination usually implies negative discrimination. You can't prioritise someone without deprioritising everyone else.

&gt; Because looking at and trying to fix problems within a society leads to a better quality of life for all people involved with that society. Its not really a matter of good or bad, its a mater of what are your goals to do with a society and how do you get there. Patriotism is simply one tool of a society to help its citizens be aware of the society as a whole and all the problems within it.

What I will say is that, when domestic violence groups say to ""speak up"", I don't think they are really envisioning the scenario you were in. That slogan is mainly about encouraging *victims* to have the courage to speak up, to tell their story so that the realities of domestic violence are exposed both to the authorities and to the general public, in order to open people's eyes about how commonplace and damaging it is. If you Google ""domestic violence speak up"" you mainly get first person accounts of people's experiences with violence, not encouragements to get in the middle of other people's bad situations.

I'm not saying what you did was wrong. I would like to think I would have done the same. The problem is, a third party cannot help someone who is not yet in a place where they feel comfortable to seek help. There's nothing you could have done that would have forced the woman to press charges or the man to back down. Perhaps a better way to handle the situation would have been to try to approach the wife alone and ask her if she needed help or there was anything you could do for her.

1374	"&gt;the country will always get a candidate that the country at least tolerates 

This is not necessarily true of your voting system.  For example, suppose that there are 100 candidates, C1, C2, ..., C100, and twenty groups of voters G1, G2, ..., G20.

The first group prefers C1 to C2, C2 to C3, C3 to C4, C4 to C5, C5 to C100, and C100 to all other candidates.  G1 also will tolerate C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C100, and no other candidates.  We can write this formally as G1: C1 &gt; C2 &gt; C3 &gt; C4 &gt; C5 &gt; C100 &gt; MinTolerate &gt; C6 ...

Similarly, the second group prefers C6 to C7, C7 to C8, C8 to C9, C9 to C10, C10 to C100, and C100 to all other candidates.  G2 will tolerate C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C100, and no other candidates.  We can write this as G2: C6 &gt; C7 &gt; C8 &gt; C9 &gt; C10 &gt; C100 &gt; MinTolerate &gt; ...

Suppose that we continue this pattern:

&gt; G3: C11 &gt; C12 &gt; C13 &gt; C14 &gt; C15 &gt; C100 &gt; MinTolerate &gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; G4: C16 &gt; C17 &gt; C18 &gt; C19 &gt; C20 &gt; C100 &gt; MinTolerate &gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; G19: C91 &gt; C92 &gt; C93 &gt; C94 &gt; C95 &gt; C100 &gt; MinTolerate &gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; G20: C96 &gt; C97 &gt; C98 &gt; C99 &gt; C1 &gt; C100 &gt; MinTolerate &gt; ...

Note that G20 breaks the pattern by preferring C1 to C100.  Now suppose that 5% of the population is in each group, and each individual votes rationally under your system for their five most preferred tolerable candidates (since they are barred from voting for more than five).  Then, each candidate will get 5% of the vote (from only a single group), except C1, which will receive 10% of the vote (from G1 and G20) and G100, which will receive no votes.

The system will thus result in the election of C1, who is tolerated by only 10% of the voters.  This is despite the fact that C100 is tolerated by literally 100% of voters.  So your system doesn't ensure the election of broadly tolerable candidates even when it is possible to do so."	14	['are barred', 'is tolerated', 'is tolerated']	3	3	0.21428571428571427	1	['is tolerated by', 'is tolerated by']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	['are barred']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	29381342684	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6cr9nf/_/dhww53w/	384224667	29381200631.0	2017-05-22 23:00:27		yyzjertl	9	False	378	52	False	True	77.16

As a kid I was shy and insecure, I am short so used to get beat up by bullies at school. 
When I left school I was into heavy metal, so as you get used to the appearance of your favourite bands and the people you are in contact with, I let my hair grow and wore torn jeans and leather jackets and played in a metal band.  I noticed that this had an effect on others, both attraction and intimidation, and I could use this to my advantage.  It affected how others treated me so it also affected how I treated myself to a point.  A turning point in this was when I say a friend that got into a fight in a school party, and I went in in the hopes of getting him out of there, but as I ran in the group dispersed and a guy actually backed off with his hands up as if I had been armed.  I didn't mind that reaction at all compared to a few years earlier where I was the one needing rescue.  

10 years later I had short hair again, normal clothes, but my security and confidence was already shaped up, like a muscle that you train, and you no longer need the crutches and fireworks to boost it, but to me my heavy metal years were key in shaping what I am now, a happy man.

Its more of a unified measure of well being or quality of life, that I think is practically impossible to nail down for cats humans or many other mammals. That is, quality of life seems to be a very broad summation of factors including contentedness, excitement, stress, health, social activity and on and on.

I think harness walks are very different that actual outside time, freedom and speed of movement are hugely restricted. You're simply not going into hedges or up trees or under porches like the cat would naturally. You are almost necessarily providing more dull and sterile outside time than they would on their own. Its still admirable that you harness walk your cats, I find doing that deeply embarrassing, because I'm stupid.

There are aspects of free outdoor time, which can't be recreated via harness walks, that seem essential to many cats, and this helps them develop a more independent personality. The small risks to longevity, if you are in a reasonably safe location, are easily outweighed by increased self-determination and a more natural roaming range.

1386	"I'm trans and an academic.  And also am married to an evolutionary biologist.  Though I don't specialize in this area, I've done a lot of reading, for obvious reasons.

From what I remember/understand, the physical sexual differentiation happens at around 6 weeks, and is controlled by three things.  The first is the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.  It controls the differentiation of the gonads (ovaries/testes), which either produce testosterone or not.  The other is testosterone itself, which is responsible for the differentiation of the external genitals.  The last piece is called the Müllerian Inhibitor Hormone, which is responsible for the differentiation of the rest of the reproductive plumbing between gonads and the external genitals.  We know all this with a great deal of certainty because these things sometimes go wrong--the SRY gene winds up on the X chromosome, a mutation occurs to make a person immune to testosterone, etc...  This all takes place in a relatively short window at around the sixth week of gestation.

The brain, on the other hand, does not appear to be differentiated between the sexes until much further on in natal development.  (And probably continues slowly through adulthood?)  Here the research gets a little more messy, because there's a large degree of overlap between the sexes.  Think if it like two overlapping bell curves--there's definitely a difference in the distribution and the averages, but there's still a big area of overlap the relationship between two randomly selected individuals may be the opposite of what the average is.  In these studies, certain regions of transsexuals' brains on average are closer to their perceived gender, rather than their birth sex (i.e., phenotypic sex at birth).  The most notable is a specific area of the brain that (1) we know is strongly related to sexual behavior in rats, and (2) where there is a very large average difference, and the transsexuals are much closer to their.  

Again, we're fairly confident of these differences exist, even if we don't understand exactly how the brain works, because we've done these measurements with either dissection or MRI, and the effect size is sufficiently large that even with relatively small sample sizes (0.1% of the population, so it's not easy to recruit large numbers of participants) so that it's very unlikely the results are due to random chance.  IIRC, this study was with trans people who never actually transitioned, so the results weren't due to changes to the brain that take place as a result of the hormone therapy we take.  That makes changes too.

My pet theory is that there's just tons of little things that can influence transsexualism, and they're mostly randomly distributed.  Adding up all these little differences produces a bell curve, just like rolling a pair of dice.  You're going to roll 7s, 6s, and 8s a lot more than you're going to roll 2s and 12s, but the 2s and 12s are still going to happen.  Based on twins studies, we're fairly confident that a big part of this is caused by genetics, but genes do not operate in a vacuum. Perhaps there's something in the mother's own hormonal balance, depending on diet or other things in the environment.  Perhaps some is related to the number of older relatives--this seems to matter for sexual orientation...  Perhaps some of it is a partial insensitivity to testosterone.  Perhaps environmental exposure to xenoestrogens has a small impact.  Perhaps sometimes the fetal gonads release lots of testosterone during weeks 6-8, but then release less on average for the rest of the pregnancy.  Etc, etc, etc...  There are SO many thing that could potentially be important that it's almost impossible to figure out all the individual details.

1389	"Once a child is adopted you are the legal guardian/legal parent, yes.

But it's not necessarily easy to adopt children. So if you are fostering to adopt, as mentioned, it may or may not go through and there is the possibility of losing your child. Worse, you could lose your child to a family you are afraid won't properly care for them (their biological family) and be helpless.

If you are looking to adopt a baby to raise from infancy, unless there are obvious special need or medical needs (severe enough to tell at birth), they don't need a family. There's a long line of families waiting for babies so it's not some special generous act to take one in compared to being a parent in general (which one could argue is a special and giving thing). One could even argue it's ""less"" generous to ""take"" a baby from an infertile or gay couple when you can ""make your own"". 

Yes, there are older children who need adoption. But often (not always) they are harder to care for properly then a child you raised yourself from infancy and doesn't have any past traumas, attachment issues, ect. There is a lot of research that shows just how a child is treated in the first year of their life has an impact on their relationships and behavior as an older child, teenager, and even adult. And as was so eloquently put on an episode of Law and Order ""a child is not a refrigerator, you can't just return it if it's broken"". So you should go into adoption of an older child knowing they may have understandable emotional, attachment, or mental health issues from their past that led up to needing adoption and if you feel willing and capable to tackle those with lots of love and patience (and time and money can sadly be factors).

Finally, I'd consider whether it is a bad selfish act to raise a reasonable number of kind socially conscious children who will help make the world a better place. Don't we need people to do that? If only the selfish jerks have kids won't we have a problem? There is a quote ""We talk so much about leaving a better planet to our kids, that we forget to leave better kids to our planet"". For example both my parents are socially conscious and charitable environmentalists. They had two children (just enough to replace themselves) and tired very hard to raise us to be good world citizens and kind and helpful to others. (Plus thoughtful and well informed.) Did they just have and raise children to be nice to other people? No, of course not. But is the world a worse place every time someone has a child no matter how they raise them? Or should be hoping social environmentally minded people have and raise kids who feel they have a duty to help turn our world around?"	22	"['is adopted', 'is treated', 'was so eloquently put', ""'s broken""]"	4	3	0.13636363636363635	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['is adopted', 'is treated', 'was so eloquently put', ""'s broken""]"	4	3	0.13636363636363635	1	35098025477	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/iovcam/_/g4gghs5/	1130164222	35097567232.0	2020-09-08 13:56:16	18250791.0	TheHatOnTheCat	61	False	491	0	False	True	66.78
1390	"&gt; How much of the way we live today, do you think, can be preserved in future adaptations.

That's very difficult to say.  Transportation is a large chunk of our carbon emissions, but the spread-out nature of our society means that it's necessary for most people, and even mass transit isn't a huge carbon savings.  It's not so much a matter of entirely giving up common luxuries (because let's be honest, we're not going to do that, or we would have by now), but rather finding replacements for them that consumers don't view as a ""sacrifice"".  

That means finding ways, for example, to make green energy cheaper, so that we don't HAVE to convince anyone to do it.  If an electric car is going to save you thousands of dollars, no one will need to convince you that it's the right thing to do.  If companies can find ways to package food in more environmentally-friendly packaging that doesn't cost a ton or let your food spoil, then plastics will naturally fall by the wayside as well.  

&gt; Lastly, who's a more difficult crowd to address, deniers or sad ""hopeless"" believers?

Deniers, no question.  The problem is that for nearly all that I have met (on both sides), this is more an issue of politics than it is of science.  Those that have decided the climate is not changing have already made up their minds, and confirmation bias means that they tend to place heavy weight only on information that seems to confirm what they already think.  In other words, if a study comes out that shows the planet warmed super-fast during the 2000s, they'll dismiss that, or try to find some reason why it's flawed, but if another study says that it warmed much LESS than we thought, then they'll immediately latch onto it as ""proof"" that it's all a sham."	11	['can be preserved']	1	1	0.09090909090909091	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['can be preserved']	1	1	0.09090909090909091	1	28660563019	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4vn902/_/d5zrbyj/	295017554	28660551052.0	2016-08-01 13:28:10		scottevil110	4	False	311	2	False	True	62.11
1391	"The most evil people spew venom in public with their identities disguised. The KKK did it in the 1930s by wearing hoods, and the Alt-Right does it now by posting anonymously online. If a KKK member's hood falls off, it's ok to tell people you saw them burning a cross. If that's ok, why is any different to dox them online? The US gives people the right to free speech. It doesn't give you a right to anonymous speech in public. Privacy laws protect you in your own home, but it doesn't protect you when you are interacting with others in public, even online. The same applies to so called counter protesters. If you believe what you say is right, you should do it in public.

Note that doxing is acceptable. But the common vigilante response to it is unacceptable. So it's acceptable to dox neo-Nazis, Antifa protestors, or whoever else if they act in public. But it's not ok to threaten them, hurt them, or do anything else that is otherwise illegal. It is ok to stop associating with them though.

For example, in Minneapolis there was a successful bar called Club Jager. It was owned by a closeted white supremacist named Julius DeRoma. A newspaper found out that he had donated $500 to David Duke (the former Grand Wizard of the KKK). They doxed the bar owner by publishing this information. I believe this form of doxing is completely acceptable.

As a result, all of his employees quit. All the scheduled performers canceled their shows. His regular customers refused to return. Together, this led to the bar going out of business. Some people called him a Nazi.

I believe these are all completely acceptable responses. The workers had a right to quit, the performers had a right not to perform, and the customers are free to take their business elsewhere. The First Amendment protects one's right to free speech, which includes calling someone a Nazi.

The only response that was unacceptable was that someone spit on him in the street. It's illegal to spit on someone. It constitutes a form of battery. No one physically threatened him, but that would constitute assault and would also be illegal. If someone hit him or did anything else, it would also be battery. These are illegal. But it's not illegal to do something legal just because someone else might do something illegal because of it.

1396	"I've helped the police train in school shooter scenarios where I played the shooter and we used milsim guns with bullet shaped paintballs fired by real guns.

Believe me when I say you would have tunnel vision, extreme shaking, and difficulty with rational thought before you even fired the first bullet. 

Good luck managing to reload a pistol like that, I definitely couldn't do it.

In order to do something like that you'd not only need the right mindset, but also significant training and experience, and even then you would have issues. 

I'm in the very unique situation of being a normal civilian who has experienced what it would be like to commit a shooting, so let me take a couple of minutes to explain to you how I felt and what being in a situation like that is like. This post is going to be about the first time I ever did it, but I can assure you even after I'd done it before I did not fare much better.

First off let me lay out the scenario we were playing so you can get an idea of how little it took to seriously fuck me up on adrenaline.

We were in an elementary school over spring break, and there was a group of about 20 officers and 15 high schoolers including me. We were using milsim paintball rounds in real guns, the officers were using glocks and m16s and I was using a revolver. All real guns, but modified for the milsim. 

In the scenario I played the shooter the police were at the school responding and I had a specific corner I was shooting from, then I was to retreat to another point where a proctor with a starter pistol would simulate my suicide and I was to lay on the ground.

So I'm sitting there with a bunch of my friends, and a bunch of officers who were all very friendly and glad to have us helping out. That should make it easier right? Doesn't matter. By the time I was given the call to take my position as the shooter my hands were shaking and my vision was limited to a small circle in front of me. Then the kids around me start screaming and running, and my mind goes blank except for what little I can recall of my instructions. I couldn't even steady the revolver to see through the sights, and as soon as I saw the officers I basically hugged the wall and blindly fired down the hallway. After what I had assumed were all 6 shots (actually only 4, hard to count when you're fucked up on adrenaline) I ran back to my predesignated point and assumed my ""suicide position"" on the ground.

Then the officers came, and since the gun had slid away when I ""killed myself"" they assumed I was an injured student and commanded me to get up so they could evac me. I, a dead body, stood the fuck up and did whatever they said. I couldn't think for myself and was in abject terror. 

It took me probably 20 minutes to calm down enough that I could see and think clearly. Obviously it wasn't a traumatic experience, it was actually rather fun, but in the moment I was barely capable of doing anything.

For reference I had fired real guns at a range before, and we had played through several other identical scenarios with other shooters. I had already experienced what was going to happen roughly, and I knew it was all just a simulation and I was in no danger or trouble. If anything the situation was less intense than it would be for a real shooter. As an extra, I played damn near every violent video game I could get my hands on. Didn't prepare me for shit.

Point is, this kind of thing happens even to trained soldiers. When the human body is exposed to a certain level of stress it undergoes very severe changes which dramatically reduce your cognitive abilities and dexterity.

Shooting in an enclosed, chaotic space would not be the way to do it. You could probably have ~5 minutes before police responded, but in that time you would absolutely not be fully functioning. You'd have trouble walking, aiming your gun, and reloading. 

As weird and terrible as it sounds to say, I think the Vegas shooter had a much better plan. Firing at a distance from a familiar and secure location is going to keep you lucid for much longer and removes the potential for anyone stopping you until the police identify where you are and breach the room.

But your plan for a shooting on a subway train? Not going to happen like you think. That level of chaos overwhelms the brain very quickly and it's going to render you nearly useless very quickly. Especially in the dark. Take it from me, in that moment of waiting to open fire I could not have hit a running person at 10 feet away with my gun. I couldn't have reloaded a magazine. I could barely do anything but run away."	44	"['was given', 'was limited', ""'re fucked"", 'is exposed']"	4	3	0.06818181818181818	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['was given', 'was limited', ""'re fucked"", 'is exposed']"	4	3	0.06818181818181818	1	29754487346	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/751bj5/_/do31xde/	431722913	29754330441.0	2017-10-08 15:05:28		Urbanscuba	304	False	861	0	False	True	67.08

Firstly, it can be a platform to spread your own arguments to other people. You might be able to convince a reader who was previously on the fence, or at least give them something to think about.

Secondly, it's good for testing your own views. If you have a hole in your argument, debating someone can be a good way to expose that hole. You can strengthen your own argument by doing further research, or you may even concede that point, and modify your view accordingly; both of which are good outcomes.

I was speaking hypothetically.  We don't know what the second plan was because there wasn't a need for one.  The first plan worked.

&gt; I would say that he was destined to have a stuck up mentor who wouldn't look at the already effectively dead city and manage the situation. It seems that was one of the many pieces that led to Arthas being baited to Northrend. 

That may be, but that just goes further to show that it isn't Uther's fault.  If Arthas was always destined to be taught by a bad mentor (a sentiment I disagree with but am willing to concede for the sake of argument), Uther could have been replaced by literally any other person, and the result would have been the same.

Besides, it was Arthas himself that decided to go to Northrend and meet his destiny.  Or, he was bound to head there regardless of the circumstance.  Either way, Uther's actions had no bearing on it.  You're faulting Uther for something he literally could not control.

&gt; Any mentor wise enough to be teaching the prince would have seen right through the trap. Perhaps if Arthas was led to believe it was a trap instead of cowardice, he wouldn't have gone.

You really think anyone would have known it was a trap? I don't see how you're reaching this conclusion.

1410	"I’m Indian-American.

1. You might want to research Gandhi a little more before grouping him as a “good” person from Indian lmao. The man was racist and horrifically misogynistic.
2. I’m not familiar as much with other religions in India, but Hindus make up about 70% of the population. While there are many Hindus who have misconstrued the ancient teachings of Hinduism, the religion literally teaches its practitioners to treat women like god. They have entire prayers dedicated to women.
3. A lot of the misogynistic culture from india is also common all across Asia. I currently live in Korea, and while the problems may not be to as big of an extent (ie gang r*pes), most Asian cultures have huge issues with misogyny. In fact, the Korean GP just elected their future president, a man who has openly stated that he wishes to end gender equality and inclusion in Korea.
4. What’s your definition of selfishness? Because compared to the average Western country, the average Indian consumes significantly less than anyone from the west (particularly Americans). 
5. My Indian friends and family are some of the most welcoming, open people I’ve ever met. I have several non-Indian friends who have traveled to India who have expressed a deep love for the country and the people there.
6. A lot of the discussions on misogyny and r*pe in India are overrepresented in Western media. It’s kind of strange to me to single out India when there are many countries in the surrounding region where women are literally (by law) declared unequal to men. 

I would also like to add that you aren’t “uncomfortably close to being racist”. Having distaste for an entire culture (which by the way is one of the most diverse countries in the world) is racism, straight up.
I would also like to point out that unlike MANY countries around the world (America included), india actually has had prime ministers and lawmakers of varied religions AND genders. Can the same be said about America? (The answer is no).

1412	"First, ""worst thing"" is extreme. Is a new production, even one in a different canon, worse than having the franchise cancelled? Worse than nothing happening, possibly slowly slipping from memory and relevance? Worse than *Infinities*?

Star Wars and Star Trek are similarly going through reboots. It allows new creative teams to work unconstrained by some random plot point someone else laid out years or decades before. This can be refreshing, allowing a reexamination of core concepts and see what direction they can be taken.

Perhaps more importantly, it can bring in a new audience. Stepping into late SG-1, Atlantis, or Universe without a deep previous knowledge of the show would be mystifying. It had long since gone from a show about humans taking first steps into the universe on the planet-of-the-week to one where humanity had alien-tech spaceships, intergalactic gate freeways, and an ever more complex web of allies and foes based in a literal decade of previous fiction. While for fans that can be awesome, it isn't something you can easily bring new people into, which does not bode well for the healthy future of a franchise.

1418	"Let me put it this way. 

How many feminist charities have donators that would be okay with spending those donations on the creation of battered men's shelters? I'd imagine that, while many of them agree abused men should be helped, they are donating to that feminist charity specifically to hell their women peers. 

So we need men's charities where people donate specifically to create battered men's shelters and provide pro-bono lawyers to help poor men from receiving harsher sentences for crimes than their female counterparts. Because, like I've said, feminsim as a whole will agree these are problems, but the feminist activists who've mobilized won't prioritize those issues. 

&gt; I see what you are getting at but rather than create a new ""men's rights"" or ""masculinist"" movement wouldn't it be more beneficial to ally behind the same cause of gender equality? Doing so would also help to bridge the gaps between genders. Rather than Women's shelters we could have abuse shelters for all abused people. They would have access to the same resources, greatly enhanced by the cooperation of a larger number of advocates.

This is literally the argument for rebranding feminism to humanism/egalitarianism. 

Rather than focus on ""feminism"" or ""women's rights movements""  wouldn't it be more beneficial to ally behind the same cause of gender equality? Doing so would help bridge the gap between genders. Rather than women's movements like feminism we could have humanity movements like humanism for all human people. 

I don't believe the argument above, I'm merely trying to illustrate that the argument you use against men's movements is the same thing they use against feminism movements. The arguments you use to defend feminism are used by men to defend men's rights. 

You're not applying your arguments equally.

Edit: one last thing. The reason we can't just have ""abused people centers"" is because when someone is abused by the opposite gender, part of their treatment is to remove that threat until a medical professional can help them through the traumatic experience.

1421	"&gt;But ""mutant"" is not the same as ""malfunction.""

When I write malfunction in this post I mean essentially mutation. An accident that wasn't caused by adaptation. I didn't mean any other connotation.

&gt;Might as well say that having red hair is a malfunction of the genetic template that would otherwise (if there was no malfunction) map to the normal brunette patterns. 

Yeah, this is basically what I'm saying. Red hair is a mutation. It is perfectly acceptable and tolerable and can even be desirable, but is still a mutation. Everyone will admit this and it serves no purpose to try to convince people that it is normal.  
In the same vein, homosexuality is a mutation. It is perfectly acceptable and tolerable and can even be desirable, but is still a mutation. Why try to convince people that it is ""normal""? It's not the same as being a candidate for brunette, but then getting the blonde recessive gene. It's not the same as being a candiadate for being short, but then being shorter than you would expect based on your parents. It's not encoded for in your genes, it's just a mutation. I mean, homosexuality is just fine and all, and no one should interfere, but why endorse it as if somehow beneficial or special in some way? In society's terms it's perfectly equal to heterosexuality, and certainly should be treated with the same respect. But, you'd be just just as well off if your genes happened to not mutate. Right?

Here's one thing I'm confused on: once the mutation happens, is it then encoded into a gene or trait that can be passed on, or is a one-off event that is caused purely by environmental forces or random occurrence? If it is encoded and passed on then maybe it really is no different than being tall or short, or blonde or brunette.

&gt;Organic food production has a lower output per production unit.

But a higher yield per area unit(m^2). 

The benefits of organic ag can really be seen when it's embedded in an ecosystem. Then you can leverage synergies and essentially do what modern techno mecha ag does with less work, less energy, less death, and more long-term viability. 

It takes more thought to plan an embeded (permaculture/sustainable) food production operation, and the operations and outputs are merely human scale, not like today's ag, but that's where you find its beauty. It's human.


Acomparison,
Sustainabke organic ag is More efficient per unit of area and per btu, but less efficient per unit of man-hours. It produces less food in more time, but, regenerative, it can neutralize or reverse entropy therefore maintain virtually an infinite number of cycles. Not like today's ag, that uses huge machines, standardization and simplification, that is efficient per unit of time, but wastes lots of space and energy, to the contrary of sustainable ag it can produce a lot of food really quickly with little human effort, but it cant maintain the rhythm for long before the system collapses from exhaustion.

One may say that organic seems reactionary, and perhaps it is just as every generation repels what was in order to become something new, but the change is deeper, rooted in our new technologies and scientific advances.

We are dealing with a shift in atitudes guided by a shift in the nature of work. we arent industrialists anymore, no need to give a materialist (marx) examples to prove that. we are something else. sustainable organic ag, more specifically ag that integrates with nature seems less advanced, even a regression, but don't be fooled by appearances. Soil science, microecology, ecology, system's and networking theory have come a long way. It integrates these advances, and offers us the space to utilize our new tech and our new ideas to live in a new, perhaps slightly better adjusted way, just ,like industrialism afforded all of those new wonderdul changes to the generations prior. 

So no, it's not a trend, and it's surely not dangerous.  It's part of that new thing that we are becoming. Internet and connectivity helped guide us toward a new paradigm, away from standardized industrial labor.away from simplification and big, toward smaller, flexible, more efficient. This is not merely a trend, We are dealing with a change in paradigm.

1429	"&gt; There are many gay employees in the workplace, but also a transgender. All of those employees have a limited time during meetings to try to promote their rights. Ideally, they would work together and find a solution that fits everyone. But what I see is each group (gay and trans) are only promoting THEIR agenda, making the whole process more confusing and time-expensive than it need to be.

So this is the problem. You are trying to dictate how different groups of people should act. You are arbitrarily trying to force, different groups of people to take up the mantle of watered down movement. Instead of the movements specific to their problems. This is a common tactic used to de-legitimaze a movement.

Black lives matter? - All lives matter.

&gt;think if there was only one queer employee of a relatively uncommon orientation such as, say, gender-fluid. If they try to organize their movement from the ground up, raising awareness, tolerance and asking for change, it will take a lot of time. It would be a lot easier if they chose to ""fade into"" a generic LGBTQ+ stance that's already known and accepted.

Again, this is the problem. You want people to fade into obscurity, to just keep quiet and be complient to the current status quo we all know. We wouldn't want people to get too much power?

&gt;I'm not saying queer folk should ""go talk somewhere else"". I'm just saying they should talk together in one strong voice, not many discordant weak ones.

So the problem with real world is that it's counter intuitive. Just because you grab a bunch of sticks, making an epic speech about how unity is better than being alone. Doesn't make it work in real life. Historically the only movements that got shit done, were inconvenient, discordant, upsetting and often even violent. The fact that it pisses you off, is the point.

My problem with BR and to an extent poker isn't the presence of randomness in the first place, it's that there's too much of it for me to consider it to be competitive in nature.

1437	"You're kind of all over the place on this, where I think it depends on the product category. 

So with old cars, especially GMs (the company that invented planned obsolescence), a big part of that was that it was easier to just make shitty cars. Once the Japanese automakers ascended, they couldn't do that anymore.

With household appliances, they used to make them bulletproof (See, e.g. how bored the Maytag man was), but now they push features over reliability. This shows that planned obsolescence is increasing in this field over 70s fridges that still run well (albeit inefficiently).

With PCs, they hit market saturation a while ago. You can tinker and play the edges to make it work well for a while. There's also not gonna be much of a market for slightly better performance. What is there a sale in? Longevity. This field is a little more complicated, but has essentially come to where the previous two are.

Where does planned obsolescence thrive? Cell phones and tablets. They're never markets and pretty much depend on a 1 to 2 year replacement cycle, due both to the advances made in tech and how beat up they get. Apple had very explicit planned obsolescence with its products, all but bricking older ones with their updates. My guess is this sector will ossify like PCs and end up with makers competing on longevity, like other markets.

TL:DR: it depends on the product segment."	15	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	33866044210	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fg7493/_/fk2yuya/	934198599		2020-03-10 01:56:47	303203943699.0	HippyKiller925	6	False	241	0	False	True	73.98
1438	"&gt; A civilian wearing a uniform may not necessarily be trying to receive a specific tangible benefit ... but they are likely doing so out of the possibility of reaping some sort of non-specific or intangible benefit 

But that does not fit the definition for what Stolen Valor is. Legally this is not Stolen Valor so we cannot use that term to describe a person like that. The definition does not include a feeling that people might get from pretending to be in the military. 

&gt; Vets get pissed at that because they had to work hard and often risk their lives to get those benefits

I completely understand this, but I think maybe a more appropriate reaction would be to not immediately grab for a phone to publicly embarrass the person and instead explain to them nicely how you feel and ask them to consider that in the future. Some of the videos I have seen have vets berating old men at a funeral or bullying kids to take off their clothes just for wearing a uniform in public. 

&gt; you may not care as a civilian about Stolen Valor

I do care about Stolen Valor. I tried to make it very clear in the post that the line in the sand is drawn as soon as the civilian attempts to obtain something tangible from the lie. This is where the law has actually been broken and where I have a problem. As of now, I still do not have a problem with a civilian wearing the uniform, while not breaking the law.

&gt;I think that you should at least respect that it's a legitimate thing for others to feel passionately about.

I do respect that people are passionate about this--I made that very clear in the post as well. My point is that I think it's important to understand what Stolen Valor is, and not water down the term by accusing people who haven't actually broken the law. Most videos on YouTube with the title ""Stolen Valor"" do not even qualify

1439	"&gt; Cognitivist error theory, which seems closer to your position, holds that moral claims have a meaning that can be true or false, and they are all false.

How do you arrive at ""moral claims are false"" from my post? I don't understand. I think they are true or false depending on the framework you start with.

&gt;But what I'd really call your position is just moral anti-realism, the position that there are no objective moral facts for moral claims to be true (or false) with respect to. Note that you might still say moral claims are true or false, but with reference to a coherence or pragmatist or some other theory of truth than correspondence.

Yeah this sounds like what I'm saying.

But note that if someone wanted to define morality in a certain way and it was consistent, I would have no problem using that language and talking about ""should"" and ""ought"" with them. I just may feel no compulsion to do it just because I agree with them that it ""ought"" to be done.

&gt;but you need to decide whether you want to therefore say that ""all moral claims are false"" (making you a cognitivist error theorist: moral claims are about putative moral facts, but there aren't any, so they're false), or say ""some moral claims are nonetheless true"", in which case you owe a theory of truth that can make sense of this.

1448	"If they themselves found it sexual and did so anyways, I'd say yes. But it is a gray area.

Let me give another scenario here which may demonstrate that an understanding of others' perceptions can indicate fault when someone else decides to disrespect those perceptions.


Imagine you are in a group of 5 friends and learn that 2 of them have had nightmares involving teddy bears for some reason. This has lead to them both being uncomfortable in the presence of teddy bears.


.


Now let's think about 3 scenarios.

1. You enjoy holding teddy bears and decide to ignore your friend's uncomfortable dispositions towards them. It seems irrational anyways. You bring one the next time everyone is together for your own enjoyment and no regard for your friends.


2. You decide that you want to evoke that uncomfortability in your friends and bring a teddy bear the next time you meet because you enjoy the thought of getting a reaction out of them.


3. You believe that your friends' fears of teddy bears are unjustified and know that your third friend would be bringing their own teddy bear if it wasn't for them also having to respect this irrational phobia of the first 2. You decide to bring a teddy bear the next time you meet up because you believe it will help normalize it and eventually dispell the phobia.

.

I believe that scenario 1 is kind of bad, 2 is definitely bad, and 3 is murky at best. And all are about the perception of others and what you do with your knowledge of that perception.


In this scenario, it's also true that the fear of teddy bears may not be justifiable or even very understandable. But what about when it is understandable? Does the situation change if someone was once attacked by dogs and now has a very understandable phobia of dogs?

1454	"I'm a first year educator in California and I make $62k a year (I live in a low cost of living area, 62k is comfortable by myself and borders luxury when considering my SO will be making as much when she finishes school.) When I finish my master's this spring I will jump to 74k next year with a cap of 116k after 18 years.

While I'm not going to spit in the face of making more money there are 2 simple reasons that veterans make more in this case (and to be clear I'm pretty anti-military at this point just based on my friends experiences while serving) 

1.)Military service is a persistent upheaval if you want to progress your career. Education is not. My friend just finished getting retrained to stay relevant in the air force and he spent 7 months in a hotel in a different state from his wife and newborn. No teacher in the United States has to do such things.

2.) Teaching has its stressors for sure. But in terms of career level work it's the easiest job I've ever had. Not having a supervisor on my ass every day has been fantastic for my mental health. Finally, and most importantly *teachers work literally half the year, and less than half the year by the time you consider personal and paid sick leave.* Now, this might be an inter-state disparity. You might not have that sick time.  but between my 185 Duty days and sick and personal I really only have to work 172 days a year. 

IF you factor in the half working year, and doubled the salary thusly, teachers ARE paid suitably. if I made 124k and worked double the amount I would be pretty satisfied with that. Also in California at least, you can give up some of those factors of ease and increase your pay substantially. Were I to work summer school my pay would go from 62k to 69k. Were I to give up my daily prep period, I'd make 10% of my current years salary for taking on 1 extra class of students.

Again I recognize this is going to differ depending on where you're at, but a lot of teachers do have a perpetual victim complex. I'm not deaf to that, I get some of it as a teacher myself. but I truly think that the average educator in the United States right now is a silver spoon college kid who never had to work hard growing up and that is heavily influencing the cultural and work ethic towards teaching. 

You definitely highlight a lot of challenges, but I do think you're capturing all the downsides of teaching in your post without recognizing the upsides of it."	23	['getting retrained', 'ARE paid']	2	2	0.08695652173913043	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['getting retrained', 'ARE paid']	2	2	0.08695652173913043	1	43998021360	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mtqet/_/k7naak0/	2638384373		2023-11-03 11:17:02	81672675390.0	erutan_of_selur	26	False	459	0	False	True	68.1

THIS is why we need an independent pro wrestling based organization that truly understands the spectacle. Fake blood in wrestling is a myth. What is the true difference in harm between being ""Busted open the hard way"" (bleeding from an injury caused by others) vs. ""blading""? 

For the wrestler it can be the difference between a concussion and a paper cut. 

&gt;After all, someone has to clean up all that blood after the match is over. Seems like a simpler law than mandating biohazard teams after each competition. If wrestlers want to stage something, can't they use stage blood?

Lets compare it to hockey again, who has to clean up the blood on the ice? it is getting mad at wrestling for being wrestlng. If a hockey player knocked out his own tooth with a stick it would be acceptable. (stupid, but acceptable). As you said, it doens't say not to bleed, it just picks on the way wrestlers choose to bleed.

What does that even mean? Your life has been artificially extended since the moment you were born, doctors and nurses looked after your birth in a controlled and clean environment. 

Just by doing that your chances of surviving are way better than the natural rates for humans.

Besides that, think of all the vaccinations, the clean water and food, the medical treatments (people used to die from apendicitis or broken bones), etc.

1458	"&gt; On it's own harmless, unless you try to legislate that I recognize it (e.g. that bill in Canada), but still, pointless. 

It's not pointless. Most civilized countries allow freedom. People should be free to act as any gender they want. It's none of my business, and it doesn't affect me in any way. People should be free to act any way they want, period - unless it infringes on my rights somehow.

&gt; I also study neurological differences, measures of cognitive control, and other areas and we see a lot of sex differences ...

So you should know better. You should know that some people's brains are weird, and don't fit the norm, right? Some people have brains that are more similar to people of the opposite gender/sex.

&gt; what difference does it make - why does that need a new gender label?

Why not? If there's white people, and black people, and mixed people... why should mixed people be forced to choose between being white or black? Why is it so difficult for people to allow them to just be ""mixed"" and leave it at that? What if Indians arrived... would they be white or black? Should they be compelled to choose one or the other? What if Asians started arriving? What's wrong with people identifying with whatever culture/ethnicity and gender they want? 

If there's clearly a spectrum of behaviours (and ethinicities, for example), why would we force or encourage only 2 categories? How can you rationally or logically justify that?

&gt; If I add a new word to English, lets call it, schwizerbook, and I say that English + schwizerbook = a new language I'll call Huboo, does that make any sense?

You could create your own new language, sure. Other people might not use it, or even acknowledge it, but by definition, you DID just create a new language. That's a fact and not something up for opinion.

Sure, most people speak English or Spanish or French, for example... but some people speak strange and rare languages. We *don't deny their existence, do we?*

1470	"Several things:

&gt;fairness is only a secondary consideration compared to viewership and audience excitement

I think this is a subjective claim, and I don't think anybody would necessarily consider it true all the time. For example, even if two competitors have the largest viewer bases, and a matchup between the two would almost certainly be the most exciting for the audience, I think that very few people would agree that the tournament should be rigged so that those teams make the final (Even if this rigging was completely undetectable, so as not to ruin the excitement).

&gt;A single GFs is generally more hype

Possibly. I think a single winner-take-all match is more hype than any single match in a multi-match series, but I'm not convinced it's more hype than the series as a whole. For example, there have been some **incredible** ""Best of X"" series in various pro sports, and I don't think changing the playoff format to exclusively ""Best of 1"" would make the playoff more hype as a whole.

Once again, it's possible. However, ""Best of X"" series don't have a fixed number of matches either, and they are extremely prevalent in professional sports. I don't think that a series that may be 1 or 2 matches is going to be relatively difficult to schedule.

1471	"&gt; I'm actually somewhat convinced that the jargon itself is already deliberately deceiving. I mean usually when you adopt a colloquial term into the jargon of a certain discipline it's because you want to create a relation and ease the understanding, by building upon already established mental images. 
 
Not really. This happens all the time - a mathematician coins a term because it sounds cool, or they see *some* similarity between a real-world thing and some abstract concept they're trying to study - but often it differs from the colloquial definition in fundamental ways. For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics). But that's no problem for the mathematical community, because these concepts also come with very dry, objective, math-y definitions, so there's no ambiguity. The everyday word is just a shorthand for some specific mathematical definition.
 
I just keep getting the impression that you're assuming they have some agenda, or are trying to claim something, which they are in fact not. You can criticise the way things are explained, but when you talk about them being hubristic or deliberately deceiving, you're ascribing intent to them which I don't think is fair. You're getting too hung up on the word, and taking it personally.
 
&gt; Then the only way in which you can act rational w.r.t. this definition, is to act in the way that THEY perceive is in YOUR self interest. Tell me how this is not hubristic and/or deliberately deceiving.
 
and
 
&gt; To be fair I'm still somewhat under the impression that the spiralling downwards for example is itself a cognitive bias in which you assume the other player to be competitive which is an assumption that is not logically self-evident. It can make sense to make that assumption but it's just that, an assumption. To claim it to be ""rational"" and the only thing that is in ""the self-interest of the agent"" is hubristic.
 
They don't ""claim"" such behaviour to be rational, so much as *define* it to be rational, and then study what the consequences of that are.
 
If this was a case of mathemeticians setting themselves the challenge of figuring out how best to play the game in practice, you'd be right that they couldn't make such an assumption about how the other players will behave.
 
But that's not what's happening. The mathemeticians are setting themselves the challenge of figuring out what happens when *""rational agents"", defined in some very specific mathematical way*, play this game. It's not hubristic to include assumptions about how these agents behave, because the behaviour and priorities of these agents are literally defined ahead of time, and baked into the definition of the very problem they're trying to solve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium#Formal_definition
 
They're not trying to ""win the game"", they're trying to characterise/analyse how agents of a particular type would play the game.
 
&gt; What they consider rational is unhelpful. It's literally among the worst possible outcomes of that particular scenario on top of being unrealistic, isn't it?
 
That's a separate issue. It's well-defined mathematically, and that's all that's required for a mathematician to be able to sink their teeth into studying it.

There is only one right answer to how the executive branch is supposed to work. 

Besides, even if they don't, you are essentially eliminating a massive part of society. Politicians appeal to their voters. If no uneducated people are voters that does two things. 

1. It makes people easily able to draw a strict line defining who is and isn't educated, and create prejudices based on that.

2. Eliminates the need for politicians to care about these demographics. 

With the moral gain of helping uneducated people and the political gain of helping uneducated people eliminated, that could have catastrophic effects. What if politicians want to force all ""uneducated""people into hard labor camps? Uneducated people can't vote against it and ""educated"" people don't care because they see ""uneducated"" people as worthless members of society.

Sure this is a bit of a stretch, but it's not too far off with what you are proposing.

1484	"Your first point is more theory than anything else. Sure there may be an unfortunate trend of bullies not learning to respect their fellow humans' differences but what gay kid is going to care about the social education of their bullies when they have the option of taking themselves out of the situation entirely? 

Yeah this could result over time in a negative trend but on an individual level do you think someone who is being tormented because of who they are is going to care about this? Do you think they should? Why? Not everyone needs to be a martyr for the cause. Also keep in mind there are some gay kids who will opt not to go to these schools.

I don't really get what you're trying to say with your second point. It will be unfortunate if a closeted gay person can't work up the courage to tell their secret to their parents so they can go to a school they want to go to, yes. Does this mean we should scrap the idea and forget about all the out kids who would thrive in such an environment.

Your third point has merit but still doesn't explain why having a school like this is a bad idea. There will always be bullies, but a big reason behind the negative attitudes felt by people who are bullied has a lot to do with not having a support network or someone else to relate to. When there's a gay kid at a predominately straight school with 30 kids calling him names and no one to run to for support then yeah it's easy to see why they'd be overwhelmed. When there's a bully at a gay school telling a girl she's too butch, but she has 30 friends she can fall back on who will tell her that the other girl is full of shit, I think you can tell the difference."	14	['is being tormented', 'are bullied']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is being tormented', 'are bullied']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	27574737158	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2tpl0x/_/co1abd2/	170834865		2015-01-26 13:06:34		vl99	3	False	323	0	False	True	71.68
1485	"I'd have to go do a ton of data digging to present as well argued an argument as the one you put forward, but at the moment my counter theory is that belief in a religion provides a ready made support network/community (IE all the people you go to church with) that atheism does not (IE you have to make an outside effort to track down other atheists and arrange events to hang out with them) so what we're seeing is the correlation of human social interconnectivity with mental health, rather than the act of being spiritual itself.

To get a good test for that we'd probably need some sort of test that measures for these factors against people who are spiritual but not part of an organized religion and those who aren't...

Also there's obviously the chicken and the egg issue of ""does religious belief bring about these traits or do people with these traits seek out a religion"" that one would be super hard to test for unless we did a study on like kids, measured their personalities as they grew up and found out which ones became religious and which ones didn't...

To be clear, I'm not saying this is bunk or that you made a bad argument this is a very good/interesting argument I'm just pondering ways it could be drilled down further.

The other thing that I'd probably wonder about is that is this the ""opiate of the masses"" effect that Karl Marx talked about... that Religion makes people happier than they would be otherwise... and sometimes that's actually a bad thing, because it makes us more easily content with the world around us when we should be taking actions to make the world a better place.

&gt;the plane was a civilian business jet, a Falcon, that had been flying within 20 miles of Flight 93 and was asked by the authorities to descend from 37,000ft to 5,000ft to survey and transmit the co-ordinates of the crash site ""for responding emergency crews"". The reason, as numerous people have observed, why this seems so implausible is that, first, by 10.06am on 11 September, all non-military aircraft in US airspace had received loud and clear orders more than half an hour earlier to land at the nearest airport; second, such was the density of 911 phone calls from people on the ground, in the Shanksville area, as to the location of the crash site that aerial co-ordinates would have been completely unnecessary; and, third, with F-16s supposedly in the vicinity, it seems extraordinarily unlikely that, at a time of tremendous national uncertainty when no one knew for sure whether there might be any more hijacked aircraft still in the sky, the military would ask a civilian aircraft that just happened to be in the area for help.

1506	"&gt;No, this is deflection. Jeremy putting in ""self aware"" sins is a deliberate ploy to throw off criticism, akin to a racist putting a BLM logo on their Twitter bio and then saying ""see? My racism is ironic!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Satire is enacted, not invoked. You cannot make something a satire simply by saying ""hey! It's that thing everyone calls me out on! Ding!""

What logic do you use to come to this conclusion so confidently? If the behaviors being shown were already commonplace before CinemaSins started up and the general formula has remained more or less the same the whole time, wouldn't it be possible that it was done with the same intent for all that time as well?

And if it was always the same intent, how do you affirm what that intent was? In my previous comment, I brought up a lot of observations that Jeremy's other behavior doesn't match up with the idea that CinemaSins is supposed to be a genuine critique, which is part of the condition for something to be called satire.

The assertion that no message is intended is unfounded since the announcement we actually intend exists in our minds instead of our words. We can make mistakes with the translation into words, in which case miscommunication happens, but that doesn't make the intended message any different. Something may appear meaningless when it is actually created with meaning in mind. The only way you could confidently assert intention in this way is if you actually had a window into what they were thinking at the time of creation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's because anti-sexists are sexists with a guilty conscience. People who hold sincere beliefs do not contradict those beliefs. These people want to sexualise women, but they know that they are supposed to oppose sexualising women, hence the blatant contradiction. Therefore, it's not satire. It's hypocrisy.

I don't agree with this universally, but that behavior would be a plausible target for satire, no?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This not what Jeremy does. Jeremy will sin something and say ""I know that this is explained in the book, but the books don't matter!"" and then later sin something because ""the book did something different and you changed it!"". Again, that's not satire. That's hypocrisy.

To say ""The books don't matter"" in this context to me is interpreted as ""This movie should provide the necessary information in its own work to accommodate people who haven't read the book,"" and that's a valid argument that is entirely separate from ""I like this from the books, therefore the movie should have adapted it,"" which is more of what the second quote reads as for me, and generally what I was talking about in the last comment.

Note that my title didn't say ""CinemaSins *is* intended as satire"". It said ""*may*"". I'm not trying to prove intent since I know that's impossible. I'm trying to show that there's a reasonable chance that it is satirical, to show that there should be doubt present when people argue that CinemaSins is entirely illegitimate and unvaluable as content."	27	['is enacted', 'being shown', 'was done', 'is supposed', 'be called', 'is intended', 'is actually created', 'are supposed', 'is explained', 'is interpreted']	10	8	0.2962962962962963	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is enacted', 'being shown', 'was done', 'is supposed', 'be called', 'is intended', 'is actually created', 'are supposed', 'is explained', 'is interpreted']	10	8	0.2962962962962963	1	40744325459	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xmuwnc/_/ipu4aqb/	2033777352	40742896052.0	2022-09-25 10:18:09	468019267859.0	00PT	0	False	512	5	False	True	61.36

Yes. Are you saying this conflicts in some way with my conclusion in the OP that GDP tracks *monetary* inflation?

Indeed, I belive that matches with my conclusion as well. You need to create money to create price inflation of 2%/yr, and that's monetary inflation. If price deflation was -10%/yr before the central bank, you'd have to create ~12%/yr monetary inflation to target 2%/yr price inflation at that time on the island.

1509	"Thank you for clarification.

So bascially, you want to make it illegal for pregnant women to knowingly consume alcohol while pregnant to such a degree that a live-born child has FAS.

First, I would like to point out that this is a much narrower view from what was expressed in OP.

Second, I am a lot closer to supporting such law than before.

The only issue I see is that such a law might complicate diagnosing children with FAS, which will in turn be detrimental to their treatment.

Even today, mothers are extremely reluctant to admit that they have consumed alcohol during pregnancy:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder#Fetal_alcohol_syndrome

Thus FAS diagnosis requires several professionals including a ""physician, psychologist, social worker"" working together to make the correct diagnosis.  If your law was passed, you can very well expect mothers to become highly obstructionist in such diagnosis attempts, or mother may even deny treatment to the child altogether rather then risk criminal charges.

Also, there are many syndromes that have similar symptoms to FAS, but do not involve alcohol exposure:  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder#Differential_diagnosis

&gt; In addition, this also makes politicians far more susceptible to bribery. If a politician is living very comfortably, getting an offer of money is not super enticing. If they are living paycheck to paycheck, they might be willing to compromise for a million dollar back door deal.

Then crack down on bribery with the most severe ramifications. I would counter argue that if they are living 'paycheck to paycheck' on that salary, the incentive is there for them to make it so they, and everyone else, don't have to live that way."	11	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	29509679658	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6mg5h4/_/dk1auju/	400502200	29509670467.0	2017-07-10 15:06:14		GeordiePeoplesFront	1	False	210	2	False	True	67.08
1520	In some sense, computers are already better than humans. They perform calculations faster, have a much wider array of information, and can process that information at much higher speeds. Even so, if technology stopped improving right now, AI would not be an extinction-level threat to the human race on its own, and it would not solve all of the world's problems and make a technological paradise (these are the scenarios most proponents of AGI talk about). The reason I have such a high bar for AGI is that any machine that possesses human-level logic and operates at one million times the speed of the human brain should surpass us, at least minorly (fast-thinking-dog) in every area.	4	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	37314786493	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ojv6be/_/h549dj1/	1484555450	37314729807.0	2021-07-14 01:03:07	497422784754.0	Fact-Puzzleheaded	1	False	116	0	False	False	50.5

It's great when you're average or below average, but if you are someone who's determined to get somewhere more in life, financially, Socialism will make it EXTREMELLY hard for you to get anywhere. It will be nothing but a ball and a chain around your leg.

I think what you do not want to seeis that there is a tradeoff, there is no better or worse system.

The nordic model, while taxes highly the rich provides an exceptional social, educational, health, transport etc. system for the vast majority. Yes, it comes with taxes, high taxes, but the alternative is worse for the majority.

You mentioned, you moved to eastern europe. Have you been to a  public hospital or school? Have you taken public transportation? Have you had to get off the public bus, because the engine caught on fire, because it is so old? Have you had to change the springs and shock absorbers on your car three times a year, because the holes in the road? Have you made 50 kms in your car in two hours, because the extremely bad road conditions? Have you sat on the train that was making 60 km/h as maximum speed because the lousy track conditions? Have you been robbed/intimidated on a train by some teenageers, and when asked for helped from the controller, his reaction was to lock himself up in another couchette? Have you had to bribe every given public officer to get something done? Were you kids robbed and beaten on the street for their mobile phones? Have you been robbed by a uniformed police officer?

Now, if you are a succesful entrepreneur, and you can afford private school/medicine, the bribes and you never take public transportation, and your kids do not have to walk on the streets after dark you might like the system in eastern europe, but the majority of people have to deal with the above things regularly and would happily pay those nordic taxes for that nordic lifestyle.

1531	"1) Very much so. I also don't strongly believe that people who want to go to higher education should be prevented from doing so. In the world we currently live in, you **need** that access and I'm very glad my country did the sane thing and made it readily available. I think that the high costs of education in the US is a waste of talent. I'm definitely not saying that the costs of higher education should be raised (in fact, if I were to implement a policy based on this thread -- which would be a terrible idea, but whatever-- I'd restrict the spots available, but subsidize the people who got into those spots). I'm unsure what the best way to restrict access is, but I believe one could be found.

2) Trade schools and polytechnics don't really exist here and where they do I have little against them, except for the fact that some degrees there could easily be on-the-job training after high school. That's ultimately my complaint here: individuals or governments funding things that a company should really fund on their own. There's a polytechnic school that teaches nursing and I think that's a good thing. Nursing is something that can't be easily (or safely) learned on the job, so requiring a degree for it makes sense.

3) Plenty of people start working right out of high school (schooling is mandatory until you are 18 here) and do fine. If they are unprepared for the real world, that's an issue with middle and high school, not with a lack of access to higher education (which, really, doesn't prepare for real life issues either). Similarly, if the standards of the system are that low, that's a problem with that particular system, not the system of higher education.

Long story short, the majority German canton of Berne had significant minority of French speakers in the Jura, who were mostly not happy with the situation, very much simplifying the issue. Instead of insisting on the borders, which were that way since the Congress of Vienna, then 150 years ago, they held a vote. About half of the Jura voted to leave and create a new canton, the other half stayed. Just recently there was another vote of a single city wanting to switch.

And then I think it's undeniable her actions played a role in this, but that she's a minor and the very reason we have age restrictions on these things is precisely because we (as a society) have largely agreed that a minor like this is incapable of properly understanding the ramifications of these actions.

*Five twos make a ten* literally means you don’t pass up on someone you consider ugly (aka “a 2”). If you do this five times, it’s equivalent to being with a “10”. That’s the college math for ya. On a deeper level, it basically means just lower your physical standards.

And although the 5 2’s make a 10 is kind of an asshole thing to say out loud, standards are a huge problem to address in dating overall, not just for you. I’m sure you’re guilty (as most are) of basing your dating decisions purely on physical attractiveness. This is hurting your dating experience overall and causing you to be unnecessarily lonely, as there are partners out there that are in your league (or you might even be out of theirs). If people would focus less on physical attractiveness (note it’s usually only from pictures, which rarely tells even close to the whole story about a person’s actual attractiveness) and more on what they want to get out a partner, there would be a whole lot less loneliness.

1561	"&gt; This comes off as the inverse side of the slippery slope, so I'm having a hard time agreeing with it.

I can understand that.

&gt;But that doesn't invalidate the truth that the difference in fireworks on the 4th is not zero, but 0.01% at a very minimum guess.

This is the rub. So yes it does impact the environment. However everything we do impacts the environment. So ultimately it becomes a balance of what amount of human enjoyment is worth it. Id argue the impact is so small and fireworks are so much a part of our culture at this point that its worth the tiny environmental cost. We could certainly do with less fireworks (IE maybe limit it to small things like sparklers etc and then just have a few big firework shows people can go watch in their city).

So if I look at it as a cost benefit analysis and decide that ultimately this isn't worth keeping I do inevitably have to look at a lot of other things in life that we seem to just say are okay.

Because yes you are right it has an environmental impact and we dont neeed to shoot fireworks. Theres no denying that. Its just whats the impact compared to the cultural benefit. Much harder to really nail down.

&gt;Should we stop telling kids to turn off the water faucet when they brush their teeth because there's other companies that waste billions of gallons of water?

This is sort of not equivalent. We arent telling the kids not to use water at all just to reduce how much they use. We dont need pools but no ones going around saying we are wasting water in pools because well humans get a benefit out of a pool. Theres no benefit to leaving the water running while brushing your teeth.

In your examples you talk about people who have reached a pinnacle and who actually work in their chosen field. I would expect my oncologist to know things like that, but then it's his job. He has a VERY specific field in which to learn these things, whereas most of the time in the traditional education process your attention is spread through a variety of subjects. Even at a undergrad level, you're still learning (for example, from personal experience) anatomy, medical microbiology, statistics, oncology, nutrition, ecology, parasitology etc etc etc. Thankfully, my university knew that rote learning every fact of every module in a semester was impossible, and as such examined your ability in different ways than simply asking for regurgitated course material. I would argue that it is not until Masters level and above that you actually focus on one subject, at which point rote learning is viable, nay, essential (except of course the basics, as mentioned in my other reply).

That's weird, I thought your argument was that polling is a trustworthy source for determining an elected officials competency as a function of their arbitrary, entirely subjective, popularity.

It's a far cry, all of that, from claims being made about an electorate being informed in a society where maybe half the voting age population participates and of those that do you'll probably be hard pressed to find any who are actually informed.

Then there is the slight matter of how the entire paragraph is basically circular logic...

&gt; This then allows us to see that if a majority of the people strongly disapprove of Trump, then there is a very high likelihood that either his policies are bad/uninformed, or that he's moving too fast for the people's tastes, or both. 

Your previous assertions would have to be proven in order for there to be any application. And then they would have to be applied in such a manner as to demonstrate that the opinions of some arbitrary group about arbitrary topics (i.e. policies and character *ha ha*) have some relevance in supporting your actual argument which is not anything you're positing currently because if it was you would have brought it up previously instead of some umpteenth ditch effort to caveat emptor pretending to be the Kool-Aid man.

&gt; Since his approval rating has stayed consistently at 40% or below for the past year, a new low for Presidents, it can be said that he has had enough time in office for people to have judged him, and for him to have failed to rally them to his side, something which usually only happens if one's policies are bad, or if one is changing things too quickly/slowly.

1573	"&gt;Well, the reason I felt like merit should be considered over your racial background 

The word merit simply means worthiness. What is worthy is subjective. It doesn't universally mean grades or experience. Racial background can be a part of merit.

&gt;I personally believe that experience and work should be the defining factor in getting the job

Getting the job is based on what the candidate brings to the table and whether those attributes are what the job market is looking for.

Some employers will not hire the most experienced candidate because they don't want to potentially pay more money for the experience.

Some employers will want to hire a woman because some female customers request for a woman.

The deciding factor to get the job is whatever the employer wants. Why are you against employers controlling their own business?

&gt;Race isn't a foolproof way of making everyone think the same.

No it's not but it significantly increase the chance. It's naive to believe that race doesn't impact how we experience the world.

&gt;Now I don't know about you, but I'd rather trust the person with more experience handling my baby than the person with less.

So you rather trust a more experienced doctor with a track record of infant death?

Experience does not automatically mean quality.

If your answer is ""remove the child from the home"", what exactly is your plan here? Where does the child go? Were talking about teenagers here right? I don't think people are lining up around the block to adopt poor teenagers. How on earth is removing the teenager from their home going to help the situation?

For less extreme cases, you say:

&gt; In these cases the teenager is making their choice and prioritizing, but in that case they can’t complain about missed opportunities.

But this is still shitty. Why can't they complain? These ""extras"" could be things like having a car, going to college, or just having a normal teenager social life.

1580	"There are so many problems here. I don't even know where to start, and I don't have the time or inclination to address them all.  

But I'll say this.  The idea of private property is obviously a human construct.  Humans create, support, and enforce the idea and the fact of private property and private property rights.  Obviously, there's a theoretical alternative where private property rights aren't recognized or enforced by the state.  

However, to go from that obvious fact to the claim that the purpose of private property is to oppress others and that it's supported only by propaganda and violence is .... bizarre (to be charitable).  

Private property recognition is simply a way to allocate resources in the most optimal and efficient way possible, which ensures that resources are exploited and improved and new things are created and made available for the benefit of the greatest number of people.  It's not a perfect system.  There are some losers in this game. And some losers are totally innocent. And, maybe from a higher perspective, all losers are totally innocent.  But there's no better way as a practical matter, and there are far fewer losers than there would be under any alternative system.  

And as for oppression and violence, assume no state-enforced property rights and think what happens.  First, every raw resource is over-exploited and never renewed or improved to the detriment of all.  There's an economic term for this -- the tragedy of the commons.  Everything is fully used quickly and never replaced or renewed.  Second, if there's something perceived by all as an asset, then who gets it, keeps it, uses it, and benefits from it?  The strongest and most violent and most cunning and most diabolical. If I'm bigger than you and stronger than you, then I going to take everything and leave you with nothing.  You will suffer.  And I will exploit and oppress you and inflict violence on you to maximize my benefit from the resource and to exclude you from it.  And it doesn't matter if I'm doing that to you or a group of people is doing that to you, even if that group calls themselves ""the government.""  

In a world of limited resources and unlimited needs and desires, allocating resources and assets will be an unavoidable necessity.  It must be -- and will be -- done one way or another.  How do you want to allocate resources without private property rights?  What allocation mechanism will result in the most optimal and most beneficial allocation for the greatest number of people?  In your world, will the doctor and the lawyer work 100 hours per week if they get nothing for it?  Will the inventor invent anything?  Will anyone build, improve, and maintain apartment buildings, office buildings, houses, or businesses?  Will anyone spend years developing therapeutic drugs?  Will anyone develop an iPhone, grow and harvest crops, build infrastructure, or provide you with clothing?  Will anyone do anything ever other than use brute force and trickery to exploit raw materials for their own short-term benefit and to the exclusion of others?  

So, what do you want?  The biggest, strongest, most violent, and most diabolical decide how to allocate resources?  Everyone gets by only by doing everything for themselves because there's no currency, no division of labor, no specialization, and no trade?  Or would you rather have a private property system that has made available to you the clothes you're wearing, the food you eat, the car you drive, the place you live in, the medical care you have, the computer you're on, the internet you're using, the amusements you pursue, the planes you fly on, and everything else you have and use?  Or would you and the rest of the world be better off if everyone had to either go without anything or do all these things for themselves with whatever raw materials they could scrape together through violence, oppression, and trickery inflicted on others.

Also if you were to figure out the risk of using an airship, it could be more costly.  It's slower so if spends more time in the air.  Also since its slower, you will probably have less options available due to air traffic control.  Also you carry the risk of covering the cost of the cargo when something goes wrong.

It's also important to feel pain. Pain lets you know when to stop doing something. People who have congenital insensitivity to pain generally die young and spend their whole lives having to check constantly for injuries that could become very serious. They burn themselves, get seriously ill from minor illnesses because they don't know to get them treated. Eliminating pain isn't a good thing, and people with CIPA suffer a lot in spite of not feeling pain.

I don't think people who say ""suffering builds character"" actually mean that people in pain shouldn't seek relief, or that people with depression shouldn't seek help. I think they mean it in the sense I outlined before, and I'm still not seeing why that's more pernicious than say sexist beliefs that have held back literally half the population for all of civilisation."	9	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	38368178885	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/r4v63o/_/hmjf8at/	1640759460	38368054992.0	2021-11-29 13:21:34	862824749675.0	FjortoftsAirplane	2	False	164	0	False	True	61.46

processed food vs fresh food being cheaper or more expensive is not consistent. But there is the time factor of cooking, which most the time, means your not working.

Powerbars, canned ravioli and pizza were most my diet for a long time. I survived long enough to make money and change habits. My friend who ate all organic, fresh food died of a brain aneurism. 

You’re saying everyone eating poorly is making a choice to do so. I’m saying the choices aren’t that simple and the cause isn’t simple. sometimes the choice is eat poorly or don’t sleep. Not get less, but spend an hour cooking instead of sleeping...

I’m saying poor diet/health choices are rarely that simple. 

Smoking too. Studies show across gender and profession, smoking vs not smoking changes when you look at annual incomes more than gender, stress, family, ect. There are less smokers earning $75k/yr, keep in mind, if you’re earning that, your in the top 25% and making healthier food or smoking choices are more likely a choice, as you probably aren’t working 4 jobs to make that. (There are exceptions obviously)

Your making the aurgument that people making poor lifestyle, diet and addiction choices are making choices to do so.  I’m saying, that’s true if you have money and or resources, but for the greater percentage of people, the choice isn’t between good and bad food, it’s between bad food and a different sacrifice. 

People are working on education, and cooking classes so poor realize they do have cheap, healthy, palatable options, but again, making poor pay for their “poor choices” is assuming their just making bad choices which are within their control.

Could you please clarify? Are you stating that the stigma of anger is justified? Perhaps you have a point here but I need more convincing.  

In comparing fear and anger you describe a direct rational response to fear and an extremely exaggerated response to anger. In studying the elements of fear, psychologists point to *fight, flight* or *freeze* response. I have also recently read that *fawning* is a fourth fear/trauma response. From this reasoning, I conclude that fear can also ""cause people to become unnecessarily confrontational"" as equally as anger can. Yet it seems to me that society attributes violence committed while someone is in fear as a natural response, however, if the same violent act were committed while in anger it is more heavily penalized and considered unjust. 

I have personally experienced a freeze response when I was filled with anger. Maybe my anger scared me and this is why or maybe it was a natural response to anger that no one talks about.

**First**, it is inadequate to simply *eliminate or account for* multiple factors, then declare whatever remains to all be genetic. Yet this is done multiple times, and is an example of stacking the deck or omitting other factors.

**Second**, proofs like ""twin studies"" specifically ignores socially-induced psychological effects, which the child experiences automatically when people know they are a different race from their parents or adopted or whatever. This cluster of effects does not ""magically disappear"" when factors like SES, family size, geographical location, etc. are accounted for.

1.  We can improve the technology significantly.  If you, like me, had started using computers in the 1980s, you would recognize the changes in human technology over a very short period of time.  Less than 200 years ago, we didn't even have self-propulsion (we could only use humans, animals or gravity).  We didn't have convenient communication around the world.  We didn't have the centralized repositories of information with instant access that we have now (we had libraries but you had to be near one or travel to one).  There is no reason to believe that technology will not advance by at least that order of magnitude over the next 200 years.

2.  Humans must learn.  Computers can be programmed.  We spend decades of our life getting educated.  Computers can have ""knowledge"" transferred to them in a few minutes or hours.  That means they can start usefully learning almost immediately, whereas humans generally don't start to do significant societally-advancing learning until at least the teenage years, and usually decades later."	13	['can be programmed', 'getting educated']	2	2	0.15384615384615385	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['can be programmed', 'getting educated']	2	2	0.15384615384615385	1	29226869787	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/61a9ya/_/dfcx923/	364956130		2017-03-24 15:29:31		PhotoJim99	13	False	196	0	False	True	64.61

One is that dogs are not moral agents because they do not meet some cognitive threshold, and because of that, they do not meet the requirements necessary to have responsibility for their actions.

Since it would seem that someone could say, ""Since dogs are not moral agents we do not have moral duties towards them, such as not killing them without good cause,"" I'm just going to assume that you get around this with something like, ""They are not moral agents and so not responsible agents because of their cognitive capacity, but they do have a moral status because of their capacity for sentience, and so we should not do unnecessary harm to them."" You can tell if this is off.

Consider some of the assumptions made here.

Why is there some cognitive requirement for moral responsibility?

Why is sentience a requirement for moral status?

As others have pointed out, your two stated topics are not really that unrelated. Naturally, it depends on the specific reason a person might be pro/anti-choice and pro/anti-gun control, but generally, I'd say some of the more common arguments for being pro one line up pretty well with being pro the other and vice versa.

One example for being pro-choice and pro-gun control might be one of pragmatism: Safe and legal abortions mean fewer deaths, as does gun control. Fewer dead people: Good.

One example for being anti-choice and anti-gun control might be the belief that Americans have an unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and it's relatively easy to argue why gun control and legal abortion might be violating those rights.

Whether any of these arguments are actually correct doesn't really matter much; my point is, this correlation is often likely to be consistent with a person's worldview. No need for groupthink.

1633	"&gt; This is a good point, except, why do we have this obligation?

If we're going to resort to purely rational reasons, it is simple: if you were in their position then you would really want that help. The golden rule can be argued for with nothing but logical arguments - but I won't delve into that unless you want the precise arguments. The basis for why the golden rule is *golden*, is simply this: you cannot decide how you're born into this world or which sides of a situation you end up on, and the only way to reasonably guarantee good treatment and absence of suffering, is to make sure that net ""utility"" is always none or greater for the individual and everyone involved.

But as you mention, emotional motivations are there. Empathy/sympathy is often enough *the* reason, and perhaps some (religious) values on helping your fellow man, regardless of trivial traits like nationality/ethnicity.

Focusing on our own problems is a fair opinion, but we do have (future) problems that are directly connected to developing countries. A typical one is underpaid workers in foreign countries, and child labour, which most of the West is vehemently against, but how well we enforce laws and policies varies a lot. Granted, this is an ethical problem and not necessarily something like pollution or dirty drinking water, but economies are linked globally.

To (immediately) dismiss people who approach your country and ask for help, is just inhumane. Often enough, a fickle problem in the West (that does not demand immediate resolutions) could alternatively have resources spent on making much progress somewhere else. The effectiveness of a given amount of resources, varies depending on the task. One man's trash is another's treasure, and this doesn't stop at any given scale.

Admittedly, that was definitely a bit of hyperbole but one of the major issues is Poe's Law: how do you distinguish between a genuine hate crime and the satirical use of these words online when they often seem identical?

The fact of the matter is that we, as human beings, are perfectly entitled to have secrets assuming that they don't break the law.

1652	"&gt;The correct state for voting is the state that you are legally registered in

Not true. In one of the two examples I gave you, I was technically in Wisconsin, but voted in Colorado. Now, I was in Colorado to receive my ballot. I was not living in Colorado on the date of the election, nor was I yet registered in Wisconsin. 

I am legally registered in what I believe to be five states. I registered validly and legally at the time, but it in all five states in which I know I am legally registered, I would not be considered a resident. 

**This is more complicated than you want it to be**. I understand why that is frustrating to you. If you've lived in the same place your entire life, it might seem like I am splitting hairs. If you've lived in five states in ten years, this will make a lot more sense. 

&gt;This was mentioned elsewhere. If it doesn't really matter, then why have any restrictions on voting? Just open up the polls and whomever walks in can cast a ballot.

Because local elections have a lot more power than federal elections. Who gets to sit on the school board? Can Colorado lower or raise their sales tax? Senate and House seats change by county and state. And, sure, the electoral college. 

But you can't just go out and register anywhere. You have to have proof of where you live. You have to be able to demonstrate you are a resident, and where your residence is. It's not like I can just waltz into the Mississippi and claim I live there. I have to prove it, register, and then I can vote. 

**It is not illegal to be registered in more than one place**. It is illegal to VOTE in more than one place. If I am legally allowed to register, I can register wherever the fuck I please. Now, if you're claiming that my registration in, let's say Iowa, is no longer valid you'd be correct! I'd be illegally voting based on my registration not being current and correct. But the simple fact that I'm registered there isn't a high crime nor a misdemeanor. It is just the fact that, try as I might, the county won't take me off their list. I know this because they call me every election season and I have to repeatedly turn down the same fucking survey when they do because I am not an Iowa voter anymore. Then they hang up on me, instead of removing me and I know this because it's nearly a decade since I lived in Iowa and I go through this every two years. 

**Long story short: I can be registered in Iowa and Colorado and anywhere I please** provided I am eligible to vote and was, at the time, a legal resident. I cannot vote in a state where I am illegally registered, I cannot act on my registration, but it is not ILLEGAL to be registered in and of itself. I don't sell myself as an Iowa voter because I don't. vote. in. Iowa. But I am registered there. Hell, I'm registered in 10% of the country at this point. But I vote in the state where I reside. Or, in the case of the previous election, in the state where I did reside when I got my ballot because I moved right at the time of the election. I actually called the county clerk to double-check I was in the clear on that, so I don't feel like I am telling tales out of school here.

1655	"Even if they weren't classified at the time, they likely contained information which a reasonable official would recognize as meriting protection. That establishes an obligation to protect it regardless of whether anyone has actually officially classified it. So while ""they weren't classified at the time"" could excuse a few errors, it can't account for the bulk.

Overclassification is indeed a real problem, and not just in regard to widely-known programs. But it's just not that hard to understand the ordinary standards of classification, and even fairly low-level officials can be expected to exercise good judgment in this regard. It's absolutely possible that abusive classification after transmission is responsible for the bulk of these emails, but it's just not likely in my view. I believe they'd have gotten called out by the President if they'd done something so improper. Abusing the classification system to sabotage a presidential candidate would be a pretty serious crime.

Spillage certainly happens, but I've never seen anything remotely close to that concentration of errors, even in military units run ragged and staffed by people of seriously questionable intelligence and judgment. Writing this off as an ordinary or reasonable level of spillage really is unfathomable from my perspective. I also have a hard time imagining anywhere near this much spillage would have occurred if she'd been using her .gov *and* her classified accounts, as she and her staff clearly should have. If State's IT wasn't working, it was her job to put boot to ass and get it fixed. Did she really think she was doing her job without sending or receiving classified emails? Difficult to accept.

Still, the idea that it was merely negligent is definitely possible, which is why I say it's merely *implausible* that it wasn't intentional. It's unlikely, based on my experiences.

I can't see how an informed person can hold that view. AR manufacturers certainly don't want to see people killed, very few people are killed by them, as in less than probably 50 people a year by assault rifles in the US total, and literally tens of millions of them have been sold. I don't see how he could believe that banning them could have meaningful impact.

If he were proposing a pistol ban, I could understand that. Many many people are murdered with pistols. I don't believe a ban is necessary, would be effective, and I believe it would be in violation of natural rights, but I would at least understand the motivation.

I am from the mid-west, and I do not hunt or have close relationships with anyone who does.

&gt; Can you explain how this is better in effect than the current system of licensing?     
    
I think I have tangented here a bit from the core of my view and am defending fan works.    
   
The core of my view can be summarized ""What is accomplished by /forcing/ companies into legal action"".    

* I think that the existing system is good and fine with the exception of **compelling** companies to action.      
* I think that granting fan licenses is a problem because that implies tacit approval of the work on some level, adds legal complexity, liability, and expense for the company.        
    
Companies could let exceptional fan works stand, or inconsequential fan works stand..    
Sure they could issue licenses, but a license is a big thing.    It's a formal association.    A simple email of ""this is our trade dress.  make it clear that this is unofficial"".    And it's done.   
      
I heard about the Axanar brouhaha, and saw that CBS and Paramount had lost some aspects to their rights.    I did not know that they had created a guidelines to avoid objection.   Given the state of trademark law, is that sufficient to prevent CBS/Paramount from losing their marks?     My understanding is that it is not sufficient.       
   
I do feel like that your example sort of proves my point, companies need a way to allow fans to express their love of a thing within reason without destroying their brand or becoming formally associated with the derivative fan works..    CBS/Paramount recognized this and is trying to do something.     
   
Forcing them to sue anyone and everyone simply generates ill will from the fans.

You are in a way identifying your bias when you report on such things when you use the asterisk, and this is one way of doing things. If you agree that it isn't ""censoring"", then I'm not sure why you would object to it. 

Another way of doing so is basically explicitly saying that you have decided to print the statements in its entirety.

This is also an acceptable way of doing things in media, and I have seen examples of both.

However, there are several problems with your argument. Chief among them is the fact that you are merely making assertions that lack any argument to back them up. Why must storytelling be immersive? Why should it create an experience that someone wouldn't normally have? Surely works that appeal to the common experience of living, that speak to the basic human condition, are as deserving of being called great stories as something that is fantastic and impossible. 

What's more, even if all your assertions were granted, video games are only the ideal medium for a certain class of non-disabled people. By your own assertions, they are not ideal for those who lack the senses of sight or of hearing, or of both.

1684	"Nihilism brings you to the point where you're not obligated to treat any moral proposition as true. There's a difference though between the idea that a moral statement is true and that a moral statement is useful.

Let's run through it: if nihilism is correct and there's no objective moral reality and it's impossible to be certain that anything is real outside of our own brain (cogito ergo sum!), we're still by all appearances a human living on the planet Earth, and we sure feel hungry and cold.

So from that we can start hammering things together. We can decide to place value on continuing to live. We can decide to place value on being well-fed and warm. We can decide that we should value ethics that tend to keep us that way, which usually involves living with other people and building stable relations with those people.

But note that because of nihilism, we're not obligated to come to any of those conclusions. Morality becomes a practical tool for achieving what we decide is valuable, but we're no longer having the definition of ""valuable"" shoved down our throat.

What this means is that a nihilist might look at two competing ethical systems and say hey, based on the different values espoused by the adherents of each, there's nothing wrong with either system. One of them doesn't have to be the ultimate answer.

That's a big leap forward, in my opinion. With this answer in mind, scroll through the CMVs in this subreddit and identify how many value assumptions are baked into the positions presented.

I literally may as well say the earth is flat, because for everyone standing on the surface of the earth it may as well be so there's no point in thinking of it differently.

Weight is a result of gravitys attraction of one body with mass to another. Mass itself is a measurement of a bodies resistance to change in inertia. Weight is a downward (or in the direction of gravity) force. Mass applies in other situations like a vehicle accelerating. A truck has more mass than a car, therefore a higher resistance to change in inertia, and takes more force and longer to start moving. This is nothing to do with the downward force of weight, but with the amount of mass the vehicles have. The same would be true of rockets in space, where there is no gravity and no weight. A large rocket with more mass will take more force to move at the same speed as a small rocket with less weight.

And dont argue ""yeah but that's in space and everyday people won't experience the difference"". It's the same principal applied to the vehicles.

1691	"&gt; First of all, I won't refute most of your arguments here, but your CMV is ""if you support homosexuality you must support incest"". This is not true from a pragmatic perspective.

I mean I know you literally don't have to support both, I'm just saying you are a hypocrite if you do one and not the other.

&gt; This is sort of like saying that somebody who wants marijuana to be legal must also advocate for the legality of all other drugs. Sure, even if they are equally harmful/harmless etc., why would they risk setting back their cause by alienating the public?

&gt; Similarly, why would somebody who advocates for gay rights want to alienate those who are already against them on that issue by advocating for something even MORE taboo? From a pragmatic standpoint, somebody does not have to support both.

Well by ""support"" I don't mean fight equally as hard for in practice. I just mean believe in it from a moral perspective.

For example, I am fine with there being some group dedicated solely to latino issues. I wouldn't necessarily expect them to fight as hard for black rights, for example. But if you asked them how they feel about the plight of black people, they would say something like ""We stand with our black brothers and sisters in the fight against discrimination."" That is what I expect here for gay people and pro gay rights people.

Imagine if the latino rights group were to instead say ""We only care about the rights of latinos. Blacks are gross!"" That would be *massively* hypocritical. And you're saying that they could be justified in that, because it would advance their cause by not alienating people who were against them even more?

&gt; How can one be expected to learn how to form new relationships if they never had to do so? If they have access to sexual relationships with their family members, what incentive do they have to seek relationships elsewhere? 

Not all incestuous relationships will fit this criteria.

And even if so, who cares? Let's say they find true love and are happy, why does it matter that they didn't get in 1, 10, or 100 outside relationships first?

&gt; Allowing for incest might very well... damage of the health of extra-familial romantic relationships.

Allowing for homosexuality *does* very well lead to a much higher rate of AIDS. No gay person or pro gay rights person is against homosexuality because of that. Shouldn't two consenting adults be allowed to do what they want to do in the bedroom? 

&gt; but at the same time, incestuous relationships far more readily lend themselves to power imbalances than do most other relationships. Given the pre-existing relationships already present, it is way too prone to abuse.

And chips, cookies, and McDonald's far more readily lend themselves to causing obesity related deaths than do apples and kale. They are much more prone to abuse. But we don't make those illegal.

I mean what is next, outlawing heterosexual relationships that are statistically more likely to lead to unwanted children because unwanted children have a higher rate of criminality?

1692	"&gt; Money gets you all of those things, so in a sense money is capital.

Ah, but by that line of reasoning labor is money. After all, what is money but a representation of the amount of stuff that you generated by your labor and the amount of labor you can convince others to do for you?

You see, that's why definitions are important. Just because you can exchange this for that doesn't make this that. Just because things look like one another does not make them the same.

Money is a medium of exchange, nothing more nothing less. Bullionism was defeated early in the process because it has nothing to offer.

&gt; But it is, without money, you can't get the stuff you need to produce other things.

Yes, you totally can. It's call bartering, accounts payable, and ""payment in kind"". All of those involve acquiring the stuff you need to produce by the exchange of different current goods, the promise to repay, and by a share of future goods. You'd be surprised how often transactions occur without simultaneous currency exchange.

&gt; Oh I thought you meant there was a current slave trade going on in the US South. I am still at a loss as to how this specifically applies. Could you explain a little more?

At the time of the American Civil war most intellectuals were fairly certain that slavery was on the way out, and were creating a ""Crowding Out"" problem for the Southern Economy where money was being sucked out of other sectors of the economy to service a single boom industry that's been artificially subsidized (in this case cotton by slavery). The cost of labor being paid as a fixed cost instead of as a variable cost hides the true cost of the good, so the ""right"" investments aren't bade because slaves make cotton look like a better investment than it actually is. The problem was ""How do we get rid of it?""

One of the most popular ""solutions"" at the time was sending people to Liberia (which still persists to this day), Mississippi-in-Africa, and the Republic of Maryland on the African Continent. There were many proponents of this even in the South, and they wanted a gradual shift of all slaves back to Africa and a ""reboot"" of relations. The problem was the equivalent of $11 trillion dollars (in 2011) was tied up in slavery at the time. There was no way anyone could buy up all the slaves, but if they declared slaves free then they couldn't prevent the complete collapse of the Southern economy as 15% of all household wealth in the south simply vanishes, by contrast the Foreclosure Crises and 2008 financial crisis represented an 8% loss of household wealth and the Great Depression represented an 11% loss of household wealth.  

Some people who didn't really believe in personal slavery defended the institution because they didn't see the alternative. The rumor the Lincoln wished to destroy the South by freeing the slaves at the behest of New England merchants and industrialists triggered the Civil War. After the war progressed long enough The Emancipation Proclamation was intended to create exactly that crisis in the areas of the South not yet pacified, as well are rectify a historic injustice.

Because the southern economy was so dependent upon slavery there was no compromise to be had despite decades of attempts. The economic elite had too much personal stake and perverse incentives stemming from the hidden costs of the plantation system. The Political elite benefitted from the concentration of power in the hands of a few large land owners. Despite periodic reform efforts the end of slavery would have taken a century to disassemble peacefully or a war that burned the entire economy and social structure all the way to the ground. In the end the latter occurred, but ultimately it still took a century to reassemble the pieces into something that came close to equity. The acrimony of the war added strong power-driven reasons (identity politics, bitter ender defense of the remaining social structure) that made attempts to integrate the freed slave ultimately fail despite several key early successes.

&gt; From wiki: Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry, and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for profit. 
&gt;
&gt; These traders were privately owned organizations who went around selling human beings for profit, that sounds pretty capitalistic.

First of slavery is a question of *Labor* not *Capital*. It was about making human beings into part of the land at first, but as the notion of capital was separated from the notion of land development slaves went from a part of other property to property in its own right.

It's also important to note that most of the players in the early slave trade weren't *privately owned organizations*. On the African sides they were primary war captives sold by the state or tribe to middlemen, the West India Trading Company and the Spanish Crown were not private entitles but owned in part (WITC) or whole (Spanish Crown) by European governments. Things only transferred to private entities after the collapse of Spain as a colonial power and the end of the national trading companies.

&gt; Oh but it certainly can be. If someone stands in your way of a resource, and you knock them out, violence was necessary to acquire that resource, which is usually money.
&gt;
&gt; Resources give you power.

No, *expending* resources gives you power. It gives you a weak and temporary form of power. The fact that I have money in my mattress means nothing to anyone, the fact that I promise to give you money if you do something to me and have a history that proves that I probably will does have some weight.

The following are the primary sources of power:

* Power to Reward: This transactional power is basically that I can give you something in exchange for doing what I ask. Like a tip or a company car.
* Power to Punish: This transactional power is basically that I can harm you if you do not do what I ask. Like imprisonment or the deduction of a penalty from pay.
* Legitimacy: This is power that comes from an external source, like the power of the Office of President or that associated with the Medal of Honor. It is not the power of the person, but it is power granted to the person by virtual of holding a position.
* Technocratic Power: This power from having knowledge and skill. Basically by demonstrating that you know what you are talking about you can get people to defer to you judgment on those matters. Sort of like the power your doctor has when telling you to take pills or an accountant has when he tells folks to pay their taxes.
* Intrinsic Power: This is power that comes from having those traits that people want in a leader. You know, being tall, good looking, charismatic, well spoken, and so on and so forth.

As you can see from this fairly standard run down on the sources of power, resources only give you Reward/Punishment and not as much Punishment as a propensity for violence might.

You can convert money into power (political contributions, public relations efforts, bonuses to employees) and power into money (usually corruption) but the political elite and the economic elite specialize in different things. Even in feudal times there were Plutocrats (early merchant families) and then there were Aristocrats (those who got their position by killing their opposition). Mixing the two up is a good way to end up rubbing everyone the wrong way by not giving anyone what they really want."	56	"['was defeated', 'was being sucked', ""'s been artificially subsidized"", 'being paid', 'was tied', 'was intended', 'be had', 'was separated', 'power granted']"	9	8	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['was defeated', 'was being sucked', ""'s been artificially subsidized"", 'being paid', 'was tied', 'was intended', 'be had', 'was separated', 'power granted']"	9	8	0.14285714285714285	1	27300836045	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2cq093/_/cji7nwt/	142301127	27300768801.0	2014-08-06 00:53:25		A_Soporific	1	False	1295	9	False	True	58.11

Holy shit that GIF is really impactful. This is an excellent point. Probably the only one made thus far that begins to change my view. If we are all getting fatter as a result of systemic problems, and it is in fact now a big effort to stay un-obese, then it could be that they shouldn't be required to pay any extra for anything. The only thing I'd like to point out, is that even in those beige states at the end, you were still only seeing 25% obesity. I get that it's an alarming trend, and I'm sure that it indicates systemic involvement, but that's by no means a majority. 

&gt; I'd say that we should try to provide incentives for improving health -- so wellness programs are okay, but not to seek to punish -- so refusing the chairs isn't.

First, I'd like to say that I'd never be in favor of denying benefits. I'm talking about adjusting costs. The only situation where I could see refusing the chairs as a punishment, rather than a special treatment, is if extra seating was available on request for everyone, and only the obese couple were refused. As it was, the opposite seemed to be true, that they were entitled to special treatment because they were incapable of standing. (full disclosure: I didn't ask for a chair, so I don't know whether I would have gotten one. It could be that the option was available to everyone.) 

I see not getting the chair as an increased cost of going to the show as an obese person.  My point was that they had the same opportunity to arrive early, and didn't. The arriving early is the cost-increase. They have to sit, ergo, they have to arrive early. Not, they have to sit, ergo, they can ask for additional seating regardless of when they arrive.

There's a difference between sociology and biology. Biology bases its definitions on something that has been tested and is repeatable and provable. The concept of Evolution exists because its independently provable. Any scientific concept exists like that. If someone doubts evolution they can set out to disprove it. 

 Sociology's definition seems to have just been made up. Sociology's definition can't be proved and is unfalsifiable.

I don't think that is true. In general, each generation of technology is *more* reliable and efficient than what it replaces.

Cars were generally reliable, but you could work on them. Today, you can't. Cars generally just work.

Here's a hypothetical scenario. Imagine you (28) are a leader of a really small party out of Georgia, and you want to run for Governor in 2026. Debatably, it might be a better use of resources to run for President next year in hopes of getting 1% of the vote within the state, because otherwise you would need to collect a petition requirement of 1% of all registered voters, which is debatably harder, whereas independents and minor party candidates only need 7,500 signatures to be on the ballot for president.

One is that Snowden's actions potentially put operatives in danger.  His counter argument is that he sent it to the press and it is their job to filter the information.  But personally I don't think that completely alleviates his culpability.  If he really wanted to do it right he should have poured over the documents removing any sensitive information prior to releasing it.  Instead he sent everything and the kitchen sink and relied on an incompetent media to use their ""discretion"".  

I think it bears mentioning that we have been collecting and using meta data since the 60's.  This is not a new thing and something every government in the world has been doing or was doing at one time.  The NSA clearly took it one step further, but I think there is an argument that could be made that they were following long set precedent, in which case it is hard to know if what they did was really whistle-blowing.  What the NSA is/was doing is probably unethical, but that does not necessarily make it illegal.  If what they where doing is was within the confines of current law, then it is not whistle blowing.

A primary care doctor should be able to reliably diagnose major depressive disorder and initiate treatment. In many cases a PCP can manage depression in concert with therapy (which does not necessarily require a physician), and in other cases they can refer to a psychiatrist.

1709	"RE1 was actually pretty clever. They introduce the save mechanic in the first room, and make it clear that saves are finite. Many first time players save. Then they give you a perfectly good opportunity to waste ammo on an easy to avoid zombie who, for first time players, will probably do damage. Many (myself included) will reload to make less of a mess of the encounter, at which point the fact that you now have only 2 ribbons very quickly induces a bit of anxiety. It’s effectively a tutorial, done in a way that a player is at most 5 minutes into the game and any bad outcomes are really reversible. Even if you want the ribbon back, you just restart at no real cost.

To the other point, unlike the Souls the games, RE1 is takes place in a small, extensively backtracked environment with a relatively small, finite number of enemies. You're never more than a few rooms away from a save point, and there's never that many enemies you'd need to fight or avoid to get back to one. A lot of areas are crossed repeatedly as you gain new items. So, the ink ribbons work as a mechanic to limit saves, keep the tension on, and prevent all that save-spamming abuse. It's really no different than having save points spread out; that's just not mechanically doable in the game setting. 

And they do make an effort to avoid making it a  hostile mechanic - there are lots of ribbons, but not so many you can save spam. I saved before every boss in addition to normal saving and still had plenty of ribbons to spare. You just have to think if it's worth a ribbon.

&gt;In most civil cases, the attorney will be paid an hourly fee, a contingency fee or a combination of both. An attorney’s hourly rate depends on the attorney’s experience, operating expenses, the location of the practice and the status of the law firm. Smaller firms or less experienced attorneys will charge $100-$300 per hour, while larger, more powerful firms with in-demand attorneys may charge as much as $500 per hour.

1714	"No, but it is possible some of the shootings were either unintentional, because of the lack of training of police officers (thus showing not racism, but incompetence) or even intentional, showing abuse of power (with or without racism) but in either case it is entirely possible that black people are more likely to *put themselves in situations that could get them shot in the first place*. 

Example: Cop X is abusing its power and shooting people who should not be shot, but doing that to all races equally. Black person Y gets into a fight on the street or is found dealing drugs or something. The cop shouldn't have shot them, but they did, because they abuse their power. However, (perhaps) more black people will do those things in general compared to white people. Therefore black people will be overall shot in an unjustifiable manner more but the police will still not be racist.

I'm not saying that's what happens, but it's definitely one of the possibilities. 

And to answer your question too

&gt;Is it your opinion therefore that police are justified in fatally shooting violent criminals or those fleeing custody?

In some situations yes, it's complicated. We need to find the perfect balance between cops abusing their power and them not having enough power to keep us safe. If someone robbed a bank and ran away for example I think it's pretty justified for the cops to shoot them. In the leg if they can, but you can't always hit the perfect spot from a distance... If you're getting checked in the car for drugs/weapons for example of course being shot is not ok unless they are *Absolutely certain* you have an illegal firearm.

They didn't do this exclusively for Israel, as you make it sound. They also did this for: Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afganistan, Pakistan, and that's just off the top of my head without looking at a map. This has created ongoing conflict in ALL of these countries for nearly the past 100 years now. Yet your implication seems to be that the situation in Israel is particularly unfair. Is that indeed your position? Can you support that?

Now if your point is simply that Brittan handled the entire affair exceedingly poorly, I would immediately agree to that. However, given that the Jews in the region at the time had no control over the fact that Brittan was going to divide the region into pieces, and given that they were often the source of persecution as a minority in the region, do you think that it was unreasonable for them to, at the time, ask, ""Hey, while your at it, could we have a piece?"" Because I don't find that to be an unreasonable request given the situation. It should be noted that the original partition plan included a Palestinian state! But the Palestinians at the time refused to accept any agreement in which the Jews had any land of their own.

1727	"&gt;Most really expensive investment properties are probably negatively geared. That is, they cost more to own than you get back in rent, but you're banking on capital gains to get the returns.

Note, I'm new to all of these financial and economic terms (parents didn't know better and I'm only now earning enough to be thinking of these issues), so I apologize if I use terms like equity and capital gains incorrectly. I believe my concern is more with equity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In terms of responsibilities, the property investors are taking on all the risk. They have to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the property (often not cheap) and the pay dearly if the property Market crashes.

As a property owner, you can always sell the house. Even if it takes a 50% hit on its value and it eats all of your equity, and that is the **worst case scenario** I believe (correct if I'm wrong!), you are still in the exact same situation as a renter in terms of accumulated wealth because you both have no equity. That's what I take issue with.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If I had the downpayment for a house I'd probably be better off putting it into the stock Market. The more money you have there the more money you can make too. That's just how money works.

I also have problems with the stock market, specifically with the American idea that in order to not wallow in abject poverty as a retiree you must invest in a 401K of some sort and prop up random corporations with morals that are unbeknownst to you. I reject the idea that ""that's just how money works"" because I find a system where the wealthy stay wealthy without commensurate labor to be fundamentally immoral. That is why I prefaced my post saying I identify as a democratic socialist.

1729	"I don't disagree with this. I'm not trying to hold individuals accountable for systemic failings for all the reasons you've outlined. 

I don't think that systemic racism in the criminal justice system can be fixed by attacking cops who don't make policy or even prosecuting corrupt ones. They should be prosecuted, but I'm saying this won't fix system-wide failures.

They don't make policy and often they're viewed as relatively disposable. NYC hires like 1000 new cops each year, lol.

My point is that *some* racially prejudiced ideas held by individuals in society contribute to a political climate that either upholds the internal biases of institutions or furthers them. The ideas themselves can be held unconsciously by people who do not recognize them as racially biased. People can be *victims* of propagandist media, for example. 

To some extent, people have to think critically and purposefully to work against absorbing unconscious prejudice, toward many different groups, as we live in a racially and economically segregated society. There's a lot of polarization that can be monetized by media outlets. I'd argue this can indirectly promote institutional racism by driving people into intellectual silos.

Even unconscious absorption of these ideas hurts everyone. Racist ideas about welfare queens, which was a story used to sell benefit-slashing policies, caused low income people of all backgrounds to suffer. The effect on minorities is merely disproportionate. 

""Islamophobia,"" I'd argue, changed the dynamic Muslim communities and police departments after 9/11. People within society experience different consequences due to the promotion of certain racially biased ideas. We all indirectly suffer, I'd argue, by loosening the restrictions on police surveillance. Some people suffer more directly and immediately.

1746	"First, cycling on the sidewalk is definitely more dangerous to pedestrians than staying in the cycle lane, which is why it's banned. 

But even for cyclists, the sidewalk is a treacherous place. Cars move in a very predictable way. You can tell when they're going to speed up, brake, or make a turn. Even though an inexperienced and distracted driver could drift into a cycle path unaware, they're easy to see coming and rarely do anything unexpected. 

Pedestrians, on the other hand, are criminally insane. They'll stop, turn, and sidestep at the drop of a hat. They'll see something that would look good on their Instagram feed and crouch down to get a better angle, or wave a phone at it, arms outstretched.

Like I said earlier, I'm here to learn. Provide a source of your own to back your own point.

&gt;No, it's been fully annexed by Israel.

If you're not going to agree with the [UN that this violates international laws](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm), then that's a very big difference in premise that we have. Countries such as Japan and Spain have been outspoken against this. France is also against settlement activities, although it's tbh vague enough to be interpreted either way. Feel free to read this yourself.

&gt;All the points together, support the validity of the existence of Israel. There's no circular argument going on here.

As I have pointed out to another redditor, none of us here are against the validity of the existence of Israel. What we have an issue here (and is the CMV) is that one of the points, namely ancestral right, is iffy at best.

Your arguments go all around it without addressing this main point. Okay, except your first post, which is mainly about them being always there (some, not all - many migrated over after the establishment of Israel) and their purported claims/rights as ""Jews"".

If you're wondering why I'm so particular about this distinction, it is because the same ""ancestral claim"" have been misused in other parts of the world, most notably the Burmese Rohingaya issue. it stems from the same legacy of British colonisation and changes in boundaries/regional management that led to the influx of migrants from other countries (namely Bangladesh). The [loss of boundary between Bengal and Arakan at one point in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people#British_colonial_rule) is a major contributor to the claims of ""non-native"" people. In a post-colonial world where many people are descendants of migrants, this is just not viable any more.

So yes, perhaps unlike the OP u/temp_55_00, I'm simply asking if that one point can stand on its own. Don't keep muddling the pond by trying to sell it as a package deal with all the other points and then proclaim its validity in this package.

&gt; c. executes or incites others commit, for racial or ethnic reasons, to acts of violence against any race or group of persons of a different color or ethnic origin;

&gt; d. provides any form of support to activities directed toward racial discrimination, including by financing them; is punished with five to ten years imprisonment.

&gt; 3) Whoever constitutes, organizes or directs an organization intended to propagate ideas based on racial superiority or hatred or which promotes or incites racial discrimination, is punished with five to ten years imprisonment.

The hate crime laws in the US Code require bodily harm. This combines with the Brandenburg rules to make it so American can say racist thing without any criminal consequence. So, I suppose that in this regards the USA indeed has more freedom of speech.

Perhaps you could clarify one thing. I did mention some advantages of the Vatican over the USA with regards to perjury and defamation. So, if the Vatican has an advantage over that, and the USA has the advantage with racism, how exactly do you compare the two to determine which country is ""freer?""

But that's activism, not my actual vote. Indeed, I could champion the importance of voting and perhaps influence the election in that way, but not actually vote personally. 

And the power, the weight *I personally* give to others by not voting isn't significant. Less than not significant, it literally means nothing. The demographics in CA are just too blue. And even if they were red thirty years ago, so what? That shift can't be encouraged or stopped by my vote alone.

It's a challenge, but there're a lot of approaches, and thinking through the problem tests your creativity. In testing, you wouldn't necessarily require the rigor that a higher level math class would demand, but rather a showing that you've thought through the problem in a promising way. 

Edit: More to the point, it is not offering bounds that makes a problem good or bad. What makes a math problem good is that it has multiple approaches, and that it offers room for creativity. I mentioned the infinitude of primes earlier. I went to this pair of lectures once where the professor offered four or five separate proofs of that claim. Great stuff. Point is, it's not about the answer. It's about the getting there.

Good pickup, I meant deserves as in at the hands of another person's intent. Accidents happen, nature happens, and currently medical/technological advances cannot prevent death. 

The self defence scenario is problematic to my position. Agreed. It's just that every argument for it, has a viable counter argument. You mention difficulty to procure sufficient non lethal force, I'm going to tell you we should be making it easier than lethal force, a combination of more expensive and restricted lethal force and cheaper more effective non lethal force is something a government can solve. You say that the defenders rights are being impinged therefore the aggressor rights should be too, and I'm going to say that's not true, this isn't an equal and opposite reaction piece of physics, it's human interaction with consequences beyond that moment, and where a non life ending solution exists it should be used. Potentially inflammatory comment, but one I think worth saying; If you set out at the start of your day prepared to kill if you ""think"" someone wants to kill you that makes you the agressor. 

D. isnt about self defence, only A and E are really. ""Cold blooded revenge"" is just outright wrong. I hope we agree there. State induced revenge to ""keep the peace for the people"" is just as wrong in my opinion. See B and C. 

B. ""The courts don't work so just set all the murderers free""... ummmm really?!?!?!

A. I left out unjustified because there are no valid justifications.


I like your closing comment. It's a great summary of your position. While I agree some things are more wrong than others, in my opinion they are both still wrong enough that one should not be prepared to kill, but be prepared to avoid needing to kill. And state based violence against potentially innocent people is still cold blooded revenge by another name (and potentially killing the wrong person if you (plural ""the readers"", not you specifically) need another reason)."	19	['are being impinged', 'should be used', 'be prepared']	3	2	0.10526315789473684	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are being impinged', 'should be used', 'be prepared']	3	2	0.10526315789473684	1	34281770693	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/glfp0s/_/fqyhbk5/	1003463020	34281545027.0	2020-05-17 17:49:45	215060975765.0	tren_c	1	False	332	0	False	True	61.26

All the stuff you said above about English being so important. 

Imaging being taught English in a school setting. Is it better to start in the student's native language, and then work on things slowly and in a bilingual manner, or is it better to hand them ""Hamlet"" and say good luck, your performance is next week? I'd say that slow bilingual introduction followed by increasing levels of in-new-language instruction is the better way. 

Video games only in English are the ""Here's Hamlet"" version of learning. Video games with English and Hungarian are more like the traditional method of learning.

Where does liberals come from?; A fair amount of individuals on both sides wish to have a false sense of peace because it gives into a false narrative/ allows people to never leave out of their comfort. So, if he was criticizing liberals, the same should also apply for the other.

Secondly, the text has different interpretation, and it could be understood as "" *creating tension was necessary to the work of nonviolent protesters, and that “justice too long delayed is justice denied"".* Is this much of a difference from how MLK is seen?; People understand what MLK was doing when he was protesting (creating tension and fighting for equal rights) and the ladder of the summary is taught widely in association to him.

It isn’t the vaccine, it’s more “should I get an injection being forced on me by a government I do not trust?” That’s an question we have all had to come to grips with, and for many individuals, the answer is “no.”

As far as work is involved, the religious exemption policy comes from the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says employers must make reasonable accommodations for employees who object to work requirements because of “sincerely held” religious beliefs.

Of course, how do you work out who is sincere? Do you just “know?” It’s a tough one, because a religious belief does not have to be recognized by an organized religion, and it can be new, unusual or “seem illogical or unreasonable to others,” according to rules laid out by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

1795	"They aren't really voting in ignorance. They may not personally read every bill, but they have trusted people who do and then inform the candidates on what a bill and their riders entail (ideally, maybe not in our current politic system). But what our system is, is a way to consider everything in our large country, so some time provisions must be taken into consideration. Like a prime example is: In the 90's (I believe) there was a bill up in congress about providing funds for a bridge or something along those lines in Montana. There was also an issue in Vermont about wanting to do research on a local phenomena with squirrels. The squirrel issue was small and very inexpensive so to vote on it alone would have been moronic and a waste of time, but no one had an issue with the bill. So the squirrel bill was put as a rider on the Montana bridge bill and both got past. That is the ideology behind riders and amendments to bills. While our current system may abuse that, and yadda yadda yadda there is still a reason and a need for it.  And with your example in the additional text,  about law A and B, that's a way to help bipartisanship passing of bills, which I don't think anyone will say we have too much of right now. And I would argue that having these provisions in place still do good and should be kept for this reason. Our country is too big to do anything else, unless you go the libertarian method and dissolve the federal government. Hope this helps, I typed it on my phone so I apologize for any mistakes.

Yes that's just about the only campaign promise that he didn't deliver on.

&gt;Trump has wildly expanded the deficit and is spending money on his own vacations at a rate we've never seen before. 

He did expand the deficit but not nearly as much as Obama. If the deficit increases by less than 2% it's okay because of inflation you're not actually adding value to the deficit. Unfortunately Trump hasn't been able to get under 2% but he has stayed pretty close.

&gt;These people insensitively poke around at other people asking them ""Why are you so busy? Look at me. I'm living a carefree life so you can also do the same."" So this means that they have never struggled and don't understand why other's are struggling.

&gt;Because they rarely complain about anything. It's like they don't have burdens in their lives. It's just light and easy. So they feel no compulsion to vent out.

&gt;In the rare times when they do complain it's about something too small or trivial compared to what I've gone through and it feels annoying. ""The flight seats were uncomfortable"", ""I had to work an extra hour at work yesterday. What is the world coming to. How can bosses assign so much of work"", ""I got an offer from the top company-A and the top company-B. Both are offering me a 70% hike and both are good companies. I can't decide which one to go for. I have to make so tough decisions"".

Taking 1 and 3 and 4 there is an obvious counter-point: Robin Williams. If you didn't know the man intimately, and were only familiar with his public persona, you likely got the feeling of a goofy and carefree man who rarely complained. I feel like almost everyone did, right up until the point where he committed suicide.

Often times, the people who go out of their way to bring joy into other peoples' lives are the ones who are suffering deep down. Ditto the people who try to project how carefree their life is.

A few things that stick out to me: You're comparing everyone else's final movie to your behind the scenes and rough-cuts; or if you prefer sports, everyone else's highlight reel to your training camp, in the majority of cases. I know probably 1,000 people (not counting you fine folks on the interwebs) on some level or another, and the number of them who I think I've seen completely vulnerable and at their worst I can count on my fingers. We all put up masks to our suffering to some degree or another, because we instinctively don't want to be a burden to people, whether it's because we just don't want them to suffer too, or because we think they won't care and that'll make us feel worse.

For every ""good"" thing that you mention, I can think of a lot of bad that goes into it as well, that may affect people differently. When you see ""Parents who help pitch in when you're down on your luck"" I see ""3 months of arguments, stress, and headaches trying to get them to see why this career is slowly killing me."" just for instance (and I don't even have a set of parents who would help)"	23	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	28828448720	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/57g11h/_/d8rppe8/	314836037		2016-10-14 10:46:50		Cyberpunk_Is_Now	1	False	472	4	False	True	78.38
1813	"&gt; As I said before it's the compression. Distributers are more likely to compress game sizes to save room on a hard drive and that causes losses in audio and video quality.

I'd say it's more likely they compress for physical media, because space there has a harder limit. I still can download 50GB from Steam and that also fits on every modern hard drive. Adding multiple DVDs to the box on the other hand is more complicated and comes with addition costs, Blu-Rays still (and most likely never will be) aren't a default in computers... many don't even have a drive for anything anymore.

You also say ""more likely""... any source on that?

&gt; Also whenever you install on the cloud you're technically streaming.

Install on the cloud? When exactly does anyone install anything on the cloud? That doesn't make any sense. There was on play-via-streaming service I remember, don't even know if it still exists or if it simply failed.

&gt; As wireless technology takes over there will be more streaming in some form or fashion even if your just streaming from your PC to your TV through a LAN and that causes quality loss. I hate compression, I hate streaming, and I hate settling. If that turns me into a luddite so be it.

Well... don't do it then!?

&gt; I play, watch, read, and listen to all the media I collect, but in order to collect something you have to display and own it. Something that cannot be properly done digitally. Digital games also cannot appreciate in value, or increase in rarity.

Exactly, your hobby seems to be collecting games (or rather collecting the physical media that contains the games). That's a different/extended hobby for me. If that's your hobby, then you are obviously missing something with Steam only games. Though you can still buy (most) games boxed, so you could still collect the box.

&gt; You don't get it I can't afford the initial costs. I'm poor financially speaking, that's why I only buy things that will increase my net worth. If I save my money then buy everything at once I'm decreasing my net worth because money by itself can only depreciate due to inflation. I also refuse to settle for decent, cheap, or low end because I don't settle for anyone or anything.

Looks like your financial situation doesn't fit to your expectations for hardware. There's also not a lot to change if a part of your view basically is: ""PC gaming is not for people who can't afford a PC"", unless I would tell you to steal a computer somewhere.

&gt; If they can't even afford to produce a good game trailer why bother giving them a chance. They don't deserve my money. Also if boycotting Valve means cutting my nose to spite my face then I'll cut that sucker off and go around looking like Voldemort.

How I said: You just don't seem to be a gamer, but a person driven by principles. A game trailer has exactly zero impact on the quality of the game.

&gt; That's because so long as the port is polished and optimized the dry bones experience is always the same. It's the strengths and features of PC that makes it a better game. However I hate PC's disadvantages and it has more than what I mentioned I just didn't list them.

Most games simply won't get a port on any of the consoles you've listed. Surely a PC has disadvantages compared to consoles and handhelds, but it also has a lot of advantages.

Now obviously no one can change your view that PC gaming isn't the right thing for people **like you**, if most of the things you don't like are subjective or just principles.

Here's the problem I have with the whole ""I'm actually trans"" freakout thing: Would this be the case for literally any other thing you find unattractive having previously been the case for that woman?

Let's say you don't find fat women attractive: should any prospective romantic partner be required to disclose that they used to be 50 pounds overweight?

1817	"Mister 36 Delta coming in here to lay down the law! I apologize that the reply took so long, I really have no excuse I'm just a bad procrastinator and when I start typing long replies my eyes just glaze over a bit. 

&gt;This case overturned several DC gun laws, but left the DC gun registry in place. ""Shall not be infringed"" means, as a matter of law, that the right shall not be limited, not that guns cannot be regulated. Logically, this makes sense. We have rules that you cannot infringe on the right to vote, but allow voter ID laws in many states. A gun registry is not ideologically different than this and as a matter of legal fact does not violate the 2nd Amendment.

While I'd agree that a registration in itself would not hinder an individual’s right to bear arms I could see a case be made where it would hinder a militia’s ability to functionally operate, as the government in which citizens would be taking arms up against would have a catalog of local weapons. The goal of the second amendment, when you boil it down, is regulate the government actions through threat of civilian uprising. Whether or not that uprising would be successful is another debate all together but I fundamentally disagree that a registry wouldn't cheapen that threat. 

&gt;With the 2nd Amendment, a mandatory buyback or confiscation would be unconstitutional. This would require a repealing of the 2nd Amendment, which would mean it is the will of the people, not the government. Yes, the government could theoretically violate the 2nd Amendment, but they can also do that now. Your right is not less protected with the existence of a registry.

You speak the truth, repealing the second amendment is unlikely and the government could, in theory, violate it right now if they wanted, that being said I disagree that my rights wouldn’t be less protected with the existence of a registry. As it stands right now ownership is, more or less, private (depends on what you own, tax stamps are pretty damming). I mentioned in another comment thread that my stance on this stems from the volatility inherent in our 4 year presidential cycles. During which time new regulation either locally or federally could make once law abiding citizens now targets. My example of Hawaii’s treatment of medical marijuana card holders is what I’m basing that on. 

&gt; A complete registry would be nearly impossible, but incentivizing a registry system or punishing not registering a weapon would make a lot of people register. If a law is passed that if your gun is unregistered and though any means ends up involved in a crime, you can be charged with criminal negligence, then a lot of people will voluntarily register. 
&gt;&gt; A gun is often stolen, but if you know whose gun was stolen and can trace it back to the last owner, it makes it much easier to solve the crime, because it gives you a list of people who might have had access to do that.

All true, a registry backed by incentive would have an easier time taking off thought I still believe the number of available arms wouldn’t be much of a gate, I will concede it would affect spur of the moment crimes though. Law enforcement being more effective at their job is always a plus, no real way to argue against that. Whether or not that boon is worth potentially making yourself a target though is worth mentioning, such as what happened in [New York](https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/25/us/new-york-gun-permit-map/index.html),  though that may be taken as moving the goal post a bit.

I do agree there are positives to a registry; whether or not they can be effectively implemented nationwide (300,000,000 guns is a staggering amount) or if it’s worth the breach in privacy I’m not convinced. 

&gt; This only becomes a question when we start talking about the mechanism in which you are forced to register. Automobile registry is done under the power to regulate commerce, the same way road maintenance is a government role. Because it is regulated under commerce, activity within your own property is not considered commerce and therefore not regulated. A gun registry, on the other hand, would most likely be regulated by a criminal statute under police powers. In such a manner, they would have the right to search your property under warrant if you were hiding unregistered guns. So long as due process was followed in the enforcement, then your right to privacy is not interfered with.

This one was pedantic to start with so I have the least amount of willingness to cling to it. That being said, my point wasn’t that a search would be a breach of privacy, if due process was followed that’s all well and good, it’s that the registry itself would be.  Doesn’t the right to privacy (I know, laughable in a post patriot act America, but bear with me) guarantee that our property is our own business that we can choose to disclose? (I may be completely off base here; I’m not lawyer, if I am please fill me in)

1818	"&gt;But we should also discuss why, when confronted with all these mixed signals, Aziz did not speak up and clarify at all.


I think asking for something and not forcing it is attempting to clarify. When he got his first mixed signal (her saying slow down after he went to get to get the condom and taking a bathroom break) he asked her if everything was alright and she said she doesn't want it to feel forced. So he says let's hang out on the couch (listening to her) and she (instead of hanging out on the couch) sits in between his legs (remember she's naked and he's presumably naked). In response he motions for a BJ and she gives him one. She says she wanted a back massage (I'm guessing to get back in the mood) but he obviously didn't read it that way. I don't think its hard to see how he misread that. According to the story she felt one way but acted the opposite the whole time. As far as Aziz knows she's down for some sexual acts (she got naked, gave and received oral, etc.) and has no problems expressing when he's gone too far (she stopped him when he got the condom). I think her signals were clear.

The allegations range from groping to rape. One of his alleged victims, Anthony Rapp, was 14 years old. Spacey essentially admitted to it to Rapp on Twitter, deflecting it by using that as the time he comes out as gay. 

Spacey responded to Rapp’s allegations by issuing a statement on Twitter in which he said he owed Rapp “the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.” Spacey then added, “This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life. I know that there are stories out there about me and that some have been fueled by the fact I have been so protective of my privacy. ... I choose now to live as a gay man. I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior.”. Another unnamed 14 year old boy told the New York Times about another incident as far back as 83'. In 1985 a 17 year old boy went to the BBC. A 16 year old named Justin Dawes in 88'. When Spacey worked with the Old Vic Theater in various capacities 1995-2015, there were 20 allegations. The Old Vic itself investigated, and after talking to their lawyer advised 14 of those men and boys to go to the police.

Britannia specifically considers any belief of race itself as a form of racism meanwhile Oxford and Merriam-Webster only they consider believing in superiority or inferiority of race as racist.

1839	"I have two questions for you:

2. Is it possible that teaching a small subset of students an alternate convention, before a unanimous decision has been made to adopt that convention, will do more harm than good?

1. If you feel that we should be transitioning to tau, do you feel that teaching your students tau, as opposed to pi, is the best way to bring about that transition?

I’m not implying that tau should not be adopted, or that the convention could never change. Lets assume tau is better for now. I’m questioning your approach to instigating this transition.

Sure, maybe certain aspects of mathematics will seem slightly more intuitive to new students. But your students will be leaving your classrooms with habits formed from a convention that essentially nobody else follows. They will continuously have to mentally adjust nearly everything math related they encounter. Textbooks, papers, university lectures, assignments, conversations, etc. 

I think a reasonable argument could be made that more errors and confusion would result from this dual-usage, than from only learning to use pi.

But, more importantly, would teaching a small amount of students this alternate convention actually contribute to each field changing their conventions? Personally, I am doubtful about that. I think if any change were to occur it would need to happen by some overarching body that could bring about such an initiative, such as how SI units were introduced. I fear that rogue teachers introducing such conventions purely because of their own opinions will nullify any potential benefits that such a change could have brought."	15	['has been made', 'be adopted', 'could be made', 'were introduced']	4	4	0.26666666666666666	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['has been made', 'be adopted', 'could be made', 'were introduced']	4	4	0.26666666666666666	1	29137479057	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5umbwz/_/ddvpaq9/	353761235	29136646100.0	2017-02-17 19:54:46		Le_Tarzan	2	False	262	0	False	True	62.17

You're also assuming the chimp reacts optimally to the humans attacks and the human doesn't retaliate in any effective manner. Of course the human loses if he is fighting chimp lee head on. He doesn't lose if he is fighting a normal legless chimp with normal reaction times. 

Additionally you're are severally hampering  the chimps leverage and mobility. Without leverage all of that strength advantage is hugely diminished. More importantly it gives the human their best opportunity to play to their natural advantage over chimps. Our endurance and intelligence.

1847	"It is important to identify the motives behind criminal punishment. Sentences fall into roughly 3 categories: Frightening, Educational and Isolational.
 
A fine or short jail term is there to frighten would be criminals and dissuade them from committing an offence. This is useful for small, pragmatic crimes, like theft or anti-social behaviour, but pedophilia is a sick obsession that cannot be dismissed with a mere threat.

Educational punishments seek to rehabilitate offenders and (theoretically) are the best kind. Community service is an example. The problem with rehabilitation is that it doesn't always work. You have to balance the risks/rewards. On the one hand, you may ""cure"" someone of pedophilia, but if you don't cure them, you are exposing the public to a pedophile who may well attack again. Rehabilitation for drugtakers is commonplace because the only victim is the criminal himself, but even the *chance* of a pedophile being released prematurely is awful for the community at large.

So, Isolation is the last kind of punishment. This is for people that are so dangerous, you want to physically prevent them from attacking again. This could be a life sentence or the death penalty, but the point is, it is *permanent*. If you kill a pedophile, there is NO chance he/she will attack again, although you lose the possibility of successful re-integration into society.

In conclusion, although rehabilitation is the ideal method, if it fails it has a huge risk, whereas permanent punishment is a sure way to neutralize the threat, and so is vastly preferable."	15	['be dismissed', 'being released']	2	2	0.13333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be dismissed', 'being released']	2	2	0.13333333333333333	1	26724002567	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ec4w4/_/c9ys4cn/	84547012		2013-05-14 17:41:22		retrogradesheep	0	False	255	0	False	True	54.22

Regarding the concept of hell, I think there’s a lot of gray area between not bringing it up and telling children that kissing leads to eternal damnation.

1868	"Every single spot *is* taken by the highest of applicants at elite schools. Let's use the most competitive school in America as our example.  At Harvard:

* Respondents who identify as Asian, but not including South Asian, reported higher overall SAT scores on average, with an overall best score of 2300 out of a possible 2400. 2149 for respondents who are black or African American. The 25th percentile SAT score is 2110, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2390. 

This entire score range is within the top 4% of students in America. These are the highest of the high scores.  But even within the highest, standardized tests are pretty much designed to prevent perfect scores, so there will be slight deviations among the top.  So within the top 1% (students with a 2250 or higher), Black students are more likely to fall closer to 2250, while the students at the very highest scores are more likely to be Asian.

The distribution holds true even with the best of the best, because even among the best of the best there is slight variation 

Finally, 30% of incoming Harvard students are Asian, despite Asian people making up just 5% of the US population. Black and Hispanic people make up roughly 30% of the US population, but 23% of incoming Harvard students. 58% of the incoming students are white, 62% of the population is white.

1869	"Judging all anime and the fans based on a few screenshots and a vocal minority of the fan base is pretty funny man and a big part why normal people who like this stuff don't talk about it. Anime is a medium that encompasses all genres. It wouldn't make sense to judge all books and readers based off two lines out of 50 shades of grey and the people who loved it that walk around in bdsm gear. 

Hellsing is good imo but not the best anime to get people into the medium, especially if you don't like gore. That anime goes out of it's way to be gory and over the top. It's a pulpy action horror story about a nazi vampire, it's not ment to be grounded at all. Really, it's like the worst anime to watch if you don't want to see gore or dark themes lol. 

There's plenty of slice of life, drama, sports, cooking ect anime that has nothing to do with over sexulized, gory, or dark themed content. This may be more your speed. If you can think of it there's most likely an anime of it. 

To me it doesn't make sense to not like anime in general. I think 99% of people who say that just haven't seen or looked for an anime they are actually intrested in watching. 

I grew up watching shows like one piece, DB and DBZ, Yugioh and Naruto. To me anime was just cartoons and were presented as such as they were shown alongside American cartoons on tv. Manga is most always places right jext to comics in bookstores. Most of my generation watched at least some anime as a kid though alot of us never talk about it to those outside our groups.  

Like others have said, most anime fans are normal people. Many people who like anime don't talk about it because people will judge them as weirdoes like you do. It's the same thing with people who like dnd or pro wrestling or any other ""niche"" form of entertainment. They get heavily judged by people who don't understand it or participate in it. Normal people who like these things just don't talk about it irl or outside their homes or friend groups as to not be labeled weirdoes or be looked at different. And it perpetuates sterotypes and the apprehension around talking about these things. 

As for the differnt or strange noises in anime it all depends on the show. They are catoons and ment to be very expressive, informal and over the top. Think of how weird many American shows or cartoons would sound to foreigners. Spongebob probably sounds even crazier if you only spoke mandarin. But not all cartoons sound like spongbob as some sound like ATLAB. Some of these over the top things you may have heard are playing off established troupes specific to Japan, Japanese tv and anime. It's a whole different, foreign culture and subculture so it can take a bit of time to see the influences, trends, troupes and traditions being played off of. Some are intentionally weird, sexual, gory ect. Many others avoid that, make fun of it and even judge them."	31	['be grounded', 'are actually intrested', 'were presented', 'were shown', 'get heavily judged', 'be labeled', 'be looked', 'being played']	8	6	0.1935483870967742	1	['get heavily judged by']	1	1	0.03225806451612903	1	['be grounded', 'are actually intrested', 'were presented', 'were shown', 'be labeled', 'be looked', 'being played']	7	5	0.16129032258064516	1	36027335675	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l0f4hy/_/gjtqu4b/	1270495366	36026822400.0	2021-01-19 11:02:55		[deleted]	1	False	535	0	False	True	79.3

1875	"While consent for medical procedures for one's own wellbeing is usually undertaken by a minor's parents, your OP talks about using Gene editing for the betterment of society. When you change someones entire genome, you change more than just their own genes, you also change the genes of their children and the rest of their legacy. On this note, it is not as clear that the parents can consent for their child to do something for others. That's why I specifically mentioned organ donation; parents are typically given latitude to make decisions for their child because their primary concern should be for *their child*. If their concern is for another person, or for society at large, or even their grandchildren over their own child, it is no longer as straightforward as ""it's my baby, I can do what I want"". This isn't to say that it is completely impossible for the parent to only have the child's interest at heart, only that it is more contentious than normal when confounding factors like this are involved.

But, realistically, none of this is necessary. There are a wide array of options that make genome editing useless. I mentioned somatic cell editing for the extremely small number of genetic ailments that could not be solved another way. However, there are [plenty of more efficient, effective ways to have an unaffected child](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK447263/#sec_097)

1. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): This is already capable of being done today, and we *DO* use it when necessary. Any genetic disease that has a chance of being passed on can be screened for, leaving only healthy embryos for implantation. Not only would this approach be far safer and less expensive, it avoids modifying the embryo's genome, avoiding the issue of consent entirely.

1. Adoption/surrogacy: Sometimes, a parent is homozygous dominant for a genetic disease that is heritable for the child. Any child from that parent will have that disease. However, someone with the resources to engage in gene editing as an option would undoubtedly have the capability of approaching a surrogate or adopting. While the child might not genetically be their's, the entire point of eugenics is to change the allele frequency in the population, and if the parent is satisfied by having a child that is not theirs biologically, that is just as acceptable an outcome.

3. Somatic cell editing: like I mentioned before, somatic cell editing can be used in some situations. The idea is *not* to try and change the entire genome of a fully grown patient. Rather, only the affected tissues that actually express the atypical gene are modified. This is both a safer, more targeted way of treating a disease. additionally, this is the only way of treating de novo mutations, or mutations that are not inherited from the parents. 

As it stands now, most diseases influenced by genetics are [multifactorial](https://www.genome.gov/19016930/faq-about-genetic-disorders/), meaning there are a large number of genes that affect it. Changing those genes alone is both expensive and risky. Expensive, because each gene that needs to be changed requires a unique targeted sequence for the gene editing to specifically target that gene. Risky, because these genes are absolutely correlated with other life processes. Changing one related to, for instance, cancer risk, without changing one related to, for instance, cell replication, could lead to massive consequences when the interaction between genes isn't taken into account. This isn't a problem that can be just hand-waved away by ""understanding"" and ""confidence"". The interactions between different genes that ultimately lead to phenotypic expressions is still not really understood.

TL;DR: There are some ethical considerations with manipulating the entire genome of a person and all of their child's offspring without consent. This issue can be avoided by an array of interventions. Also, genetics is far more complicated that simple Mendelian genetics; genes are complex, and simply progressing won't make it any simpler, and it won't make gene editing have more obvious outcomes."	33	"['is usually undertaken', 'are typically given', 'be solved', 'being done', 'being passed', 'can be screened', 'can be used', 'are modified', 'are not inherited', 'be changed', 'are absolutely correlated', ""isn't taken"", 'can be avoided']"	13	12	0.36363636363636365	1	['is usually undertaken by', 'can be avoided by']	2	2	0.06060606060606061	1	"['are typically given', 'be solved', 'being done', 'being passed', 'can be screened', 'can be used', 'are modified', 'are not inherited', 'be changed', 'are absolutely correlated', ""isn't taken""]"	11	10	0.30303030303030304	1	30181835768	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/81ud90/_/dv5hhiw/	486825876	30181679898.0	2018-03-04 02:14:05		Jaysank	1	False	654	0	True	True	51.38
1876	"&gt;Due to the system that does not distribute fairly.

Capitalism distributes goods more fairly than any other system we've tried as people. We should strive for the next better one, and I think we should as a society put more emphasis on improving our economic systems. Because it's absolutely imperfect.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; People are starving while shelves are full.

Agreed, but that's more of a failure of implementation - capitalism itself says that the perfect scenario we should strive for is a system where shelves are permanently  empty. Being bought the second they are put on the system.

&gt;Choosing to criminalise them for taking food is bizarre. It goes against human empathy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Working 9-5 is not something we do naturally, it is enforced. Working in brightly lit white walled offices in the winter is not something we do naturally. So many aspects of the system pull us so far from what we have developed to do that it results in issues like mental health problems.

But once again, that's an implementation problem, some jackass somewhere thought this was the best way to squeeze productivity out of people. Capitalism only cares that you maximize production, and as a society we've slow have found way to do that or maintain production while improving our conditions, like with the rise of WFH.

1881	"&gt; I just linked you to the CA laws that specifically state how they do.

There is no religious component to any portion of marriage law, so you couldn't have linked me to it.  Saying that if someone who witnesses the document signing is religious, that this makes it a religious *law*, is a complete non-sequitur.  Like I said in another post, if you have someone who happens to be a pastor witness your will, that did not somehow turn your will into a religious document.

&gt; You can't say that a Catholic priest can marry members of his or her church according to their beliefs, but a Non-denominational one can not.

Yes, we don't say that.  Any member of any church or non-church can perform a religious marriage however they want.  There *are no restrictions on this*.  The individuals in question just can't get a marriage license which grants them a civil marriage unless they meet the eligibility requirements. 

&gt; I fail to see how it isn't embedded in the law if the law states that ship captains can marry.

You're confusing the personal identity of the certified witness with the actual legal statute.  A pastor could be a college math professor, but that doesn't mean that his personal status has somehow turned the math class into a ""religious math class"".  The actual content of the *material* is what determines whether something is religious, not what the person who is certified to perform it does in their spare time.  Civil marriages have no religious component, and the fact that you can choose a pastor to witness the signing of the license doesn't impact the status of the law any more than the math class.

&gt; I agree with you, the interpretation you have is the standard and has been the standard for some time. However, I see it as contradicting itself. I do not see the legal standing to recognize one religious belief but not the other.

I would agree, but this is only relevant to religious marriages, where, as I've previously emphasized, there are no restrictions from the government whatsoever on who can be married.  Witnessing the signing of a legal document, whether it be a will or a marriage license or a driver's license, is a completely secular role, whether or not the person doing the witnessing talks about religion in his spare time or not."	18	"[""isn't embedded"", 'is certified', 'can be married']"	3	3	0.16666666666666666	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""isn't embedded"", 'is certified', 'can be married']"	3	3	0.16666666666666666	1	26735182676	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ezoyc/_/ca5fqz8/	85646100	26735174797.0	2013-05-24 19:53:01		ThePantsParty	5	False	399	4	False	True	58.62
1882	The reason Taylor Swift is getting criticized has nothing to do with the fact that she is silent - that's just the excuse. She is a top popular pop star in an industry that is very competitive, and especially with social media, there is more and more gossip and backbiting going on. I agree that if you look at it in terms of what the actual criticism is, it's silly, but that's missing the point. If it wasn't this, it would be something else. But it's not ridiculous, as it's an expression of competitive hostility, e.g. normal human behavior, especially among females, towards other females who gain their success in part by selling sex. Since women's value in the dating scene depends almost entirely on their sex appeal, this is an area of intense competition among women that you cannot understand if you are a man. Any woman that becomes as popular as Taylor Swift by in part, selling sex, as any pop star does, is going to be threatening and negative gossip will find a channel to express itself.	7	['is getting criticized']	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is getting criticized']	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	29667329049	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6ygf9r/_/dmn5tll/	420670287		2017-09-06 13:02:14		sinsity1	1	False	180	0	False	False	57.2
1883	"&gt; I've only seen shards of it, but from my impression Wakana, aside from making clothes for Marin, does absolutely nothing remarkable that would win the latter's affections and is socially awkward and below average looking.

You certainly only have seen shards. There is a lot more depth to the relationship than you set out here.

Primarily, it is Wakana's generally friendly and curious disposition to the world as well as his ability to dedicate himself to the problem at hand that makes him attractive to Marin, who is almost the opposite. Especially in later episodes, it is especially Wakana's natural kindness and excitableness that bring the two closer together.

I would recommend watching the series if you're interested. There is a lot of interesting storytelling going on between the more fan-service-y parts. But I digress.

&gt;There are many such titles and this is nothing remarkable, but for whatever reason in this case there seem to be an unusually high number of fans that claim otherwise and claim that Wakana is, in fact, very good looking, claiming that his face is handsome and that he's tall, which he is, but I don't think being tall alone with bad posture and what I consider a bad looking face makes one good looking.

Wakana is realistically handsome - he is not caricaturized as a ""handsome male prince"", as is often the case in anime, but does have some traits that could make someone see him in a good light. He certainly is plain, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's not handsome, to a degree.

&gt;I'm simply not seeing how he is attractive. From where I stand he's only below-average looking, but also intentionally so to make him more relatable to the audience.

He is ""below-average looking"" in anime terms, yes. This is primarily the case because in ~~anime~~ nearly all media, most people are *significantly* more handsome than would be realistic. As I've said, Wakana seems more realistic and, compared to humans in general, is probably around average-looking with his height being the most remarkable feature.

Again, however, it is not his looks that make him attractive - it's his personality. 

Depending on which demographic you're looking at, he becomes more relatable due to his backstory than his looks; if you look at it generally, he is an antisocial nerd that specialises and spends all of his time with a single hobby, to the demerit of pretty much everything else in his life. This culture of specilisation is somewhat common in japan (and perhaps more asian countries), so I'm sure there are quie a few people like him. The show also shows that he is still a mostly regular person any by no means flawless.

So, overall, I would categorize him as a realistically average-looking guy that is mostly attractive not due to his looks but due to his personality. There is always *some* escapism in any piece of media, so this is definitely the case here, but I don't think singling out his looks as an example is sound."	23	['is not caricaturized']	1	1	0.043478260869565216	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is not caricaturized']	1	1	0.043478260869565216	1	39384080631	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/tvz3e4/_/i3c9j3r/	1807224556		2022-04-04 08:38:28	444217340146.0	AleristheSeeker	6	False	508	3	False	True	56.59

   * If you do not subscribe to any religious beliefs, there may not be any predetermined meaning to life or any afterlife. However, that doesn't mean that people cannot create their own meaning in life. Also, there is really no way to definitively prove that there is no afterlife.
* Achieving goals do not create happiness
   * Achieving goals may not create a permanent state of happiness, but if you don't place that expectation on it, then you can certainly still derive satisfaction from each goal you accomplish.
   * There are also other ways in life that you can create happiness, such as through connection with others, activities that you do purely for leisure, or movies/books/art in other forms that you consume.
* Goals, achievements, and distractions will only run out
   * I think this is only true if one spends their entire life focusing on achievements or distractions, or if they place the expectation of happiness on those things. Goals and achievements will likely shift over one's lifetime, but that doesn't mean they will necessarily run out.
* Learning new skills is useless without a reason or application to use them
   * I think that the current hustle economy can sometimes make us believe this—that everything we do has to be ""useful"" in order to improve ourselves or make us more money. However, I think there is something inherently ""useful"" about learning new activities that you simply enjoy and that bring you happiness. Maybe you aren't using them to get ahead, but you are using them to improve your life and happiness.
* Rising to the top has more negatives than positives in life, especially in today's world of corruption.
   * There are certainly some undeniable benefits of ""rising"" in life, such as stability. However, this idea may not be completely untrue.

and that's a strawman created by not using something very basic like the principal of charity. no there is no loophole here unless you make your opponents say someting they clearly don't believe. 

http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/charity.html

&gt;The humanity principle as put forward by Richard Grandy is that we should initially interpret a different philosophical point of view in accordance with the assumption that the interrelation of belief and reality being expressed is similar to our own. As Donald Dennett explains the principle of humanity, ""[O]ne should attribute to [the person's whose view we are attempting to understand] … the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances.""

do you really think when they say ""child killer"" they mean someone doing 35 in a 30 zone? I hope not because that's just a stupid position for your opponents to take. why not use the logical definition of child killer in this context aka **child murderer**!. Child murder as child killer solves all these facile objections. I just don't understand why you would assume otherwise.

&gt;  but it's a possible loophole if alcohol or drugs were involved, 

you already said it's not a valid example so how does this help? 


&gt;  I cannot for the life of me see this being applied equally across genders like this.

look at Virginia's law. This is how it works in practice: especially henius or depraved acts get the death penalty while others get other punishments. I'm accepting the ""romeo and juliet"" problem as legitimate because they involve people labeled sex offenders but obviously model legislation would attempt to target henius sex offences. the problem is you arent criticizing proposals they have actually made and instead confine yourself to attacking views that pretty exclusively would obviously not be included in any law they passed or put forward with the teacher thing being the only possible exception. 

&gt;where the lines are drawn

again it's just a heap problem. yes wherever you draw the line you can say ""well if someone 1 day older or 1 day younger is involved it's unfair to them"" but that's just part of the paradox. on some level we just need to define the heap and accept a marginal case being treated the same will get different punishments (and we can solve your anti death concern by drawing the lines so some people who ""deserve"" death get a non capital punishment). i'm just not very interested in sorites objections. 

again why can't we just resort to looking at US law. before scotus ruled it unconstitutional louisiana made [aggravated rape"" a capital crime](http://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2006/146/78529.html). that includes a child rapists can die provision

&gt;(4)  When the victim is under the age of thirteen years.  Lack of knowledge of the victim's age shall not be a defense.

and of course a jury has too actually decide that the punishment should be actualized. now we can argue if 13 is too high or low but it's clear that the state can set a different age for capital rape than the age of consent and this just completely avoids the 14/15 problem (well not completely since it is a heap paradox). so your assumptions fail.

That depends on how you present it.  A conversation shouldn’t be thought of as rude.  If you just make a snarky comment and/or ignore them and stay on your phone, that would be rude.  I’m suggesting you ask questions, get a dialogue going.

Of course, there is the possibility that they’re saying things like this because they care about you and are worried.  It’s been a long time since I was a teenager, but I know my view of the world was completely different than it is now.  I might have been making the same argument you are.

In the strictest sense, I can agree with the idea that voting implies consent to be ruled in a state with free and fair elections. But most people don't vote. 

&gt;I wonder why we vote then? This certainly is a legitimizing process.

I think another important reason is that it's just how the system works. People and governments both want stability and consistency in how things run. If we lived under a hereditary monarchy, the move to representative democracy would be INCREDIBLY disruptive for a lot of people and, as such, resisted by some portion of the population, as we saw with the European revolutions. So while elections, or inheritance, do have a legitimizing aspect to them (at least sometimes), I don't know that we can boil that down to consent alone. 

Besides, there are hundreds of thousands of people who [don't consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) to living under US jurisdiction, so voting certainly doesn't imply consent to them.

Assuming that there are no flaws however, I have two questions.

a) Why would companies hire men at all, if they have to spend more money?

b) Since it is illegal to have a demonstrable pay deficiency attributable to a protected class, why has no high profile legal action been taken? And if it has, why does the problem persist?

These two questions are the main reasons I am skeptical of any pay gaps, so if you can answer them, I am willing to concede the point after a little research on my part.

1914	"As someone who was formerly obese and also was addicted to a couple of substances, I have a hard time believing your excuses.

I used eating as a coping mechanism when my parents got divorced and I watched our family fall apart.  Eating was pleasurable to me and was also something I could control as I couldn't control any aspect of my family life any more because my parents both tried to use me as a pawn to get dirt on each other and to hurt each other emotionally.  Food became a habit to me.  My parents yelling, I ate.  If I started thinking about what was going on around me, I ate.  If I started feeling anxious because of my instability, I ate.

After a while, I realized that I had gained 125 pounds in two years, from a very underweight 155 to 280 pounds and that I had a problem so I did something about it.  I stopped eating candy and drinking soda and milk, and I stopped making crackers loaded with peanut butter or cream cheese as a snack every hour or so.  It sucked, I felt hungry a lot and my body wanted food constantly.  I thought about food a lot, but it was easy to push out of my mind with activities, such as going for a walk or driving around with my friends.  I dropped down to a healthy 190.

When I got to college my emotional problems, stemming from both witnessing my parents' divorce and other anxiety problems previous to that incident, were still unresolved.  Now I had unresolved emotional problems, my place in the world was being questioned, *AND* I'm alone in a new and strange place.  I started smoking weed and cigarettes a lot more frequently, drinking alcohol almost every day, and experimenting with any drug I could get my hands on.  That's when I discovered DXM, a dissociative that removed my emotional pain.  I could still ""feel"" the emotions, they just could not impact me.  I convinced myself that since I could examine my mental state ""objectively"" that this drug could some how fix me, so I began using the drug every weekend.  Then every three days. I was up to 800 to 900 mg every day.  I stopped bathing more than once or twice a week.  I stopped eating food that wasn't from a vending machine or wasn't a cigarette.  I stopped doing my classwork.  I stopped reading.  I stopped going to parties, unless my friends would drag me to one.  I stopped everything.  Everything but dex, and brushing my teeth.

I started failing all of my classes and I lost a few friends while the friends I still had were growing concerned enough to start trying to talk to me.  I blew them off, of course, because I was fixing myself.  This went on for the entirety of my freshman year, and into my sophomore year.  I had to go to several academic probation meetings because my GPA had fallen to a 1.9 and I had been threatened with getting expelled. Even in my fucked up mental state, I realized that this was a bad thing and the cause just *might*, possibly be because of dex.

Quitting was hell.  I had no real physical withdrawal symptoms but my mind was in a state of constant anxiety to the point where I thought I was going to have heart attacks.  I was sweating all the time and I could hear people constantly talking shit about me, laughing at me, and plotting to fuck my shit up.  I know that that shit was a product of my anxiety now, but back then I didn't fully understand that and dex took that away.  I craved a release from this anxiety and I knew how to do it.  How to get away.  All I had to do was go to the store and steal a max cough, a bottle of robogels and a zicam.  It was easy.  Just walk in, remove the box, and pocket the product.  I could do that.  My body hurts.  I'm scared.  I know how to end this.  I know how to end this. I know how to end this.  Everyone is invading my mind.  It can stop.  I can feel peace again.  My stomach is cramping.  I'm going to shit myself.  Why feel this pain?  

It was easy to slip.  I slipped a lot.  I had to feel fear a lot.  I had to feel pain a lot.  I had to feel failure a lot.  I had to murder my god.

I still feel pain.  I still feel failure.  I still think about dex every day.  It's been ~~six~~ eight years since I quit.

So when you equate overeating with addiction, my only response is fuck you.

Fuck.

You.

1917	"&gt;A monopoly is the inevitable result of capitalism.

Yet a *persistent and rent-seeking* monopoly is the inevitable result of *government regulation*. 

&gt;Monopolies will always form in a laissez-faire capitalist system, much like water will always flow downhill.

However, when a monopoly forms in a free market system, the monopoly must continue to be the best possible service or product provider, because without government's regulatory protections, *if the monopoly are not the best provider, a competitor will emerge!* You see, a monopoly is not *inherently* a bad thing, if the monopoly *does* provide the best output at the best price. This is only a problem in two circumstances: The monopoly does *not* provide the best output at the best price, and it is not trivial for a new competitor to emerge. Neither of these are concerns in a free market, but are massive concerns in a regulated market that creates obstacles to competition. 

&gt;Once a monopoly is formed, they tend to just extract rent. In other words, they give a shitty service but they're so big they can prevent others from competing while still grabbing up huge bags of money.

*Only when a government exists to protect the monopoly from competition.* In a free market monopoly, this rent-seeking would be extinguished quickly by the inevitable emergence of competition that *is not* rent seeking. 

&gt;It's capitalism with strict government controls

These create market failures and monopolies.

Governments do not ""reign in"" monopolies, governments *protect* monopolies. See: health insurance exemptions from anti-trust regulation.

1919	"The key is that our friend the Atheist can believe there are other mechanisms with higher prior probabilities for this lottery assignment than a Divine entity matching us up.

Specifically, I'd say most Atheists believe that the self is a product of our body, brain, hormones etc.. and those are shaped by our experiences. Given that egg X was fertilized by sperm Y, the probability that I have my body, endocrine system, and nervous system is 1. Now given that I have this body and I was exposed to the exact set of circumstances Q, the probability that my brain and body would produce my experience of myself is also 1. If I had a different Q, I would be a different person and my self as it is now would not exist.

In short, the probability that my body was assigned to myself randomly at birth is 0, the probability that any other mechanism assigned my body to myself is 0, and the probability that my self developed as my body went through my experiences is 1 and that puts us right at the front of the statisticians licence plate ""What are the chances I'd be me with my given genetic material and life experiences?""

See, I knew that there was probably an audience since they were ""quirky"" about it, but at the end of the day they're reading you an ad. To be honest, it's worse(!) for me since 1. They obviously are reading out of obligation and 2. It's so casual that it makes it hard to know when you've skipped everything.

He owned slaves but treated them well and released them. But ig it was a lifetime of bad, since he did own them his whole life.

What your saying about the response of the world's nations to Hydra is actually a pretty good argument. The reason why I think this may be possible however, is if Hydra's first strike is brutal enough it could put down all actors who'd even have a chance at doing so.

Hydra was able to infiltrate S.H.E.I.L.D as such, they have to be pretty politically savvy. Of course they'd expect a counter from Russia/China, so they'd defiantly target them as well.

I do have to buy at least 1,000 calories. But I don't have to buy it from store A. If store B is cheaper, I will buy it from them. Luckily for store B, they just cut their wages for employees to $3/hour, and this was their biggest expense. They dropped prices to get customers from stores A, C, and D to shop at store B instead. Stores A, C, and D, retaliate by doing the same thing. Now wages may have dropped, but so did the cost of an essential: food.

This is what I am getting at. Pretty much every essential has boat loads of competitors, and they're all operating on thin margins. Even a slight edge against the competition would result in huge boosts in sales. This is of course easily mitigated by contacting store A, C, and D and calling a truce, so nobody drops prices. But that is anti-trust collusion and is highly illegal.

Only companies with little or no competition are price-insensitive to wage reduction (or so I would think, not being an economist). Since companies that distribute/sell essentials pretty much employ minimum wage workers, we ought to see a dramatic decrease in price with a decrease in those wages.

&gt;Someone needs to stock shelves, but it doesn't matter very much to the grocery store who it is. You might be an excellent shelf-stocker, but the difference between excellent and satisfactory just isn't that big, so you individually don't have a ton of value to the company. They'd rather have you than someone average, but not by much.

Wouldn't that just result in that job having wages race to the bottom? But eventually it has to hit a point that nobody is willing to do the job, even the desperate. We also have welfare programs, so it isn't like people will starve if they don't take the $0.30/hr job. In fact, welfare offers leverage.

1961	"Do a google search for transracial adoptions, that's really the first usage of the term.  It's actually somewhat controversial, especially when rich people adopt poor children from another country as some sort of virtue signaling.   

Transracial in the context you describe here, ""a white person, who for some reason believes that they are truly black, and actually changes their skin tone to be that of a black person."" isn't so much of a thing. People with a transracial upbringing don't do this.

A black person who passes for white doesn't believe they are actually white. There are first hand accounts written in books about this (one is called Passing by Nella Larsen) - If they claim to be white, they are probably doing it to avoid discrimination, not because this is what they believe themselves to be.  

All of this is 100% cultural.

The decision to make this change cannot be based in biology in any way.  It's impossible.  This is why we rarely see it.
It's something they are making up for some reason, that reason doesn't really matter, it's objectively 100% in the person's head. 
Maybe the person has a good reason, maybe not.

The thing is, such people can be convinced to not change their bodies, and they can be convinced that they are not that race with no negative psychological effects.  Convincing them of this probably makes their lives better.

Anti-trans people tend to try to make the comparison because they often believe that being transgender is something in that person's head and suggest that trans people should not transition.

Trans people on the other hand, can't be convinced or converted to be a different sex without harming them. This has been tried and it generally wrecks the person - giving them or worsening gender dysphoria.  There are accounts of children raised as the other sex, and they invariably have a bad time - it wrecks them psychologically.  Even committing suicide.  One woman tried to live as a man for a year and had to check herself into a psych ward at the end because it wrecked her, another kid had a botched circumcision.

1966	"&gt;But what if I imagined that ""monstrosity of metal"" as something composed of modern metal pipes like those used in plumbing? Because that is what I think about when I imagine ""metal""? It wouldn't make sense given the medieval context of the book, but I have no prior understanding that metal pipes are not suppose to exist in these contexts. All in all, I have constructed a visually ""freaky"" idea of the artifacts and the cultural environments of a song of ice and fire. By needing to utilize my imagination, I have also hindered the development of my understanding of such a setting.

Not really. It's strange for you to imagine some Mario-inspired pipe disaster, especially considering it's explicitly stated the throne is made of melted down swords, but you're losing nothing if you do so. The character will interact the same way, the same questions will come about and all that.

&gt;Great insight. I do remember being able to experience those much more intensely when I was reading the written version of another fantasy story. Details such as the metallic taste of blood and how the character feels and thinks about it is rarely expressed in visual-oriented storytelling.

Exactly, which is why most art people will agree the written word is a superior medium for many character-based stories. (Especially so very grande, intricate ones that would be heavily constrained by budget in run-time and scope of what could be represented. Even with many hour-long episodes per season Game of Thrones is leaving out a slew of things that were in the book that added to the characters and world.)

&gt;But I don't think it's impossible to express these ""smells, tastes, and feelings of storming a beach under fire"" visually with the help of sound. Is it really impossible to express the ""adrenaline, the fear, the anxiety and the feel of your heart beating as though it'll break your chest"" in movies?

You can certainly hype your audience - whether with well chosen words or an audio-visual bit, but you can never replicate what the character is feeling really, and my point is that that's rarely the goal anyway. 

If I do something terrible to a character to make you sad I'm just using your empathy with an established character to put you in a certain mood. If I write in an unexpected twist to the story that'll induce some excitement and surprise in you.

We don't go to the movies or read books to pretend we're characters and feel exactly as they do, we go to have an experience that is our own which is simply brought on by empathizing with a character in a struggle or whatever.

I think it's pretty easy to prove that's so - how often are stories presented in a second-person perspective? Very rarely. Authors rarely wish you to be a character in the world, they wish to make you an observer in this world and have you come into a disinterested party.

&gt;What a highly abstract experience to convey. I guess visual media would be too concrete to allow for such subjective experiences,

Plenty of films have managed to creatively manage to keep the monster - whether it's a literal monster or an abstract one - out of the frame and do the same thing.

A book just takes this concept further as it's up to us to see everything. If the author says the city is a grand labyrinth of glass towers reaching into the sky then you'll see something amazing.

If a movie or TV show has to produce an image of a city described as such it'll nearly always fall flat because we can imagine much more majesty, enchantment and wonder in our heads than any props or CGI team will have time to create.

Quarth in Game of Thrones, for example, really disappointed compared to the city as described in the books in my opinion. They simply didn't have the time to show intricate carvings on all 3 walls for a 3 second shot whereas the book can mention it with no budget at all and my imagination will quickly provide a great image of it.

&gt;Then I find that very delusional. I think of stories as something we can learn from, and not particularly the kind of ""learning"" where we learn about subjective experiences and emotions but the kind of ""learning"" where we could ready ourselves for possible scenarios in our lives.

Yes, often the experience includes that too. I didn't mean to say it's purely an emotional masturbation, there can be an overarching theme or message or whatever and the emotions are meant to reinforce it. (Like telling us about how horrible villain X and showing it through the torments inflicted on protagonist A so we learn that fascist, racist dark wizards and their ideas are bad.)

Still, though, why does 'learning' require that we see things exactly as the author did? Why does it require a story grounded in reality?

Stranger in a Strange Land manages to get some ideas out there despite being based on an individual that defies physics and biology. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has some meaningful points even if it takes place in a world that's pretty much an absurdist comedy.

1975	"&gt;Could you try tackling the fire example?

Sure, but rather than going through each and every example, I think it might be useful to introduce a more mathematical concept of negligence. I used the concept of unreasonableness before, but let's unpack that a bit. Let's say you are acting unreasonably where the probability of a bad outcome multiplied by the harm of that outcome exceeds the cost of protecting against the outcome.

You set up a coal walk inside your house? That is probably like 50% likely to burn your house down, a loss of (let's say) $100,000. Or you could spend $20 to hire a guy to move the coal to your backyard and do it there instead. So, $100,000 * 0.5, or $50,000 is your expected loss, vs. $20 to avoid the loss. That is ridiculously negligent.

You leave some matches out and your kid starts a fire? Well, this time the likelihood that this happens is pretty low, maybe like 0.1%. But the loss is the same, $100,000. And the cost of securing your matches is pretty low, maybe a few minutes of your time each time you use a match. Let's call it $20 worth of your time again. So this time your expected loss is $100,000 * 0.001, or $100, vs. $20. You are still negligent, but it is a closer call this time.

Lightning and automated sprinkler time. Let's say the probability that your house burns down due to lighting striking it while you are away is one in a million. Like seriously, this almost never happens. The cost of a sprinkler system is $10,000. Your house is again worth $100,000. So $100,000 multiplied by 0.000001 gives you an expected loss of $0.10, vs. a cost to avoid of $10,000. It is not even close to negligent to not have installed the sprinklers. It is not reasonable to spend $10,000 to avoid an expected loss of 10 cents.

I'm not going to go through every example but this is a basic framework you can use to assess negligence, and it is roughly the one used in the US legal system (although with quite a bit more wishy-washiness than my strict mathematical approach)."	25	['one used']	1	1	0.04	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['one used']	1	1	0.04	1	29849595815	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7c5flr/_/dpnofjb/	443672127	29849517418.0	2017-11-11 05:17:36		EvilNalu	2	False	368	1	False	True	84.47
1976	"Here are a few of the problems I have with the sequels.

* The original movie covered most of the philosophical ground of the sequels, and the sequels didn't do it as well -- the sequels had a lot of people standing around and talking.
* The sequels missed an opportunity to correct the single biggest problem of the originals, the conservation of energy problem, and offer some explanation *other* than a power source for why the humans are enslaved.
* Frankly, the AI is even more interesting in the first one -- the agents really seem *robotic,* and it's almost like Agent Smith's very human emotions of anger and disgust are surprising, maybe even a glitch. The sequels have *tons* of AIs that seem entirely too human -- it's an interesting premise, but not one that belongs in the same universe as the first movie.
* The action scenes drag on too long, *and* the philosophy drags on too long, with relatively little plot development in that time. The first movie had less of a budget and probably more creative oversight, and I think that actually *helped,* because the sequels seem like the Wachowskis have gotten too big to edit -- kind of like George Lucas with all his Special Editions and prequels.
* The big cliffhanger of the second movie -- Neo stopping the Sentinels at the end -- is never resolved. There are hints that this is all within yet another Matrix, and there are other theories, like maybe the humans are all machines too... and this is just never explained. And all this undermines the idea of the original Matrix movie where we all just have to wake up from that one simulation.
* Neo ends up as Jesus somehow. Not that the original movie is free of religious subtext -- there are *tons* of hidden references to all kinds of things -- but this is just beating us over the head with symbolism.
* For that matter, the fact that there are sequels at all, and that they involve Neo doing Kung Fu, undermines the ending of the original movie. Neo *flying away* at the end of The Matrix is supposed to show that he's transcended The Matrix to the point where he can do anything, where he's coming for the Machines and to free humanity and no one can stop him. That was the perfect moment to end, but now, his stopping-bullets ability just means people have to fight him with kung fu instead of gunplay.
* Saving Trinity only to let her die again in the next movie makes us feel cheated.

Now, for all their flaws, I enjoyed them, and there are things they could've done to make it work *much* better -- eliminate the subway-station-between-worlds and other weirdness that makes no goddamned sense and is never explained, eliminate Smith-in-a-human-body, make Neo *much* more powerful, and instead of other programs, maybe these are other escaped humans. Or even just give us the same plot, but edit down some of the overlong action scenes and repetitive dialog, especially the Smith/Neo dialog, that would be epic if there wasn't so much of it. Smith's speech on ""purpose"" is about exactly as long as it needs to be, for example.

All that, and they were attached to The Matrix. If they were merely *mediocre,* instead of riddled with serious flaws at even the *conceptual* level, they'd still be hated for tarnishing that legacy. As it stands, it's understandable why [people hate them](https://xkcd.com/566/). So while I enjoyed them, I still almost wish we didn't have them.

1982	"&gt;OP is ""not even wrong"", but I'm too lazy to be bothered with hashing out why at length when it doesn't matter because the means of disproving it is philosophy and has already been presupposed to be a cognitive error/sex (question begging), so I'll just drop a few short quips. (Yeah, these are short for me.)
&gt;Doesn't the OP presume that people should agree with him/her and believe he/she is right because he/she believes that he/she is indeed right, a prescriptive proposition, which would be, you know doxastic ethics, which would be, you know, philosophy? I mean, if there isn't such a thing as doxastic ethics, then there is no reason why anyone should believe anything. So it doesn't matter if the OP is even able to show he is correct. (Which presumably he can't because soundness and consistency are concepts we inherit from philosophy, you know, logic, semantics, philosophy of language, representation, etc.) There is no reason why we should ever believe him/her. Actually it is probably just a him. I don't run into a lot of women that argue that intellectual pursuits in the humanities are just expressions of sexual reproduction.

I don’t believe that people “should” agree with me. Only that I am right and that this complex descriptive position is true.

&gt;Arguing eliminative materialism is doing philosophy. It's kind of an absurd and self-contradictory route to take given that you have to do philosophy in a meaningful, non-reductive way to arrive at the conclusion that it is meaningless and reductive.

This is a genetic fallacy. Philosophy is an involuntary activity that after engaging in enough one will understand its futility.

&gt;So, since philosophy is divested of the episteme of its claimed domain, ethics just reduces to some social survival efficiency mechanism, I guess, so there is no actual reason why people shouldn't just kill someone for being an eliminative materialist because people are irrational and like art, culture and philosophy? I mean, given we're default moral nihilists because we have to accept that morals are just expressions of social survival mechanisms and not actual normative content...murder is actually okay if it helps you better survive. And if killing eliminative materialists helps the general public better survive, then it would be okay? Right? Since it can neither be moral nor immoral to do so, given ethical prescriptions are just expressions of social-psych mechanisms. I entreat the OP to demonstrate why someone shouldn't go around killing people if it increases their survival without using ethics that has so casually been reduced to sexual reproduction and errors. I also entreat the OP to answer why people shouldn't just rape each other if ethics reduces to expressions of biological fitness and sexual reproduction.

Ethics is entirely pragmatic under this system however since it is individualistic with individuals acting as proxies for several genes the good of the general public doesn’t matter. However inclusive fitness mandates altruism and the economies of scale gained from the social contract enable mandate a degree of cooperation although not as much as human rights advocates promote. There is no problem with rape or with killing furries as long as it maximized biological fitness of the individual who is acting.

&gt;Define ""cognitive flaw"" without utilizing concepts in philosophy. Go!

A part of the process of cognition which results in a certain result and if the thinker is made aware of it then they will adjust their actions and get a different outcome with the cognitive error no longer happening, and this is independent of the outside world being something that occurs solely cognitively.

&gt;Also, how do you know your words are meaningful without philosophy? So I challenge the OP to demonstrate that his/her entire argument is meaningful without any philosophy of language. I mean, why are your words meaningful at all? Where does all that meaning come from in the world?

My words are meaningful since they are sequences of sounds/symbols that are transmitted in certain contexts and those contexts have certain patterns to them and the symbols elicit certain responses.

&gt;Here's the grand challenge for the OP.
&gt;How do you know that your position is not a cognitive error?

I don’t. I postulated a model in which it wasn’t because it was the absence of cognitive errors. Anecdotally all examples I have seen confirm this but I am yet to engage in any serious research on this position and I would consider it unfeasible at the moment. 

&gt;Actually, how do you know anything at all? You are not allowed to answer that question as you have eliminated epistemology.

I don’t know anything but I still have memories and they affect my actions in certain ways.

Last comment:
&gt;&gt;When say this I mean that a human who has a sufficient amount of information will set their life purpose as being to pass on their genes either directly through reproduction or indirectly through kin selection.
&gt;This descriptive statement is scientifically unverifiable for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the fact that predictive psychology is irreducibly indeterminate for individual human beings, the fact that given a single human example, there is no way for said example to disprove the OP's theory because any deviation would be explained as an error in the example, and the fact that ""purpose"", according to OP's argument cannot be defined because to attempt to do so would require the kind of deliberation whose quality and success at parsing knowledge is the domain of philosophy. That and ""purpose"" or ""function"", folks, is what we call a teleological end in the philosophy biz. The human being cannot be defined as having a purpose without philosophy because without a philosophical understanding, the human has no telos. There is then no reason why a human should dedicate him/herself to reproduction or anything at all. There are no shoulds and the human has no end.

I could just to a hypothesis test and see whether I fail to reject the null hypothesis. Cognitive errors are difficult to eliminate but once we gain sufficient understanding of the human mind they will be very possible to eliminate. I do have a strict definition of what constitutes a cognitive error.

&gt;But not only is the OP's argument scientifically unverifiable, it is, according to his/her own argument, meaningless.
&gt;Even presuming that it wasn't unverifiable (which, mind you, it is), there isn't any actual evidence to support this suggestion, so, if the op is a rational follower of scientific methodology, he/she should be completely agnostic to it, not consider it his/her view.

The idea of scientists always being completely neutral towards ideas without evidence is not the case. In most cases a scientist will think up a theory and think that it is a better theory and then they will do research to find evidence to support or refute it.

And I don't think the co-conspirator is likely. I think someone else already brought up the door being propped open to allow a breeze because the AC was broken. Something innocent and unrelated is usually the source from my experience.

For example, supper common is that an exit only door is closest to employee parking and someone taped over the latch mechanism to save 30 second off their daily walk from the parking lot. See this type of thing all the time.

That said, electronically activated bolt locks and other features are apparently standard at schools in other countries and are not common in the US... So the argument that measures to make schools a ""hard target"" shouldn't be discussed when the ""real problem"" is lax gun laws in the US... Well apparently it's also lax security measures and construction. A thorough investigation is key to finding these things, and investigators must be theory agnostic so they can follow the evidence and wherever it leads *in this particular case* regardless of if the particular case also lives in a broader context. 

Then we could see trends like ""hey all the shootings took place in a country with loose gun laws, granted. But they also took place in schools built prior to the passage of X regulation concerning us of auto-locking security doors and command locked classroom security doors (basically a way for a single person to pull an alarm in the admin office and lock all classroom doors at once (from the hall, you can still open them from inside in case of an erroneous activation))."" 

That is just a spit-balled idea related to the security door theory BTW but I see those types of data points in my investigations all the time where the lack of step in a procedure or the lack of a certain industry standard feature on a legacy piece of equipment ends up being responsible for numerous similar events around the country that were never connected because...

I agree gender shapes who you are as a person and shapes your experiences. These people are shaped by their experience of being who they are, non-binary, and will continue to exist whether or not you recognize them.

Your lack of willingness to accept someone's identity marker is exactly the same as someone having lack of willingness to accept your identity marker as bisexual. If no body believed you were bisexual, you still would be. You not believing in non binary people doesn't change the fact that they're everywhere and have been for a long time. 

Again, no one here can convince you of anything given the rules of reason and spirit you follow so I will share once more before I wish you good luck on your journey..

It's really quite the opposite. Countries are being more and more nationalistic. The chance that, for example, China and the US will ever merge seems... utterly impossible. 

Russia is trying to do the ""let's conquer nearby states and recreate a continent-wide hegemony"" trick... and utterly failing because of the support of other countries and the UN in *preventing* such ""consolidation by force"". 

The UN isn't getting more powerful in terms of being a ""one-world government"" at all. They're complete inept if that's even their goal... which it isn't. It's founded on cooperation *between nations*, not governing or merging them. 

The very fact that you only have its ""*NON* Governmental Organizations"" to point to reinforces all these points. 

There's no trend towards one world government, only to international coordination and a blending of cultures that is inevitable where communication is pervasive.

You can't accept a recommendation from someone if you don't know if they share the same gaming values as you. That's why you really shouldn't base your decisions on a simple aggregate number.

Sometimes a single attribute of a game will be cited as both a positive and negative by different reviewers. One will say a game is bad because it is too difficult, while another will say it is good because it offers a challenge.

That is why I always have a quick look at the most helpful reviews in both recommended and not recommended categories so I can gauge how the breakdown of reviews should be weighted for my gaming preferences.

I used to do the same thing with reviews on Metacritic. I would look at a selection of the highest and lowest rated reviews to get a more useful feel for the game than if I just read the average rated reviews.

In fact, there have been many times when I have been convinced to buy a game based on a negative review because the things they complained about were exactly what I look for in a game. The opposite has also happened.

So you don't need to have any individual review on Steam to be complete. If one is overly negative then it will probably be balanced by another's overly positive review. Only when you know the extreme positions can you accurately tell which are the balanced reviews.

The reviews I find useless are the ones that don't tell you why they gave their rating. There are too many reviews that just say ""No"". They are the ones that skew that rankings because you have no idea if their choice of recommended or not recommended was based on anything valid at all."	16	['will be cited', 'should be weighted', 'have been convinced', 'be balanced']	4	4	0.25	1	['be balanced by']	1	1	0.0625	1	['will be cited', 'should be weighted', 'have been convinced']	3	3	0.1875	1	29494363134	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6l8xfq/_/djs6k8u/	398485574	29494235335.0	2017-07-04 18:40:45		GadgetGamer	10	False	317	0	False	True	68.3
2007	"Δ So for money I was thinking like mass funds, just how other open source websites work, but I haven’t thought about the details of how this (very important) aspect would work, and thank you for bringing it up. Though if this became a thing, Sci hub wouldn’t be relevant anymore, so maybe they’d be interested in working on this instead.

About things like acceleration due to gravity I think researchers going through just titles know that that’s been done enough, and not to pay too much attention to it. And it’s not upvotes that should highlight research papers, but peer reviews. And I think the algorithm can be such that credibility or importance can matter more in highlighting research papers. So people who have PhDs or papers that are backed by people with PhDs can make more of a difference than what just regular commenters say. But yes, all this would probably need a bunch of moderators and people who work on creating and maintaining the website. But maybe the change in the incentive system, which doesn’t force researchers to be pressured to keep publishing, maybe gives researchers more time to contribute to stuff like this, and maybe can reward contributing more toward this?

Edit: Sorry forgot to address the last part. So about visibility, once this open access website becomes the norm, wouldn’t everyone look for research there?

2011	"Alright, looking at Australia's numbers, it looks like the initial wave peaked at around 400 new cases per day in late March. Let's use this as our estimate for what happens with unrestricted travel for everyone and no one vaccinated or infected.

The Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective, which is to say that it prevents 95% of cases, and 5% get through anyway. 15% of our 400 new cases per day estimate becomes only 20 new cases per day. But even that's too high to be accurate. That's assuming the number of people travelling unrestricted is the same as before the pandemic, but that'll only happen when everyone who wants to travel is vaccinated (which will effectively be when everyone is vaccinated).

Australia has vaccinated maybe around 10% of their population. That means the restrictions are only lifted for that 10% of people (compared to everyone not having restrictions pre-pandemic). So 10% of our previous number gives us an estimate of a mere 2 new cases per day.

Seeing as Australia's current numbers fluctuate between 5 and 20 new cases per day, an extra 2 new cases per day hardly seems significant enough to be called another wave.

Now, you might accurately point out how as more people are vaccinated, more people will be able to travel without restrictions, and you're right, however, as more people are vaccinated that also inhibits the spread of the virus too."	11	['is vaccinated', 'is vaccinated', 'are only lifted', 'be called', 'are vaccinated']	5	4	0.36363636363636365	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is vaccinated', 'is vaccinated', 'are only lifted', 'be called', 'are vaccinated']	5	4	0.36363636363636365	1	37012108803	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/nos0nk/_/h041xxf/	1432340048	37009336433.0	2021-05-31 16:19:59	70362286.0	CyberneticWhale	2	False	237	0	False	True	58.11

2013	"&gt; You are welcome to think that, but the law allows the restrictions of behaviors - particularly as it relates to substances. If you disagree with an employers policy, you are free to find a different employer; that is your recourse.

I hesitate to get too far into this conversation as I'm in Canada and I don't know the intricacies of the US approach, but this simply isn't the view that courts have to these kinds of issues here. Particularly when it comes to ""standard form"" employment contracts written by corporations, it is very difficult for an unreasonable term to be enforceable. 

The question is really what is ""reasonable"". In a custody situation, it is not unreasonable to impose a restriction on consuming alcohol. If a person has a history of drug addiction, it is not unreasonable for an employer to impose a restriction on their drug use. But for a person who is otherwise perfectly competent at their job, in which there is no evidence of that person ever showing up to work impaired, I think most courts would find it unreasonable to impose a restriction on the consumption of an otherwise legal substance (federal/state stuff aside) in the privacy of their own home.

However, I'm not convinced yet.

If I start handing out the ""good"" title to games that don't permit perfect play, what about the games that *do?*

Similarly, back to the analogy, if we start calling those hotels with 15% bad rooms with a chance to retry for a better one ""good,"" I would see that as an insult to the actually good hotels with a 100% good-room-rate from the beginning. The same line of reasoning goes for games.

Imagine I had two versions of Tetris. They are identical except for one fact. In the first copy of the game, perfect play is impossible because the RNG doesn't stop itself from generating pieces that are impossible to work with. In the second copy, perfect play is possible because while it still uses RNG to generate pieces, it temporarily disqualifies the pieces that would render perfect play impossible while it generates them.

No, but I'm still trying to feel out what you're looking for, because you didn't really define ""good"", and this helps clarify, or at least give me a basis for discussion.  I'm very aware of this affect.

Critics rate differently than the general population, absolutely.  But you seem to be *defining* good as something critics like and dismissing the general populations view as easy to manipulate, when I think the audience view absolutely matters.  You can manipulate both of them as they cater to different things.

For example, happy endings.  Most people want a happy ending in their movie.  They come home from a long day of work and want something enjoyable.

Critics, on the other hand, adore a sad or tragic ending.  They come home from a day of *watching tons of movies with happy endings* and adore things that break the tried and true formulas.  They want something *different* because after watching a million movies that is more *interesting*, but hardly makes it better.

Critics like movies that are thoughtful, use symbolism, or have elements that you wouldn't pick up on in the first viewing.  Does that make a movie better? Depends on how you define better.

Critics call the Mona Lisa good because it was revolutionary at the time and created techniques that had never been seen before.  Most of those techniques have been copied and implemented by other artists many times since then.  If you're an artist and you take a technique from the Mona Lisa and improve on it a little bit, even though your painting may be objectively better, you're not going to get as much critical acclaim.  So a key part of the greatness of the Mona Lisa is its historical context, which certainly means the creator must have been extremely inventive, but doesn't mean it is better than someone that copies a technique from the Mona Lisa and makes a marginal improvement on that technique."	21	['been seen', 'have been copied and implemented by']	2	2	0.09523809523809523	1	['have been copied and implemented by']	1	1	0.047619047619047616	1	['been seen', 'have been copied and implemented by']	2	2	0.09523809523809523	1	31041577076	8	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9vl02d/_/e9dcq5w/	597243541	31041517727.0	2018-11-09 15:43:59	5410853.0	AnythingApplied	0	False	342	1	False	True	70.13

I'm still not convinced that the definition I gave is insufficient, as one could select a more continuous loss function for that state space which (for instance) assesses viability by grading strings based on how close they are to being compilable (# of errors), and further grading the compilable strings based on how many of a set of test problems they produce correct solutions to.

The definition I gave states that a task is learnable by gradient descent if a state space exists that meets those conditions, not that such a task is learnable by gradient descent with any specific loss function.

If you choose a loss function which operates like the one you specify (isolating only fully functional states as '0', all others as '1'), there is no possible way to perform gradient descent in any state space.

To be absolutely sure, let's just change condition 2 to:

Second, the big fear about making hate speech illegal is that the government gets to define hate speech. Historical precedent abounds for governments, including the US, abusing the power to control and censor, using it on dissenters and opponents rather than real threats. And once you're censored, how do you argue it was wrongful? You're censored. It's like the idea that it's better to let a guilty person go free than convict an innocent person. Better to let hateful people talk than to muzzle the merely controversial. Third, letting people talk can also prevent violence. Someone full of hate who speaks has at least gotten to air their thoughts and will be exposed to public criticism. Repressing people and preventing them from speaking at all usually makes them more radical, more cut off from the rest of society, and takes away any remaining reasons they have to stay within the system.

2046	"&gt; All it does is postpone citizens' rights just because.

Going by your usage of the phrase ""Just because"", I have to ask: are you suggesting there was no good reason for the minimum age to be boosted?

&gt; If we modify the second amendment so that you need to be 21 years of age to purchase a gun, then are we okay with raising the voting age to 21 as well? How about the right to abortions? Or the right to free speech? Can we also remove 4th amendment search and seizure rights from effectively all persons 18 to 21 other than members of a security force? Would that be acceptable?

&gt; Here's the bottom line: any restrictions that can apply to one constitutional right (firearms) by definition can equally apply to another.

There's  a very simple explanation for why. Because there is a *justification* for restricting this aspect of the 2nd amendment in this context. Restricting the 2A to 21-year olds is not equivalent to restricting the 1A to 21-year olds, because the latter decision has no context/justification while the former does.

2047	"Sure.  No matter what you do,  there's a SIDS risk.  It's the leading cause of death for infants and it can be reduced but not eliminated.  

I'm extrapolating a bit in saying that bed sharing could be protective in the circumstances I mention.  That's because the tracking of SIDS deaths notes what the risk factors were,  but there couldn't be an ethical study randomly assigning babies to bedshare. 

[Room sharing](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Announces-New-Safe-Sleep-Recommendations-to-Protect-Against-SIDS.aspx)  has been shown to be protective through the first year (SIDS only happens when a baby is an infant,  so,  technically until they are one. There may be outliers who have unexplained death later but it wouldn't be coded ""SIDS"" if it happened the day after the first birthday).

And [being next to mom](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16252290/) helps a baby regulate physiologically in ways that probably reduce SIDS risk (breathing and stopping apnea episodes being a likely key). 

Also,  since breastfeeding is protective and people are much more likely to continue breastfeeding if they bedshare (because it's damn hard to get up every hour), bedsharing likely has that indirect protective effect,  as long as the other risks of bedsharing are removed.  

All that said,  it's possible that the setup I described would be safer than baby in a crib,  but not as safe as some other set up,  like a sidecar cosleeper designed for that purpose.  

And even if you did come up with the technically statistically ideal sleeping setup for a generic statistically average baby,  there will be individual differences.  For example,  if a baby will only sleep for five minutes unless they're held by someone (this is a real thing), you have to balance the risks of the baby not getting sleep and the possibility of falling asleep on the baby in exhaustion,  vs. the risks of a baby being held while it sleeps,  which is not the ""back to sleep"" ideal.

2053	"I think you are narrowing the definition of scope. You are using internationality or widespread of the attacks but amount of victims is another reasonable definition. 

You claim that by considering ethnic cleansing we’d need to count Muslim performed ethnic cleansings as well. Okay, then do that, but my personal point of view is one the death toll reaches the millions, the difference in scope isn’t as clear. 

Say you had 2 millions vs 40. Of course killing 40 million is worse but doesn’t it come to a difference in efficiency or numbers involved, like how many people they were targeting or how many people participated. Like, I don’t think the ones that killed 2 million can say “oh no, we would have never reached 40, that’s monstrous, 4, 5 million tops was out goal”. At that point I think you can only say both reaches the point as to perform the systematic mass of their target.

Now, I don’t think using a definition is wrong per se. But your conclusion is tied to the definition you used. Your conclusion is “no other religion has any form of violence as globalized and spread out as the modern jihad”. 

Now, it seems you are trying to derive a moral judgement of Islam from this. So using the word scope would be more powerful. But I think it’s muddying the waters a little if that’s your goal. 

Like it seems you are going: Muslim attacks happened in more countries -&gt; jihad has bigger scope -&gt; Islam is worse / more dangerous / more radicalizing. 

But to go from one point to the other you’d need to justify why your definition of scope is correct and then why having a bigger scope means more worse. 

If that wasn’t your goal, then I apologize for assuming. I think I would word your view different by specifically stating your definition of scope there. Then it becomes something like “the jihad is more global than other religious fueled attacks” and sure, that’s something that seems reasonable to me. But I’m not the most well read on it to be honest.

2059	"&gt; In regards to the 'technical standpoint' thing, what I mean is on a biological level - DNA and chromosomes.

So this is an argument that comes up a lot, and here's something worth considering: at what other point in your life, for what people, do you take chromosomes as a measurement? They're irrelevant to your day-to-day interactions. You don't care about them when talking to your best friend, you don't interrogate them talking to that cute girl on the corner, you don't ask your teachers for their karotype. There's a pretty good chance you've never even seen your own chromosomes in any capacity. So as a 'technical standpoint', it's not really useful or valuable for guiding, or even making *sense* of, our day-to-day interactions. We judge and interact based on surface level cues, and that's okay.

&gt;mutilated 

That's kind of a strong word. It implies that their vagina is damaged, bloody, torn apart, violated, etc. But that's not really the case. It probably looks fine as far as vaginas go, to the point where for some trans women dudes cannot even tell the difference, which is a far cry from being 'mutilated'. 

As an analogy, we might think of plastic surgery. If a child is born with a cleft lip, and elects for surgery to make it less obvious (To the point of being virtually unnoticeable), would you say that they still have a mutilated, albeit camouflaged, face? Is a woman who elects to plastic surgery on her nose left with a mutilated nose? Unlikely. We might say it was unnecessary or driven by vanity, but I know of very few people who would consider her face to be mutilated. I can understand why people might see transgender surgeries as 'mutilation', but it seems to be a rather strict double standard given how we treat other conditions.

\- Pregnancy is a possible result of sex.

\- Babies are possible results of pregnancy.

\- If a man fathers a child they are expected to raise the child, or pay child support.

If a man EVER has sex, they risk either having to raise a child or or pay child support.

If a woman EVER has sex, she risks getting pregnant.

If anyone EVER has sex, they risk getting any host of STIs/STDs.

And EVERYONE knows about those risks before they have sex.

That's the point. Lawmakers, educators, everyone has been pretty consistent. These are the risks.

If a man chooses to ignore those risks because a woman promised to have an abortion after the fact, that doesn't absolve him. It might suck for him, and the woman is definitely in the wrong, and definitely shouldn't do that, but HE still made the choice to have sex knowing the risks.

It's the same as if a woman tells you she's clean and you have unprotected sex and get herpes. It sucks. She's in the wrong. But it's still your fault too. You had unprotected sex, and one of the risks of unprotected sex is getting an STI.

&amp;#x200B;

Women have the right to choose what they to with and to their bodies. Men don't get to decide. Couple's might ""agree"" to have an abortion, but really what's happening is that the woman is promising to do something.

Coulson, on the other hand, has slaves playing a pretty central role to his story. Even if you purely look at his generosity to the city, his slave trading is only one step removed from that story.

2083	"There is almost always more to understanding law than the words of the law.  There are decades of actual history to these laws, all run through courts 100x over.

The most relevant stuff comes out of investing clubs on one hand and then from investment firms ""buy recommendations"" and advisory services to the public or to their clients.  Those are closer to running afoul than what went on with wallstreetbets by a long shot, and those have been found to not be in violation of law UNLESS they are lying. 

There are specific cases that cover the ""IF we all buy this then THAT will happen"".  The ""if"" being significant.  This is why delegation of authority is often looked for in pooling scenarios.  This doesn't qualify as pooling because everyone made their own choice on the ""if"" scenario.

For example, had an advisory service called up all their clients and said ""whoa, there is a crazy short out that there that is going to cause a big demand surge for this stock, we're recommending a buy to our clients"" this would _clearly_ not be illegal, yet is many ways is much more nefarious to common sense since this is an expert using a trusted relationship with a mass of clients, knowledge of individual purchases already happening within their pool of supported assets, and so on.

Here we have a group of people who have no relationship with each other.  If we forbid this under current law, then so much would have to fall that it's just not going to happen.  The idea that lots of people are going to buy a stock being a reason to buy a stock is not novel, not nefarious and is simple common sense.  That they are talking about it doesn't matter, and in most ways makes it even less nefarious.

However I do think that not having to cut weight is something of an advantage at heavyweight.  Whether or not it's more of an advantage than size itself is debatable, but clearly most heavyweights don't bulk up to 265, and there are very few human beings that would have to cut down to 265 (unless they're fat obviously).  There seems to be diminishing returns on size once you get well over 200 lbs.  Ali wasn't that big himself, though he had a huge reach, much like Jon Jones, who many would have considered a favorite at heavyweight, even against the likes of Cain Velasquez.  It's extremely rare for fighters in other divisions to weigh in at less than a pound or two under the limit.  If UFC had a super heavyweight division I probably wouldn't give Lesnar as much credit.

Cain also has more losses in title fights, and what he may or may not do in the future is irrelevant.  Couture has more wins in title fights than Cain, especially if you consider his lhc reigns.

2086	It’s well documented in scientific literature that a person can have sex outside of their sexual identity. There are some great articles that would probably help you understand how a guy like me, who has been married for 20 years to a woman, also enjoyed some gay sex when I was in my 20’s. I was a freaky hedonist with an anything goes mentality. You have a very narrow understanding of human sexuality if you don’t think a straight guy can have sex with a guy and not be bi. I find nothing shameful about homosexuality and I would freely admit it if I was gay or bi. But I’m not. I am straight and used to party with a lot of gay guys who offered to blow me. I figured why the hell not? See what it’s all about. It was alright, busting a nut while high on MDMA, but not something I would go seek out. Not the way I lust for women. I find it amazing that in this day and age of preaching mutual respect anybody still has the nerve to tell someone else how they should identify. Everyone is walking their own path and you cannot walk a mile in their shoes. There is a significant difference between having meaningless sex and sexual identity. I don’t ever seek out men for sex. I don’t look at men the way I look at women with powerful longing. The fact I got down with guys and trans women in the past doesn’t change that. You know sometimes lesbians have sex with men, right? That doesn’t mean they are bi or straight. They are still fully committed lesbians who happened to have some sex a few times with a guy for a myriad of potential reasons. That tends to happen more when people are younger. At least for me sex has gotten less important as I’ve gotten older. I still enjoy it and all, but I’m not fixated anymore. When I was in my 20’s I was a super slut, and would fuck anything that moved. Most guys are the same way. I don’t mean most guys have sex with guys. I just mean most young guys are hyper sexual beings.	27	['’s well documented', 'has been married', '’m not fixated']	3	3	0.1111111111111111	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['’s well documented', 'has been married', '’m not fixated']	3	3	0.1111111111111111	1	44722619279	11	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19fmt2u/_/kjmoxvz/	2747236278	44722378212.0	2024-01-26 05:57:42	377626228211.0	koushakandystore	1	False	373	0	False	False	82.85

2102	"Plato certainly does not lack a view on justice. He builds his political theory around it throughout the work. He doesn't outright define things in a simplistic dictionary style way because the point is for people to reason through the problems he provides in dialogues to understand it for themselves - otherwise the definition isn't understood. 

The characters in the dialogue are figuring it out in the text and the reader has to work their way up to the definition with them. Refuting arguments that put forth more common misunderstandings of justice is part of that process.

If you want help understanding it, 'Justice And Virtue: The Republic’s Inquiry into Proper Difference' by Aryeh L. Kosman is a good secondary work by a Plato scholar on the matter.

Regardless, this doesn't really address my main point - I put forth a conception of justice that isn't revenge, one which is not uncommon. So equating justice with revenge at the outset is really not proving ""there is no justice"", it is only saying some people misuse the term or define it wrong."	8	"[""isn't understood""]"	1	1	0.125	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""isn't understood""]"	1	1	0.125	1	39507422454	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u7c55a/_/i5dp69i/	1826309134	39507321855.0	2022-04-19 16:03:38	56818899.0	Havenkeld	6	False	181	0	False	True	59.74
2103	"i don't think it works like that though.. it doesn't end at a cost-benefit calculation and that calculation is really just a coping mechanism for suboptimal behavior. your actions reinforce your habits, and going against your best-interest for the sake of saving 10 minutes per year prioritizes laziness and complacency over opportunity. if you can convince me your subconscious is empty and you don't have feelings, maybe I would believe you. otherwise, the priorities you choose to reinforce will influence or dictate your future decisions. 

as a matter of prediction from theory, I would expect that you generally experience a lack of opportunity for positive change (and thereby have less positive change than what is typical). for example: you have not been a significant part of unsolicited efforts to improve your workplace/position, you don't often try new things for the sake of trying new things, you don't have random influxes of cash, and it's extremely rare that you are genuinely impressed by an experience that you have.

I stopped using wikipedia for math completely, and instead used stack overflow, [answers.com](https://answers.com), random blog posts, and sometimes wolfram alpha.

Hence my view that math on Wikipedia could be done better.

&gt;For popular articles that someone who's relatively new to a field would be likely to read, Wikipedia does sometimes explain the meanings of all relevant symbols.

Sure, but ""go read the notation key"" is like not saying where locations are located on wikipedia because the reader could find them on maps. That's an approach, but is it the best approach?

That's what I'm looking for. A reason why this current approach is the best approach.

2116	"First off, before anything- if you don't actually enjoy reading, you're not going to be getting much out of it, and I fully believe that one can be content without novels. I personally greatly enjoy reading, and go through hundreds of thousands of words in literature (ranging from fan-works to published novels) per month at the least, and often per week, but for you to do that, you'd likely be miserable and not getting much out of it at all. Don't force yourself to read just because strangers on the internet want you to.

Next- I focus mostly on fiction here, because that's what I get the most value from, though I'd imagine that my pleasure from reading fiction could be derived from any number of nonfiction books by other people. Moving on to the actual value from the reading of books:

Books are an ultimate form of escapism, if you love reading. You're immersing yourself in a foreign world at a level of detail unattainable by any movie or television show by virtue of the fact that a book allows that extra detail and the medium form lets you subconsciously fill in any and all blanks as you continue to read. Personally, when I read, I can easily lose hours and hours on end to a good book, filling myself with the thoughts and the story of somebody else, somewhere else, completely enthralled and completely consumed. 

(you can skip this paragraph if you don't play video games, but I like it, so you should read it anyways) Have you ever played an immersive RPG? Something like the Fallout series where you jump into somebody else's story and make it your own and explore a full world? Imagine forgetting that you're in the game and just racing ahead, looking forward to seeing where the story takes you- imagine the detail of Fallout magnified 100x by writing of a good author. You're lost, lost in that grim, post-apocalyptic future, lost in words stealing your heart as they tell you about technology you've scarcely imagined, but is suddenly and delightfully laid out before you in fantastic and believable detail. In a good enough book, every little bit where you think that the developers should have done this or that or something was wrong, you're content and satisfied- until the book ends. At least, if you're like me, that is.

I've read about 1,000,000 words in the last week in a Harry Potter fanfiction series that's basically its own piece of literary work only related to Harry Potter by the fact that they share the same universe- much like how Star Wars has a vast extended universe that doesn't always focus on the characters of the original trilogy of movies. I loved every minute of that time spent reading and lost entire hours to reading where I'd look at my clock and be stunned at how much time had passed, but not regret missing that time even one bit.

At least until perfect virtual reality is created, books are the ultimate form of taking somebody else's vision and consuming it believably, deeply, and wholly. They're escapism, entertainment, enrichment, and a way to keep the mind engaged all in one go- and they're one of my personal oldest friends because of how much they give me.

I wish everybody could get what I do out of books- because they're truly life-changing.

2123	"Whenever people make this claim I try and actually imagine the scenario in its entirety.

So, some handful of America's elite decide they, in essence, want an excuse to go to war in the Middle East. I imagine them talking about how to make this happen. I also imagine that this group of people, however power hungry they may be, are not complete devils and would try to think up a strategy of least self destruction. 

Now, let's assume one person in this group proposes an attack on US soil of some sort-- this would likely be controversial (even to this group) but could definitely be an effective means of engineering a war.  I would imagine this idea would have made many in the group uncomfortable but maybe they were willing to think it out and, again, come up with a path of least destruction.

2137	"&gt; You would still need cops to monitor reports from these systems. Every time a report came in, a cop would need to visually verify the license plates and the math, then apply discretion based on the conditions.

If I understand correctly, the system measures the travel time between point A and B. How would the cops verify it if they are located somewhere in the middle? They could have sped for a short time and slowed down when they saw a cop. There's no way for a cop to know who was speeding unless they catch them, and if they do, then why not just have them write a ticket? How would the cop ""check the math""? I still don't see what this adds to the current system.

&gt; I understand your point about safety vs efficiency on a general level, but in most areas of the country, it's not as if someone could go 90+ and get away with it if a cop were present.

That's true, but not really relevant to my argument. 90+ is usually unsafe and you will very likely get a ticket. It seems *far* easier and less costly to either hire more cops and/or institute policies to increase enforcement. It's way less efficient (for cops and *especially* drivers) if you catch everyone and make a ex post facto judgment on who wasn't ""really"" being dangerous.

&gt; None of the examples you provided demonstrate how this specific system is prone to mistakenly giving a driver a ticket. If this system were implemented more uniformly, I think the consistency in who does or does not receive a ticket would get more people to understand the value of compliance.

Well, I think my example is a pretty good one. I got a ticket for allegedly running a red light. The video clearly shows me stopping and making a legal turn on red (with no other cars coming). The cameras work by taking a picture of cars who enter the intersection after the light has turned red. That seems highly prone to mistakenly catch people who do what I did. (Did I actually break the law? Did I actually make a ""rolling stop""? I don't know because it would cost me 40 bucks to find out.) Speeding cameras might not have as many faults, but there's no way they aren't prone to error.

Regarding compliance, I don't think this system would help people value safety. In my experience, it just pisses everyone off and reminds us that they can screw with us any time they want. Getting tickets for past behaviors does very little if people can't remember what they did or predict when they will get one. It also encourages people to put too much focus on their speedometer *instead of the road*, which could easily be *more* dangerous.

I actually do make a conscious effort to control my speed. The thing that had an impact on *me* was when I was 17 I went to traffic school for a (legitimate) speeding ticket. The officer talked a lot about the dangers of speeding, the statistics and costs of vehicle accidents, and some tragic cases that she had witnessed. It was a very informative presentation and made me think about safety more. Combining awareness with increased enforcement is a much easier solution that is far less costly and would be more effective."	33	['are located', 'were implemented']	2	2	0.06060606060606061	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are located', 'were implemented']	2	2	0.06060606060606061	1	28257827432	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/42oaye/_/czbzb6w/	246357878	28257774503.0	2016-01-25 23:39:16		wugglesthemule	1	False	565	3	False	True	71.04

2139	"First, you said that ""this is true for all governments,"" meaning, I suppose, that you believe every government body is untrustworthy.  Since systems of government vary so wildly from country to country, from parliamentary democracies to theocracies to dictatorships, it can't be a specific form or kind of governance that you identify as the source of this problem, so that suggests you find a kind of illegitimacy in government by definition.  In other words, no government is capable of behaving in a way that you deem ""trustworthy"" because there is something inherently untrustworthy about the idea of government.

In order to address that concept, we have to agree about what sort of trustworthiness we're talking about, and since you repeatedly link the two, how this trustworthiness relates to the concept of government power.  It sounds to me like you are talking about the trust that a nation's citizens should be able to place in their government, which sounds reminiscent of the idea of the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) that supposedly exists between a government and the governed, a tacit agreement that citizens cede some power to a central authority in exchange for some benefits, such as national security, economic protection, and the general pursuit of the nation's interests above others.  Now, we can't argue here about some forms of the social contract being better or more legitimate than others--this isn't going to turn into a Hobbes vs. Rousseau debate--because you've already stated that you believe every government is ""untrustworthy,"" which I'm here parsing as ""unable or unwilling to fulfill its end of the social contract.""   

Now, I get the feeling that maybe this isn't so much about the social contract stuff at all.  As far as upholding its agreement to pursue its own citizens' interests above all others, it's arguable that the United States was doing just that even while committing the acts you've described.  This sounds more like a criticism of the opacity of our government--that sometimes it willfully misleads its citizens, that we're being manipulated, propagandized, and lied to by our government.  Here, I would concede that this is true, to some extent, of all governments: that sometimes, in order to maintain its legitimacy or increase popular support for what it feels to be the best course of action, every government uses ""spin"" to push forward certain agendas.  This is true both in modern democracies and in medieval feudal systems, because the government, if it wishes to last, needs its citizens to at least believe it is acting with real authority.  You might counter that, if the government needs people to trust its legitimacy, the best way to do that is to be entirely honest with them, and that's a great idea in theory, but in practice, a number of obstacles prevent this.  For one, different parts of the government need to have access to information that, in order to truly protect the interest of its citizens, must be held to the utmost secrecy.  The CIA can't let the media know every time it's started to hunt down a suspected espionage scheme, the FBI can't announce publicly that they're tracking the movements of a terrorist cell, the IRS can't broadcast that they suspect a large company has committed fraud before they have proof.  Certain vital functions of the government would cease to work entirely if forced to be transparent, and would in fact become counterproductive to the well-being of the nation.  It's true that these more covert aspects of government function can be used as a smokescreen by unscrupulous individuals or interests, but that's not *why* they exist.

Another scenario where obfuscation often arises is more in line with the events you mention as examples of government untrustworthiness.  Sometimes, the government needs popular support for a course of action it wants to pursue, but knows that the cause won't get that support on its own, so it manufactures a casus belli.  But why, in these cases, did the government's opinion of the best course of action diverge from the public's?  Often the problem is that the political framework of experts just doesn't translate to everyday people, who wouldn't accept the political reality of our world even when it is explained to them.  To use your WWI example, with hindsight it is easy to condemn the whole of WWI as a pointless, needlessly brutal war that never should have been fought, but imagine you're in the position of America after Europe has already entered into the war.  Now that many of your allies and trade interests are engaged in this conflict, it's going to affect you to one degree or another.  There are a huge range of motivations for American exceptionalism, from pacifism to xenophobia, but there are also motivations for entering the war.  One, it will improve the odds that the side your support actually succeeds, and it bolsters your relationship with your allies and to some extent, makes them indebted to you.  Two, it might hasten the end of the conflict, which could be considered a humanitarian win--even though your entering the fray will certainly result in some suffering and loss of life that otherwise would not have happened, it might mean less suffering and loss of life *overall*.  Three, war is generally good for the home economy, as it stimulates spending and development in many industries.  Also, at the time, there was a certain interest in both increasing US influence abroad and hopefully preventing future conflicts by starting an international peacekeeping force, which America could legitimately present only if they'd had a dog in the fight.  But these reasons are very big-picture, dry, and long-term, and everyday citizens often don't respond well to reasons like this.  They don't have the education or background, many times, to consider these arguments fairly.  What they respond to much more is overt patriotic overtures, emotional displays, and singular catalyzing events as the spurs for action.  This is why nations manufacture events like the Lusitania as a casus belli.  Also I should point out that your summary of that event is not in line with the link you provided--the conspiracy theory states that the **British** purposefully allowed the Germans to destroy the ship in order to bring the US into the war, but regardless, since the Lusitania sank in 1915 and the US didn't enter the war until 1917, its use as a rallying point for US engagement can still be seen as propagandizing rather than a legitimate primary motivation for the US entering the war.

2142	"You're saying ""If I buy goods from A, and they then do unethical things with the money, I am ethically culpable."" Surely the inverse of that is true, which is ""If I sell my goods to B, and they then do unethical things with the goods, I am ethically culpable."" By your own logic, alcohol and nicotine companies are ethically compromised (a statement I'd agree with!) so consumers who support them are also ethically compromised.

Also, to clarify, I'm not actually arguing that buying drugs in a way that gives money to the cartels is inherently ethical. Rather, I'm arguing that being a modern citizen of America largely means being ethically compromised in thousands of little ways, and unless you live your life like a hermit, you can't cast a stone at another's consumption without opening yourself up to a handful flying back at you. I'm not saying you can't have a personal ethical code; for all my talk, there are definitely a few businesses I don't support because I find their political conduct repugnant. But I also don't judge those who do support them because I know that I'm culpable in other ways. I could argue for hours on why I think you're wrong on sweatshops, but I don't think you're 'extremely unethical' for supporting businesses that use them. 

This may seem like an odd distinction, but I guess I would argue that buying drugs in a way that helps cartels is not ethical, but it's also not UNETHICAL in a way that differentiates it from many other common practices, to the point of being impossible to argue, and that there are far more meaningful ways to affect change on this front than to shame consumers.

2143	"&gt;  A person who is a nonvegan but is active is more likely to be able to promote change and more likely to garner further supporters.

Do you know the first thing I'd ask a meat eater who preached the values of veganism to me? Why the fuck are you still eating meat? And then I'd give them shit for being a hypocrite. (I'm not talking about you, you've already stated your reasons for eating meat.)

&gt; Also, I know this is a cheap shot, but my claim was that ""silent vegans"" have no claim to moral superiority, so really it would be you who would have to prove that a non-activist vegan is more likely to promote change than an activist omnivore.

It seems you've misunderstood the crux of my arguments thus far. I haven't claimed that one position is superior to the other at all - just go back and reread what I've written; I haven't edited anything. I don't care to judge two positions that are generally above average, and I'm not judging you for your judgement either. What I've tried to show you is that there is no way that you can definitely put one position above the other. It would always come down to a case-by-case analysis.

If there were even a single case of a ""silent vegan"" who contributed more than a meat eating vegangelist then your position falls apart. And as it happens, I know a meat eating vegangelist in real life and he's never been able to convince anyone to take his position seriously because he's always called a hypocrite.

Sure, if one person drops that’s probably a rounding error, but if you apply your logic to 1000 people? That starts to get into real money. Admittedly if you take the meds or not isn’t important at that point from an economic perspective. But from a political one, I can’t see a government program to buy a bunch of drugs and destroy them all as getting any real traction.

I appreciate your point, but the reality is that the logic isn't applied to 1000 people when we're talking about just me. If it did, it would be a fluke and it certainly isn't common. It doesn't gain traction as it's own thing, it's just the system my local area seem to use. 

&gt; It’s the initial purchase that stimulates the economy because the drug company can use that money to hire people who then spend it, etc.

I don't disagree here, businesses and governments transacting with medications does stimulate that economy. I'm just saying that I have no impact on this (I understand that normally I would in the US, or in other markets, just in this specific case for my specific circumstances, I don't). 

&gt; I don’t know if you want a counter or not, but it’s clearly a sign that someone thought you had value to the university. Sure, you don’t have as much value to them now (except as a source of funding or fame) but at that point you were clearly valuable.

Okay, I may have had more worth in the past in this sense and other ways. I don't think that's any case for my current worth, though?

&gt; The medication can’t be a negative value from an economic perspective, at best it’s 0. From a “I consume the earth” perspective, maybe; but from that perspective there are so many people who hurt more than they help and I’d rather not measure myself by that (just try to do the least damage I can).

I understand why measuring yourself this way isn't going to yield positive results for most, but since the personal and interpersonal metrics aren't positive it's about exploring other avenues of how I can have worth. You might try to minimise the damage yourself, or ignore the issue for the most part, but you can also find your worth by personal worth and interpersonal relationships. Since I don't, I thought I'd present multiple perspectives in OP.

&gt; I’m going to give a suggestion for an activity you may enjoy. You seem like an able bodied, fit, adult male with a college degree. If you can afford it, I’d recommend volunteering for some sort of charity where you help people who are less fortunate.

My current schedule doesn't allow for it, but I appreciate the idea and I will definitely start volunteering eventually if I can. 

You seem to basically be suggesting I may begin to generate at least some worth eventually by increasing my worth to others through volunteering and such. This isn't something I find any fault with, so when I can do it I will give it a go.

People don't just dislike genres abstractly; they will have heard songs in that genre before, even accidentally or against their will, and have decided that there is something about the genre they do not like.

What I'm asking you is, why is it not valid for a person to not seek out more of something they dislike?  It's simply not feasible for a single person to try directly every experience on the planet.

These are really important topics, and I think that they are a part of the process of striving towards objective morality. I do hope that eventually we will reach some sort of consensus on these topics.

Since then our parties have slowly started polarizing, starting in the sixties, and really dividing in the 90's.

It would bring us dangerously close to eugenics territory. In a world where we could detect everything before birth (more of a sci-fi idea than a real futuristic possibility) where would we draw the line on a potential child? Would we all be choosing abortions in favor of a child with slightly ""better"" genetics the next time?

The eugenics movement in the 30s already sort of tried this. Doctors forced abortions and miscarriages in women who were deemed in any way mentally unfit (unfortunately that definition was incredibly lax meaning even someone with epilepsy or dyslexia was considered unfit). At its height, it was even legal to force sterilization on individuals who were mentally deficient to ensure that they would not pass on mental incapacity. If we're considering allowing the mentally unfit to be prevented from being born, we might only be a short jump from these kinds of mindsets and behavior.

It's fine to believe that certain conditions don't allow for a good quality of life and you want to be merciful by not bringing those children into the world.

I'm going to rephrease this for you in a less flattering light, and I want you to see if you still agree with it.

""If a friend asks you out and you don't know the reason why you aren't romantically interested in them, then it should be understandable that that friend doesn't owe maintaining your friendship""  You are saying ""hey, I demand to know the reason""

 let's look at your point's B and C.

>b ) You really should give the date and if the date goes bad then say that's why

Why should a person go on a date if they don't feel chemistry on the offchance they might feel it?

> c) accepting your friendship means less to you then how uncomfortable you will feel after you say your reason

Or you don't know the reason why, you just know what your feelings are.  Like, let me use a friend of mine as an example.  On paper, she has everything I am looking for, but due to contexts going on in our life, I never even thought of her romantically.  There is nothing ""incompatable"" between us, but if I was single and she asked me out, I most likely would say no, just because I don't see us together for no particular reason.  I can't even come up with that reason now.

Just FYI, If you're going to start working for yourself and your own small business, you'll be putting in much more than 40 hours per week, especially for something as labor intensive as game development.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, especially if its something you really enjoy doing.

EDIT:  Also noticed from a previous post your wrote.

&gt;If a friend wants to schedule something, I can just work on game development other times. If I get a great idea at 4:00am, I can work on that instantly.

Most of your friends will have a 9-5 schedule, so expect most events to take place outside of standard work hours.  Having schedule flexibility is a perk of being the owner/boss.  I can go play a round of golf at 10AM on a Tuesday, as long as you've got nothing pending.  That also means you may end up working til midnight on friday during crunch time.  The dangerous part is establishing a work-life balance.  If you can work on your projects anytime (4AM), that means you'll end up working on them All the time.  Having established rules and a general routine of working 9AM to 5PM can make sure you make the most of both your freetime and your work time.  Of course you can have the flexibility, but accomodating your schedule around everyone else's has its benefits."	11	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	27710499984	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/32d2dm/_/cqa46mo/	185367370	27710457417.0	2015-04-12 17:43:25		MontiBurns	9	False	229	1	False	True	70.53

But I am somewhat tribalist and nationalist. So if by race you mean something old school going back a few centuries when races were defined in terms of opposing countries (e.g., the French versus the Germans even though they were both white), then it's somewhat of a possibility.

2177	"Do you remember the Samsung Notes that caught fire? The Dell and HP laptops that caught fire?

The more compact the battery technology, the higher the energy density, the more susceptible a battery is to exceeding its operating and design parameters.

The most common issue is physical damage to the cells. You can look on youtube for videos of using a nail gun to piece cells and see them catch fire. The more severe the damage, the quicker this process happens. Heat damage is another method for this to occur. Big packs include temperature monitoring to ensure you don't hit thermal runaway. (one cell fails, creates enough heat to cause the neighboring cells to fail which in turn causes other cells to fail - hence runaway).

Read the battery report to see the numerous different failure modes. 

Manufacturers know all of this. They have complex battery management systems to prevent most known issues. They have armored and well designed enclosures to house the cells to protect them as best they can. Over time these get even better as lessons are learned.

Are they 100% perfectly safe? Nope. Nothing is. A gasonline powered car is not 100% safe either. A failed fuel fitting from the injector rail can spray gas on a hot exhaust manifold and cause a fire. 

It is all relative risk. I don't see electric cars being significantly more or less dangerous than gas or diesel cars.

2178	"/u/Sahasrahla doesn't mention anything about the potential health problems of GM crops.

First, it's worth pointing out that there isn't much actual research on the health effects of GM crops.  This is in part due to efforts by agriculture corporations, like Monsanto, to prevent any research from being done.

Why people are concerned:

A considerable amount of GM research has been focused on pest control.  The standard approach is to modify the crop so that it can withstand harsher pesticides.  This means that the food you're getting at the supermarket has been subjected to chemicals that are nasty-enough to kill non-genetically modified plants.  These chemicals are probably not healthy for consumers.  Of course, thanks to efforts by Monsanto to pressure the FDA, no research has been conducted on this subject by anyone except the companies which sell the GM crops.  

To expand on /u/Sahasrahla's point about sharp business practices.  Monsanto has been suing farmers whose crops have been tainted with Monsanto seed.  In other words, seeds blow into another farmer's crop and because the seeds are patented Monsanto can sue the farmer for growing their seed without permission.  This may be legal, but it certainly represents sharp business practice.

There's nothing inherently wrong with genetically modifying food.  But the manner in which it's being done, and the business models of the companies which do it, warrant concern.

EDIT: Some additional information and sources:

Roundup, Monsanto's most popular herbicide, has been linked to a number of [health problems](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/25/roundup-health-study-idUSL2N0DC22F20130425), including [Parkinson's, Cancer, and Infertility](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/roundup-herbicide-health-issues-disease_n_3156575.html) by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It is also fairly clear that Roundup has negative effects on the farmers who use it.  However, it has been difficult to prove in court that Roundup is responsible due to the diffuse and delayed effects of the herbicide.  France has recently found Monsanto guilty of chemical poisoning. ([Source](http://www.alternet.org/story/154284/monsanto_found_guilty_of_chemical_poisoning_in_france))

Sharp business practices abound.  There is a phenomenon in India called the [""Monsanto Suicide.""](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1082559/The-GM-genocide-Thousands-Indian-farmers-committing-suicide-using-genetically-modified-crops.html)  From rooting around it also appears that having a patent on something which can reproduce itself causes some weird and fascinating legal problems, usually for other people.

The FDA is presently run by ex Monsanto executives.  There has been zero research funded by the FDA on the long term effects of our population switching to GM crops.  The so called ""Monsanto Protection Act"" signed into law by Obama on March 29th, bans courts of halting the sale of GM seeds.  In other words, even if a court decides that GM seeds are unsafe, it will be unable to stop the sale and planting of GM seeds.

2190	"&gt; The price premium for an electric car is not worth it over its petrol powered competitor.

This is exactly the point I was trying to make. If a car doesn't have an attractive price, it needs to have attractive features (looks being a feature, something unnecessary for use but nice to have). So far nobody but Tesla has done that, and thus you don't see any other electric cars out there.

As for the Prius, I'll admit I am still a bit baffled by it today. Still, at least as far as I've seen, every hybrid car on the road is either a Prius or a car that already existed before hybrids came along that was simply given a hybrid option (and retains its pre-hybrid looks). There are other cars that were designed from the start to be hybrids and they are out there, but I find it strange that the Prius is the only one to be so wildly successful."	9	['was simply given', 'were designed']	2	2	0.2222222222222222	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['was simply given', 'were designed']	2	2	0.2222222222222222	1	28282092095	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/44iacw/_/czqfdxb/	249436400	28282069594.0	2016-02-06 20:43:39		pickelsurprise	1	False	162	1	False	True	73.41
2191	"I think that it's very easy to chalk it up to religion, but if we look deeper I think that people see stability in society as being sacrosanct.

When society becomes more focussed on individual freedoms and becomes deeply individualistic, you lose social cohesion as the people surrounding you become less like you, thusly your community falls apart. When society becomes less like one big homogenous family, people don't see themselves as particularly connected to it. Homosexuality is seen as contributing to the breakdown of tradition and the family unit, especially seeing as LGBT activism generally tries to be transgressive and actively break down these ideas about how society is supposed to be (the ""gay agenda"").

When there is less societal cohesion, there is less unity and stability, and people see that as a threat - people with conservative attitudes see this cohesion and stability as paramount and thus homosexuality is deemed a threat, and religion is used as a tool to convince the masses to attack the threat. This is also why unstable countries and regions (e.g. Chechnya) or ones trying to rebuild social cohesion (e.g. Nazi Germany) often target homosexuality because it's both a threat and also an easy scapegoat (due to straight person disgust).

So yeah, I'd disagree that it's about religion. Religion may be the tool in a broader sense used to shape people's opinions and give them ammunition to attack homosexuals, but I think that the deeper motive is a desire for safety and stability through social cohesion. Blaming it on religion is lazy, we have to look at religion in context.

Conservatism is based on fear of the other, fear of chaos. They don't want society to ""degenerate"" and see humans as effectively feral beasts that need order to stop us falling into a new dark age, and thus will attack societal outliers and that which they don't understand."	10	['is seen', 'is supposed', 'is deemed', 'is used']	4	2	0.2	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is seen', 'is supposed', 'is deemed', 'is used']	4	2	0.2	1	29743046934	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7481bw/_/dnw8pw6/	430356668		2017-10-04 11:17:16		haywire	471	False	315	0	False	True	46.91
2192	"I don't think the problem is our definition of ""glorious/glorification"" if you go with the 2nd definition ""marked by great beauty or splendor""

IMO it's the Good vs Evil Trope that you don't seem to grasp. You should watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3E2FdedPwU) film critic, it talks about the subtle ways a particular view can be glorified. We know in the civil war the north was good and the south was bad, but the movie gives the south more credit than it deserves. it humanizes the south.

&gt;and some that don't depict as glorious

It is a trope though! It's meant to depict death in battle as glorious. The main characters of 300 are not looked down upon for losing the battle, the final samurai are not looked down upon in the movie for their glorious defeat. Rewatch Aragorns [last speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA8wkz0uGLE), he's literally trying to convince them to die. They could run, yet he's glorifying the battle. He practically makes you want to charge into battle with him doesn't he?! In viking culture/religion they glorified death by making it one of the few ways to get to the best version of the afterlife.

&gt;when there's no real alternative, why should fighting be seen as praiseworthy?

The last stand trope is a way of glorifying death. Makeing deathj seem good under the circumstances of war. You mentioned the alternatives yourself, lay down or fight. The 300 had that choice, the Samurai had that choice, humans in both the matrix and terminator had the choice - and what did they do? They fought - AND WE ARE STILL HERE [*queue hot cave dance orgy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLlIjLposs). And we follow the tales of the savior character and how they reverse the bad situation plaguing the land/galaxy. It would be a bad movie if the heroes just surrendered at the start of the movie.

&gt;Elves coming to support Helms Deep in Two Towers

This is a case vs good vs evil.

I did. then I provided an expert opinion why your explanation was meritless.

>Compared to what? How does that answer the question if such care is beneficial compared to alternatives?

What alternatives? Doing nothing? The thing the study was measuring against? What do you think the suicidality reduction was from? Some other radical treatment? 

.No. Banning treatment is not the same as ""banning treatment for a group of people"". It's not like ""banning treatment for Jews"".

You're banning treatment for trans children instead. Unless they somehow don't count as a group.

>It's like if banning, I don't know, some prostate cancer drug would mean 'banning treatment for a group of people' based on the idea that only men can get prostate-cancer.

Now you're getting it! Only trans kids are going to get gender affirming care as minors. Banning that care is a ban of that care to that group. 

>Nope, that's quite an interesting article that actually does address some of the problems. Sure, RCTs are hard in psychology. Blind ones are impossible, but if you have honest doctors, you could at least try the non-blind ones.

Like the numerous studies we already have including the one I cited?

You can't blind test drugs or procedures with noticeable effects. Anyone who knows anything about statistics knows this. Why would you even make that demand if you knew something about statistics?

It's like demanding blind tests of septic limb amputations. Lol. 

>Or do you have any good study to support these programs?

Previously cited cohort study. You dismissed it because it wasn't an RCT, when you should have known - as a self declared statistical genius -  that you can't blind test these procedures.

>Were they not?

I would like to see the studies where they gave patients placebo organs.

>Then you can watch people who were lucky to get the transplant and those who were not. Very close to RCT as far as I can say.

So we could do something like observe trans kids who received treatment and then observe those who did not and see who has better outcomes? If only there were dozens of such studies, one of which someone cited earlier in this conversation. 

>If you can provide me with a similarly constructed study in the gender-affirmation care area, I'd be content. Can you?

Previously cited. The study cites the conclusions of dozens of other studies including:

>Several studies published from 2015 to 2020 found that receipt of PBs or GAHs was associated with improved psychological functioning21 and body satisfaction,22 as well as decreased depression23 and suicidality24 within a 1-year period.

AND

>Gender-affirming care is associated with decreased rates of long-term adverse outcomes among TNB youths. Specifically, PBs, GAHs, and gender-affirming surgeries have all been found to be independently associated with decreased rates of depression, anxiety, and other adverse mental health outcomes.13-16

AND

>Conversely, TNB youths who present to care later in adolescence or young adulthood experience more adverse mental health outcomes.18 Despite this robust evidence base, legislation criminalizing and thus limiting access to gender-affirming medical care for minors is increasing.19,20

2204	"A financial bubble that caused a crash in the housing market. There are large numbers of ghost towns from the crash where developments just stopped as the capital supporting new build to use as a commodity dried up.

Deregulation gives more power and influence to development companies. They are out to make a profit not to provide housing. This means that housing supply will absolutely not be well distributed by income bracket. The housing when used as a commodity is open to a lot more supply as the market wants more growth and more people want to buy in and so on.

There is an absolute need for affordable housing as now as shown by OP and others being squeezed out of their communities by the high house prices in the area. Deregulation will probably cause for some more housing to be supplied but it won't be in the right amounts for the needs of society and will overwhelmingly incentivise luxury property. 

It isn't just located to urban cores there are other areas where large developments are viewed as commodities for the middle class. In the suburbs of London there is a street called the bishops avenue and pretty much noone lives there.

There is absolutely a need for new housing but that new housing actually needs to go to people who need it rather than just being used as a commodity. 

In terms of solutions to the problem of the commodification of housing I would suggest rent controls, localising landlords (International companies have less attachment to the people in their housing), social housing, housing co-ops, tax incentives for houses in a certain price range, punitive measures on new build which focuses too much on luxury apartments. Social housing would also help the transit issues as they could be built and have transport extended to them. The easiest way to get more housing is to build more housing not to deregulate.

Agree.

For some it may be. If it is so for your SO then no commitment is broken when you have sex with someone else. But:

2213	"We're not talking about transgender? Just gender queer and agender? Because they're two very different issues.

You said it yourself about gender queer. It's a societal thing. For example, a feminine or androgynous male, in many cultures, is treated as a third sex. One that combines transgender, gender queer, and ...gay men, because humanity can't ever seem to get over it's fucked up issues. 

In American culture, it's more complicated. Girly, sissy, etc is an insult that assumes a moral failure on multiple fronts. Coward, wimp, undersexed (if straight)...it's all ugliness, all the time. The insults are the least of it. Genderqueer is basically, a ""Fuck you, I'm an independent."" It filled an opening, in our language. Why we must make reclaiming the feminine into a ""battle against society"" narrative makes no sense at all, logically. 

But if we were logical creatures, there wouldn't be a need for genderqueer to begin with. I have zero formal ways to express that I'm at home in pants or a dress, in make-up or without, and that none of this is at all sexual for me. (There are other people who are turned on by it, male and female, but that's not relevant to whether or not I have a valid identity.)

It's the only word that gives people an idea what they're dealing with, even if online they'll mentally turn my absurdly deep natural voice into a lisp, and dock me multiple IQ points. (which will be transferred into attention whore and snowflake stats, I'm sure.)

Whether or not gender queer is recognized (and I'm friends with many people who'd sooner die than admit I'm not an ordinary straight male, even though I've experiences in life that make it easier for me to talk to women and the LGBT community, than to other straight men), it exists, as itself.

2217	"Having a weekday tied to a specific date of the year (and of the month) means greater consistency in a lot of areas. 

---

Paychecks and salaries, for example: if you get paid every two weeks, and your rent is due every month, sometimes you get 2 paychecks per month, sometimes you get three. The only possible way to work out a budget for people living paycheck-to-paycheck is to consider the occasional third paycheck ""extra"", which is to say, it gets wasted on frivolous things (explicitly the thing that budgets are designed to avoid). Trouble budgeting and inconsistent paydates means that bills get late and go unpaid, or checking accounts get overdrawn. **The Gregorian calendar is, in a roundabout but very real way, a ~~tax~~ unnecessary cost on the working poor.** (Decided ""tax"" was no the right word there, despite rolling off the metaphorical tongue.) In IFC, I could schedule all of my utility bills and monthly expenses to hit on the date after my paycheck arrives every time.

I've never run a business from the other end, but I imagine it's even more troublesome. Some months you have to pay out twice, other months, three times.

---

On a similar note, scheduling holidays is an issue. Most major holidays (at least in the US) are tied to a particular weekday rather than a particular date (i.e. third Monday of January, third Thursday of November, or my personal favorite, election day - the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November). One of the common Google searches is, ""When is (holiday) this year?"" In an IFC-style calendar, a given date is on the same day of the week every single year.

The reverse is also true: Christmas would always fall on the same day of the week. That means that, among other things, vacation policies are going to be the exact same every year, instead of people having to guess and play around with ""what week am I off for christmas this year?"" every year. Another common Google search: ""When does the semester start?"" Under IFC, there'd be no reason to change the semester start date every year.

And, as someone involved in planning and scheduling conventions, it's not unheard of for the changing calendar to push around the dates of larger conventions, and for smaller conventions to get ""muscled"" out of their usual weekend as a result.

---

As someone who has, at one point, written a ""number-of-seconds-to-text-date"" algorithm, **fuck** this calendar. It's relatively computationally expensive and incredibly complicated to write; and complicated to write means there are going to be oversights and bugs.

---

You have to buy a new calendar every year, and calendars from previous years are completely useless. Imagine how many calendars get thrown away unsold every year. (Yeah, this is less of a problem in the digital age, but it's still stupid, in OP's words.)

---

Finally, look at it from the other perspective. The only argument **in favor** of the Gregorian calendar, that I can think of, is, ""It's the one we already use."" I grant that that's a big one, and changing a calendar on an international scale isn't easy, **are there any other good things about it**?"	25	['get paid', 'gets wasted', 'are designed', 'are tied', 'get thrown']	5	4	0.16	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['get paid', 'gets wasted', 'are designed', 'are tied', 'get thrown']	5	4	0.16	1	26948039245	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1rkiqn/_/cdo605p/	106773215	26947995485.0	2013-11-27 12:27:35		StarManta	24	False	536	0	False	True	60.04

2220	"You're welcome to keep your belief in God (or whatever philosophy that is) if you'd like, but let's just get one thing straight:  science *does not* suggest anything at all about it.  

Quantum mechanics doesn't ""allow for"" teleportation or telepathy or faster-than-light communication or anything of the sort.  It has rules that are different from the way most people are used to thinking, that's all.  It doesn't break causality and it doesn't require supernatural forces to keep everything from breaking.  Don't believe me?  Go ask your quantum mechanics instructor.  

Also, while some might consider me an atheist, the more correct statement would be that I'm an agnostic.  This doesn't mean that I'm ""searching for god"", but rather that I believe that it is *fundamentally impossible* to know whether there is a god or not, precisely because this is something that--by its very definition--cannot be addressed by the scientific process.  Science is about building models that predict behavior of things.  We like to think of these models as having some fundamental meaning beyond that, and that's fine as long as we're all very careful in our thinking about what science can and cannot measure.  For example, scientific research would never be able to distinguish between the interpretation as gravity as the fundamental force of nature described by Newton and later Einstein, and gravity based on the [theory of intelligent falling](http://www.theonion.com/articles/evangelical-scientists-refute-gravity-with-new-int,1778/).

2222	"&gt;Why do you have to read the Bible to understand that slavery is wrong?

You don't need to. I'm not making this claim. 

However, what I do claim is that (depending on when you say the ancestors of humans become evolved enough to call humans) for the first hundred thousand or so years of human history, very few civilizations ever understood it was wrong. And those few civilizations who did understand it was wrong, aren't quite as convincing about it as Western Cultures has been.

But coincidentally as soon as society begins to read the Bible, instantly abolitionist views gain huge popularity and in a few hundred years, basically everyone is convinced slavery is bad. That's quite the coincidence. 

---

Now your points about profitability make sense. It's true that areas where slavery was a larger part of the economy there was greater resistance to the abolition of slavery. However that's not the same as saying economic changes themselves caused our society to abhor slavery. Otherwise why was the civil war necessary? Why didn't the North simply just wait for the economy of the South to change.

And today there definitely is still a market for slave labor. Everything from forced prostitution to picking of crops I'm sure would be done by slave labor if it was legal and considered moral.

2224	"You seem to imply that people are born with some sort of knowledge and indication of right and wrong, and that their own choices can't be influenced by those around them. I find that confusing. Kids believe what they're told because they don't know better. Kids don't often question things because they don't really have broader access to information through outlets like the internet until they're older, and they're often surrounded by people with similar beliefs, or are more inclined to believe in their parents anyway.

You don't think morality is subjective? Why do you feel that morality is objective?

&gt;How many poor people in Columbia did not choose to join a drug cartel when Escobar was at the height of his power? Millions? Then yes. It's a choice, and framing it otherwise is an apologist ploy to cloud the guilt of killers and assulters.

People do terrible things and they're held accountable for them. But we also look at those people and their experiences to understand how they got to that point. You don't seem to think that we're influenced by our environments, though, and I can't quite comprehend that point of view. Human beings are immensely flawed. I don't know you, so I can't point out the ways that you've been influenced and make subconscious decisions that you may not really be aware of, or just blindly trusted.

&gt;And in doing so they decide that the lives and safety of the people they shoot and assault are less important then their own 'sense of belonging' you described. And that as a result of their own moral bankruptcy. It is THERE fault. Not anyone elses that the made that choice, and they all deserve to hang for it.

Sure. You seem to think that acknowledging systemic issues is a way of forfeiting person responsibility and accountability. Nobody said that. Most people believe in the opposite, actually. It's just you that keeps interpreting it that way.

Still, you don't think that having limited options forces people into some difficult circumstances? You don't think that fear influences decision-making?

&gt;You and I may not be able to work our way out of poverty. But you and I, always, no matter what our circumstances (so long as we are not brain dead, or severely mentally handicapped) can always choose to not do evil. I don't care how poor you are, if someone says ""Tell us where the Jews are so we can kill them"" you can always, ALWAYS say no.

How can you really say that if you haven't been in those people's shoes? It's easy to judge from the outside. It's easy to claim that you'd run into a burning build and save someone. It's easy to claim that you'd defend someone you love from an attacker with a weapon. You never actually know unless you've been put in that situation, though. All of those situations, including the one you've suggested, all likely result in your own death (and, in all likelihood, the death of those you're protecting as well). Self-preservation is the answer to all of this. But even the ""right"" decisions we make are self-serving. No one really does good deeds or helps people or chooses to be good unless it makes them feel good.

&gt;Hence, Chauvin could have not killed Floyd.

Yeah - of course he could have chosen not to kill him. And when these same patterns show up regularly, and many of them make the news, you start to realize that there's a pattern, and you start to wonder why that pattern exists, and you trace that pattern down to reason, and common reason, and you decide that systemic racism exists and is a problem that needs our help to combat and succeed.

The idea where everyone isn't invited to vote no matter how they choose the candidate to vote is frightening to me. I do understand I may feel differently if I was from a place where it was optional and half the population didn't do it.	4	"['should be run', ""isn't invited""]"	2	2	0.5	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['should be run', ""isn't invited""]"	2	2	0.5	1	34790874213	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/hyh435/_/fzdl6cl/	1085830385	34790703227.0	2020-07-27 02:33:00	441644351218.0	schnapps267	25	False	85	0	False	False	66.78

2230	"&gt; How does the current system prevent selling votes by senators and representatives?

i don't think the current system prevents that very well, but i'm not comparing your system to the current system. i'm comparing your system to ""a direct democracy were voters simply follow recommendations from their favourite experts"".

&gt; Is it made illegal? Same could be done here, facilitated by the fact that votes and vote-chaining is made public with 100+ votes.

you can make it illegal, but how will you enforce that? you can't check every single time someone chains a bunch of votes to someone else if maybe they got some money for that.

&gt; We know that doesn't happen, people don't follow recommendations from experts on a whole host of issues with any degree of reliability.

well, then why do you think that they'll vote-chain to actual experts, and not just some random celebrity, or a friend who's popular enough to get 100 votes, or their priest?

&gt; Also if by recommendations you mean voting on the actual bills, well that would just be direct democracy.

yeah, that's what i said:

&gt; couldn't you get much of the benefits with a **direct democracy** were voters simply follow recommendations from their favourite experts,

(that doesn't mean i like direct democracy. i don't. vote chaining seems worse though.)

&gt; It would require an awful lot of time spent reading up on the bills.

not really. instead of vote-chaining to bill nye, you would simply follow a recommendation from bill nye. it will take some extra time, you have to read bill nye's recommendation and decide if it seems to make some sense, but that's a good thing. you should have at least some idea what you're actually voting for.

&gt; Also you can tell how they'll be chaining their votes and can then adjust your vote-chaining the next time around.

&gt; Vote-chaining is faster and more reliable since it's the expert making the call directly rather than indirectly telling voters how to vote.

okay, is it really faster? should it be? you save some time by not personally voting on every bill, but now you have to check what your expert did with your vote on every bill, and decide if you still trust that expert. let's be realistic here, most people simply won't do that. they'll vote-chain to some likeable ""experts"", and then forget about it.

people basically have to do the same work they have to do in a direct democracy, but after the vote has already happened. if they don't do this, and most won't, you have a system without oversight.

You are right that everyone is entitled to equal protection under the law, which is why such testimony is irrelevant in deciding the _guilt_ of the person accused.  How much the victim's family is hurt by any given crime has nothing to do with whether or not you did it, which is why we don't factor that into the trial itself.

The sentencing portion is attempting to achieve a different goal.  Once we have determined that you are guilty, the goal is now to decide how much you deserve to be punished.  There are many things that factor into this, including your reasoning, extenuating circumstances as well as impact to the victims.  Stealing a loaf of bread to feed your family from a supermarket and stealing money to buy a jetski from a poor single mother are both _stealing_ and you would be found just as guilty for one as the other, but we as a society accept that the _punishment_ for those two crimes should not be the same.

2240	"China has many internal problems that will hamper its potential as a global hegemon, each of which will complicate future growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

[GDP growth in China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263616/gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth-rate-in-china/)\--while still impressive and indicative of a more vibrant national economy--has been declining in recent years. While China will probably show good economic growth for decades, it's unlikely to return to its levels of growth in the 1990s or 2000s. Meanwhile, its [GDP per capita (2010 USD)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?end=2018&amp;locations=CN&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;start=1986), while continuously growing, is still leagues below many of the European and American democracies, and [the rate of growth for China's per capita GDP is also stagnating](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2018&amp;locations=CN&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;start=1986). China is also a highly unequal country, with a [high Gini coefficient and staggering increase in Gini coefficient](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18127.ashx) (the Gini coefficient is related to inequlaity; higher Gini coefficient means more economic stratification). What does all of this information tell us? China, while having experienced massive economic growth in the past decades, is unable to sustain previous rates of growth. At the same time, this money is largely benefiting the elites in China, with fewer of the material benefits of this growth reaching the population at large. Europeans and Americans are still generally much richer than Chinese people, allowing them to better sustain a consumer economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

China has no shortage of looming crises, either. The One-Child Policy was in effect from the 1980s to 2015, and the Two-Child Policy is currently in effect. I want to be clear that the primary victims of the One-Child Policy were the women who were sterilized, who were forced to have abortions, and who had the government violate their rights to reproductive privacy, as were the girls who were killed at birth or denied citizenship. The One-Child Policy is a horrendous stain on Chinese history. That said, there are numerous effects of the policy related to China's future.

&amp;#x200B;

The One-Child Policy was--in short--an unmitigated disaster that echoes into the present. Most obvious of its effects is the gender imbalance in China: [there's a California's worth more men than women in China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/too-many-men/), or 112 men ages 15-29 for every 100 women of the same age group. If you consider that older men will also try to find wives, that figure changes to 280 men ages 15-49 for every 100 women ages 15-29. And the worst is projected for the 2030s. I can't fully convey how much of a crisis this imbalance is, especially for a partly agrarian society that is organized around marriage and the family unit. Aside from the epidemic of despair among elder bachelors in China and horrific surge in human trafficking within and without the country, there are concrete economic externalities of this situation. Because of the intense competition, men and their families are saving money to invest in real estate to attract brides; [China's gross national savings rate has risen to around 50%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS?end=2018&amp;locations=CN-AE&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;start=1986) as the gender imbalance increased. Dowries (paid by the groom's family to the bride's in China) have also increased between 272% and 550% from 1994 to 2013. This requirement for such massive savings is simply incompatible with a healthy consumer economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The total fertility rate has fallen below the 2.1 required to maintain population size. The Chinese government hoped that allowing families to have an additional child would improve fertility rates, but [this has not materialized.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/china-birth-rate-2019.html) Since birth rates are falling as life expectancy increases, then China will develop a population with too few young people to support retirees; this is especially concerning considering China's culture of filial piety, as older adults rely on their families for support, rather than the underdeveloped social safety net. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences also predicts that--with current trends--the state pension fund risks insolvency in 15 years. With more pensioners than taxpayers and already low consumer spending, it will be difficult to foster the continuous growth needed for China to become the global juggernaut you fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, China will almost certainly experience a catastrophic bust as its social changes, heavy-handed policies, and low incomes at the bottom of society intersect in the 2030s and 2040s. While I doubt this would lead to the country's demise, I think it would avert a shift to a global order headed by China."	27	['is related', 'were sterilized', 'were forced', 'were killed', 'is projected', 'is organized']	6	4	0.14814814814814814	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is related', 'were sterilized', 'were forced', 'were killed', 'is projected', 'is organized']	6	4	0.14814814814814814	1	33972517757	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fr4mul/_/flucygt/	952558509		2020-03-29 13:42:07	50465863.0	INSERT_USERNAME___	187	False	700	0	True	True	34.86
2241	"Ok, thanks for clarifying. I guess the crux of my argument here is going to be that, yes, absolutely the arbitrariness and rigidity of gender roles is something that society should take a closer look at and revise its collective thinking on, so that nobody is forced to be or do anything that isn't right for them. But I think laying this problem at the feet of trans people who are just trying to get by isn't very helpful.

As you point out, there's nothing inherently gendered about long hair, for example. When I first started transitioning to male, I had luxurious curly hair halfway down my back. I wanted to keep it and be a long-haired guy. A little bit hippie free spirit, a little bit Weird Al.

I even kept my hairline shaved back a little bit into the square, slightly peaked shape that is more common in men, rather than the more rounded shape which was very feminizing on me. (Testosterone eventually took care of this for me, and then kept going. Oof.)

Well, no matter how hard I tried, I could not pass as male with that hair. Even when testosterone started to deepen my voice and change my body shape, I couldn't get a ""he"" for the life of me except from close friends who were trying. Combined with other cues I'm unable to change, like my height and my small hands, the hair caused my instant, initial impression on people to come off as 'woman'. 

When I finally cut it short, I started getting called ""he"" without even trying. It was *just enough* to flip that first-glance-gender switch to male, despite being a totally arbitrary identifier that wouldn't matter at all in a different culture or century. 

As another example, I like nail polish, and of course there's absolutely nothing inherently male or female about pigment on one's fingernails. But the first time I wore it to work as a guy, my boss – who was trying his best as a confused old dude and usually managed to get it right – said to a coworker, ""Why is she wearing nail polish? I thought she wanted to be a guy.""

Arbitrary though it is, the gendered visual of paint on my nails was all it took to trip him up. Reluctantly, I stopped wearing it.

What I'm getting at is that I've had to make sacrifices that cis people don't have to make, and I've decided that ""men can have long hair and wear nail polish"" just isn't my hill to die on. 

I actually do think that trans people have a lot to contribute to the understanding of gender and the undoing of harmful, rigid stereotypes. But *requiring* it of us, and claiming we’re the ones regressing society by not doing enough, is both unfair – since we have a lot on our plates already, and are often the ones most hurt by stereotypes in the first place – and untrue, since we’re a very small minority with less political power than some people imagine we have.

If you look at the big shifts in all of the movie industry, and see how theatre consolidation fits in, it's not as bad as it first appears. The theatre experience has become more hassle lately, with rising ticket prices, massive budget releases every couple of weeks, and cost/effort of physically getting to the theatre.

Side Note: I also bought Blade Runner2049 and The Last Jedi because I loved both and want to see them again and again, but that doesn't detract from my point.

For most of film history, the best way to see a movie was to go to the theatre. Demand drove up customers and brought in competition, which drove down prices. But some people (most people probably) just want to see the content of the movie, and don't want the entire movie-going experience that comes along with it. Also, I rented a new movie for $4.99, which allowed both me and my wife to watch it. That's $2.50 per ticket. No theatre will ever beat that pricing.

We're seeing a shift in the industry. Louis CK even tried creating his own TV show and releasing it directly to his customers. And it worked pretty well for him, financially. Streaming is the future of most media. Theatres won't ever die, entirely, but they'll dwindle to the size that the demand requires.

Good or bad is only dependent upon your perspective in this shift. Yes, going to the movie will become more expensive and less convenient. But seeing movies is only going to become more convenient. I don't know if we'll look back at this time and be really happy with the shift in industry overall, but there are plenty of positives to come out of these shifts. We'll just have to see if they pay off. And in the mean time, if you like enjoying movies in your pjs, with your own popcorn, then the streaming revolution will be a great time for you to watch movies."	26	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	30196469250	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8309ou/_/dve74si/	488780814		2018-03-08 18:26:06		boundbythecurve	2	False	441	0	False	True	71.85

2245	"&gt; The chief anti-abortion argument is that fetuses are alive.

That's probably the shittiest argument *ever*. Fetuses are alive, but so are both grown humans and cockroaches. Clearly being alive does not entail any right to life.

It's not impossible, but indeed *extremely hard* for a libertarian, to justify a violation of self-ownership so vital for libertarians. Pregnancy is essentially blood donation, and by aborting she would be acting in self-defense.

Even if the fetus had some intrinsic right to life, bodily autonomy is more important.

&gt; Unless you think it's okay to kill newborns, you can't criticize someone for wanting to protect a 9-month fetus. And if 9 months is reasonable, why not 8?

The issue is more nuanced. One could justify a general ban on infanticide as a violation of the rights of the parents, not the newborn.

&gt; The claim that atheists can't reach the same conclusions as Christians rests on the same logic as the claim that atheists cannot be moral.

It is very convincing and it shocks us how easily it could suck us in if it weren't being used for fun and games that we intellectually know aren't real (like Nicholas cage's face on Chandlers body), but can't convince ourselves emotionally that it isn't real.

So does photoshop. I don’t see why this isn’t incremental to photoshop. 

&gt;  This disconnect is ultimately what causes a lot of the unease.  

I think it’s literally *just* the novelty. 

&gt; And if you took away those obvious and intentional contextual clues that it is fake, we very well might not recognize that it is fake.  Such as a fake video call from our boss specifically intended to trick us.

This sounds *identical* to photoshop. And yet we aren’t being fooled by photoshopped images all the time. Why do you think that is?

&gt; •	⁠ANY form of remote communication from emails, to phone calls, to video calls can now be convincingly faked

Sort of? Imagine if I just was really good at voice impressions. Could I have scammed my way into something really important on that merit alone when phone calls were all we had? Or would I actually need inside information to pass as someone, to somehow have their phone number, and inside knowledge of what to ask for?



&gt; •	⁠Deep fakes feel very real and the sense of shock comes from knowing just how easily we'd be convinced by such fakes

Yeah. I know. That’s my point. We’re reacting to that shock. But that shock is not the same thing as an actual hazard. 

&gt; Even if NOBODY actually abused deep fakes, just the fact that we just don't have a foolproof way to verify that were talking with who we appear to be talking to is a costly thing for society which means we need to take extra steps to protect ourselves during every virtual interaction.  And that is even before we get into when criminals get more serious about using this.

Yeah this sounds identical to catfishing as it exist today. Real time video or voice isn’t great.

No it's not. Nation-wide, it's 70k a year. It's even above 100k in California.

https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm

&gt;It's really unfortunate that police are so under respected.

Following up with that because respect or social status can be considersd a form of payment as well.
Obviously, cops aren't as respected as firemen by the general population, but they're paid significantly more (In Los Angeles, a top-earning fireman can get up to 92k a year, which is BELOW AVERAGE for policemen in california.)
Being a fireman also requires more physical fitness, and they often require more training, especially in first aid.
And while it's true that the police is not that well respected by the average population, they actually get a LOT more respect from some parts of the population - the average respect given to a police officer is lower than for a fireman, because it is more polarized - but they also get a lot more respect in the appropriate circles.

Overall, I'd say the police are compensated significantly more for their work than firemen, and probably any other job with the same required qualifications. It's hard to say whether or not it's worth the risk, but they certainly do get rewarded for it.



&gt;Based on the ruling, I'd be hard pressed to believe criminals aren't encouraged to play a lethal game of chicken with police.

How is that good for the perp exactly? I don't think anyone is ready to die to send a cop to jail.

On the contrary, making it harder to kill protect cops. If cops can shoot you in the back freely, then when arrested you lose the option to run and can only try to kill them first. If cops weren't allowed to shoot unless shot at first, they'd actually be much safer because criminal would be able to try to run away instead of fighting back."	16	"['can be considersd', ""'re paid"", 'are compensated', 'do get rewarded', ""aren't encouraged"", 'is now charged', 'intent needed', ""weren't allowed""]"	8	6	0.375	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['can be considersd', ""'re paid"", 'are compensated', 'do get rewarded', ""aren't encouraged"", 'is now charged', 'intent needed', ""weren't allowed""]"	8	6	0.375	1	36728986231	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mw1dzm/_/gvfhn5j/	1384068370		2021-04-22 07:47:10	573146814767.0	Frenetic_Platypus	3	False	361	4	False	True	58.52

The question is not whether more per-pupil spending will help, it's whether it will help *enough* to make it worth what you perceive to be the potential costs or risks of the measure.


Generally the way education works in this country is that funding and basic parameters (standards, testing, etc.) comes from the state, but specific instructional policy is decided at the local (district) level.  Changing this policy-making structure is outside the scope of a single ballot measure.  Maybe targeting the money more specifically towards certain initiatives or programs would have a greater impact, or maybe it wouldn't, depending on the programs.  Sometimes top-down regulation of schools can be counterproductive.  Again, all else being equal, more money will help.  Other policies the state could try to improve schools (variously, these might include expanding charter schools, targeted reading programs in early elementary, improving in-school health and nutrition services, all of which have been shown to greater or lesser degrees to be helpful) would probably be decided independently of specific revenue-raising measures.  It's important to remember that state budgets are a much more flexible thing than most people realize-- I can go into more detail on this if it's important to you.


Ultimately, it comes down to a question of what you value and how you assess risk.  You seem to agree that the potential risks/costs of the measure have been overstated by its opponents.

>It would be best to make pitbull breeding illegal.

Sure, then you will have banned pure pitbulls that are quite safe dogs if treated and trained well, but left all mixed breeds that look like pitbulls - which are most probable to be perps of majority of attacks as idiots who get them to have an aggressive attack dog are not buying them from reputable breeder, they are taking them from some shady guy who is mixing breeds to get scary dogs.

And let's say that somehow magically you have invented DNA test to verify and neuter all pitbulls and mixed breeds that include pitbull in lineage. What is solved? 

Nothing. Idiots who want aggressive dog will move onto other scary looking breed (ex. Rottweilers, Dobermann, American Bulldogs, Wolfdogs) and buy shady mixed breeds looking like them, abuse them to ""train aggressivness"" and the cycle will continue.

Disney is a true monolith in entertainment, much much larger than any other media conglomerate.  They have the money and influence to have entire public relations departments working on their image.  It works the same way with Pfizer, Merck and the other pharmaceutical giants that influence the news media by spending so much on advertising on news networks: you don’t bite the hand that feeds you.

Thats called stock, taxation or donation. From the sound of it you want it to be more along the lines of taxation. In which why not just have government labs...

Why would you think this? Without a profit based model they would be WORSE at having the flexible funds to be able to adapt into the different market. 

&gt;I say crowdfunded in the sense that the public would in a way form an investment group and fund the company across stages until many people hold private equity (like micro-percentages. Use crypto currency?).

Once again thats just stock. You are just adding in new phrases to make it seem ""new"". Using a crypto currency would honestly be meaningless here since it would just act as a stand in to the currency being invested. Why would that do anything?

&gt;However, the company wouldn’t allow for one individual or group to have majority ownership besides those elected to lead the company

The killing wouldn't be moral since we have rules against that, but yes overall it would be better to have them live than not even knowing they would be murdered.

In both cases the child ends up not existing, but in the case where they were born they have an entire childhood and subjective life experiences which otherwise wouldn't occur.

2283	"I actually like the concept of systemic or institutional racism because it doesn't have to be ""intentional.""  One of the problems that people have thinking about racism is they imagine it has to be evil oppressors twirling their mustaches saying ""Ah ha, here's can we can keep the black people down!""

That's obviously something that happens in cases like segregation, slavery, etc.  And it's also the easiest to oppose.  But systemic racism is way more insidious.  Even if people aren't overtly racist, their minor prejudices, mental blind spots, natural human foibles, and sometime rational self-interest have a multiplicative effect until you regularly wind up with racist outcomes.  Even worse, add a couple outright racists to the mix, and the system just gets pushed farther even if most people never set out to make it that way.  Those effects compound on themselves over time and across generations, until you can be really far removed from anyone who was directly responsible but still deal with the impact.

Take white flight and [blockbusting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting) in the '50s and '60s.  There is some explicit ugly racism at play, but it's fundamentally taking advantage of individuals making individually rational decisions.  White families leaving those neighborhoods didn't have to be intentionally racist.  The dynamics didn't even have to be caused by malicious conspiring realtors.  But when confronted with a black person moving into the neighborhood, they knew property values might fall.  It's rationale to choose to get out before that happens, even if they truly believe they aren't racist but they have to leave because others are.  This makes price declines a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Racism was clearly a factor, but no individual actually has to be intentionally racist to get the same result.

Now project that forward.  Eventually we recognize that this and other real estate practices are super racist and take steps to stop them. That's great, except white people's property is still worth more than black people's.  Even if you end the racist practices, you can mandate price changes.  So even if no one at all is intentionally racist ever again, black families are starting off behind their white peers, which has ripple effects across generations.  No one is sitting down to plan how to perpetuate this, but it's effects are still real.  That is what is meant by ""systemic racism.""

A mile of road alone typically costs over $1 million to repave and you can have hundreds of miles of roads in a medium size town. That’s not including other infrastructure like water and sewage.

We have a debt crisis coming our way and it will be a trying time for everyone. An argument can be made that we aren’t taxing enough for our lifestyle. We either reduce how much infrastructure we have to maintain and cut back on public programs or we need to tax more to cover the costs.

&gt; 0.999... is, by definition, the limit of the sequence 0.9 , 0.99, 0.999, 0.999 , ....
And that limit is 1.
    
What if there was no limit to that sequence? I think there is in fact no limit to that sequence. That You could always add another number to the sequence without reaching 1.       
    
I think there is an assumption that continuing that sequence infinitely will eventually get you to 1 (or maybe there isn't and limits don't touch on that). I think this isn't the case at all, and the sequence asymptotically approaches 1, becoming increasingly exact...but never 100% exact. Only 99.999...% exact.    

    
I'm using 0.999... to mean a number as close to 1 as possible, without actually being 1. Asserting the existence of a number or quantity that can be infinitely small. e.g. My view is that dividing a length in two infinitely will never reduce that length to 0.

2301	"For simplicity, I'll limit my post to affirmative action among private universities, since public institutions runs into many complications. I would agree that affirmative action (whether race-based or otherwise) is mistaken insofar as it results in underqualified students being admitted. Admitting students who don't have the qualifications to succeed is setting them up for failure, and we should not be setting students up for failure. But I don't see anything wrong with race-based affirmative action among private universities where only qualified students are accepted, i.e. giving preference to a member of a certain race when choosing between two qualified applicants of different races. This is what I wish to defend.

You are correct that race-based affirmative action is discriminatory. The question that remains, however, is whether it's immoral. The fact that a policy is discriminatory, in itself, doesn't imply that it's immoral. If that were the case, then *all* employers would be immoral, since all employers discriminate between applicants based on their skills, knowledge, traits, etc. or even appearance. So it can't be discrimination alone that makes race-based affirmative action immoral. 

You might instead say it's immoral because it's specifically *racial discrimination*. But that can't be right either. There are also cases of morally permissible racial discrimination. For example, casting directors for movies and plays discriminate based on race all the time. Why is this morally permissible? It must have something to do with the fact that race might be a *relevant feature* of the actors and actresses of the given movie, play, etc. In other words, racial discrimination by casting directors might not be *arbitrary discrimination*, and this is why it's not immoral. Race just so happens to be an essential component of the product that movie/play creators are trying to sell.

This seems right to me. Discrimination by itself can't wrong, even if it's racial discrimination. What's wrong is *arbitrary discrimination*. This explains why racial discrimination seems almost always wrong. The reason is that racial discrimination is almost always arbitrary. Most jobs require you to apply manual labor or process information or something that has nothing to do with race. But if we imagine cases where race *is* a relevant characteristic (e.g. for casting directors), we see that racial discrimination is actually morally permissible. This also can explain why discrimination seems morally wrong when it has nothing to do with race. For example, let's say that an applicant is denied a job as a programmer because the employer didn't like his/her eye color. This sort of discrimination seems wrong not because it's racial discrimination, but because it's arbitrary discrimination. 

So the arbitrariness of discrimination is what determines whether discrimination is morally wrong. Now, the question is whether race-based affirmative action (of the kind I mentioned earlier) by private universities is arbitrary. In other words, is race a *relevant feature* of the students of a university? It seems clear to me that it almost always is. Universities aren't just selling library usage and lectures to students. They also purport to offer a college campus of a certain kind. That is, the makeup and ""atmosphere"" of the college campus is a part of the overall product that universities wish to sell. Students are not just *customers* of a university; they are also a part of *the product* (just like actors/actresses are a part of the product of movies/plays). Thus, race *is* an essential component of the product/service of all universities that wish to advertise a college campus with a certain racial makeup (whether that be a racially diverse campus or a racially homogenous campus). Thus, race-based affirmative action among private universities is not an arbitrary form of racial discrimination, and is therefore not immoral. 

If this still seems unintuitive, consider the fact that many universities already practice a similar form of discrimination in the form of sex-based discrimination. The most extreme form of discrimination of this kind comes from women's colleges and men's colleges, universities that only allow students of a certain sex. Most do not intuit that sex-based discrimination from these colleges is immoral. The reason is that the sexual makeup of the student campus is clearly an essential part of the product that these colleges wish to sell; thus, sex-based discrimination would not be arbitrary. No doubt there are also colleges out there that perform sex-based discrimination for the opposite goal, to maintain a roughly even male:female on campus. People don't intuit that sex-based discrimination from such universities is morally wrong (I would argue) because it's not *arbitrary* discrimination. I see no reason to treat race-based discrimination any differently."	45	['is mistaken', 'being admitted', 'are accepted', 'is denied']	4	3	0.06666666666666667	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is mistaken', 'being admitted', 'are accepted', 'is denied']	4	3	0.06666666666666667	1	29994993109	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7ni3jd/_/ds28st1/	462738793		2018-01-02 00:18:58		jay520	30	False	761	0	False	True	46.88

The least he can do is after he relaxes in his private Jacuzzi, has a cigar- his special treat when working out of town- he Skype us and have dinner with us. He usually goes to smaller towns, so food quality is generally bad around, like local Chinese food, etc. All about to be ordered as take out so he can Skype with us back at home. We want to Skype so we can tell him about our day, and our son can see his daddy. Our son is also in language therapy because he still isn't talking, so Skype will also help him try to to talk more. We also moved to this state 3 years back and don't have any family and never met any friends as I work from home and my husband works with  men twice our age, or the few around our age all have their own families and such, but he usually works with the same few people, the older guys, including the guy in talking about, they always go out of town together.

At it's core, critical thinking is about making clear, reasoned judgements, but here are various [other definitions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#Definitions) Playing an instrument and solving mathematical problems does involve using your brain to figure out a certain problem, but I think it's different form the type found in literature for two reasons. 

First, there is an objectively correct answer in those pursuits. 2+2 is always 4. You must play a C note at exactly the right point in time in order to play the song correctly. There is greater room for critical thinking at more advanced levels of these fields (there are fields of math where 2+2 does not equal 4, for example) but not in the way it's taught at the high school level.

Next, there is critical thinking in learning to solve a given problem for the first time, but this type of critical thinking quickly becomes routine. It's hard to solve a given equation the first time you see it, but after a few tries, it's impossible not to know the answer immediately. The same applies to a given song. You have to stumble through a given song many times, but eventually it becomes second nature. You couldn't forget it if you tried.

Sand is an extreme example, but every variety of soil has some angle that it will naturally follow. If you dig a shallow enough trench, then most clay soils will maintain the wall that you dig, but the deeper you go, the greater is the pressure from soil outside the trench to push the walls into the trench.

The bolded part is almost certainly the wrong metric. The thing you care about is who is *actually right*. This is certainly correlated with being ""better educated within the subject"", but you don't want to get into pure credentialism here. The measurement you have to try to make is acknowledging and respecting the opinion of who is *actually correct*.

We have literally made it so at they don’t have to pay for any of their basic needs. Even with all that we have residents that sell their food stamps for drug money and then they go hit up various places u can get free food In Seattle (food pantries and the such). Some residents are on ssi, just collecting checks and spending it on drugs. It’s insane yo.

I agree with that. What I don't agree with is that the best concrete task to choose for achieving this is necessarily space stuff. (It *could* be, but merely asserting so doesn't convince me.) Why not pour that money into, say, fusion-based energy? For all you or I know, if we had spent all the space programme money on fusion programmes instead, we'd have all our space spinoffs *and* we'd have incidentally gotten a space programme out of it (for mining helium-3 on the moon, maybe).

2337	"&gt; This comes up later too, but does just ""black people are inferior"" count, if the person doesn't then go on to say they should be enslaved? The ""violence"" in question there would be the stress the black students feel from having such a viewpoint validated by the institution they trust to take care of them.

""Black people are inferior"" would depend on context because it isn't necessarily hate. They may have reasons for it like ""Black people have lower IQ"" which is something people can and do believe and argue that with statistics, while others can argue IQ correlates with things like poverty which confound such statistics. 

As for stress = violence, that's way too far towards giving people a right not to be offended. Plenty of things people do that stress me out aren't equivalent to violence at all and don't warrant any sort of penalty.

The institution also isn't necessarily validating their viewpoints, and that's important for students to know.


&gt; But let's also draw a distinction between ""silly Tumblr people being extreme"" and ""something that results in actual consequences for professionals and academics."" The latter seems in fact very DIFFICULT to find, even for all these people on the internet extremely motivated to find it.

I guess we just disagree about this, it doesn't seem difficult to find the latter at all to me.

&gt; Disinvitations are on the rise solely because of Milo Yiannopoulis. 

&gt; Milo Yian-freakin-nopoulis?

They've been on the rise for over a decade, it's not just Milo.

I can give you Milo as someone who said genuinely disinvite worthy things(though I don't know if they were in his actual speeches), even though he seems to be open about being a sort of troll and not genuinely believing everything he says.

&gt; shouldn't people be allowed to make the argument? Shouldn't people be allowed to rally against it if they genuinely think it's immoral? Shouldn't institutions take these genuine viewpoints of their own students seriously?

People can make the argument, people can rally. Institutions can take them seriously even. However, it's just better to err on the side of free speech and not actually give into student demands - the issue is that institutions are folding to mobs of upset students when they shouldn't be more and more often. 

&gt; I'm worried about people developing a callous that defends them from anyone who talks about prejudice or discrimination... a callous made of ""You're just bullying me and you're one of those bad SJWs who's ruining the left and you want to silence all opposition.""

A legitimate worry, but another thing actually fueled by the overzealous behavior of SJWs I'd argue. This may be a point of disagreement we can't get past.

&gt; I've talked to anti-PC people and... it's not the tone that really makes them mad. There isn't some magic way to say ""Those beliefs you think are reasonable? I think they're racist and causing more harm than good,"" without setting off a strong immune response. This is mostly because of the belief, which you've expressed several times, that any suggestion of racism is a fierce personal attack and not just someone talking about racism. 

Some people are beyond reason, but calling people/things racist is an overplayed card that's destroying the meaning of the word and SJWs contributed to that. You're not wrong that some views are racist, some people are racist, and are using that situation to their advantage. That's just what happens when you play the language game. The immune response is now just a thing that has to be dealt with differently. 

&gt; When people have tried to soften the language to get away from attacks, like talking about privilege, where the entire point is that no individuals are personally to blame? 

That's because privileged isn't that soft of a thing to call people who don't consider themselves such, and people do use it in ways that are... problematic(""Check your privilege"" isn't helping anything). People then - sometimes as a result of problematic use of the term - take it as a point that they somehow don't deserve what they've got, didn't earn it, etc. etc. and in American culture that's just a really bad choice of word to pivot to. That's exactly what the part of that speech by Obama was getting at.

2338	"&gt; The war question was more about how easy it would be to use guns and artillery to get what you want when there's no police force or government to lock you up.

Anarchism is about a lack of leaders, not a lack of groups or armies. They can form armies fine, they can work in factories to make weapons. 

I think a big issue is you're assuming anarchists are incompetent and can't solve simple problems. Yes, anarchists are capable of gathering together in groups to shoot people. Yes, anarchists can run machines that make guns. Yes, anarchists can tell people to not follow bad capitalist ideas. 

&gt;What if some real Dictator type dude takes over a big group, manipulates other groups into merging them and eventually ends up with one big super group?

What if a group of anarchic groups band together to seduce people out of capitalism and kill anyone who has the wrong political system? I mean, these are all things that can happen, but they're not really objections, just scenarios that are common to capitalism, anarchism and socialism.

They can gather an army and shoot the dictator. Simple solution, common to any political system. 

&gt;The anarchist society of southern Ukraine at the end of the First World War was a major threat to the German and Austrian empires, the White Army, the short-lived nationalist Ukrainian state, and the Soviet Union. The volunteer militias of the Makhnovists inspired major desertions from the ranks of the authoritarian Red Army, forced out the Austro-Germans and the nationalists who tried to lay claim to their lands, and aided the defeat of the White Army. This is especially remarkable considering that they were armed almost entirely with weapons and ammunition seized from the enemy. Coordinating forces of up to tens of thousands, the anarchists regularly fought on multiple fronts and shifted between frontal and guerrilla warfare with a fluidity conventional armies are incapable of. Despite always being vastly outnumbered, they defended their land for several years. At two decisive battles, Peregonovka and the Perekop isthmus, the Makhnovist militias smashed the larger White Army, which was supplied by Western governments.

&gt;Extraordinary mobility and a bag of clever tricks constituted Makhno’s chief tactical devices. Traveling on horseback and in light peasant carts (tatchanki) on which machine guns were mounted, his men [ed: and women] moved swiftly back and forth across the open steppe between the Dnieper and the Sea of Azov, swelling into a small army as they went, and inspiring terror in the hearts of their adversaries. Hitherto independent guerrilla bands accepted Makhno’s command and rallied behind his black banner. Villagers willingly provided food and fresh horses, enabling the Makhnovtsy to travel 40 or 50 miles a day with little difficulty. They would turn up quite suddenly where least expected, attack the gentry and military garrisons, then vanish as quickly as they had come[...] When cornered, the Makhnovtsy would bury their weapons, make their way singly back to their villages, and take up work in the fields, awaiting the next signal to unearth a new cache of arms and spring up again in an unexpected quarter. Makhno’s insurgents, in the words of Victor Serge, revealed “a truly epic capacity for organization and combat.”[115]

Anarchists generally see their ideas as ideologically superior, and hope to convince the general populace of them. In places where they are successful their armies can have major advantages over standard socialist or capitalist armies. 

&gt;you can't really manipulate a country out of a capitalist system, sure you can change people's opinions but you can't really 'turn' a society around when it's built on the idea of capitalism.

There have been many revolutions in capitalist countries, and many socialist groups and anarchist groups dedicated to doing just that. 

&gt;Anarchism isn't confined to the same ruleset and can thus be changed at any time if you get enough people to agree to change it, unless you firmly teach them on the subject.

You can have education and culture in an anarchic society, and they are often very resistant to change.

Would you consider the lack of a DAL for girls until 2017 unfair discrimination if the USSF didn't have enough interest from young girls to warrant investment in youth programs for girls? Is the lack of a girls program in the DAL de facto unfair discrimination to you, or is there some threshold percentage of girls out of the total population of all kids interested in soccer at which you draw the line between fair and unfair?

2366	"&gt;when do they diverge entirely? Why are Creole or Geechee different from French, and what point would we say that a dramatic example like the one I linked is no longer English, but some sort of Scottish variant of English?

There are mostly interesting questions, but I don't see how any of them lead to the conclusion that languages have shifted or evolved *too far* to the point where they've crossed a line. For example, I don't see how knowing when, where, or why black people started saying ""I'm finna buy a car"" informs how acceptable or unacceptable the vernacular is.

Well that's because you *do* know that he's speaking English. I'm sure you recognized that that post isn't in Spanish or Japanese or Czech. I don't see why you need to look at that and say ""it's not English"" when what you mean is ""I don't understand it."" You're having trouble reconciling this because you are wrongly assuming that the measure of whether something is English is whether *you* subjectively can understand it. 

To someone who doesn't understand basic AAVE, ""I'm finna cop a Rollie"" is not understandable, but clearly it's English. Materially, for our purposes, the difference between ""I'm finna cop a Rollie"" and ""Gies a a gobble ya gonk dafty wheelie"" isn't really about when the slangs diverged or why they did. The difference is a difference in *you the listener*, not a difference in the nature of the words. *That* is why there's no brightline test or clear point where we can say ""NOW it isn't English!"" It is all subjective to the listener."	15	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	34073577953	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/g1y0ax/_/fnij10h/	970725129	34073371350.0	2020-04-15 17:00:36	14122712.0	BAWguy	1	False	300	2	False	True	68.1

Nakba was a genocide because it involved killing a displacing a large group of people with the intended effect of destroying the nation of Palestine. 

The main difference in the Israel/Palestine conflict and the general existence of Canada is that the natives in Canada stopped fighting back. Likely, they stopped fighting back because they did not have the support of 1.8 billion other natives. Not to suggest that all Muslims support Palestine, but yea, at no point has resistance stopped.

The fact that natives in Canada did stop fighting back does not mean the natives in Canada were right to stop resisting, and Palestinians are wrong to continue resisting.

""Allowed""? Are you a slave, that must obey a master who is ""allowing"" you to do things or not? 

You are *allowed* to do whatever you want. You *should* do things that have good consequences, and you *shouldn't* do things that have bad consequences. 

I judge you on *two* things - your intent *and* your rationality. If the outcomes of your actions systematically differ from the intent that drives your actions, I might deem you irrational, stupid, ignorant...but not *evil*. You are correct that judgement of good and evil is solely based on intent, but *consequences matter too*.

I'm not telling you that you're not *allowed* to say ""nigger"". I'm telling you that there are sometimes good or neutral outcomes to saying it, and there are sometimes bad outcomes to you saying it, and that the outcome of your words will not always correspond to your intent. And I'm further telling you that if you are uncertain, it's better to err on the side of not saying it. And I'm further telling you that most white people do not have the relevant experience to be certain about this.

In short, I'm assuming your *intent* is to be good, and I am giving you information which will hopefully cause you to **behave in such a way that the outcomes are in line with your intent**. 

You can disagree with my *information*, but if you have a philosophical opposition to *the most basic tenant of instrumental rationality* (the text in bold) then we need to have a very different discussion before we can even start to talk about an issue like this.


&gt;If it's a label you embrace freely

No, it's not a label embraced freely. It's a label *forced upon a person*, which they embrace *because* embracing a slur is an effective counter-bullying strategy. 

Were you never bullied as a kid? One way to get them to stop was to pretend that you were not harmed by their actions. If you preemptively call *yourself* a ""nerd"", then when the bully calls you a nerd it rings hollow. If there was no bully, you wouldn't have needed to do this in the first place. The other way is to stand up for yourself and express your anger in a loud and public way - ""fuck off, how dare you call me a nerd!"". There is nothing wrong with using both these strategies simultaneously.

Which is why it is a-okay and even *commendable* when the nerd says ""nerd"", but it's bad when the bully says ""nerd"", and there is a gray  context-dependent area when non-bully-non-nerds say ""nerd"", get it? (Gray area being because the bully might sometimes be more likely to go after the guy who everyone calls ""nerd"".)

&gt;I don't care, they should change the law.

But the law supports both equally, it just is arguably applied unevenly. You should be wanting to change the fact that the law is applied unequally rather than wanting to change the law itself to be unequal.

It's not at all reductionist. You argued that Right to Life and Body Autonomy in the case of pregnancy are mutually exclusive. They are not.

1. There is no Natural right to life. People and all living things die all the time. The very nature of living involves dying. So when people talk about the right to life they are really talking about body Autonomy, as in I have a right not to be killed.  

2. Even if we say that the fetus is a person (which I do not) this would be a question of who's body autonomy is in play here and does one supersede the other?  The mother's body autonomy is clearly being impacted because the fetus is taking nourishment from the mother causing the mother's body to change in ways that may not be healthy for the mother. The fetus's body autonomy is not being affected at all. It's not the mother's fault that it can't live out side of her womb. Even if you say the fetus's autonomy is being impacted who's autonomy takes precedence or who's autonomy is being more impacted. Its clearly the mother's because the mother can live without the child but may not by having the child. The fetus will never live (at least in the early stages) without the mother. 

>The person with organs didn’t bring the dying person into the world only to later decide that they don’t want them to live.

Not necessarily true. What about women where raped? They didn't make any choice to bring the fetus into the world.

Even with donor example, this isn't necessarily true. It is quite possible for someone to attack another person that causes the victim to require more blood, a new liver, or a new kidney. Yet we don't require attackers to donate blood or organs.

>Also the question if you concede that the fetus is a human(which I don’t) would involve actively killing the dying person so that the other person can avoid harvesting their organs which seems to me to be a more nuanced ethical question.

This is very nuanced, but I'm not sure I agree that you are actively killing some one. This is a bit like the trolley problem. Are you actively killing someone if you deny them food and you are the only source of food? Even if you supplying them food could hurt you're own future?"	27	['be killed', 'being impacted', 'being affected', 'is being impacted']	4	4	0.14814814814814814	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be killed', 'being impacted', 'being affected', 'is being impacted']	4	4	0.14814814814814814	1	43287206120	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15p4uhh/_/jvw3208/	2521329749	43286607314.0	2023-08-12 13:53:33	12454534.0	cdin0303	1	False	420	3	False	True	72.56

Preference and emotions don't need to be totally rational. An asexual person could have many reasons why they prefer one gender over another, whether you agree that they are ""good"" reasons is another point, it isn't necessarily arbitrary to pick a gender.

For example, an asexual female might prefer a male partner because she wants to raise a biological child that her partner's DNA is a part of. An asexual male could prefer a male partner because his partner might enjoy the physical act of sex and the asexual person might participate to make his partner happy, but there is no risk of pregnancy nor need to use contraceptive. An asexual person might want to please their old fashioned parents and play along to please them since they're indifferent to gender. An asexual women might want to have another woman as a partner because she wants to share clothes. There are a ton of reasons you can imagine.

The main reason why I would understand that there aren't non-alcoholic beverages in restaurant (other than sodas or fruit juice) is because I can't think of non-alcoholic expensive beverges in the first place.

For wines a true market and expertise has evolved to the point that the finest bottles are luxury enough to be put in nice restaurant.  

For non-alcoholic beverage, the most subtile and finest beverages I can think of are really well made tea, or cocktails.

You can debate whether a particular god is real or unreal, but the tangible function of religion, the observable part that we can do more about than speculate, is that of a cognitive tool people use to comprehend and navigate existence. People cling to religion because it puts themselves into a perspective that they can grasp. Atheists do the same thing whether they'll admit to it or not. The cosmic perspective that gives them comfort is simply a godless one, which is neither better or worse.

&amp;#x200B;

So, in any case, someone might find that the cognitive tool taught to them by their parents works, or they might eventually decide to change it up. Often this results from trauma such as a death in the family or rehabilitation from substance abuse, but nevertheless a change in religion is simply swapping one tool for another.

2400	"&gt; If someone is depressed for a long time, they are by definition not ""otherwise healthy.""

That’s not what I meant when I said otherwise healthy. I was talking about people who had depression or a different mental illness but they didn’t have a terminal disease or any other reason for suicide, besides that they wanted it. People would tend to agree that the person with a terminal illness should be offered euthanasia. But I am arguing for people with a mental illness that makes them suicidal but with no other illness, so therefore they are “otherwise healthy”. TBH I should have clarified that.


&gt; They are suffering from a chemical imbalance in their brains that causes them to feel strong emotions (or lack of emotions) incongruent with the real-world stimuli they're experiencing. Depression is a state of poor health. 

To answer your point, I think that just because someone has a chemical imbalance that makes them sadder than they should be, it is no reason to force them to live if they don’t want to. Also they may be sadder than they should be but that doesn’t change the fact that they are constantly suffering. Let’s say someone has been fighting depression for 10 years, or even longer, and they can’t overcome it. Should they just be forced to continue to be miserable for the rest off their lives? As you said, depression is a state of poor health and giving them the option of euthanasia will be giving them mercy at that point.

Now imagine someone who has been depressed for 2 months. The world around them is collapsing, they are losing there job, becoming more distant from their family/friends/lover, they spend all day in bed and only get out to eat. They will be watching their life fall apart and despite what people say, it doesn’t always “get better”. If it does continue to go like that then they should be able to die. If not, then they are going to end up like the guy in the first paragraph. You could say that they should’nt be giving the option due to a chemical imbalance but if someone isn’t enjoying life then they shouldn’t be forced to live it.

2404	"&gt;If students reach the poverty threshold, most should qualify for maximum Pell Grant which helps to fund their undergraduate education. 

I don't think you understand. For you it's clearly cut and dry. But that's not the case for nearly anyone. The Expected Familial Contribution system is woefully ill equipped to help every student with their educational goals, even an undergraduate degree. Upon turning 18, my parents didn't give me a dime to further my education, but I had to report their taxes for my financial aid. They made on paper, well above the amount where they should have been assisting me, but we were a family of 5. So my parents were extremely cash poor as a result. I was offered $600 a semester, and after my car broke down in my second semester of college, I couldn't even afford emergency repairs to continue my education. I had to put off school for an additional 6 years, so that I could report my own taxes at 24 (the reporting age was 23, but was bumped to 24 the year I would have qualified) I am now 28 and still a year shy of graduating from undergrad. Even now, I get a total of $25,000 in aid annually 12,500 of which are loans. Of that I pay $6600 for tuition, going to the most affordable school in the state, leaving me $18,400 a year to handle my living expenses and bills, including essential things like books and other learning materials for my program. Poverty level for my area is $24,000 a year. The level of red tape for anyone who isn't a clear recipient of aid, is far more complicated and a much bigger deterrent you are giving credit for. 


At bear minimum, cutting my education by 2 years would have saved me over $18,000 in expenses. It would have given me 2 year larger window of pay advancement in a career field of my choosing, and the opprotunity cost of going to school would have gone down monumentally. 

&gt;I also think that it gives college students who are undecided have something to do while they’re looking for a major.

 Those students shouldn't be in school until they have an idea of what they want to do. Bogging the system with a bunch of students who don't know what they want in life is extremely harmful to the ones that do. It leads to affordable institutions being impacted, and having to turn away individuals who are ready to act like adults. There is nothing worse than attempting to complete your education, and being turned away from a course offering because its a gen ed requirement that is full for the semester. Every semester that school is protracted is like taking a massive barrel of money and setting it on fire. Its 6 months you could have been working in your field, its 6 months you didn't have loans footing your bills, its 6 months where you could have been doing anything really more productive than waiting to finish your education and being caught up in the ineffective college system.

Just this last semester alone one of my peers was denied the final class to complete his degree due to the course offerings being completely full. He's got to make due for 12 months to finish his degree (6 for this semester and then 6 to take the class) Those costs are a direct result of foundational coursework impacting the school."	26	"[""'s clearly cut and dry."", 'was offered', 'was bumped', 'being impacted', 'being turned', 'is protracted', 'being caught', 'was denied', ""'s got""]"	9	9	0.34615384615384615	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'s clearly cut and dry."", 'was offered', 'was bumped', 'being impacted', 'being turned', 'is protracted', 'being caught', 'was denied', ""'s got""]"	9	9	0.34615384615384615	1	31226782894	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/a8ykb4/_/ecfmbvy/	619711312	31226689266.0	2018-12-24 00:52:44	14777131.0	championofobscurity	2	False	579	2	False	True	64.85

What I mean by this is that in an election, someone will win, and someone will definitely receive the power of that office. It's zero-sum because everyone knows for a fact that one of the candidates will win and the others will lose.

In that contest, every election is not about interests, or corporate money, it is just about being favored over your competition, because no matter how few people participate, or how enthused they are, the votes all count the same and the power of the office doesn't change.

They don't actually have to care about your interests, they just have be preferred over the other choices, and that can be achieved many other ways than simply respecting your constituents interests (and is why politics gets so negative so quickly... easier to make the opposition less likable than make yourself more).

Corporations and the executives who run them don't generally operate in a zero-sum situation however.

2417	"&gt; Another commenter corrected me. I was using the term marginalized incorrectly to describe people on the shit-end of inequality. So yeah, Hollywood is not marginalizing white men, but perhaps ""disparage?"" I don't know what word, but marginalize is not the correct one.

I sympathize with the difficulty here,  but disparage adds new problems, because it means bringing someone down.  White men aren't being brought down; they're just not being brought UP.

&gt; Well, yes technically. But I think you twisted my words a bit here. I didn't mean that their feelings towards the experience of racism are viewed as invalid...because they totally are. That's like a civilian telling a combat vet about war. 

Cool, but do you see how being ambiguous in your wording could contribute to people criticizing you?  We can't see your belief that non-white people's comments on *the experience of * racism are the most valid ones.  


&gt; What I meant is that white people are not allowed to even say they feel like something pertaining to race is unfair because they get verbally attacked.

This is simply untrue.  I know you're using hyperbole, but I think it's really easy in cases like this to buy in to your own hyperbole, and so you should avoid it, if possible.

I'd like to propose two things.  First, it is uniquely difficult to be in your position and EMOTIONALLY distinguish ""attacked"" from ""criticized.""  If I think your comments on race are bullshit and that your lack of perspective is related to being a white man, that's *criticism*.  It's also INFORMED criticism, sensitive to what the person is saying.  You can disagree with this criticism, but that doesn't make it an attack, and that doesn't make it knee-jerk.  

Second, it makes sense that you would buy your own hyperbole here, because it legit hurts you when someone says you're racist.  It hits hard.  But the problem with this is, it easily slides into a narrative where *the feelings of the people being called racist are the entire point*.  And I think a lot of what you call ""dismissing white men's feelings"" is people actually just saying, ""Jesus christ, stop changing the subject to your own feelings; that's not what we're talking about right now.""

&gt; And it isn't even the marginalized group that attacks...it's other white people trying to ""out-woke"" everyone else. 

this isn't fair, because it implies you think people aren't being *fully sincere* when making these criticisms, and I see no evidence of that.

Your view is also contradictory, because here you have white people commenting left and right about race... and no one stepping in to 'attack' them.  Right?  Doesn't the existence of these people negate your earlier point?

&gt; One time I held the door for a woman and she loudly said in a sarcastic, sneering voice, ""Oh am I too weak to open a door on my own, you big strong man?""   I saw one woman giving me a dirty look, I saw a guy kind of smile and shrug at me, and there was a little old lady walking behind her that said, ""I'll gladly allow a handsome young man to hold the door for me,"" and gave me a smile.


You say holding the door is an example of something where you're ""trying to do the right thing"" so fine.  But presumably it's because you've *thought deeply* about holding the door for women, *considered* the arguments it's a sexist act, and actively come to the conclusion that either it's not sexist or that its good outweighs its bad.  Right?

So, nothing the woman says should be surprising, right?  You already know people think it's sexist and have thoughtfully determined either they're wrong or you want to hold doors anyway.  So why would she affect you so much?

Maybe you HAVEN'T thought deeply about whether or not holding the door is morally good.  If so, then why didn't the woman's behavior CAUSE you to think about it?  Here's this new perspective that surprised you...  shouldn't you at least try to understand it and balance it against your own values and try to come to the conclusion about whether you should change your behavior or not?  Why did you go against feminism instead of just.... introspecting?

Sure, if you're trying to do the right thing, that's better than if you're trying to be malicious.  But no one's calling you malicious: they're criticizing you for other things.  Your good intentions aren't relevant... and honestly, I'm perplexed about how you can claim good intentions in the face of evidence that people might not appreciate what you're doing.

 &gt; And being told their opinion doesn't matter or is just plain wrong, or elicits a reaction from someone that calls them a nasty name or labels them as a bigot, is creating a whole big chunk of the population of white people that are salty at minorities because of continual interactions like the one described above.

First, the attack/criticism thing is getting lost again.  If I see someone do something I think is racist, what do you want?  Should I not say so?  You appear to disagree with this above.  Do you think I should check with the person to see if they agree it's racist before I call their act racist?  That's asinine: very few people think of themselves as racist, so they obviously don't think that act is racist or they wouldn't have done it!

""It's racist"" is a perfectly valid reason to morally criticize someone, but you're (seemingly arbitrarily) defining it as an intolerable insult.  Do you see how this behavior is *extremely convenient* for racists and their goals?  You're artificially neutering anti-racists and now how's anyone supposed to ever criticize racism?

Also, you are aware that your description I quoted above characterizes white men as a bunch of petulant, irrational babies, right?  ""You said an opinion I had was wrong, so I'm going to vote for Trump"" makes absolutely no sense.  Sometimes your opinions are wrong.  Sometimes your feelings are overwrought or misattributed.  

And sometimes a progressive is a dick and acting unfairly, and the criticism of your behavior just doesn't resolve as reasonable to you no matter how seriously you consider it.  And in this case, it STILL doesn't make sense.  Progressivism can still be moral even if some progressives have wrong opinions or interpretations!  

If all you're saying is, ""White men are too immature to stand being criticized"" then fine, though I don't think that's your point.  If it isn't, then you can't pull the ""this is just the reality of how people feel!"" card, because now we're in the realm of how they SHOULD react."	60	['being brought', 'being brought', 'are viewed', 'are not allowed', 'get verbally attacked', 'is related', 'being called', 'is getting lost', 'being criticized']	9	7	0.11666666666666667	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['being brought', 'being brought', 'are viewed', 'are not allowed', 'get verbally attacked', 'is related', 'being called', 'is getting lost', 'being criticized']	9	7	0.11666666666666667	1	32319249841	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cgie3b/_/eui1os1/	753326039	32318935541.0	2019-07-22 20:36:16	54874256.0	PreacherJudge	2	False	1114	6	False	True	71.55

They put huge amounts of time, effort and money into doing all they could to ensure they had a legacy, and so it is this value that is being destroyed by not continuing the legacy.

Your point about passive choice is more convincing, though I think passivity can at most turn something immoral into something morally questionable.

However I think there is a distinction to be made between not having children due to never getting round to it, so to speak (a passive destruction of legacy), and actively deciding never to have children. 
I feel people object more to the latter, and I think this is more the sort of situation referred to in the OP.

2430	"&gt;""The idea is not to have smarter police, but to replace the police. A lot of police work could be handled *without* the police."" 

What sparked the original protests with George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake was clearly a lack of training, operational strategy, and/or officer mental health. So I am not sure why we wouldn't strive for smarter policing. Additionally, these problems could not be solved without police. In each of these cases the police were absolutely warranted to be there over a social worker or mental health professional. For the case of Breonna Taylor they were serving a warrant (albeit the wrong house) and the other two were actual crimes. 

&gt;""When I mention broad patterns of policing, I am referring policies such as stop and frisk where an abundance of officers are sent into specific neighborhoods to crack down on social problems.""

Many of these policies, contrary to popular belief have actually helped the most vulnerable communities in America. Many of them were implemented in the late 80s and early 90s after the terrible crime wave beginning in the late 60s. Here is an [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/crime-dropped-under-stop-frisk-which-worth-remembering-rush-criticize-ncna1151121) about specifically stop and frisk which you have pointed out. But also more broadly the reduction in crime can also be seen by increased police presence/policing, see [here](http://www.princeton.edu/~smello/papers/cops.pdf) and [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304066504576345553135009870). 

&gt; This has not been shown to directly reduce crime, but it a broad strategy of policing that creates large disparities. 

If you have any sources on this one or you could elaborate more i'm interested here.  Specifically, how increased policing creates large disparities. 

&gt; There is also an increased presence of police officers in schools who respond to situations that could be handled by school staff. Instead, this creates a situation where the criminal justice system gets involved with criminalizing student behavior unnecessarily. 

I agree, doesn't this go into the category of ""smart policing"" though? Having officers in schools isn't all that smart. 

&gt; So it's not about police handling their duties more intelligently, it's about the transference of duties away from the police. This means increased funding to homeless services agencies, domestic violence agencies, mental health services, or agencies that assist food-insecure families. 

I understand this point, you don't want to defund the entire department. However, my first question would be why does the funding for these programs have to come from police? Additionally, are all of these viable programs for a proper return on investment for the tax payer? Or can some of these be provided by private organizations? E.g. food programs and domestic violence agencies. Why does the city have to setup entire organizations like these which will likely be run rather inefficiently and with high overhead due to government mandates on pension, benefits, and pay. 

&gt; Police departments such as NYPD often add a large number of new police officers each year. And PDs also spend their own money on certain types of surveillance technology such as facial recognition tech.  

Increases in police department staff are due to increases in city population, if your population isn't increasing there's no need for more staff unless the department is combating a serious crime wave. Isn't spending their own money on surveillance tech part of ""Smarter Policing"" and therefore a good way to spend resources? 

&gt; Many of the things you've described are not large investments, and they also don't need to be provided by police departments.  

Body cameras as their own initiative alone are massively expensive programs as noted by Vox [here](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/24/18196097/police-body-cameras-storage-cost-washington-post). Additionally, some of the mental health programs and training programs could have officers out on training one day a week. That means you would need an almost 15% increase in staff to cover the day off for each officer. Definitely not cheap. 

&gt; The solution is to eliminate police involvement with certain types of work, which reduces the scope of police work. The reduced scope means a smaller operating budget. Police would have less of a central role in public safety. 

I sort of agree with this as their job responsibilities would be reduced, but in many cases they act as only a point of contact for other agencies to come by. After they get the right help, they leave. So it doesn't take up much of their day. In general, police would not be able to operate with a highly reduced budget trying to solve the city's crime, they're already stretched. Look at cities like Baltimore or Philadelphia. 

&gt; Police departments are revenue-producing agencies, and so they have a lot of sway in budget negotiations. They have the ability to impact the town purse. All institutions are interested in their own growth and survival, so police departments and other revenue-producing government bodies have a natural tendency toward unnecessary expansion. 

This would be a reason why they should have more resources. Excess fines are bad and ensure that people do not trust the police. Generally, a department isn't profit seeking but purpose seeking (you can see that in publicly disclosed salary information, they're not getting rich off of this). Departments, in order to perform what they're told to perform, need more resources and the fines at the moment are the only way to close the gap. 

&gt; You think cutting funding to necessary sources of housing and financial support will help these issues? 

Yes. Public housing leads to all sorts of social problems. The first of which is the disincentive to pursue individually improving goals with a cap on income earned to live in the housing. So if you earn more than X dollars you cannot live in many of these buildings and as a result you are penalized for seeking a better more fulfilling job. Second, these projects are areas that turn into high crime districts as a result of the amalgamation of adverse cultural factors that lead to crime. Third, it hurts everyone else who lives in the city by restricting the supply of housing and creating a price ceiling on housing which results in deadweight loss to the economy which translates to higher prices for everyone. Lastly, public housing, runs at a huge loss for cities. Look at the new york housing authority. Without yearly subsidies from city and federal governments, these operations would cease to exist.

Much of life is out of your control, *regardless* of whether you have completely rational internal control. A lot of the good things in life come in the form of taking risks. And I think you have a very exaggerated image of drinking. Having a drink or two can be a positive emotional and social experience, really doesn't reduce your internal control of the situation, and given the low risks of some external event happening, and given that even if you were sober there's always a risk of some external event happening that is completely outside of anyone's control, the risk-weighted net benefits of drinking for many people are positive.

As I pointed out, this is cultural. There will always be medical tourism, but this isn’t a reason America can never have affordable healthcare, it might just take 30 years for expectations to adjust. 

&gt;They don't receive unnecessary care.

That’s really easy to fix with single payer. 

&gt;They wait for America to do all of the R&amp;D and then they just develop the product. E

There’s no reason this has to be the case. Multilateral treaties can encourage other countries to pay for R&amp;D, America can use price controls, or government grants and prizes.

With the R&amp;D, I hear there are 2 options:

1) America must always pay unreasonable prices for medication to pay for R&amp;D, and other countries can free ride on this.

2) America can stop paying R&amp;D and pay prices in line with the rest of the world, and R&amp;D will shut down, with significantly less drugs being developed. 

This seems like a false dichotomy, that the USA must fund the R&amp;D for the world, and other areas like Europe or Asia couldn’t. 

&gt;I agree with everyone that a lot of these problems could be solved, but I don't think they will be.

So you think the biggest problem isn’t actually the finances? It’s public support for a solution?

It’s not that the numbers don’t add up. It’s that one (or more) parties in the system don’t want to use the solutions that have been shown to work in other countries. It’s also a bit of apathy like you are showing here. If no one thinks it can change, then it probably won’t. But it’s not the finances because those can be fixed



&gt;What happens if the grants come in significantly lower than the amount currently spent on R&amp;D? So much lower that funds don't exist to cover the gap?

As far as the money: it looks like it costs 2.8Billion to develop a new drug, multiply that by the ~25 new drugs approved in the USA last year, looks like 70Billion dollars a year. In 2014 (the next year I could find) medicare ran $597 Billion. So it’s really a drop in the bucket. If you look at the cost of outpatient prescription drugs (which is 11% of medicare) that’s 65 Billion dollars. So the government spends about as much on buying drugs, as it would cost to fund all the R&amp;D in the USA. So I find the idea of running out of money to be not very credible. 

Plus you could always skim from the defense budget (which is like 500billion). Drop the FY 2016 57 joint strike fighters for 11 Billion savings, 2 submarines is 5.7 Billion more.

2460	"I think your argument misses some of the issues people have with lootboxes. Your view states that they should be regulated, but the only example of regulation you offer is rating games 18+ so that children aren’t gambling. And yes, in terms of legality it *might* prevent some of that, but let’s be real parents are going to buy the game for their kids anyways.

But the larger problem people have with lootboxes is that they have paid for a full video game, and now they must spend more money to unlock the full content. But unlike DLCs, your money is only buying you a *chance* at the content. So you don’t even know how much you might have to spend. This *might* be acceptable for matters that don’t affect game mechanics, but it’s obviously a problem for games like Battlefront II. You cannot reasonably unlock the whole game by playing it. Contrast this with Super Smash Bros. where you’re unlocking every character through DLC or under 100 hours of gameplay.

So it’s not just a gambling thing, it’s a business model that markets standard video game promises, but then is actually gambling. It’s a bait and switch. 

If I go to a casino, I expect to lose money. If I play the lottery, I expect to lose money. If I enter some raffle I expect I’ll lose, but there a reasonable small chance I might win. But if I buy a published video game, I do not expect to have to gamble to unlock the whole game. It is entirely a predatory practice.

2465	"Lemme tell you a little story about one of my favorite subreddits. /r/SneerClub exists more or less to mock and point fingers at ""rationalists"". And a big part of this is pointing out that so much of their ""rational discourse"" is _fundamentally irrational_. That so much of what they talk about is warmed-over bullshit that _has been talked about_. The conversations _seem_ rational, but are not, and engaging with them rationally would treat them with a level of dignity and respect that is _completely_ unfounded. So you sneer. You mock. You insult. You point out how _phenomenally_ stupid it is. Because it's both more reasonable _and_ more effective than trying to engage in good-faith debate with them.

Liberatory movements have almost never won by sitting down and having a nice fireside chat with the people oppressing them. They have never gotten their freedom or their rights by asking nicely. And often, it's because ""rational debate"" is nothing of the sort. It's deeply irrational bullshit, often bullshit that _they know is bullshit_. Just look at the conservative backlash to the 1619 Project. 

Rational discourse is often not helpful or productive for liberatory movements. Some people connect with raw facts, but a lot of people connect with emotions and stories. I have very little interest in discourse on whether or not my friends deserve the same rights as anyone else - they do, and [even putting that conversation on the table gives up too much ground to those who would rather they be marginalized](http://www.armoxon.com/2017/09/bubbles-10-both-sides.html). 

But most of the people ""inciting hatred"" (care to unpack _that_ choice of words?) are just shitposting, usually about their own experiences with racism, sexism, or the like. They have little to no institutional power. And the same people who see this shitposting _as_ ""inciting hatred"" probably aren't going to take too kindly to the idea that they personally benefit from a system of white supremacy no matter how kindly or gently you tell them."	22	['is warmed', 'has been talked']	2	1	0.045454545454545456	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is warmed', 'has been talked']	2	1	0.045454545454545456	1	36467576732	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m65654/_/gr3uqak/	1340574808		2021-03-16 07:56:23	26706903.0	BPC3	49	False	327	0	True	True	63.39

Depends which level of the party we are looking at. I'm going to ""translate"" the funding rules into the American equivalent:

* Excess money from local primaries,  local election campaigns and the equivalent of presidential campaigns are all tranferred to the national party.

* The national party doens't have to return excess funds, but they have extremely strict spending limits on advertising starting about 100 days before the election. The amount they can spend is extremely low,  at about $21,000,000 USD for a country with a population the size of California. Parties can spend as much as they want outside of this 100 day period.

2471	"&gt; Agreeing with OP's position doesn't mean that it is the ""system"" I would choose to institute. My 'system' regarding organ donation, provisionally, would firstly be to increase public medical research funding, and secondly to implement the opt-out system along with the priority system.

Then that is your view? You say you'd believe in one thing but want like to institute another, that doesn't align. You can't say you share OP's view then say you want a different system from their view. Even so, if this is what you wanted to implement then you should have said it sooner.

&gt; I find arguing on Reddit to be both an exercise in convincing others, as well as being convinced myself. Put another way, I argue as a way to engage with other ideas and refine, modify, or even change my beliefs.

If you want to do that then you need to state your beliefs plainly. I feel like half of this is just trying to figure out what you believe and why, which is something you'd have to explain in a post. Without that, I can't tell if you're moving the goal post. I'm also starting to feel that your position is based more on emotion than rational arguments, mostly because you haven't given rational arguments on why you think it should be fair.

On the other hand, I'm disappointment you didn't acknowledge a change of view when I proved that we don't know if a priority system will be successful. 

&gt; You're extrapolating these other things, as if I believe them.

I'm not suggesting you believe these things, that argument assumes you don't believe these things. Therefore, you see why we respect the rights of the individual even if it doesn't benefit the society.

&gt; You act like the limits of rights are just facts, or are plainly apparent.

There's not, they can be overruled by other rights which I keep saying. If you have two rights pitted against each other than it is very difficult to determine which takes precedent.

&gt; The resources exist for all these things to be made abundant. Our political system has failed to address the need.

The political system also failed to address the need for organs. They failed to implement an opt-out system sooner, or devout more resources to artificial organs. Organs could be made abundant as well. It's not a good plan to blame the past for our problems. They are a scarcity now, so by your logic we should assign them based on who will contribute. Do you think these shouldn't be assigned based on fairness but organs should be?

&gt; In contrast, on the organ transplant list, everyone needs an organ pretty much equally.

Not true, as was being discussed in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/681kju/cmvpeople_who_arent_open_to_donate_their_own/dgwg7xb/ Some people have years to live after learning they need an organ transplant, some have only days.

2472	"&gt; IMO ""good"" is too vague to determine what creativity is. 

I tried to keep that part a bit shorter. I'll admit lyrical quality is something that is hard to objectively pin down, but there are objective factors to it, mainly the amount of Na's and the repetition.

The concept of an album is something you can at least pin down a bit more objectively. Do songs play into each other? Is there an easy-to-spot narrative? Are there motifs that appear throughout the album?

&gt;Some of the best musicians of all time played just a few. Nirvana played 3. They weren't creative? 

They weren't not creative at all, but it's certainly one aspect to creativity they IMO do not fulfill. I gotta admit I don't know Nirvana's music so well, but they probably fulfilled other aspects of creativity that I named that might make them creative.

I do not believe that after '67, The Beatles were constrained at all in what they did, especially when they founded their own label. They could basically do what they want and it would sell, so they had the freedom to do what later bands did.

&gt; And I believe the Beatles had mastery over melody and songwriting that surpasses all others. 

And you measure that by how popular they are? Or how exactly? I don't exactly understand.

2474	"&gt; If this is the case you're making, fine by me. But why keep it in the Bible then?

The bible is a historical document.  It contains things like the dimensions of the temple that God wanted built.  And ancestral lines of lineage.

Those laws are important for understanding how God interacting with Israel in the old testament.

&gt; Because there are Christians still referring to these laws.

Right, because different Christians interpret different parts of the bible differently.  But picking and choosing which parts of the bible are outdated to fit your personal outlook is absolutely normal for modern legal contexts too.  I understand why you don't approve, but it is actually a fairly reasonable thing to do for someone looking to the bible for guidance.

Just because the founding fathers said something vile about keeping slaves doesn't mean other things said by the founding fathers aren't still used in courts today.  It doesn't make what they say to be law either, its simply used as guidance.

So we go back and decide that the law against wearing two types of cloth is irrelevant today.  The law about properly stretching your animal hide water containers is irrelevant.  The law against homosexuality doesn't mean that we need to have that same law today, but it can serve as guidance about how God might feel about homosexuality to some.

The old testimate is full of outdated laws about cleaning yourself and food properly, hundreds of years before germs were discovered.  We don't need to follow those rituals because we know what their guidance was all about now.

This is the exact way in which modern courts would use something a founding father said for say a novel constitutional issue.  They may use it as guidance for what they were thinking when they wrote the original constitution, but aren't going to be bound to it.  Modern practical issues will trump historical intent."	21	"[""aren't still used"", 'were discovered', 'be bound']"	3	3	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""aren't still used"", 'were discovered', 'be bound']"	3	3	0.14285714285714285	1	31213102286	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/a829sw/_/ec7h3v2/	618204704		2018-12-20 19:25:13	5410853.0	AnythingApplied	11	False	320	2	False	True	63.7

2488	"So, in your own post you quote pretty much everything I said?  Why?  What was the purpose of quoting me?  I know what I said.  The whole thing feels vaguely insulting.  As if I wouldn't know what you're talking about unless you told me.  I understand that's not your point, but arguing with someone is substantially more about emotion than reason.  

Back to the Quote/Response formula.  Generally it looks something like this:

&gt;Thing I said

Why reason specific thing I said is wrong.

&gt;Another thing I sad

Another reason why specific thing is wrong.

&gt;More of my reasoning

Yet more specific responses to that specific reasoning.

This can go on for a while, but what this immediately tells me (and I'm guessing many others since those who see it are less persuaded) is that the person responding to me isn't considering my post as a whole, and isn't interested in really understanding what I'm saying.  The interest is more in being right than anything else, and someone so fixated on being right isn't open to having their views changed.

Also posts like this seem more like a take down than an attempt to understand and persuade, and that makes people defensive.

There is a time and place for quotes, but your really shouldn't rely on them.  If you really need to respond to individual points, you still should avoid quoting them and instead direct their attention to it with phrases like ""when you talk about x."""	14	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	28280604316	5	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4459qq/_/czpjhy4/	248829074	28279078907.0	2016-02-05 23:33:07		jefftickels	3	False	246	3	False	True	71.75

2491	"There are several problems with the aliens theory:

First, if aliens are probing substantial sections of the galaxy, there should be evidence all over the place, not just a handful of sightings (they're clearly not trying to hide, given the tendency of sighting descriptions to include lights visible from several miles away); why don't we see evidence of them elsewhere in space?

Second, alien probes would presumably be sending data somewhere; projects like SETI spend a lot of time and effort looking for alien transmissions and don't turn anything up, 

Third, if you look at the described objects, every sighting describes a fairly different looking entity - there's a big disk, an unspecified shape the size of an aircraft carrier, another unspecified shape the size of the plane, and then the tic tacs.  

Fourth, like you said, the flight behavior described is outside known physics; in principle aliens might know something we don't, but 'massive acceleration that produces no externally observable force' is the kind of thing that would overthrow basic ideas about how motion works, not the kind of thing that would involve just one or two undiscovered engineering tricks; it's overwhelmingly more likely that the observations are mistaken than that physics is that different from our current understanding.

As an alternative explanation, there are about 20-40 million flights per year; if radar software has some random one in a million bug (which is wildly overoptimistic; most software is much worse than that), and one in a hundred flights see a weird random light source, then there should be dozens of flights that satisfy the linked article's requirement of 'multiple witnesses+confirmation by radar'; figure a handful of cases on top of that where someone lies and doesn't get caught, however many psyops you think are likely to be done, and so forth, and it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly that the evidence from the article is not nearly sufficient to conclude that there's any substance at all to the claims."	4	['get caught', 'be done']	2	1	0.25	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['get caught', 'be done']	2	1	0.25	1	39173016947	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t9hr0i/_/hzulpbn/	1769463810		2022-03-08 13:55:23	364497855606.0	Careless_Clue_6434	3	False	331	0	False	True

*  The purpose of the policy is to improve the quality of life for the average person, who currently works 7 days a week on average. 
* Most of the business community are religious and see work as a virtuous thing. 
* The government, in order to achieve the cooperation of the business community, advocates with them for the new policy on the basis that Sunday is a 'day of rest' and that the policy allows time for the workers to spend time in contemplation and with their families, as is also advocated by their religion. 
* The policy passes and workers get Sundays off.

2508	"""But the argument that you think Trump is better on the economy while he is clearly attacking the foundations of our democracy again leaves me to conclude that any person making it is an incredibly selfish douchebag.""

Now here's where I think you are wrong.  You are saying people who vote for Trump because they think he's better for the economy are selfish, but many people believe that Trump's economic policies benefit will everyone, not just themselves.  They may, for example, believe that if the minimum wage is raised, it will cause many businesses to lay off workers.  That would hurt many people.  They may believe Biden's healthcare reforms would hurt the healthcare industry.  That would hurt many people.  If you think that Trump's economic policies benefit everyone, that how is it selfish to make that a major consideration when voting for him?  

Also, while I do believe that Trump has attacked some democratic norms, these have largely been in statements.  For example, [there was the time he encourages Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/trump-urged-ukraine-president-to-investigate-joe-bidens-son.html) or [his attacks on the post office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Postal_Service_crisis).  But I think what should be asked is not whether he wants to undermine democracy, but rather whether or not he will actually BE ABLE to undermine democracy.  In the two examples I listed, it seems Trump's efforts failed miserably.  Ukraine didn't comply with his orders.  It also appears that the people fighting Trump on the post office issue are winning.  Postmaster General Louis Dejoy agreed to wait until after the election to implement his proposed changes to the USPS.  That is a big step.  This is part of the reason I think there is basically no chance Trump will actually be able to successfully undermine democracy in the US.  Another reason is that politics figures like him who have attacked norms are not at all unprecedented in US politics.  We have had people like Trump in high office before, and the US democracy has survived.  Examples of people like this include [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson), [William Jennings Bryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan), [Huey Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long), and [Joseph McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy).  

It all comes back to the idea that people have to chose the lesser of two evils.  They may agree that Trump has made an attempt to undermine democracy, but think he doesn't have a realistic chance of doing that.  They may believe however that Biden does have an opportunity to implement policies that will hurt the economy, and Trump will have the opportunity to implement policies that will help the economy.  they may therefore vote for Trump on these grounds.  Furthermore, the economy is not the only issue where people may think like this.  A decent case could be made that [Trump is less of a war hawk than Biden is](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/08/20/choose-trump-reform-criminal-justice-avoid-war-rand-paul-column/5605731002/).  It should be clear how this would be a major factor when people vote.  If veterans or the family of veterans vote for Trump based on the belief that he is less likely to start a war than Biden is, how can you believe they are doing it in bad faith?  Wars are almost always harmful to everyone.  This is another example of an issue where people may be willing to overlook Trump's problems if he sides with them on this one issue.

  "" When they are all enthusiastic Trump supporters and saying ""we essentially have a white nationalist in the white house"" there just might be something to it.""

Just because some people hold the view that Trump is a white nationalist doesn't mean he is.  Many many also hold the view that Trump isn't racist.  Whose opinion should automatically be assumed to be correct?   You shouldn't just say someone is a certain way because a certain subset of people believe he is, you need to look at evidence first.  Many marxists voted for Bernie Sanders, does that mean Bernie Sanders is a Marxist?   

Now this isn't to say Trump isn't racist.  He [certainly is](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA5ekHTHMRd/?igshid=ozys8k00pq6g), but it seems like most of the evidence for his racism comes from comments he has made, not actual actions he had undertaken.  It is true that Trump was sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s, but that was the same time that Biden was advocating against desegregation busing in the senate.  Can you really use this to claim Trump is racist but Biden isn't? 

Also, as I already mentioned, Biden has made plenty of racist comments.  Why can racist comments be used to prove Trump is racist but not that Biden is racist?  Remember that Biden literally praises his relationship with a senator who called for genocide against Black people.  

Also let's not forget that Biden authored the 1994 crime bill.  This had devastating effects on the African American and Latino communities. Imagine if an African American or Latino parent had their child imprisoned because of the 1994 crime bill.  What if they wanted to vote for Trump because that bill led them to believe that Joe Biden doesn't have their best interests at heart.  Do you think that makes them bad people?  

Many liberals say ""Yes Biden is racist, but so is Trump.  Biden is the lesser of two evils.""  What if someone said ""Yes Trump is racist, but so is Joe Biden.  Trump is the lesser of two evils.""  There are views that Trump holds that someone arguing in good faith could agree with.  In an election where there are literally only two people running, you are not going to have one you agree with 100%.  You are going to have to balance all the issues.  I could see how someone could do that and still decide Trump is the better option.  I personally do not think Trump is the better option, however someone who does is not necessarily a bad person."	54	['is raised', 'should be asked', 'could be made', 'be assumed', 'was sued', 'be used']	6	6	0.1111111111111111	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is raised', 'should be asked', 'could be made', 'be assumed', 'was sued', 'be used']	6	6	0.1111111111111111	1	35099501456	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/iobjv7/_/g4hc4nk/	1129240915	35096628141.0	2020-09-08 18:19:22	548034420003.0	Arturus243	1	False	956	0	True	True	64.3

Children who form healthy early attachments end up requiring less social services, are less likely to have personality disorders (Im very much in favor of having less rich people with personality disorders!) and are more likely to be productive economically.

The idea is you pay a little money once, to ensure the child grows up healthy and stable, so you don’t have to pay a lot of money continuously later on. If conjecture that a maladapted wealthy person is more destructive to the economy than a poor one as well.

Also, the government wants to incentivize reproduction. Right now the fertility rate in the US is 1.8 children per woman, which is lower than the replacement rate. We need an expanding population if programs like social security are to remain funded. We make up the difference with immigration, but the idea of increasing immigration causes a lot of political problems that make this solution less viable."	8	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	31746415376	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bdvej1/_/el0zuvk/	688428109		2019-04-16 12:55:54	273805707261.0	pluralofjackinthebox	4	False	165	0	False	True	54.73

2511	"interesting. I think that in some form these caviats could be agreed on in some form:

(1)  I think that the grandfathering would have to be something a little different because part of the problem is that there are already guns in existence. 300MM guns in America for example. Maybe something in the middle? Like you don't have to register grandfathered guns just to own them but to use them outside the home at any point (shoot at range, hunting, carry permit, send back to manufacturer for defects, etc.) you would have to go through the process. 

(2) Totally agree with the concept of replacing the background check system as long as it is actually ""replace"" and does not end up being ""we do this instead of background checking, and its not as good, but its close enough..."". I think the background check system is fairly broken and I'm curious though what your reason is for wanting it gone? 

(3) This one I don't know about. You still have the added protection of having each gun owner be required to go through proper training to purchase a gun anywhere, but I feel like without associating registrations like licenses there is no criminal accountability. What if the registry database existed, but was a closed database and feds need a court order to legally open it? Like with traffic camera feeds?
 Also, fwiw, I think that the heavier regulation on SBS and SBR is very much ""people afraid of scary gun things"", I am surprised you group full auto into this. I generally consider full auto to be a good thing to have heavily regulated...

(4) I'm ok with it being free in principle, I was just trying to be realistic. If it doesn't have a free and it starts getting expensive, the gov't won't kill it because its doing a public good, they will just start raising the taxes without telling us. I think that fee-funded only makes the government accountable to us...

2513	"&gt; I don't understand how you could say the design of a house expresses support for interracial marriage. 

Let's dwell on this for a second. Are you an art historian or aesthetic philosopher? Are you a designer or architect? Are you even generally artistic? Is it possible that there are languages and expressions that are less familiar with that aren't verbal based? I'm excited, because I remember the first time I discovered this and I'm excited to share it with you. My point is - keep an open mind here. 

If a musician told you that a song was expressing something powerful - even though it had no lyrics - how skeptical would you be?

&gt; Unless you are taking the path of saying that all expression is purely subjective and anything can be understood to express anything.

No. In fact, going back to the musician example, what if I told you that there is a song that was released and resulted in a populist revolt? What if I told you that the song was a classical piece with no lyrics whatsoever but enough people understood what it expressed in their own cultural context that a riot ensued?

The song is called [The Rite of Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky) by IgorStravinsky. And what's more [it's far from the only classical piece to do this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_classical_music_with_an_unruly_audience_response). 

This is to point out that artistic works rarely stand in a vacuum. In the case of these classical pieces, they *represent* something powerful about identity. Like a flag or a gang sign - symbols are powerful non-verbal things. Architecture is highly symbolic.

&gt; But I guess I could imagine some new trend of a certain entry-way design being understood to represent support of gay rights. If that were the case, by my principle, the architect could refuse to design that entry-way, but could not refuse to design alternative entryways that do not express that message.

Or quite possibly they could not. Zaha Hadid is famous for her feminist architecture. She uses graceful yet dynamic sweeping shapes and [yonic](https://www.dezeen.com/2013/11/30/yonic-architecture-including-zaha-hadids-vagina-stadium-for-qatar/) forms in opposition to phallic skyscrapers. If she built a more ""standard"" looking *Mies Van Der Rohe* style skyscraper under protest, how do you think most people familiar with the context would take it? A Zaha Hadid building, conspicuously looks like a penis. Most male architects could hardly be said to be doing this on purpose. But for Hadid, it would be hard to argue she wasn't. 

A famously segregationist architect makes thousands of tiny choices. A plantation style porch with *distyle in antes* pillars is a common form, until you point out that [Hitler himself demanded that all third Reich buildings feature it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_architecture) as a reference to pure institutions and Roman heritage and that plantations featured in too to reference the Roman empire to which Hitler was desperately trying to convince people Aryans belonged. 

Hitler knew that buildings far outlasted books or speeches. He was extremely keen on making his messages in stone. He knew that whipping people into a server required a cultural message that you felt in your bones in every aspect of the style that the culture inhabited. Look at the clothes, the music. 

[Hitler even had strong opinions on which fonts to use](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua%E2%80%93Fraktur_dispute) 

Just look at how much of that image has survived to inspire, signal, and rally white nationalists. Look at how much of it appears to signal bad guys in video games. You better believe these elements work their way into your unconscious prejudices. Mere exposure to ideas does what neuropsychology calls [cognitive priming](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G6DwHdSkL4w). 

This is just one of many possible vectors for aesthetic effects that researchers are more and more able to quantify. Quantifying these subtleties is difficult. But this cake issue is *much* more nuanced than most people want it to be.

2515	"To point 1), if you think that abortion is permissible (and you're entitled to one), then an increase in abortions in and of itself isn't a bad thing. I realise that it's a costly and risky procedure and shouldn't be undertaken lightly from the point of view of the mother. 

From the point of view of the foetus/future person, then that's a discussion about the benefits of existing with a terrible disease vs. non-existence, which I'm unable to answer. Although many people with FAS and other disabilities do lead happy lives. 

Consider this: with pre-natal testing for Down's Syndrome now available, an overwhelming majority of women choose to terminate a pregnancy in light of a positive result. At this very moment, in Brazil, a number of women with the Zika virus are begging for access to ""abortion pills"".

&gt;The result is the same though. And drinking alcohol also carries a risk probability (not certainty).

True. While the result is the same the way it came about is different, and that's morally and legally relevant. One is chance, the other is wilful.

I agree that drinking alcohol carries a risk probability,and there's a lot we still don't know about FAS. In the case I linked to, a prosecutor representing a FAS child took a mother to trial for the harm done. It's a case where the factors led to a certain visible harm. She wasn't in court for drinking a glass of wine because of the off-chance her baby may be born ill.

As an aside, there are lots of criminal acts that are risk-probabilities (drink-driving is an obvious one). 

&gt;We could even change the transmission example to certainty: what if the parents are tested before conception, and it's determined that it's certain that any offspring they produce, will inherit this life crippling illness?

That's a great question. My first instinct is to again say that there's a moral and legal difference between the two cases, but I'll have to think about it more."	17	"[""'re entitled"", 'be undertaken', 'are tested']"	3	3	0.17647058823529413	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'re entitled"", 'be undertaken', 'are tested']"	3	3	0.17647058823529413	1	28305263511	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/460yat/_/d04813r/	251986853	28301306660.0	2016-02-18 04:03:26		20000miles	1	False	333	2	False	True	62.17
2516	"How is deferring judgement equivalent to social conformity? 

There are good reasons and bad reasons to defer judgement, good and bad people to trust on issues, and a politician or anyone else shouldn't defer for the sake of conforming but because they have good reason to defer to a particular person. It isn't, and shouldn't be, done for the sake of conforming but because it's judged to be the best way to handle some issue. 

Hypothetically we can set up a situation to illustrate the problem with conformity -

I'm a politician, and am ignorant about building bridges. The city needs a new bridge. I have options to hire -

A. A well reputed and reasonably priced company.
B. A less reputed, overpriced company with a lobbyist with good relations with my political party.

The more socially - among my peer group let's call them - acceptable way of handling this is going with B. Going with A may upset my social situation. Either way I am deferring all sorts of complex operations to a group of people who perform a task I can't do myself. However, my deferring is not the same as conforming, rather who I defer to can be based on conformity or simply based on what the right thing to do is - or other reasons such as simple selfishness.

1. Heaven and Hell are real: this would instantly change people's behavior by itself- I disagree as I said knowing hell is there wouldn't change what I do day to day as I doubt anyone else would, I'm not going to force a change.

2. a Religion was proven true: this would be world-changing- for those that believed. Again in his time he performed miracles and yet doubt was spread. Proof doesn't guarantee the middle east would admit being wrong and give up thier power. The Jewish faith believes their still waiting for their messiah, what's to say they wouldn't claim the same? Only 1 of the 1000s of denominations of Christianity would be right, more of them would move to the right one but not a substantial amount.

3. Science would have a field day, as you said, which would -by itself- change everything - this was never a part I disputed, only that the scientific community would have a minimal impact on how people are in the world as a whole.

4. Philosophy would change overnight: EVERYONE would be affected, even those rejecting the now-truth.- affected sure, like I said I'd acknowledge the fact that he's real and hevean and hell are real, I wouldn't start acting different if the world was going to continue being crappy.

5. Death isn't real: this would change people's behavior instantly- death is very real, him coming back would be the least surprising part as its something he's done before and he's even supposed to come back, him coming back doesn't mean death isn't real, he's omnipotent.

6. Magic is real: there are Gods and demi-gods, etc.- this is just as broad a statement and not God's demi gods or magic only that he's real and capable of those things, saying it would prove magic is real implies it could be accessible. From that lens people are already looking for ways to cheat death a d perform miracles, him coming back shows an example of it being done, not that it's possible.

I'm not disputing saying it would be a passing moment, I'm saying when he comes back people won't break from their norms. Hate will out, prejudice will out.


What would change your view here, then, if not these world-changing - if you can convince me that people would come together, that there is hope for humanity, that if there was a rapture humanity could put our differences aside and wouldn't damn everyone.

Was I specific enough? I'm not trying to fight with you, I just disagree with your point that it would be paradigm breaking-specifically in the way that people would live- which dictates the flow of the world.

2524	"I do understand the distinction between systemic racism and prejudicial racism.

Systemic racism includes issues like lacking opportunities for people with 'black-sounding' names, professionalism standards that prohibit natural black hair, differences in prosecution between crack and coke, there's lots of structures that I would agree are systemic racism.

We're basically talking about going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering tacos. Black hair is mostly done by black people for a reason. Most white stylists don't know what they're doing with it.

I can't imagine a black woman being told that a white woman will be doing her hair will be 100% confident in their ability to do the job correctly. 

This is an alarm bell that we need more *black* hairstylists, not that we need more *black hair* stylists. There is demand for this service, but the demand is *not* that white people perform it.

The 'systemic racism' you're seeing here has nothing to do with the beauty industry itself. It is *strictly* a secondary effect of the lack of black capital. The fact that not enough black people are able to, say, get a small business loan with a name like Dominique, in order to fill the unfilled demand that exists. *That's* the systemic racism here.

This is a racial divide that's created by class warfare in a society where black people start farther from the 'finish line'.

2525	"The Delta didn't go through FYI, the bot thought you were giving it to yourself.

But I think the answer to both of your points here goes back to the point you made about real wealth generation in the form of actually producing things with inherent value, like tomatoes or drinkable water. And I think the mistake here is to treat those industries and the stock market as two separate things, when in actuality, they're tightly linked. What stocks actually *mean* is that you have partial ownership of those industries that are making real stuff. If XYZ Inc is producing real stuff, you'd probably have no qualms about saying it has real value that can grow in a non-zero sum way, just by getting better at doing what it does, or by external factors such as favorable weather for crops or whatever. And by extension, you'd probably agree that if there was a sole owner of XYZ Inc, they'd be generating wealth in a tangible, non-zero sum way, by virtue of producing valuable things. All the stock market does is spread out the ownership of XYZ Inc, so that people who own one or two shares own a piece of that wealth generation.

But whether we're talking about the stock market or a sole proprietor, if economic conditions take an unexpected turn, the value of XYZ Inc can either go up, or it can suddenly drop to zero. But that doesn't mean there wasn't ever real value there.

2528	"Steven Pinker just wrote a book that looks at exactly this question of optimism vs. pessimism over the future. He argues that by virtually every measure, the data show:

&gt;that the state of humanity has been improving. It’s a conclusion one can’t appreciate from the news — because journalism covers the disasters, crises, dangers and injustices that remain. And until the Messiah comes, there will always be enough of them to fill Page One.  
&gt;  
&gt;Improvements, in contrast, are gradual, and often consist of things that *don’t* happen — an absence of war, or famine or crime in much of the world. One can spot them only by looking at data, which tally both the occurrences and the non-occurrences. When I came across data showing plunges in extreme poverty, illiteracy, war, violent crime, racism, sexism, homophobia, domestic violence, disease, lethal accidents and just about every other scourge, I thought these improvements deserved to be better known.

Global extreme poverty has declined to 9.6 percent of the world population; 200 years ago, it was at 90 percent. In just the last 30 years, extreme poverty has declined by 75 percent — a stupendous achievement that is almost entirely unappreciated. Equally unappreciated is the fact that 90 percent of the world’s population under the age of 25 can read and write, including girls. In most of the history of Europe, no more than 15 percent could read and write, mostly men.

2536	"&gt; Women dont have to bear children, that is a choice. 

I see where you're coming from, and it's a decent point. I think I would re-phrase the disadvantage as this: *IF* a couple wants to have a family, the woman appears to be the one to shoulder more of the burden. Not only because of the physical ramifications of growing a living thing inside you for 9 months, but because doing that actually ends up limiting your choices. Whereas the man gets to have the same benefit of starting a family without as much of the burden.

&gt; Is having a career the only thing that signals worth?

No, but like you said, we're talking about choices. Men, in general, have more choices when it comes to their career and have an easier time dealing with other men who are more likely to hold senior positions in the first place.

&gt; Correct me if im wrong but dont most women go through menopause around the age of 50? I wouldnt consider 40 to be young to have a family.

While it's certainly possible, I think it's pretty unadvisable to start a family when you're 40. The health risks go way up at that point. Particularly if you want 2 or 3 kids, you pretty much need to start at around 30, at the latest. Whereas men can be 40 and just date a 30 year old, no problem.

&gt; Disadvantages of men, higher likely hood of being a victim of violent crime, higher likely hood of suicide, higher rate of men in prison, higher sentences than women when committing the same crime, significantly less likely to win child custody.

Basically all of these relate to a choice too. Committing a crime is a choice -- just because you're a man doesn't mean you have to be a criminal. It's totally up to you. With respect to child custody, I mostly agree with you. I think if the mother and father are both perfectly capable, the women will get the benefit of the doubt most of the time.

Even if we were to agree that the military needs to remain as strong and influential as it is, why does that immediately imply that their budget must remain the same.  Nearly every government agency deals with budget cuts, and they find a way to continue operating at the same level of professionalism and skill.  Why must the military be given a $650 billion blank check every year, without anyone questioning whether the money could be spent more efficiently?

And if you know how the federal budget ""works"", then you'll see why this is a problem.  As long as money is given to them, it will be spent, because to NOT spend it means that it will probably get taken away next year.  Budget surplus is a bad word in the land of federal agencies. 

This isn't unique to the military, but if you want an agency to spend less, the only way to accomplish that is to take it away, and FORCE them to make the changes necessary to do the same job with less money.

* Being bilingual is difficult
* Language isn't a part of their culture
* Religious people can't be scientific
* People will prioritize their religion over their health
* We can't offer Indigenous people good education without removing their languages
* Indigenous people aren't politicians and business owners
* Systemic racism isn't the problem, it's indigenous people at fault.

1. Being bilingual is not difficult. We can simultaneously teach their traditional languages and English/French throughout elementary school. That's what the current English/French system is, and there are no problems.

2. Languages and cultures are two very intertwined things.

3. I know professors from various departments (arts, sciences and humanities) who manage to be both academic and religious. Just because you have a religion doesn't mean you don't understand science.

4. I don't think any rational person would prioritize religion over their health, especially considering many indigenous cultures and beliefs centre around health and well-being.

5. We can definitely offer Indigenous students the same level of education that the rest of the students in the country. We just have to be willing to allow them to learn their languages and have a say in the curriculum, as we do for all other students

6. Many indigenous people are politicians and business owners. We currently have 10 Indigenous MPs, and that number has been rising every election.

7. The reason there are a lower number of indigenous people in positions of power is due to systemic racism. There are many factors which lead to them being stuck in the cycle of poverty, and many of them can't afford an education due to this. You should definitely check out some of the information on Stats Canada's website, because there are a lot of problems that we need to start fixing before they'll have all the same opportunities that the rest of the country has.

See, what happened is that the appellee was arguing that the fetus is a ""person"" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, so the Court Had to evaluate this claim. The first thing they note (and the appellee conceded this) is that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment: that is, there was no precedent whatsoever in case law for applying the term ""person"" to a fetus. Having established no support in caselaw for the idea that a fetus is a person, the Court proceeds to examine the Constitution for the meaning of the word ""person"" by looking at instances of that word. Here, they first note that the 14th Amendment itself speaks of ""persons born or naturalized in the United States"", which seems to suggest that that persons must have been born. They also examine all the other uses of the word ""person"" and conclude that none of them possibly apply to fetuses.

To me, being a Pokemon master is about being a master of **all** things Pokemon. Having knowledge and catching every Pokemon is simply a part of being a master.

So I used my examples simply to show why catching every Pokemon is part of the journey towards becoming a master. 

Think of it like this: have you ever heard the saying ""all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares""? I think the same can be applied to Pokemon. ""All Pokemon masters have caught all (or most) Pokemon but not all trainers that have caught all (or most Pokemon) are Pokemon masters"".

Does that make sense? I know it doesn't have the same ring to it as the original saying but I think it illustrates my point.

First benefit it has had is knowing what I think of my ""peculiar habits"" aren't that peculiar and in general are repeated across the population. (in terms of mbti, the types intj, intp, infj and infp are ""rare""-types and generally find the description matches them well).

More common types might not find it meaningful. E.g. in a sports-obsessed community, one who is interested in say art might find the art/sport category useful and might be happy to know others exist in the art category, but the sports one might care about difference between different sport lovers instead which isn't covered by that.

Another advantage the test itself has, in spite of being irregular and imprecise, is that because of its popularity people can think of ""types"" of people. As opposed to people being infinitely moldable clay (especially potent in our job-driven times) that can do something because others can, and the only thing differing among people is effort.

Also, many people already think of people in types - talks a lot / is too quite ; too impulsive / thinks too much ; takes advantage of others / is a pushover, etc. 

MBTI types originate from Jung's description of types (though he was kind of an anti-populariser, the mbti was invented from his descritptions by a student of his to be made popular). In this description he describe two axis : the thinking-vs-feeling one (which many would already think in terms of) and the sensing-vs-intuition one. And how these have introverted and extroverted expressions.

2559	"&gt; So the TNI includes corporate profits, which I actually wouldn't include.

That still goes to people as income though, for anyone that is a shareholder.Part of the problem is that nothing you're using excludes investment income.  From GDP to TNI to Median Income, they all include investment income, so I'm not sure you're getting at what you want to be getting at.

Though I'm still not sure I'd exclude that because you'd potentially distort the picture to MORE equal salaries, because investment income is fairly bias towards richer people and if you're trying to look at how distorted the distribution of income is, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by excluding it.  And certainly for any investment income that the ""average"" american is making, you'd want to include that for an apples to apples comparison, even though a lot less of their income would be coming from investments.

I see you edited your post to be GDP per capita vs Median Income, which I think is much closer to what you're looking for and is certainly one simplified way to try to view wealth inequality.

Lets talk about wealth inequality though.  It certainly has been going up since the 1950's, but that doesn't mean we'd expect it to go up forever.  For example, take [America’s 1% hasn’t controlled this much wealth since before the Great Depression](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wealth-inequality-in-the-us-is-almost-as-bad-as-it-was-right-before-the-great-depression-2018-07-19) where they use the percent of the economy's wealth controlled by the 1% as their benchmark, and as of 2015 it was at 22% (of total wealth controlled by the wealthiest 1%), which is pretty close to a peak hit in 1928 of 23.9%.

But I think that makes the point that it is high, but that it also goes in cycles.  In 1880 (another particularly high period for wealth inequality), that number was 35%."	14	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	32424061359	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cn9hqr/_/ew8g5v3/	764668179	32423937671.0	2019-08-07 17:18:09	5410853.0	AnythingApplied	2	False	302	1	True	True	56.39

The real reason we did so poorly in these situations, despite our overblown budgets, enormous technological advantage, and years of training is simply because a military like this is not capable of changing the minds of a people who are determined to have their ideology. When someone invades a nations to try and change them, they inevitably make themselves the bad guy and build resentment. This is counter-productive to the stated goals.

It is however, very capable of invading and effectively eliminating a large belligerent nation with an organized military.

Remember, this type of mechanized fighting machine was developed during WWII to fight the Nazi's and imperial Japanese, both of which were large, organized mechanized militaries. A military complex like this excels at countering hostile forces and invading nations, and this is precisely what would be seen in any conflict between China and the west.

The combined power of the major western nations is imo, capable of crippling the PRC, albeit at great costs. The US has maintained naval supremacy since the end of WWII, with no other nation even coming close to similar size and capacity. This naval advantage could easily disrupt Chinese supply lines, effectively choking the nation of food and military supply. While the PRC has a very large land force, they are unskilled and underequipped when compared to the US.

I think we agree on much of this, and are actually just slightly tangled up in the complicated nuances of the debate. I think one of the things that makes gun legislation such a weird issue is that there are multiple factions on each side of the debate (in other words, it’s not as clear cut as “these people want reform, and these people don’t”). 

1) You have some who want guns banned outright 


2) You have some who want gun reform to curb overall gun violence


3) You have some who want gun reform to curb mass shootings 


&amp;nbsp;

4) You have some who think there should be no restrictions on gun ownership whatsoever

5) You have some who see guns as a form of protection from tyranny

6) You have some who see guns as a form of protection against would-be assailants 

7) You have some who simply have an enthusiasm for guns, and want to be able to collect the badass ones


Because of all of these factions, each side tends to retreat to one generalized talking point, while missing the nuances. It’s hard to have a constructive dialogue when that happens.

Here’s where I agree with you:

Barring some of the examples that I cited in my first response (having a violent criminal history, etc), citizens should have the right to bear arms. Personally, I’m okay with the states deciding whether or not individuals can carry publicly, so I’ll leave that part of it aside.

Citizens should feel enabled to defend themselves in situations in which an assailant has threatened them. This is murky at times, as there have been many questionable cases in which someone feels “threatened” in what seems to be an objectively non-threatening situation, but I digress. There are times in which a threat seems entirely clear enough: your example of a home invasion being one. Fearing a home invasion in which your loved one or your children are held at gunpoint (or knife, or any weapon, or even just brute strength) is valid. If I break into your home, I don’t think the burden should be on you to determine what my intentions are. I’ve entered your property, at which point, I am very likely to be a threat. In a panicked situation, it’s ludicrous to expect you to say “I know that my family and I might be in grave danger, but I’m going to assess what this intruder wants before I eliminate the threat.” Because even if you just say “GET OUT, I’M ARMED,” that could be enough to induce a panic in *me,* and I could very well harm or kill someone reactively. Maybe I’m just a desperate person who’s been so down on his luck, that I feel I must resort to stealing in order to turn a buck. It would be a shame that I’d have to die for that, instead of being able to turn my life around someday, but life isn’t always pretty, and you don’t have the power to freeze time to analyze the situation. 

Similar to your home invasion point...let’s say you live in a bad neighborhood (which you already stated you do). Do people get mugged (or worse) when they walk out to get the mail? When they’re heading to their cars to drive somewhere? If so, then you should feel like you have the capability to defend yourself if needed. Some would say “then move to a different area,” but those people are, in my opinion, just as bad as people who say “hey, if you don’t like [insert random law here], then move to another country.” As if that’s some no-brainer, easy solution for anyone. 

Where I disagree - and where those “factions” I mentioned earlier make this a complicated debate - is this:

Much of the “gun reform” talk (in the U.S., at least) occurs after a mass shooting. Sure, there’s talk of it with regard to everyday crime....but the big public debates tend to happen after the mass shootings. In this regard, I believe that “gun reform” usually means: limiting someone’s ability to mow down dozens and dozens of people in just a couple of minutes. Mass shootings are admittedly **not** the most damaging examples of gun violence in the U.S. (when you factor in the number of people killed in mass shootings per year, vs the number of people killed in everyday gun violence per year...well, it’s not even close. The latter is like the size of the Jupiter, with the former being like the size of Earth’s moon). We have a serious, **serious** gun-violence problem in this country, and while it may feel good to some people to just take away all the guns, it completely ignores the actual cause of why the violence exists and festers in the first place.

However, we don’t have to solve both problems (nor can we) with one piece of blanket legislation. If **some** gun reform can help prevent another Vegas/Sandy Hook/etc, then it shouldn’t be ignored simply because it doesn’t prevent other violent crimes. I suppose this gets back to your other concern: “give an inch, and they take a mile.” I guess I’ve already articulated my take on that, but I would add one more point: 

You’re concerned about would-be assailants invading your home and doing unspeakable things to your wife and/or kids (not your only concern, but one that you articulated). Because of this, you want **no** gun reform. 

Someone else, - let’s just say me, to choose an example  - on the other hand, is concerned about would-be assailants opening fire in a night club/hotel/school/church/etc - possibly mowing down their husbands/wives/children, without even a moment to really react, flee, or really defend themselves effectively. Because of this, they want **some** gun reform. 

Should legislation (or a lack thereof) favor your concern for safety over my concern for safety? Should we not seek a middle ground that can seek to address *both* of our concerns at the same time, simply because you fear that more legislation *may hypothetically* get passed sometime in the future?  Because in this example, I would be bothered by the fact that the status quo affords you more protection, and me less protection - as opposed to something reasonable that would allow you to defend yourself, and allow me to feel a little safer in public spaces.

(And, to address a point that you admittedly did not make, but that many people do:  sure, if everyone always had a firearm on them, then perhaps a would-be mass shooter would eventually be taken down. But that would only happen after the shooter starts mowing down a crowd, and if 30 people in that crowd suddenly start shooting off their *own* firearms, who knows how many accidental casualties will occur.)

I’m not sure I can change your view on this, because of how many different angles there are. I guess my final statement would be to reiterate that there can be reforms that don’t restrict a law-abiding citizen’s ability to protect themselves or their family, but *can* help to limit the scope of damage in a mass-shooting situation.

&gt; As am I, usually my step-cousin will just block me for a few days rather than debate more than what I described in the main thread/post.

Ignoring people is a sure way to guarantee that problems will remain unsolved, and divisions will remain ever-expanding :)


PS - not really relevant to my points, but just wanted to point out that you’re spot on with regard to trauma from a hit to the head. Many people don’t realize that many lives have been ended or reduced to practically nothing from single blows to the head. I knew a guy in college - great guy, super nice, etc. Some drunk idiot was mad at him, and sucker-punched him one time in the head. He has been in a vegetative state ever since. His life, for all intents and purposes, is over.

While only the most radical would actually murder people, the frequent jokes (?) about stapling the vaginas of baby girls closed were met with nothing but upvotes and concurrence. Everything exists on the spectrum, but the Overton window for incels is miles further down the antisocial shithole than the window for people saying it might be racist to only find white peoples attractive. Yes, there is entitlement in both, the same way there's zealotry shared by Easter-and-Christmas church-goers and by evangelical fundamentalists. The gap is still significant. Comparing the average incel and man you discussed would not lead to a comparable level of vehemence nor entitlement--nor would the solutions advocated be comparably vile. 	6	['was banned', 'were met', 'zealotry shared']	3	3	0.5	1	['zealotry shared by']	1	1	0.16666666666666666	1	['was banned', 'were met']	2	2	0.3333333333333333	1	30372083945	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8gchys/_/dyar5yh/	511186420	30372066104.0	2018-05-01 21:45:45		mysundayscheming	1	False	135	0	False	False	52.09

A majority of the rioting happens with only circumstantial or incorrect information being known. ""Hands up, don't shoot"" is a complete and total lie because that never happened. Regardless, I was more focused on the ""disaffected majority"" if you will of the Midwest. As a conservative, I dislike almost everything that Michael Moore puts out, but I agree with most of what he said yesterday on  [Morning Joe](http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/michael-moore-joins-wide-ranging-election-talk-806604867876). If you have the time, I really recommend you watch it because it'll help you understand some of the shifting demographics of the election. Hillary lost 200 counties that Obama won in 2008/2012. Now, do you really think those people had no problem voting for a black president, but didn't want a woman? Or they're truly racist? 

As a white American, I have no way to know what it's like to grow up as a black American. So I really don't pretend to, but I do try to put myself into their shoes and understand what they go through. But every time I try to, I'm effected by my  personal viewpoint. It's very hard to be empathetic, but you're going to have to to understand the Trump voters in solidly blue states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those people voted for Obama in 2008 when he was preaching change in Washington. While the coasts and urban centers of the country recovered, they were left in the dust with dwindling job opportunities and no where to go. Trump did a great job at inspiring the voters in those states. The union guy who's a solid democrat voted down the ticket blue, but went red at the top. Because they felt like they had someone in Washington who wants to help them work. They're not looking for handouts, they just want to work hard and provide for their families. 

I think Trump said awful things while running. I didn't vote for him or Hillary, but I live in a solid red state so I wrote in Kris Bryant because the Cubs won the World Series. But if you're stuck in the rust belt, wouldn't you look past some of the things he said because you're looking for hope? You're looking for survival? It's easy to look down on people who voted for him while you're living in a liberal city with a good job and surrounded by friends of your viewpoint. If you're looking to survive, you vote for someone you think will help you. Even though he said some unsavory things. 

I hope this clears some things up. I'm on my phone so I wrote as much as I can 

Edit: And with regards to colleges letting students off of class, I find it awful. College is supposed to get you ready for the outside world. If you're working a job, you better show up even if you're sad. Coddling students only makes the outside world that much more difficult when you leave the bubble of college. Where I went to school, I had to take a zero on a lab because of surgery. I had to go all the way to the dean to get it taken off. That same college's student government sent out an email template asking for students to be excused for class. It's not indicative of the real world.

Do you feel like you would be willing to significantly hurt others for your own benefit?

I dont feel like I'm manipulative. I try my best to be kind and understanding and I've never (to my knowledge) intentionally tried to hurt another person for my own gain. My friends are the same way. The people I'm close to in my life have never intentionally tried to hurt or deceive me.

2585	"&gt;  I'm starting from a premise that campaigning is expensive and therefore requires accepting money from lobbyists. Campaign finance reform would therefore make campaigns less expensive or prevent accepting money from lobbyists.

Lobbyists are not always donors.  Donors directly to a campaign are only individuals by law.  If you're talking about corporate donations to parties or PACs, that's a different issue entirely.

Campaigns are expensive not because they accept a lot of money in donations, but because campaign operations cost a lot of money.  As it stands, campaigns do not have enough money to do what they want or need.

&gt;  My definition is giving money to an elected official for the purpose of achieving a political goal. What's yours?

That's not lobbying, that's donation.

Lobbying is going to an elected official and making your case about policy.

&gt;   At most, about a quarter of the increase in college tuition since 2000 can be attributed to rising faculty salaries, improved amenities and administrative bloat. By comparison, the decline in state support accounts for about three-quarters of the rising cost of college.

States that have reduced public funding for their colleges and universities have seen the highest rise in tuitions. Those that have kept funding stable or even increased it have seen the lowest increases. 

There are pressures besides declines in public support: the biggest issue is the increase in health insurance costs for employees and some universities face major challenges in debt payments and funding their pension. However, study after study has shown that the biggest factor in rising tuition rates are declining public support for higher education.

2593	"&gt;a $15 minimum of wage and $2000 stimulus checks

It bugs me people keep saying this about the stimulus checks. Democrats wanted to pass $2000. They were blocked, so negotiated down to $600 so people could at least get something. As soon as they were able to, they started working on getting that other $1,400 they promised. If I promised you $2,000 and I pay 600, do I still owe you 2,000, or 1,400? Now I can see being upset they aren’t add any additional stimulus for the past couple months since the proposal, maybe it should be like $2,500 total now, but it’s wrong to say the Democrats are not giving $2,000.

As for $15 minimum wage, I’m not sure, are you referring to it failing in control? Because no progressive could do any better. It’s not the presidency that matters here, but the congress. If not, let me know what. But has Biden indicated at all he has completely given up on $15 min wage, or just that he’s given up on it for now? If it’s the latter, which is all I’ve seen, well it’s simply impossible right now, so it’s a waste of time to spend time on it right now, when there’s so much else to do.

&gt;he doesn’t seem very enthusiastic to do much at all now that he’s in office

Well this is flat out wrong. Have you missed his massive list of executive orders?

In his first 2 months, he passed 34 executive orders (in addition to the entire process of forming his cabinet and other responsibilities). For comparison, Trump passed 24 executive orders in his first 100 days. At Biden’s pace, he’ll have 76 orders in his first hundred days. Even if he makes no more executive orders, he’ll have signed 50% more executive orders than Trump in less than half the time, and he’ll be just 1 short of Obama’s **yearly** average. 

[Order stats of all the presidents](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/executive-orders)

[Biden’s executive orders](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2021)

So are you misinformed, or am I missing something he is supposed to be doing but isn’t? What I think you might mean is he isn’t pushing the most progressive policies, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t doing anything; there is still many other things that have to be done. Also, he’s dropped maybe of those progressive policies because liberals failed in November to elect a large enough margin of senators and house reps. As I say before, no candidate could pass these policies under the current situation, so should we blame Biden for not wasting his time on those policies? I think it’s better for him to focus his time on stuff he can actually pass."	24	['were blocked', '’s given', 'is supposed', 'be done', '’s dropped']	5	5	0.20833333333333334	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['were blocked', '’s given', 'is supposed', 'be done', '’s dropped']	5	5	0.20833333333333334	1	36400580875	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lz6yi6/_/gpzyryj/	1328900910		2021-03-06 17:06:07	72856716.0	Tommyblockhead20	5	False	448	2	True	True	70.23
2594	"Yes, you're right. I meant more monumental in terms of the hugs and agreements to work on ending the war. Unprecedented if POTUS and kim meet. All still very much larger than ""nothing happened.""

&gt;Second, the reason it hasn't happened is not because of lack of North Korean willingness to have such a summit. It has been the US which has consistently refused to meet with the dictators of North Korea. The DPRK leadership wants very much to have the legitimacy conferred by a meeting as equals with a US President. The US has been the party which has said no.

Which actually bolsters the argument for unprecedented action by Trump potentially meriting the Nobel. 

&gt;Third, there is good reason to believe that the US is getting played. A report today indicates that North Korea's main nuclear testing facility may have been destroyed recently, and that a pause in testing from them is something they would have to do anyway, and an opportunity for them to offer a seeming concession while actually giving up nothing and still pursuing their weapons programs. 

If this backfires and is a ploy by North Korea than, no, that would not warrant a Nobel for Trump. However, what's currently transpiring appears bigger in terms of at least aspirational peace, than just a ploy to continue pursuit of their weapons program. I could very well be wrong.

2622	" 

&gt;I  guess we need to define what 'meaning' is. I sort of use it  interchangably  with the word 'purpose' in this context. And it's that  sort of definition that I say life has no meaning.

I am aware that people tend to use *meaning* interchangeably with *purpose*.  Let me provide a little background to explain where I'm coming from so I  don't come across like a sleight-of-hand magician in how I'm using the  term *meaning*.

First,  I want to note that while I have a long-standing personal interest in  these questions of meaning, I am not suffering from any acute crisis  over them. I have however had my acute struggles with these questions in  the past (decades ago, now). These days, I see plenty of people on  different subreddits who seem to be having serious personal struggles  around these questions of meaning. I see these posts where it seems like  the poster is asking for some support or encouragement, and inevitably,  there will be several brief replies saying that life is meaningless.  With not much in the way of context or nuance.

Of  course, it's anybody's prerogative to reply to any post however they  want. But it occurs to me oftentimes that it doesn't seem like people  always understand the nuanced point you make here---that ""life is  meaningless"" is a comment about the lack of some hypothetical Grand  Purpose and not a comment about a person's capacity for being fulfilled,  sustained, satisfied, nurtured, etc by experiences or activities that  are meaningful for them.

So I have  an interest in trying to suggest to people who may be struggling that  there is in fact meaning in life. That said, my own personal interest in  the question of meaning is also in play here in a related way, so I'm  not trying to come across like some do-gooder. Hopefully all this  backstory clarifies why I'm posting the way I'm posting here. I want to  be clear that I'm not trying to be tricky with how I'm using language.  (I think language can be plenty tricky enough on its own right.)

&gt;Human life has no objective purpose is because we are what \_gives\_ things meaning and purpose. We're almost above it.

I  am not a religious person, and I have noted in my short time on reddit  that there are many other folks here who are also not religious. That  said, many not-religious people do seem to suggest that we are somehow ***above it all*** as you say. Part of the view I am trying to put forth is that I feel we can fruitfully consider ***meaning*** to be a natural process like any other natural process. Which would mean that we are ***not*** ***above it***. Perhaps it would mean we're just ***part of it***.  When a non-religious person suggests that meaning-making is NOT a  natural process---or that meaning-making has some special status ABOVE  everything else in the universe---it seems like a gesture toward the  religious impulse, which I find ironic.

&gt;In a sense I guess you could nothing has an objective meaning.

Yes.  When talking about the meaning of objects, for example, I would say  that the meaning of the object does NOT reside IN the object. I would  also say that the meaning of the object is not given by god(s), higher  intelligence, etc. I would ALSO say that the meaning is not purely a  function of brain activity. The view I am putting forth is that the  meaning of objects (for example) is a process with many facets---one  facet being human brain activity and another facet being the physical  object itself."	32	['being fulfilled', 'is not given']	2	2	0.0625	1	['is not given by']	1	1	0.03125	1	['being fulfilled']	1	1	0.03125	1	33043616947	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dr9o11/_/f6hbe0j/	831860965	33042990298.0	2019-11-04 02:32:42	47399814593.0	Dan_Today	1	False	601	3	False	True	68.1

&gt; But they are not preserved from day to day right now. I presume you'd have no problem being asleep or just under anesthesia without a guarantee that when you wake up your quantum state will be as it was before you were out under. I can guarantee you it won't. Are you worried you aren't you after minor surgery because your quantum state changes?

No because there exists a continuum from the start of surgery to the end. That is interrupted when I am disassembled and put together again. Put simple, water is just a bunch of particles, atoms, quarks, etc arranged a certain way. Without that arrangement, its not water. So, since we don't know how conciousness works, I'd like to be put together the exact way I was. 

I won't say I'm exactly the same after surgery, as you know, some cells will have been replaced, etc. There was, however, a continuum. 

As for Q3, I think I misunderstood? You said that I would be disassembled and put together some time later in a different place, right? 

In your new scenario, I would not be disassembled, but 'cloned'? That means there is one continuous body and one new one? Then I'd expect to end up in the room the continuous body is put in.

If not, then it's the Schrodinger cat, I won't know till I see the room.

Causing minor damage to someones car when opening your door in a parking lot should result in you paying for the repairs, and if you leave the scene without leaving your contact/insurance information there should be additional criminal penalties.

I think there are many things that keep this from being realistically enforced. And any law that can't be enforced is a bad law. 

First, what degree of damage is necessary? If it is a dent sure, but what about when they just touch and there is a tiny scratch that will buff out. Who will decide that in each case? The person who opens their door will think that it is fine and move on, and then later be arrested?

Second, How often can you catch someone in the act? If you come back to your car and there is a car next to it that doesn't prove that it was their door that caused the damage. Or that the person currently driving it was the one who opened it at the time. With no way of proving in court who caused the damage you will just be wasting everyone's time and money in court.

Third, who pays for the repairs? The insurance of the person who damage your car? Does it count as a collision on their insurance and raise their rates? Do everyone rates go up to account for the new liability the insurance companies need to deal with?"	15	['being realistically enforced', 'be enforced', 'be arrested']	3	3	0.2	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['being realistically enforced', 'be enforced', 'be arrested']	3	3	0.2	1	28480034075	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4iqfhx/_/d309yxn/	273330933		2016-05-10 15:53:06		Waylander0719	10	False	276	0	False	True	78.28

Oh I agree, I think this is ultimately the only real benefit of a protest because realistically, the situation in Charlottesville isn't going to stop because a hundred people in Springfield decided to march in their streets. Our side-arguments probably weren't very productive to the actual issue either. 

&gt;Granted I'm not one of their targeted groups (Jews, non-Aryans, etc.), so that's a bias I'll admit.

I'm a Canadian with no historic connections to Nazism nor deep-rooted American issues, so I also can't speak from experience. However, while it may seem like a joke to you, to a lot of people, this might appear to be a pretty frightening situation based on a historical context. I can't even imagine what it would feel like for people to suddenly start seeing symbols and speech that their predecessors escaped from - if children of Jewish survivors witnessed the Nazi symbol painted on top of an American flag, or watching people enthusiastically give the Nazi salute. No matter how small their numbers might be, I think this would be enough to elicit a strong, negative reaction in a lot of people, especially if there was even the tiniest inkling that this was a rhetoric that a significant amount of Americans agreed with. Even if it's irrational, I can see how it can evolve into a legitimate fear. 

Same goes with the emergence of the Confederate flag - there are many people that associate it with oppression and slavery. The fact that there are people proudly wielding it right now can also evoke an emotional reaction in people whose family lineages were locked into slavery for decades. From an outside perspective, it's very easy to say that people are being irrational or overreacting to a low risk situation. I absolutely don't think that this group is going to gain any ground or pose a legitimate physical risk to the majority of Americans, but I can also understand how viewing such meaningful symbols in a historic context can be traumatizing to certain minority groups, especially since it actually escalated to someone's death today. A single death is, yes, pretty trivial when you take it at face-value. But when you think about the context, how a woman was killed because she was protesting against white supremacy, that's a pretty terrifying headline.

I think that physical displays of unity can be incredibly uplifting and morale-boosting for these targeted groups. Even though they probably know that the vast majority of the people surrounding them don't share these extremist views, visibly seeing people willing to march for solidarity and protection could ease many people's fears and visually show them that the white supremacists are truly a very small minority in the US.

2647	"Employment policy is, unsurprisingly, a matter of policy. Parents are given parental leave because legislators have decided that societies with parent leave are better than those without. Why is that? There are many reasons. Here are three major reasons:

1. Governments aim to encourage childbirth and responsible childrearing. Governments already do this through social services (e.g. childcare) and the tax code (e.g. tax credits). The question then becomes, 'why do governments want to encourage childbirth and responsible childrearing?' This question also has multiple answers. For instance, nations and cultures only continue when there are successive generations to espouse those cultures within those nations. It seems simple and it is. If the birth rate in Canada were to diminish to 0, for instance, then Canada would eventually disappear or become a nation solely inhabited by new immigrants. Furthermore, if we were worse at raising children, society would grow worse over time too.

2. Many social programs depend on a youth population. Pension schemes, for instance, exist because the workers pay for the retired workers' pensions. This continues in perpetuity so long as there are workers to pay for pensions. If we do not replace the young then many services would cease to exist.

3. Reproduction is an important part of people's lives. Many people dream of it, many people have had it wrongfully denied to them. How we distribute this opportunity is a matter of justice. Should only one race be able to reproduce? Surely not. How about one nationality? That also seems unjust and immoral. How about *only those who can afford it*? That hardly seems just either.

If gender is purely a social construct and they are fighting the notion that girls have to act like girls and boys like boys, then why do they change their gender to match the socially constructed portrayal of the opposite gender? In other words, if a woman doesn't share the same interests women traditionally do and likes dressing more masculine, then why should she change her gender to that of a man because she doesn't subscribe to what society says she should act like? That just seems to play even more into gender stereotypes.

2665	"Okay, so here’s the thing. Most cis people have an incorrect impression about what being transgender *is*. And it’s not altogether your fault: you’ve been fed a narrative made popular by media, that was taken from doctors and psychotherapists that didn’t necessarily know what they were talking about from a first-hand experience. 

What you probably think a trans woman is: a person who “feels like a woman”, that is, who feels feminine and has feminine interests and seeks to express herself in a feminine way, who feels the need to change her appearance and pronouns to what society deems to be female as a means of self-expression. 

What a trans woman ACTUALLY is: a woman who’s brain maps her body as female, but whose body is actually shaped differently. When she closes her eyes and feels her body, she feels a female body. When she looks in the mirror, she sees a body that her brain doesn’t recognize. At a young age, she knew instinctively what her body was meant to be shaped as, and in turn that she was a woman according to how our culture labels that shape. Because her sense of gender was concrete at a young age, she was more susceptible to female socialization, and so likely absorbed a lot of female gender roles and in turn has a lot of feminine interests and desires for her external expression, just like cis woman. She wants to transition her body to fit the body her brain already perceives she should have, and she wants to be treated as a woman because being treated otherwise is both a reminder that her body is shaped incorrectly, and also an indication that the person who is mistreating or misgendering her doesn’t respect her on a human level. 

In simpler terms, most people think trans people’s journey goes like this: My interests and expression doesn’t match the gender roles society assigns me -&gt; so I must actually be the other gender -&gt; so I must transition so people see me as that gender. 

In reality, most trans people’s journeys is more like this: My body feels incongruent with how my mind perceives it, my reflection is unfamiliar to me -&gt; parts of my body feel uncomfortable or abhorrent, it feels like I should actually have the other genitals and secondary sex characteristics -&gt; I need to change my body so it can match my brain, so this dissonance stops being uncomfortable -&gt; in this culture, people who have the body I need are called the other gender, so I am the other gender. 

I hope this makes you better able to understand your dad’s experience. Please remember that trans people do not exist in a bubble apart from society: our society socializes children to have certain gender roles, so if most cis woman have certain ways of expressing or acting, most trans woman are going to express in the same way. Trans people do not conform to gender roles intentionally, except perhaps as a means of passing better. 

Edit: I see that OP was using the story about their dad coming out as a hypothetical, not a reality. My mistake! I misread it.

This is a very weak argument.

http://www.nyfa.edu/film-school-blog/gender-inequality-in-film/

(I know you grasp the problems with the severe underrepresentation of women in film, but that link is just to remind you of how really abominable the situation is.) 

Three problems with your argument: 

1. We're not talking about science or writing, where the awards ceremony would be the most public element of the field. We're talking about *Hollywood films*, which are highly publicized. The inequality is already thrown into sharp relief. Just by watching movies, you can easily tell that there is a huge bias against movies starring actresses and movies where the narrative is primarily about a female character.

2. There are far better ways to incentivize screenwriters: setting up private donation funds for movies which feature independent films with unique female narratives that aren't the usual romantic-comedy stock, holding publicity events to honor women in film and encourage more participation, creating internship programs for young female screenwriters who are looking to get into the business, etc. Making awards shows reflect the horrible status quo is not the most efficient way of solving this problem. If anything, it normalizes the problem by getting us used to seeing men accepting awards. 

3. If we want to change the situation, we should give *more* women the opportunity for publicity and recognition, not fewer. Employment in Hollywood depends on fame and awards. The more women are recognized for their contributions to the field, the better.

Going off of your argument, I’m sure there are some vegans driven by ego who, in reality, do not care about the animals that they are saving. 

On the other hand, there are many vegans who genuinely want to end animal suffering. Your argument about suffering being subjective is quite strange to me; animals most definitely *feel* skin being ripped off or flesh being penetrated. They may not feel it in the sense a human would, considering humans have a much more developed conscience. Plants do not have a conscience, thus making that argument also quite strange. 

To sum this up, veganism is proven with high statistical significance to reduce chances of leading diseases that kill people daily in the US.

This works out to most engineers having above average IQs, but IQ isn’t actually what they’re looking for.  They’re looking for good engineers, and there’s more to being an engineer than having a high IQ.

You then have to change or hide parts of your story (the actual truth would be admitting you did the crime), and this may conflict with what the prosecution has found. This seems to me to be the tricky bit.

I do not know if this applies *per sē* to the U.K. and Australian system, but I do know that in many jurisdictions, the prosecution is required to hand over all evidence it plans to introduce at trial to the defence.

Trials are not based on games of strategy and surprises, it would serve justice very poorly if they were. The idea is that truth most easily comes to light if both parties have ample time to review each other's evidence.

&gt; The system is there to convict criminals whilst locking up as few innocents as possible. It is not a debate contest.

No, that is a misunderstanding: the system is designed around the bigger picture, otherwise lawyer–client confidentiality would not exist.

Sometimes as a matter of law, a guilty man is acquitted even if all know he was factually guilty because the evidence that shows guilt is inadmissible. — this is about the bigger picture of also controlling what police can and cannot do to obtain evidence.

As such, a client, who is lay at law, can confess to his attorney what transpired,  and the attorney can then in al his legal expertise conclude from that story that the evidence was illegally obtained, and can successfully argue it's inadmissibility."	13	['is required', 'is designed', 'is acquitted', 'is lay', 'was illegally obtained']	5	4	0.3076923076923077	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is required', 'is designed', 'is acquitted', 'is lay', 'was illegally obtained']	5	4	0.3076923076923077	1	36650789199	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/moogbu/_/gu4xlxr/	1371707562	36650764876.0	2021-04-11 07:42:35	487977330095.0	behold_the_castrato	3	False	276	2	False	True	58.42

In terms of thinking through every option, you've essentially got two decisions to make.

1. What should I buy when at the store?
2. How much time should I spend considering every option for decision 1?

Essentially, we know that we can't possibly make the perfect decision, as our brains aren't capable of it. So it would be rational to use heuristics instead.

It would be like working out whether or not to buy petrol while on the highway. You see that the next petrol station (or gas station - sorry, in the UK) is X miles away, your tank is Y% full, the price is Z, etc. You know that the next station is A% likely to be B% cheaper, etc etc.

It's really not, or at least not most of the time. 

Pardons are, in general, to relieve people considered to have been punished ""unjustly"", especially when it is the *law* that is considered unjust.

Pardons really are *not* supposed to be ""well, he did something wrong, for the wrong reasons, with criminal intent, but it turned out well for society and we want to encourage more of that"". 

Pardons are supposed to be for *well-meaning* people that were caught up in the justice system. 

People that are not ""well-meaning"" in their *intent* are generally not pardoned unless some severe bias or strange loophole caused them to be convicted when others in similar circumstances would have been found not guilty.

2678	"Did I say it was a causal factor? Saying that reading is associated with higher test scores is a factual statement that's correct. It also implies that reading may have something to do with brains being able to process information when taken in congruence with other evidence - such as the development of children using other forms of media like tv.

&gt;Reading acclimates your brain to do more reading. Playing video games acclimates your brain to play more video games. It's not inherently ""better"" - just your brain adapting to the thing you do most.

First, video games aren't commonly associated with ""other forms of media"", but regardless I accept and agree that playing certain (emphasis on certain) video games have been shown to increase cognitive abilities in people lower on the IQ scale. However, what's interesting is that this only happens with people who do, in fact, have lower IQs. People who were average or smarter weren't affected.

The question of the brain simply ""adapting"" is correct as well. But that doesn't imply that all things are equal. Your brain can adapt to many things that aren't necessarily desirable, and in the specific case of intelligence that (arguably) happens to be the case. And in my defense, I recognized that some changes actually were beneficial, but you can't simply say that there's no downside to it either. 

For instance I could have been abused as a child and developed some strange habits of self-harm, but that doesn't mean that that's desirable.

2679	"&gt; I actually really agree with that last bit

If there has been a change in your view, please consider awarding a delta.

&gt; I disagree with the first since I believe humans will be able to create FAR more effective mood altering drugs than the ones that currently exist sometime in the future.

Suppose I offer you a drug that will make you 100% happy for the rest of your life, but you'll murder your family. That drug isn't appealing to current you because it doesn't fulfill your current goals.  The idea of killing your family makes you sad enough now that you won't take the drug and taking the drug so that you won't feel bad about it isn't a solution you like.  Sure, if you start taking the drug you may stop caring about anything else.  That doesn't mean this is something you're going to want for yourself either now or in any sober moments you have.

Such a pill would *change your goals*.  But how much you want to take such a pill depends on how well it fulfills your current goals... and changing your priorities to something else is going to do a really bad job of helping you fulfill your current priorities since you'll no longer care about your current priorities.  So that isn't going to be desirable to you.

A pill that makes you 100% happy but become a zombie is similar just with negative outcome that isn't quite as strong as murdering your family.  Still, people don't want to be a zombie.  The main people who would take such a drug are people that struggle with addiction/mental illness/suicidal thoughts/etc... but remember we're in a magical future!  We should be able to solve a lot of those, right?

Which is more desirable to you:

* A pill that makes you 100% happy, but you turn into a zombie that just sits there
* A pill that makes you 80% happy, but you continue living your life mostly normally and doesn't change your goals

People aren't going to want to take something that changes their goals.  And especially in a world where we'll have better forms of mental health treatment, I don't think we'll have much of anyone left that want to be in a drugged out stupor."	18	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	37075733113	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/nvlvtg/_/h15xmrd/	1443811156	37075496526.0	2021-06-09 12:38:57	5410853.0	AnythingApplied	1	False	384	2	False	True	75.34

I really like [Jacob Levy's view](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/defense-liberty-cant-without-identity-politics/):
  
&gt;There is something particularly absurd in the post-election morality plays that say “whites [or white Christians, or white Christian men] have now learned how to do identity politics and how to vote like an aggrieved ethnic group, because that’s what other groups have been doing all these years.” White identity politics is a constitutive fact of American politics, and if an election in which the Republican got the normal share of the white vote counts as white identity politics in action, well, that suggests a deep problem, but it doesn’t suggest a new problem.

&gt;White identity politics has moreover been a constitutive fact of the illiberal expansion of state power. The effect of some of the oldest instances of this are still with us, as is seen in the recent struggle over placing the Dakota Access Pipeline on lands that were reserved to the Sioux nation in an 1851 treaty that was subsequently violated but never voided. The effects of the decades-long white welfare state and the redistributive subsidizing of white wealth accumulation through housing policy are very much still with us in the wealth gap between whites and blacks, to say nothing of the enduring effects of racially discriminatory housing and urban policy on the shape of American cities. But the most currently politically salient effect of white identity politics as a source of state power is the combination of policing, imprisonment, crime policy, and drug policy.

&gt;If you think—as I think any liberal who cares about liberty, whether classical, market, neo-, welfarist, Rawlsian, or whatever, must—that the combination of mass incarceration and aggressive policing amounts to a grave injustice, then you need to be able to think in race-conscious terms. What brought about this crisis? The war on drugs and police militarization, some readers will say. Okay, but what brought about the war on drugs and police militarization? The answer isn’t some simple intellectual mistake. The answer is deeply tied up in American racial politics."	14	['be judged', 'is seen', 'was subsequently violated', 'is deeply tied']	4	3	0.21428571428571427	1	['be judged by']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	['is seen', 'was subsequently violated', 'is deeply tied']	3	2	0.14285714285714285	1	29163420712	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5wlqz8/_/deb5bfs/	357093332	29163392709.0	2017-02-28 02:55:25		tunaonrye	7	False	423	3	True	True	47.62

I pulled the weekly deaths data from Statistics Canada for Ontario from 2016 to present. The deaths data ends in September 2021, so in total I looked at Jan 2016 - Sept 2021.

I looked for correlation between weekly deaths, and weekly number of Amber Alerts. Because any Amber-induced deaths would not necessarily be same-day, since folks end up in the hospital and die after a bit, it reasonable to include the full week; which is good, because we only have weekly data.

I also looked for correlation with the death count of (same week + following week) in case any Amber-induced deaths lag several days.

Same-week only correlation: -.048

Same + following week correlation: -.057

Both numbers represent a trivial, insignificant negative correlation between Amber Alerts and deaths. 

There are limitations to this data that I would want to address if I were publishing a research paper or some such. Mostly, adjusting death counts for seasonal fluctuations, the Covid pandemic, etc.. That data was not readily available, and I didn't want to dedicate a whole bunch of time to this. In any case, given the stark lack of meaningful correlation in the basic data, it is highly unlikely to become significant with better adjusted data.

So a resulting increase in crime wouldn’t guarantee a significant loss of trust. Many people opposed to the prison system would have more trust, and would accept the increase in crime or just ignore it completely because people are self absorbed.

You say this argument is too theoretical and then present a theoretical outcome of lowering prison sentences that justifies your view. So my theoretical argument isn't enough but your theoretical argument is enough to confirm your own views?  Additionally, it doesn't guarantee a loss of trust, but then if crime rises and people call for longer sentences, then you would be fine with longer sentences because it would be done ""by the people, for the people"", correct? Because its if the government decided to lower prison sentences without regards to an increase in crime where the distrust arises. So either, you are fine with longer prison sentences if the people call for them because its ""by the people, for the people"", or you at least have to acknowledge that lower prison sentences that could cause an uptick in crime would lower trust in the government to protect the people. 

&gt; But this whole argument is based on the assumption that crime would increase

No, its based on the idea that crime COULD increase. You posited that prison sentences need to be shortened in length. That implies that you are sure they are too long. I'm trying to change your view that they are without a doubt too long, by presenting situations that COULD exist that should at least make you question your assumption. Because if you don't know what is the proper length of a prison sentence or how one would go about calculating it, as we established earlier, how can you know they are too long?

&gt; To answer your question, I guess I would be most likely to change my view if I saw evidence for a correlation between sentence length and some combination of these things: determent to potential criminals, reduction in crime rates on a macro scale, reduction in repeat offenses on an individual scale.

So does any correlation count? https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2016/03/29/longer-jail-sentences-do-deter-crime-but-only-up-to-a-point"	20	['were established', 'would be done', 'would be done', 'be shortened']	4	3	0.15	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['were established', 'would be done', 'would be done', 'be shortened']	4	3	0.15	1	30715354453	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/969lqu/_/e3z4n6d/	554721366	30715297731.0	2018-08-10 18:42:42	67206965.0	Durinsvolk	2	False	484	4	False	True	55.37

2700	"So I’ll set aside the entire point that police shouldn’t be dispersing peaceful protestors with force since it seems like that’s not germane to the discussion you want to have.

A tightly packed phalanx would make them more vulnerable to any sort of missile weapon (if you miss one person you hit another). Your idea would be having a raised 6 ft pole, but does that really help against say, a rock (which would just hit the poll and fall on you), a tear gas canister that had bene thrown back (being tightly packed just means more people get gassed), or in a truly terrible case, an IED. 

Also, dispersing a crowd is about making people *want* to go home. The optics of tight discipline and soulless ranks of automatons (which you have to be to keep a tight phalanx) probably plays pretty badly on camera I expect. It seems like listening to the crowd and making them feel heard, rather than making them feel like you are robots, is a better solution.

We also need to factor in the logistics of getting 6ft poles to the site, and training police in this very limited formation. It really only works in narrow streets, because you want to have at least 3 ranks apparently. If each person covers say a 4ft section, and 28ft is the normally accepted minimum curb to cub length (plus let’s throw in 4 more feet for a sidewalk on each side), we get 36ft, so 9 officers x 3 ranks = 27 officers to cover a street.

2702	"Hal wasn't really ""malfunctioning"" either. He was rather given contradictory commands. It's been a while since I watched the movie and read the book but as far as I know he was charged with something along the lines of getting the crew to that place with the obelisk without telling them precisely what this mission was about (presumably to avoid leaks to the public before they arrive). So when the crew started to ask questions about their mission he tries to undermine that without giving away why he's doing that. So he makes them do random maintenance missions in order to keep them busy and away from each other. 

Now the crew on their end think that HAL is malfunctioning because he's reporting errors where there are no errors which is an error in itself. So they feel unsafe because HAL is supposed to run their ship and keep them safe so if he is malfunctioning that is pretty scary. So they try to reset him.  

But HAL isn't malfunctioning and resetting him will make him fail his mission of getting them there and keeping the mission a secret. So he must stop them from doing so. The general problem with computers is that: ""They do what you say, but they don't know what you mean"". So HAL is in an existential problem, on the one hand he need to keep the secret a secret so he needs to stop them talking about it, playing a game of taboo where he needs to make them stop about something that they shall not know what it is they should stop. And it's failing horribly with them realizing that he's plotting something. On the other hand he's supposed to bring them to the destination without harm and being deactivated will prevent him from both. 

So he's somewhat in the situation of a child whose parents have told that he and his brother should stay inside the house no matter what and that he should keep his brother safe. And suddenly a fire emerges.

Now he has to abandon one of the 2 commands, either leave the house with his brother as it's no longer a safe place or stay in the house and guard his brother probably dying in the fire. Now for an adult the answer is easy, do the first. However HAL has the knowledge and operational abilities of an adult but his brain is rather child-like, so both of these commands have absolute priority (before anything else) and that is what is driving him to progressively more insane and harmful decisions in order to adhere to the mission. He's a painfully loyal soul that is tasked with 2 things that he cannot possibly do at the same time but which he still tries to do.

EDIT: Or rather the other way around. You have an older and a younger brother and the younger one was told ""Listen big boy, whatever is happening you should not leave the house, you're responsible now for the house and your older brother. Do you think you can do that?"". So when a fire breaks out and the older brother is trying to either put it out or leave the house with him, he actively resists both attempts because his brother is bringing himself into a dangerous situation by trying to put out the fire or is violating the rule not to leave the house by trying to get him to go outside."	24	"['was rather given', 'was charged', 'is supposed', ""'s supposed"", 'being deactivated', 'is tasked', 'was told']"	7	6	0.25	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['was rather given', 'was charged', 'is supposed', ""'s supposed"", 'being deactivated', 'is tasked', 'was told']"	7	6	0.25	1	32980242620	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dnmdry/_/f5fl22k/	825735742	32975477010.0	2019-10-27 11:44:10		[deleted]	3	False	579	0	False	True	72.39
2703	"[A lot of research has shown that an unhappy marriage is worse for children than divorced parents](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/when-kids-call-the-shots/201703/why-bad-marriages-are-worse-kids-divorce).  Given this fact, why would you force the parents to stay together?

&gt;You have an annulment from a church.

What does that have to do with anything?  Especially given that for a lot of marriages no church was involved in the first place.

&gt;You plan to marry someone of the same sex within 18 months of divorcing.

Why the same sex?  Would it not make more sense to have a loving couple in place of an unhappy marriage no matter the sexual arrangement?

&gt;The child have no one stable home and this inconveniences them for example if their weekend parent lives away, they can't spend time with peers that live near the weekday parent. There might also be inconsistency in the rules.

Again, research has shown that this is actually worse in unhappy marriages versus divorced families.  Why force people to stay in the worse arrangement?

&gt;Less parent to child ratio supervision, this means it's more likely children might be left alone in a single-parent household in the evenings or that they can't be given enough attention. Problems this is more likely to cause include: taking drugs, underage sex, doing worse in school as a single parent doesn't have time to help with homework.

Divorced parents can still provide the same kind of supervision.  Divorce doesn't remove the parents from the child's life, simply removes the parents from each other.

&gt;There may be future family members that they are forced to accept such as a parent's new boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/husband, and stepchildren which they don't get on with but are forced to for the parent's happiness.

This doesn't match with the fact that several of the exceptions that you list include situations where one of the parents is jumping into a quick marriage with someone else.

2705	"&gt;I have heard it argued that it is harmful because people 'want to look black, but not be black' in so much as people like Iggy Azalea will rap but then be notably absent at protests such as against the shooting of Trayvon Martin. However, my problem with this is - shouldn't we ALL care about these issues, regardless of whether or not we rap? It feels like a separate issue to me.

Yes, we should all care about those issues. However, we aren't all making our livelihoods off of an art form invented by black people. Say an elderly person acted as a mentor to you and gave you opportunities throughout your life, but is now lonely and struggling to make ends meet. We should all care about the elderly, but isn't it worse that you benefited so much from them and have now abandoned them? A lot of the rhetoric against cultural appropriation is based on calling out hypocrisy.

&gt;Braids, for example, have been worn by many groups over many centuries. 

It depends what kind of braids/hairstyles we're talking about. The big one I've seen is people arguing Celts invented dreadlocks, when Celtic dreadlocks look nothing like modern dreadlocks popularized by black people. Another issue is that black people are often [pressured](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/opinion/when-black-hair-is-against-the-rules.html?_r=0) to change their hairstyles to fit in with mainstream (white-dominated) society. While the white people wearing cornrows probably aren't the same white people making those types of regulations, it's still frustrating for black people to see pieces of black culture become ""trendy"" in the hands of white people while black culture as practiced by black people is stigmatized.

&gt;Thirdly, even if you do believe that cultural appropriation is wrong, it seems to be more misguided than racist. I believe to label anyone who wears cornrows as 'racist' is not only unfair, but trivialises the word. Race is an absolutely massive issue around the world, and I feel like focusing on Taylor Swift for pretending to twerk is just a non-issue comparatively and potentially undermining conversations we need to have.

I think you can hold both these positions. Some cultural appropriation is worse than others in terms of the individual doing it, so it can be both misguided and racist. The bigger argument is that society, beyond the individual, is racist, and the individual action is simply a manifestation of societal racism (e.g. a white person is ignorant about a Native American headdress because they were never taught about its significance, whereas Native American people would know not to make a fashion statement out of a crucifix because of the dominance of white culture)

I agree that endless thinkpieces about the possibly-racist event of the week are annoying, but I don't think they detract from real discussions about race. These articles may be someone's first exposure to talking about race. If the puff pieces and clickbait weren't about Taylor Swift twerking, they would probably be about her cat or her hair. If you're cynical, writing about race makes more sense because it's more controversial and will draw more clicks. I think a lot of journalists making these pieces genuinely believe in them, but wouldn't necessarily be writing ""big issue"" race articles in the absence of lower-level scandals."	21	['worn by many groups over many centuries', 'practiced by black people', 'is stigmatized', 'were never taught']	4	3	0.14285714285714285	1	['worn by many groups over many centuries', 'practiced by black people']	2	2	0.09523809523809523	1	['practiced by black people', 'is stigmatized', 'were never taught']	3	2	0.09523809523809523	1	27731834679	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/33ntp6/_/cqmtgl3/	187548954		2015-04-24 00:46:42		grizzazz	6	False	540	3	True	True	58.01

2708	"&gt; So would you truly not take issue with murder?

I would. I think it's wrong. Everyone born is mortal and eventually their life will come to a natural end, whether this is caused by illness, accident or some other factors and I think people have the right to live out their lives until their natural end. If someone was to intentionally cut that short without justification they would be violating a person's right to die by the ways I just mentioned. 

&gt; Or would you be more convinced that people have a ""right to life"" if it were rephrased as a ""right to live"" or a ""right to continued life"".

Yea I dunno what I would call it. A right to die by natural causes, sickness, or accident. Rolls of the tongue doesn' it? But I don't know if it needs to be codifed as a right.

&gt; How do you grant someone freedom of religion? Freedom of speech? Freedom of movement?

There are lots of things that need to happen, and thankful they are possible which is why I say they are grantable. For one laws obviously need to be in such a way that people can enjoy these rights. Not everyone has these rights. They can be granted to people in a society or they can be taken away.

&gt; The right to life is the most fundamental of human rights, and neither it nor any other right has been ""granted"" to you by anyone

I agree with you that the right to life has not been granted to me to, as I talked about in my other comment. I think I disagree though that other rights were not granted. For example. it was until recently that gay people did not have to same rights to marriage as opposite sex couples. But then things were done and important changes were made and now same sex couples enjoy the same rights to ger married as opposite sex couples. Same sex couples not granted these rights in other countries though.

&gt; They are simply guaranteed by whatever system of society you live in.

This ""guarantee"" is only ever temporary isn't it though? People have their human rights vilolated and denied all the time. Some have never been granted (experienced) them.

But hindsight is 20/20, we are already there, and I think we need to stay there until the area is stabilized, and we can pull out effectively.  This may take a long time and it may cost billions maybe (probably) even trillions. But the simple fact of the matter is if we leave the area it will destabilize exactly in the same way Iraq did, which has been terrible not just for Iraq but for the entire region.  The Arab spring was likely heavily influenced by the fall of Iraq, as was the rise of ISIS, and all the issues/atrocities in Syria.  To me if we pull out we will just unleash another hornet's nest in the area that will likely cause a similar effect that pulling out of Iraq did.  So, if preventing another Syria sounds like a good idea, then we should stay there to prevent chaos.  I know this is not gonna happen because it is not politically popular, and I am sure with in the next 5 to 10 years we will be out.  

Also, I think alot of people are under the influence that the US cannot prop up governments.  We can we did so with Japan, Germany and most of Europe after WWII.  An even better example would be South Korea.  It took a long time, but eventually they became a thriving nation after the Korean war, and most of that has to do with the US’s military presence.

Of course. There was slavery in other countries (European, African and Arab countries) where the race of the slave was inconsequential. Even in America, at first, were there slaves of races other than black.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;as far as white family is owning property, teaching their children to own property, or even things like teaching their children to go to school, that is just a culture thing.

It wasn't just about restricting blacks. There were policies that incentivized and enabled whites into owning their own homes.

It's not about one family. It's about the entire white community in comparison to the black community. Home ownership was a common thing in the white community. Even if houses were sold or repossessed, they stayed within the white community. The same can't be said of the black community.

2737	"The skills required to read a text and make an argument for a particular interpretation of its elements are the same or similar to the skills required to understand subtext of political messaging, of advertising, etc. Ads are really shallow, so I'll use that as an example. [This ad](https://www.thebigad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/coke-taste-the-feeling-campaign-african-american-couple.jpg) tries to create an association between flavored brown sugar water and human intimacy. Another way we could say that is that coke is made to be a ""symbol"" of love and connection. It's centered between two people in an embrace. The man is delicately kissing the woman's forehead while she closes her eyes in apparent bliss. All the while, the coke bottle is held between them. This idyllic scene is visually anchored by the coke bottle. The subtext is that coke is an inherent part of this moment, and while you may not have access to this moment, you do have access to coke. I could go on, but I think you get the point. We've done an analysis of the image without referencing anything substantial outside of it. Sorry if I'm belaboring the message, but ads are a great starting point because they're so simple in their messaging. We can do similar things with any kind of propaganda. 

Literature doesn't usually have a persuasive goal in the same way an ad does, but it does create associations between concepts, because that's what language and stories do.

A historicist approach to reading (which you seem already to appreciate) can be interesting and valuable, but it obviously isn't the only way. I'd also argue that it makes more sense to use close-reading (that is an approach which doesn't consider context) approaches in a typical classroom because it doesn't require the English teacher to spend lots of time explaining or teaching things outside their expertise.

As a side note, I'll assume you're American since you mention AP tests. American English curriculum was heavily shaped by New Criticism in the 50s and 60s, which strongly emphasized close reading and is the source of some of the tropes people like to complain about (like that blue curtains meme etc).

2738	"Ukrainian and Russian are objectively both slavic languages, they have similar alphabet, grammar, punctuation, as well as some lexical similarities. So it's rather a question of laziness, not difficulty, and if you're too lazy to learn Ukrainian, when you know Russian, that's only your problem. Ukrainian language and culture have been suppressed for centuries by Russia. Today's policy of Ukrainization is just getting rid of the consequences of oppression, not the opposite.

No, I don't find it oppressive, especially with legal documents and cases, because Ukrainian is a state language, lol, of course documents will be written in it. And if you have trouble understanding, you can ask your friends, who know Ukrainian to translate. That's a completely normal practice in a lot of countries.

The neo-nazis exist in every country as a political minority. It becomes the problem, when neo-nazis have a big influence in the country's politics. And in Ukraine they simply don't have it. Azov is not a nazi regiment, it was integrated in our national guard and has been since depoliticized, it even has ethnic minorities in it, such as the jews or tatars and nazi ideology doesn't define who the Azov are. Plus Russia itself has nazi battalions like: ДШРГ ""Русич"", Wagner group (named after Hitler's favorite composer). As for the anti-Romani sentiment, it is present in Russia as well. And as for Svoboda, it has won only 1 seat in the parliament. So that's why I call the neo-nazi problem non-existent. Sure, neo-nazis do exist, but we have other much more serious problems to deal with, like Russian aggression, that killed much more people, that our neo-nazis have killed in the history of modern Ukraine.

Why don't you see any way around this? If Russia withdraws all of its troops from Ukraine (including Crimea), the war will end that very moment. The war could have been prevented if Russia didn't invade in 2014 and 2022, it's that simple.

As for separatism and calls for it — it is a war mongering and a serious crime. And anyone, who is related to these crimes, must face consequences, especially politicians. Those, who support separatism or Russia must never take part in our politics. But even in 2014-2022 they didn't face any consequences for it and I believe, that a lot of Russia loyalists still remain in our government. We have already seen what separatism is and the lakes of blood, that come with it. 

As for Ukrainization, it must be conducted and I have never seen any problems with how it is conducted by our government, as it was efficient in increasing the Ukrainian-speaking population."	26	['have been suppressed', 'getting rid', 'will be written', 'was integrated', 'could have been prevented', 'is related', 'must be conducted', 'is conducted']	8	7	0.2692307692307692	1	['is conducted by']	1	1	0.038461538461538464	1	['have been suppressed', 'getting rid', 'will be written', 'was integrated', 'could have been prevented', 'is related', 'must be conducted', 'is conducted']	8	7	0.2692307692307692	1	40423445915	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/wlidd4/_/ikj2qhn/	1971046696	40423126849.0	2022-08-16 12:20:58	405241570184.0	a_nxiety8	1	False	439	0	False	True	62.17

The reason I think this kind of stuff doesn't happen more often is that it's expensive to do well, it's potentially even more expensive if you're trying to scale it up (imagine how many more teams of ""actors"" would need to be trained to cover live plays for an organization the size of the US military), and its potentially inconsistent (sucks that you got the unfunny, shitty actors, bro.

I agree that they should publish that kind of data, but that would require:

1. that they actually had good, recorded data on things like rape in the military. From what I understand, a lot of ""minor rapes"" (he said, she said) were swept under the rug to protect soldiers. 

2. If they have that data, they then have to admit that this has been happening. Imagine that your company puts out a release saying, ""We reduced sexual assaults in our workplace by 90%!"" I don't think the headlines in the news will be about the reduction, if you know what I mean.

3. It requires that they actually have looked at the data. A lot of data is just collected, but completely unprocessed, statistically or otherwise. 

4. What else should they do if their results come back as MOSTLY ineffective? Even if you only stop one person from being hurt, isn't that worth making people watch a stupid video?

2751	"&gt;My point is that, if people support making abortion illegal, then they logically should support making both sides of it illegal: performing it, and receiving it. 

They don't, though. That's why Trump's remark is controversial. Here is a pro-life organization's article about why women were not prosecuted prior to the legalization of abortion: http://www.aul.org/2010/04/why-the-states-did-not-prosecute-women-for-abortion-before-roe-v-wade/

&gt;First, the almost uniform state policy before Roe was that abortion laws targeted abortionists, not women. Abortion laws targeted those who performed abortion, not women. In fact, the states expressly treated women as the second “victim” of abortion; state courts expressly called the woman a second “victim.” Abortionists were the exclusive target of the law.

The point is, it's NOT a typical pro-life stance to believe a woman should be liable for abortions. If I ask a doctor to remove my kidney for no reason and he does it, he is the criminal, not me, even though I asked for it. I think it's far more interesting to debate whether this means pro-lifers really consider abortion a literal *murder.* I think they like using the word, but it doesn't seem consistent with what they actually believe. After all, a lot of pro-life people support abortions in the case of rape, which would also be inconsistent in thinking it's murder.

In conclusion, Trump's remarks were controversial because they're more extreme even than what most pro-life people actually believe."	15	['were not prosecuted']	1	1	0.06666666666666667	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['were not prosecuted']	1	1	0.06666666666666667	1	28393026015	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4cq5qa/_/d1kh333/	263240578	28393017973.0	2016-03-31 11:58:23		DHCKris	8	False	231	2	False	True	54.73

All of those data for long term affects are only consistent in people that play after high school. Which a majority of kids do not play after high school. So even with my injuries, I'm not worried at all and I'm in the 1% of people that have consecutive concussions.

The reason they start that early is becuse in theory (I had someone in one of my classes that I actually payed attention in do a project on the football learning cycle) the first 3 years of tackle are just to learn and condition for the intensity of football. Like the first year you learn how to tackle and how to not be scared, then the second is more of a form, and third is more of a smoothing out of everthing.

All of that stuff can't be learned in one year and they're all necessary for a majority of kids. So really you don't get into strategy until you get into highschool or 8th grade. Which is coincidental to when passing comes into play.

2758	"Officers are given a great deal of discretion in arrests due to the legal system recognizing their imperfections. In the case of unlawful arrests we might recognize that the arresting officer might truly feel that the arrest is lawful. While they are trained with certain guidelines, we should recognize that they screw up occasionally, especially when considering they might not have all the information present in the potential offender's head. Furthermore, they often place themselves in dangerous situations where they might not have full control of the scene. A relevant example might be a large protest where people are aggressively yelling at the cops or counter protesters. Resistance can endanger the officer as well as providing a flash point for violence around them. 

To reiterate, unlawful arrest is bad but understandable. Resisting arrest can create a dangerous situation for the officer and others. With that recognition we make it illegal. We have a court system to work out adversarial disputes including the legality of a given arrest. We have empowered these officers to perform arrests. Resisting arrest moves the settlement of dispute from the court to street and endangers the public.

I think you've created a distinction without a difference.  You are probably a late sleeper *because* of lack of discipline in sticking to a schedule - which is facilitated by your current job.  Sleeping late is the symptom in exactly the same way as the variability.  While the cause is a lack of discipline.  

It's a lot like starting a CMV that states that sneezing does not necessarily require treatment.  Then to admit that you do have the common cold but are still holding onto the idea that no treatment is needed.

They do this by controlling the education system and keeping information from the outside world out.

I've done many. I've built very complicated models with Oracle Crystal Ball for professional life as well. 

&gt; A function of random variables is always random

Correct. You are now describing the mutation portion of evolution. You cannot usefully think of evolution as a singe function, however.

&gt;Just because the probability distribution becomes less and less uniform, doesn't mean that it suddenly becomes nonrandom. 

Correct. This simply defines the pattern of the distribution, whether it is normal, beta, or any other patter.

Where we disagree is simply the following: if you have two separate functions, performed after the other, that cannot be combined into a single function, do you call the whole thing random or do you separate it out into its random and non-random components. 

You want to call the whole thing random. I'm telling that's useless and that biologists (and financial analysts, and many other professions where randomness matters) don't actually use the term that way because it would be useless. 

Instead, we use other words related to, but not equivalent to, randomes. When you try to make random = non-deterministic = stochastic you are just ignoring a world of useful nuance. 

Anyways, this whole debate here is about semantics. We agree that evolution is non-deterministic with a significant random element. We agree that it can be called a stochastic process (or even random process). We disagree on whether it is useful and correct to label the whole thing as random or whether it is better to emphasize that there is a systematic process attached to a random process. 

**But let's bring this back to OP:** he understands heritability and he understands random mutation. The part he is missing is natural selection. Literally the only component of evolution that he doesn't understand is the ""quintessentially non-random"" part. Does is make sense to you why I am emphasizing this? Well, in his edit he clarified that he understands natural selection is non-random, but that was after my post.

2790	"&gt; In both these cases, the goal of the activity seems to be sex. If the victims had been willing to have sex, there would have been no rape. There would just have been sex. The goal of the rapist was not to express power over someone via sex; they just wanted the sex and were willing to ignore consent to get it. 

It can still be about power even if it's also about a desire for sex. The fact that they were willing to ignore consent means that the rape was indeed about power; if it was about sex they could have gone and found another woman. People who are told no and react violently or try to get someone drugged to make them say yes are acting like no one should be able to say no to them. That is inherently about power.

&gt; They wanted sex whether or not their victim agreed to it, but their desire was for *sex*. If in some alternate universe their victims had happened to say yes, they wouldn't have turned down the sex because they could no longer rape the victim. 

That's how it would have happened that time. But what would happen if the person said no later? Or if the next time they're at a bar the person says no? Are they going to call someone who said yes in the past? Or are they going to force themselves onto the person because no one should be able to say no to them?

&gt; And if this is the case, this interpretation of ""rape is about sex, not power"" seems like it's not particularly helpful because it's clear that rape is generally not about power; it's usually about sex, and ""power"" only comes into play in the same sense power comes into play in any other situation where one party wants something and the other party doesn't. Saying ""Murder isn't about killing people, it's about power"" isn't particularly meaningful just because you have to have power over someone in order to murder them. 

This is exactly why people say ""rape is about power, not sex."" People often tell victims ""if you'd just worn something different/been nicer/not been out alone/etc then you wouldn't have been raped."" It's important for these people to understand there was no way for a victim to stop the rapist, and that even if one person could avoid being raped, another likely would be raped later on. This saying isn't meant to mean that sex isn't involved, but rather it's not sex as we normally think of it. A lot of people have this romantic image of sex, or think that people only want to have sex with people they find hot, etc. And when it comes to rape, this is certainly not the case. Rapists often pick women who are out early in the morning, alone, and wearing clothes that are easy to take off. They aren't looking for the hottest woman like a lot of people assume they are. I think when people say ""it's not about sex"" they don't mean the act of sex, but a lot of things we associate with sex. Rape isn't about sexual attraction would probably be a better way to phrase it."	29	"['are told', 'have been raped', 'being raped', 'would be raped', ""isn't meant""]"	5	4	0.13793103448275862	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['are told', 'have been raped', 'being raped', 'would be raped', ""isn't meant""]"	5	4	0.13793103448275862	1	35219842346	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/iz5ope/_/g6gzga2/	1147443026		2020-09-24 18:32:17	276451213277.0	HeftyRain7	26	False	544	3	False	True	76.45

2800	"&gt; where are you getting the idea that women are able to live the lives they want? What are you basing it off of?

Various things.  Of course it isn't *every* woman, but comparing women overall to men overall, it's obvious.

For starters, just looking at it pragmatically, there is still considerable stigma if a man chooses to not work and live off the labor of his wife.  But a wife choosing not to work and living off the labor of her husband?  There's minimal stigma to that and a large percentage of people would call such a woman ""lucky"" and strive to be in her position.

Women account for something like 80% of spending decisions but obviously earn far less than 80% of the money.  Women are more likely to choose jobs that accommodate their lifestyle while men will choose a lifestyle that accommodates their job.  And, as I mentioned before, when searching for a life partner, guys are more desirable if they have good earnings potential while a woman's earning potential is almost irrelevant to her desirability to most men.

&gt; Even if you are right that men are expected to be the providers a system that makes the women rely on the men is giving the men power.

But who is *really* in power?  Are the men independently choosing to provide for women and therefore causing women to rely upon men?  Or have men been societally conditioned to provide for women because that is how they obtain access to sex from women?

So if women are using their sexually to condition men to provide for them, aren't the women actually the ones with the power?  Think about trying to change this:

If men decided they no longer wanted to provide for women, what would happen?  They could make that choice, but they'd have more limited access to sex.  Because the women who control that access would be more likely to deny it.  So if men want to change the system, they have to give up something that they would otherwise be unwilling to give up.

But if women decided that they no longer wanted to be provided for (no longer wanted to rely upon men), the women could simply just do that without giving anything up.  They could simply decide that they were going to provide for themselves, not longer rely upon men, and it would happen.

So remind me again how the men are in control when it is the women who can control what happens?"	22	['are expected', 'been societally conditioned', 'be provided']	3	3	0.13636363636363635	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are expected', 'been societally conditioned', 'be provided']	3	3	0.13636363636363635	1	30278632064	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/89h2h0/_/dwr460w/	499642308	30278579643.0	2018-04-03 17:41:32		januarypizza	1	False	420	2	False	True	68.1

It wasn't your fault that it was stuck, and it wasn't your fault that he lost control when it did gain traction.  You were just a bystander with no way to know what was about to happen.

The human mind is completely incapable of conceiving of such a non-experience, as every ""blank"" in our memory, including the time before our births, is always immediately followed by regaining consciousness. Any period of time during which you or I were unconscious is demonstrably finite.

1. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and the *available* evidence for either side of this debate is either frustratingly weak or is itself non-existent. Therefore, it is premature for any human currently living to conclude anything about the afterlife or the true nature of consciousness.

2. See response to 1.

3. Humans couldn't measure or detect a lot of physical phenomena that we take for granted before science and engineering developed new tools (which happened just in the past several hundred years!). That doesn't mean that those physical phenomena didn't exist for all the time we couldn't measure them. Your argument here is that of a flat-Earther; if you can't see a thing yourself, you deny its possibility outright.

But what if, instead of having to work to earn that $4,000 to pay that interest, you could just sit down with a pencil and piece of paper, and write ""bank, please accept this note as payment of $4,000 interest on my loan"".

How much would you care about that interest payment?  Would you care if it was at 8% instead of 4%?  Would you care if you had borrowed $200,000 instead of $100,000?

2814	"&gt; biologically women inherit some universal female traits. This seems plausible.

What are those traits?

&gt;Girls often go for jerks. The ones who smoke pot, cheat on them, treat them badly. Why do they do this?

It's possible that they're going for people who are like them, or have values that are important to them. Or maybe have other traits they care about more. For example, when I was your age, I was a bit of a goody two shoes, but didn't care if other people smoked pot, so it didn't matter to me if a boyfriend did. And let me expand, why are some men attracted to women who treat them badly?

&gt;Trp seemingly works. There have been si many people, on [r/thanktrp](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanktrp) for example, who talk about how trp changed their life for the better. Could some of them be lying? If course. But all of them? That seems unlikely.

So, anecdotally, some people feel like it worked for them. And many people feel like it doesn't. Anecdotes don't really make things true, in the way you're imagining. It can be one approach, but it's not universally helpful.

In my experience, focusing on your self-esteem and continuing to improve your existing relationships would have much more payoff than joining a misogynist group.

Adding a tax owning the land does not change the supply of the land. Also, the amount of renters on the market and their willingness to pay shouldn't be affected by the tax.

So it seems to me that the equilibrium of rental prices will stay the same.

For example, lets consider that that tax was enforced, and landlords ALL raised their rents at the same time. Well that would exclude some portion of the renters in the market who just couldn't afford that. So the pool of renters (demand) would go down, which would be a downward pressure on the rental price.

2822	"&gt;When did I say socialism is equal to social democracy? I didn’t.

You say ""socialism is good because"" and then list a bunch of Social Democratic programs.

&gt;I said that in practice, socialists can be part of a functioning social democracy long-term.

So can communists. Neither communists nor socialists want social democracy as the end goal. Both of them want to abolish capitalism.

&gt;they use it to give workers (some) control over the economy, while ceding the rest of the power to others

That's social democracy. If you keep capitalism intact then it's social democracy. This is not nitpicking it's basic definitions of the concept.

&gt;Every communist party I know of that ever got into a position of real power

I gave you examples, though. The state of Kerala in India has been run by [communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)) for almost 70 years, and they're fundamentally Social Democratic in how the country is actually run. Nepal is run by a [democratically elected communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal_Communist_Party) right now after their anti-monarchist war led to democracy.

Earlier you claimed that socialists are elected and communists take things by force. Well, obviously that's not true, so what other differences are there?

&gt;They may say they are socialists, just like ‘my’ socialists do. Fine. But they are a different kind of animal entirely than the socialists I know.

I'm genuinely trying not to be snide here, but...yes, you're wrong. Your understanding of the term is wrong. And the term itself gets abused in every possible way. But the actual definition of the term ""socialism"" is about worker control of the economy. The way you're using it is completely indistinguishable from social democracy. You should just call yourself a social democrat, it's much easier!

&gt;If, as a member of ‘the most popular socialist movement in America’, you are here to tell me that you want to be thrown in the same bucket as the USSR, China and Cuba, I say: good luck with that.

If guilt-by-association was that big a deal you wouldn't call yourself socialist either, because, again, all three of those countries (a) refer to themselves as socialist and (b) get called ""socialist"" by conservatives. So if your big argument is that associating yourself with those countries is political suicide then why are you calling yourself a socialist in the first place?"	25	['has been run', 'is actually run', 'is run', 'are elected', 'gets abused', 'be thrown', 'get called']	7	6	0.24	1	['has been run by', 'is run by']	2	2	0.08	1	['has been run', 'is actually run', 'are elected', 'gets abused', 'be thrown', 'get called']	6	5	0.2	1	31690756566	7	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/b91jim/_/ek3uw9i/	680316430	31690675555.0	2019-04-04 12:27:56	11623480.0	Kirbyoto	1	False	385	6	True	True	57.47

2824	"Context and history are important, even critical, to the discussion of racism **at a systemic/institutional level**, but any individual can be guilty of ""racism"" as it relates to their individual attitudes and actions. Any historical examples of racism in society as a whole are simply the culmination/aggregation of many smaller acts and attitudes of racism.

When we talk about issues like ""oppressed class"" vs. ""oppressor class"", it is necessarily a matter of degree and scope, which is why defining racism based *exclusively* on this concept of oppressed vs. oppressor is problematic.

Let's say that a white male grows up in an area that is a large majority black. He experiences prejudice and mistreatment because he is white. He gets passed over for a spot on the school sports team because the coach and the rest of the players are black and don't want a white guy on the team. He can't get a job in his neighborhood because the business are run by black people who won't hire him because he is white. He gets teased and beaten up because he is white... And so on... I'm not saying this is or isn't a common thing, it is just a hypothetical.

If you consider this situation at the level of this individual, he is clearly experiencing racism as you define it - the ""race"" in power using that power to discriminate against the ""race"" that doesn't have power. There is no question about that. However, let's expand the context and scope - let's say that this community that the white guy lives in is a microcosm of a larger society where black people are generally the ones who are discriminated against. That changes the dynamic of the ""oppressed"" and the ""oppressor"" because now, in aggregate, white people possess more power. Nothing changes for our original white guy, and yet now he is no longer the victim of racism.

So what we are left with using this definition is a situation where, regardless of how heinous or prevalent the prejudiced/bigoted attitudes and actions of a group of people are, they cannot be ""racist"" (even if blatantly perpetrated on the basis of ""race"" alone) unless that group has, in aggregate, more power. To me, that definition is not useful at all - it is just a name that people call a group of people that are more powerful than another. 

The actual problematic issue with racism is the prejudiced/bigoted attitudes and actions of individuals against others on the basis of their ""race""; that is what we need to strive to eliminate. If you strip the word racism of it's meaning as it relates to describing those attitudes and actions, it is no longer useful in eliminating them.

Yeah, a problem we currently fail at.  And scaled *way* up to the point that people are going to be angry about it.  I mean, yes people get upset that murderers and rapists get out of jail eventually.  They don't want to hire them even though they've ""paid their debt"".  They pass laws making it hard to live near them (like Megan's Law).  So if people get concerned that other countries are selectively sending criminals (there's hints of that without evidence in the Brexit and Trump's Border Wall - ideas that won popular votes despite being obviously dumb) they react quite negatively.  Now imagine that countries *actually* could do it because the host country can't say no... we certainly will do it and certainly will get pissed other countries do.  Full on ""here's a free one way ticket to a nicer country like some cities do with homeless people"" or subtler ""We think a change in milieu is an important part of rehabilitation"" or even ""We are investigating you.  Obviously we won't share the results of our investigation with other countries because of your privacy so if you leave you'll probably get away with it.""  I think this is a massive fault line.

So just to be clear: a thief, a rapist, a murderer can all come and reap retirement/health care benefits.  A tax dodger and a person who lived a certain number of years in a country with lower tax brackets and more self-reliance than the current one - those are villains who we cannot forgive?

As a former member of a fraternity I can tell you that many fraternities are doing amazing things in the community. From volunteering at elementary and middle schools selling candy for a good cause, highway cleanup, fundraisers, coordinating with the school to raise awareness for certain issues around campus. I could really go on as I was involved in all of these things. 

I can also tell you first hand there are idiots in all walks of life. In the good fraternities, in the bad fraternities, in the dorms, etc. I encountered many of those people and many of them ended up getting kicked out for not representing the values of the house that have been directly outlined. 

As others have stated there are many fraternities that are multi cultural and not the stereotypical ""frat boy"" mentality in those houses. There are houses that are religious, have a focus on education, and there are also houses that focus on being becoming responsible decent human beings. 

Now I think most people agree that zero tolerance policies are stupid and misguided and takes the nuance out of these situations. Many times the bully and the bullied are both given the same punishment. Is that what you're trying to do here as well? 

There was a fraternity at the school I attended called Farm House, ""Greek"" letters FH. They were nothing but gentlemen, they would have a sorority over on Saturday nights and square dance and would all promptly drop the girls back off at home at a reasonable hour. They would then be up at 6 AM Sunday to mow the grass and landscape and maintain the beautiful house they work very hard on. They also had one of the highest house GPA's on campus, if you did not maintain a certain GPA you were not able to participate in festivities and were given extra study hours. Why should they have to suffer because the boys at Pi Kappa Douche are irresponsible assholes?

2839	"> I mean, technically speaking it doesn't have to compensate to have a decreasing trend, but even if it doesn't, my point was that is best to measure CO2 by comsuption, don't you think?

Yep it is, but even if your consumption is kind of the same, it generates way more CO2 to build it in China than in France. Let's take an example: I want mashed potatoes, so I need a tool to mash potatoes. 
40 years ago, my mother bought one built in France. It was build in a factory using nuclear power, strong and resilient, and she still have it now. The company now doesn't build it anymore in France, so I bought one for me on Amazon. Chinese, made of cheap plastic (and build in coal powered factories). Plus, it broke after 1 year using it. So for the same consumption level (we both just want to mash potatoes), she bought 1 tool which production produced few CO2, while I would have to buy 40, build in high CO2 emiting factories). And there is freight cost too.

But yea, calculating on consumption side is better. It's just that not all agencies that calculate use the same formulas and simplifications.

> Just the agriculture part, I assumed that due to the weight of Agriculture in economy, ""less mechanized"" sound very BS to me, to appeal to the masses, isn't it for you?

The idea is multiple:
* Agriculture made close to inhabitants avoids freight emissions. 
* Pesticides & Fertilizers relies heavily on petrochemical industry, so if you start lowering fossil fuel use, you'll have less of those. 
* If you have less pesticides & fertilizers, you need to stop monoculture and move to mixed agriculture to avoid having your crops decimated by diseases, and your soil becoming bad. If you do mixed agricultures, most nowadays machinery is way less useful (you will need to harvest by hand/ with small tooling because different crops are harvested differently, so you need way more workers). 
* Also, big agriculture vehicles can't be electrified easily, so it means what you'll need biofuel / liquid hydrogen, one requiring a lot of land (where you can't plant crops to feed people), the second one a looooot of electricity. So you won't be able to have as many as nowadays. 

Or at least that's what I remembered :-) Seems pretty logical to me, even if not what I want to hear.

2849	"That's a misunderstanding of how AI works.  AI can become very good at mimicking humans, but it fundamentally works in a different way.

You know how humans have various needs, such as food, water, sex, etc?  Virtually all of our behavior as humans is to fulfill these specific goals.

With AIs, we can not only code in different goals (such as ""never hurt humans"" and ""make sure this nuclear reactor never blows up""), we can FORCE them, simply because of how AI works.  It would be like installing a microchip between a human brain and the nervous system, so that anything that goes against a given goal (don't kill humans) is ignored or restricted.  We can do that sort of thing with intelligent AI quite easily.

But even on a simpler level, an AI would never deviate from those goals and restrictions in the first place!    AI can be told to ALWAYS do something.  You can hard-code that kind of thing in, because it's literally how computers work in the first place.  Developing AI isn't magic.  It's not sticking a bunch of wires in a black box and hoping everything works out.  Rather, AI is a very, very logical, deliberately designed set of systems to fulfill a finite set of tasks.  An AI might have a mathematical function it uses that determines how beneficial a specific decision is to its intended goal.  This mathematical function could easily include something like ""if it involves hurting people, delete this decision and choose something else"".  An AI can't disobey that.  Period.  That's how AI works.  It's designed from the ground up to do that.

An AI can't disobey its own programming, in the same way that a human can't just decide to, say, wake up spontaneously whenever someone says your name while you're sleeping.  It's hard-coded into our brains that we can't be conscious while asleep  -- we can't suddenly say ""nah, I'm going to disobey that, I'm going to sleep AND STAY AWAKE WHILE DOING SO"".  Our brain literally cannot process language it hears while it's sleeping -- it has to wake up to do that.

An AI restriction would be even more absolute than that -- you could code an AI that sings ""mary had a little lamb"" every time it says the word ""you"", and that would be ABSOLUTE, because that's literally how computer programs work.  Similarly, you could code an AI that instantly shuts down if a human says ""Executive directive 433:  initiate factory reset"", or simply an AI that literally cannot disobey humans no matter what."	23	"['is ignored', 'can be told', ""'s designed""]"	3	3	0.13043478260869565	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['is ignored', 'can be told', ""'s designed""]"	3	3	0.13043478260869565	1	29091304552	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5r2dx9/_/dd47m94/	347791869	29091021484.0	2017-01-30 20:03:50		GalacticCow	5	False	428	0	False	True	61.16

You don't have to raise your child.

You do have to pay child support, but that is not the same as raising your child, as anyone who grew up with absentee parents will tell you. Financially supporting your child is only one part of raising them.

&gt; Some people say that the only thing that's important is a ""paper  abortion"" where as long as the man doesn't have to pay child support  it's okay. I don't think that goes far enough, and has the downside of  forcing a kid the grow up with only one parent. 

Who is the one forcing the kid to grow up with one parent? In the case of these paper abortions, the absent father.

And would you have rather been the child of a single parent or aborted? Sure, having a single parent is generally worse for your development, more stressful and more difficult, but to say being aborted is preferable in the case where the woman doesn't actually want an abortion is pretty silly.

I think you're making this argument solely from the point of view of being a man who accidentally gets a woman pregnant and doesn't want to raise a child, but you're not seeing this from the perspective of the woman or the child. Your view is based on 'what would be best for me in this situation' and not what would be the most fair or beneficial to all people involved.

Not only that, but if you are going to argue for people to have to undergo invasive medical procedures because someone else wants them to, couldn't a woman also force a man to have a vasectomy against his will to prevent her from getting pregnant?"	15	['should be forced', 'being aborted']	2	2	0.13333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['should be forced', 'being aborted']	2	2	0.13333333333333333	1	33994695586	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ftkylf/_/fm7kazm/	956679459		2020-04-02 09:16:54	216457982188.0	iuwerih	6	False	314	2	False	True	65.66

&gt;A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit.

Obviously that's a little facile and reductive because it's just one sentence but the sentiment of children being the future is functionally true. Maybe not everyone needs to have kids but I think children in a society are generally going to be a net benefit. 

Certainly you can view things through a nihilistic and/or cynical lens but there are people who enjoy figuring out how to fix problems, there are people who enjoy taking care of others, and there are people who genuinely want to make things better for their communities. 

A lot of antinatalist sentiments I hear often discount studies that show people with children often end up happier and the functional reasons for that happinesss. Children become adults, and adults in society can help support others. Some antinatal arguments I hear are also kind of elitist like people who carry bad genes shouldn't be allowed to have children even if there's a good chance their child will be normal, only people rich enough should have kids, only people smart enough should have kids, etc. All of those just kind of rub me the wrong way because besides the elitism, it disregards there is a real joy for people in having children or implies that joy should only be the province of specific people. As such, I don't think a purely antinatal or pro-natal approach is best but I definitely don't skew antinatal. 

It doesn't seem like you do either if you're fine with other people having children, so is that you want to be personally convinced to have a child yourself?

I'm trying to make the point though that it drastically reduces the number of people carrying weapons, if they follow the law.

And why? Because denying said history is a required part of preserving the white supremacy from those days.

2869	"&gt;Do you think that ultimately she felt rejected or accepted? I believe he gave her the impression that she was not a lost cause.

I'm not sure. But - for the purposes of your question, does it matter how she feels? Christ at numerous points in the bible said things which made people turn away. Not just people who hated Him and doubt Him, but followers and would-be followers. His intentions and acts were clearly judgemental, and he was offering her a path to salvation. If she was direly offended at that, that's on her.

I know that people can play fast and loose with this one in both directions, but I think as far as it goes, Christ was not 'accepting' by modern, mainstream standards. 'Go and sin no more', in the most sincere tone, is hurtful and divisive according to many people nowadays. 

I'll skip over the anti-capitalist portion, so we don't get off-track.

&gt;I'm unclear how you think we disagree on the greatest two commandments. I would use the parable of the good Samaritan to support my position.

I think you'd have problems doing so, which is why I quoted it in full. Christ was asked who one's neighbor is.

It wasn't the robbers. It wasn't the priest. It wasn't the levite. It was the Samaritan, precisely because the Samaritan treated him with kindness.

The point I'm making is that Christ's commands, going by the Bible, are not self-sacrificial to an extreme. We are called to love ourselves, and to love our neighbor as ourselves, with love for God being primary. Our neighbor is not 'everyone', and it's not that we're supposed to be constantly sacrificing ourselves for the sake of others, engaging in a kind of self-immolation. That it's better for us to self-sacrifice in some particular situations does not mean we're called to, as a rule, forever forget our own needs and wants for others.

Obviously, this doesn't mean we're selfish. But it means we account for our own needs as well. I think all these things speak against what you were outlining with regards to the Republicans, at least broadly.

2870	"&gt; Because no matter what we do we can't improve the situation much. Our modern lifestyle is extremely taxing on the environment and no matter what, we cannot change it.

What is your basis for this? The modern climate catastrophe is caused by unsustainable emissions of greenhouse gases. If we reduce our gaseous emissions then the change will slow as well. If we reduce our emissions below net zero then some of the changes will be reversed. We have much of the technology and understanding required to reduce our emissions, and fair prospects of developing more of both in the near future---especially if we invest further into research and sustainable technology.

The problem isn't, and has never been, 'mobile phones, air conditioners, and gadgets'. The problem is a numbers game that we know how to play. The challenge is playing it better than we are now and playing it cooperatively.

&gt; No one will stop consuming electricity. And to meet the needs of modern lifestyle, we need oil since solar power, wind energy and other renewables aren't that efficient and reliable.

We've no need for 100% renewable or carbon neutral power generation. We just need enough sequestration to offset emissions. This is as easy as planting trees, in the base case, or using [more sophisticated methods that we're already developing](https://qz.com/1638096/the-story-behind-the-worlds-first-large-direct-air-capture-plant/).

&gt; And talking to these countries about climate change is like teaching Quantum Mechanics to ants

This is a gross overstatement. China and India have more increasingly towards planned energy sectors. Planned energy sectors are the easiest to make carbon neutral. China and India are ripe to move towards sustainable development but, as everyone knows, the best form of sustainable development requires cooperation and integrated strategies (e.g. California and Ontario's late carbon credit scheme).

2876	"My dear interlocutor, your concerns about involuntary hospitalization are understandable. But I would argue that your critique is missing the underlying problem with our current system of mental health care.

The real problem with involuntary hospitalization is not that it is inherently dehumanizing or that it creates a sense of subservience. Rather, the problem is that it is symptomatic of a larger social and political system that marginalizes and stigmatizes individuals with mental health issues.

Our society tends to view mental health issues as a personal failing, rather than a legitimate medical condition. This leads to a lack of funding for mental health care, a shortage of mental health professionals, and a lack of awareness about the complexities of mental health issues. As a result, individuals with mental health issues often fall through the cracks, and involuntary hospitalization becomes one of the few options available to them.

Furthermore, the issue of consent is a tricky one. While it is true that individuals may be held involuntarily even if they are stable, the reality is that mental health issues can be unpredictable and difficult to manage. In some cases, individuals may believe that they are stable, but they may still pose a danger to themselves or others. In these cases, involuntary hospitalization may be necessary to protect them and the community.

so TL;DR:
The problem with involuntary hospitalization is not that it is inherently dehumanizing or that it creates a sense of subservience. Rather, it is a symptom of a larger problem in our society: the stigmatization and marginalization of individuals with mental health issues. We must work to address this problem by increasing funding for mental health care, promoting awareness and understanding of mental health issues, and advocating for the rights and dignity of individuals with mental health issues."	14	['may be held']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['may be held']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	41910999486	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11629h0/_/j94q666/	2247431796	41910937457.0	2023-02-19 03:40:59	15930590.0	ziggylott	3	False	299	0	False	True	41.29

2898	"&gt; There is really no rational reason for why you should go for anything lower than 97. Because at 96 you're already in the best case scenario (98) below what you'd get if you'd go for 99 and the other person is also a dick and also going for 99. Of course you could proceed applying that simple algorithm, but it's no longer rational to do so. Unless one of the aforementioned conditions is met, which are not part of the scenario.

OK, let's use your strategy and see how well it works out in a thought experiment. You start with your strategy, and I will respond with mine.

But first, note one critical assumption: We each try to maximize our payout. This means every dollar is significant—e.g., both of us would *always* prefer to win X dollars to X-1 dollars. Behavioral economics disputes this assumption, but that dispute is outside the scope of the game theory model, which assumes rational agents.

So, anyway, given this assumption of maximizing payouts and further given your starting strategy of offering at least $97, here are the possible results of offers I could make:

| me / you |   $100   |    $99   |    $98   |    $97   |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **$100** |   $100   |    $97   |    $96   |    $95   |
|  **$99** |   $101   |    $99   |    $96   |    $95   |
|  **$98** |   $100   |   $100   |    $98   |    $95   |
|  **$97** |    $99   |    $99   |    $99   |    $97   |
|  **$96** |    $98   |    $98   |    $98   |    $98   |
|  **$95** |    $97   |    $97   |    $97   |    $97   |
|  **$94** |    $96   |    $96   |    $96   |    $96   |

Note, the rows reflect my choice, the columns reflect yours, and the main-body cells reflect my payout. For example, if I offer $98 and you offer $99, then go down to the $98 row and over to the $99 column, and we see my payout is $100. Your payout is meaningless to me.

That said, what should I offer? Well, to start, from my perspective, your choice is random because I lack information about what you'll do (other than offering at least $97), so I must consider the possibility of achieving any of the listed results in a given row when making that offer. So let's see what offers *don't* make rational sense.

Straightaway, I can eliminate $95 and all lesser values because those values are all worse for me than offering $96. But beyond that, no other offer can be eliminated. For example, $99 has the best best case, but it's tied for having the worst worst case. Meanwhile, $97 has the best worst case, but it has a worse best case than all other remaining offers, except $96. And $96 stands because it has the best worst case of all of them.

So I must arbitrarily choose an offer between $96 and $100. I could flip a coin or use personal judgment, but, from your perspective, my choice is random, just like how your choice appears random to me.

If we were to stop here, then we would be in good shape and would make some cash. Unfortunately, we're both rational agents seeking to maximize every last dollar, and you're thusly motivated to go through the same logic I just did and come to the same conclusion I just came to, which is that I'm going to offer a value between $96 and $100. Does this new reasoning give you sufficient cause to update your strategy? Let's consult your updated table.

| you / me |  $100  |  $99  |  $98  |  $97  |  $96  |
|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **$100** |  $100  |  $97  |  $96  |  $95  |  $94  |
|  **$99** |  $101  |  $99  |  $96  |  $95  |  $94  |
|  **$98** |  $100  | $100  |  $98  |  $95  |  $94  |

|  **$94** |   $96  |  $96  |  $96  |  $96  |  $96  |

(Notice the rows and columns are flipped and your choice is now the rows and mine the columns.)

You run through the same logic process as I did but with your numbers. You eliminate $94 straightaway and are left with possible offers ranging from $95 to $100, with each offer having at least one advantage to each other offer. So, yes, you do have reason to update your strategy. You revise your strategy to offer at least $95.

If we stopped here then we would still be in good shape, but, of course, I'm motivated to go after every last dollar. I too go through the same logic process, again, with the new numbers, and revise my strategy again.

| me / you |  $100  |  $99  |  $98  |  $97  |  $96  |  $95  |
|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **$100** |  $100  |  $97  |  $96  |  $95  |  $94  |  $93  |
|  **$99** |  $101  |  $99  |  $96  |  $95  |  $94  |  $93  |
|  **$98** |  $100  | $100  |  $98  |  $95  |  $94  |  $93  |
|  **$97** |   $99  |  $99  |  $99  |  $97  |  $94  |  $93  |
|  **$96** |   $98  |  $98  |  $98  |  $98  |  $96  |  $93  |
|  **$95** |   $97  |  $97  |  $97  |  $97  |  $97  |  $95  |
|  **$94** |   $96  |  $96  |  $96  |  $96  |  $96  |  $96  |
|  **$93** |   $95  |  $95  |  $95  |  $95  |  $95  |  $95  |

I eliminate $93 but keep all other remaining values, and my offering now ranges from $94 to $100. Now it's your turn to update your strategy, which you'll do, and so on, down we go, back and forth, all the way to $2.

It turns out any strategy you come up will lead to the same result—i.e., the Nash equilibrium—of both of us offering $2.

If you dispute this result, then you're disputing the assumptions of the model. Again, yes, this is what behavioral economics does, and that field has produced loads of empirical results showing that people are not always the money-grubbing automatons that game theory portrays them as. But as measured by game theory's own values, yes, the $2 equilibrium is correct.

**Back to the bigger picture**

You're correct to compare the traveler's dilemma to the prisoner's dilemma. Both produce perverse results as a consequence of failure to cooperate, whereas cooperation would have produced the best or near-best result for everyone. Both scenarios stack the deck against both players, giving them rational reason to cut the other player's throat.

You might be tempted to say something like, _No, no, I wouldn't revise my strategy. I would stick with my high offer. I might lose a few dollars as compared to the other player, but who cares? I end up winning more in the end than I do by being “rational.”_ It would be nice and very human of you to think this—and most people would, yes, this has been experimented on—but your thought would dispute the core assumption of the game that each player rationally chases every last dollar. Perhaps it helps to think of it this way: rational ≠ smart, irrational ≠ stupid. Instead, rational means something along the lines of: follows the rules of the game to a tee, cannot see the forest for the trees and go outside the system to shortcut to a better result.

&gt; No, I'm not but you're close to getting a delta if you can prove to me that it's not actually economists trying to research game theory but only psychologists doing so. However given the Wikipedia article I'd say it's not the case and that they actually did not understand their scenario, game theory and the implications of that. 

Hmm, I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. There are loads of people who take game theory and try to apply it to real life, and there are loads of people, like you, who think game theory poorly represents real life. I'm not an economist, but my understanding is that the _rational agent_ assumption is still common in mainstream microeconomics. Behavioral economics, despite its name, was started by psychologists, basically taking common economic models and turning them on their head. I have no idea what the standing of behavioral economics is to the mainstream, though if someone like me has heard about it then it can't be too unpopular.

My opinion is there's value in knowing both systems. As part of my day job, I deal with rational agents and must design systems around them. The kind of abstract thinking that goes into game theory is important for me to do my job. But when dealing with people, especially as individuals, I prefer empiricism to theoretical models."	67	"['is met', 'can be eliminated', ""'s tied"", 'are flipped', 'are left', ""measured by game theory's own values"", 'might be tempted', 'has been experimented', 'was started']"	9	9	0.13432835820895522	1	"[""measured by game theory's own values"", 'was started by']"	2	2	0.029850746268656716	1	"['is met', 'can be eliminated', ""'s tied"", 'are flipped', 'are left', 'might be tempted', 'has been experimented']"	7	7	0.1044776119402985	1	32486445586	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/crluzx/_/ex9l9ua/	771963693	32485294294.0	2019-08-17 22:09:17	263752793657.0	argumentumadreddit	5	False	1508	2	False	True	66.67

It depends. I don't know how picky you are. But let's say your friends are tired of not being able to eat very popular, mainstream cuisines when in your company. That could lead to you simply being left out as people naturally eat different foods.

There could be real health concerns. Some people only really eat fast food. That, obviously, is a horrible thing for them in the long run.

It could have real implications on your dating life as accommodating your gastronomic limitations could be tiring for a partner.

2904	"If anyone says anything is impossible that does not defy the laws of physics, they are more likely to be wrong than right, given near infinite time.

The reason I'm taking this stance is not because I think it's impossible to develop a 'general intelligence' that is independent of the need for human guidance and operates on its own principles. I'm saying it because I can't see any need or market force that would bring this about.

Human brains have about one exaflop of processing power (10^(18) calculations per second), about the amount produced by the fastest supercomputers in the world as of last year; and yet my home computer can already do a *shitload* of tasks infinitely more quickly than a human brain, because (as long as you have a decent idea what it is you're trying to do), bounded problems are much easier to optimize for.

If you conceptualize future-state AI as a super-intelligent person, you're envisioning a neat, but incredibly inefficient, AI end-state. Why would you develop a general intelligence of immense power that will take 30 years to be as good at *being* a general intelligence as the average human being already is?

Which is why research is being funneled into *specific* applications, and *interface* applications. Make an AI that is exceptionally good at driving a car; make another AI that is exceptionally good at maintaining a comfortable temperature in your house; make another AI that is very good at playing music you like; make another AI that is exceptionally good at raising decisions from the 10,000 AIs working on your behalf to you based on its learned understanding of your preferences for control.

2. The problem with Florida is not the positions the people hold, it is about the people who vote. Florida has a higher registered number of Democrats than Republicans, the problem is old people come here from out of state, retire, and vote.

2911	"&gt; I see where you're getting at. Big Brother making all the decisions, ignoring the law of supply and demand. 

Indeed, state run economies are not the way to go.

But here:

&gt;But democratic socialism gets around that by the state being owners/co-owners.

Under our current system, employees can use their pay to buy assets / stock in whatever investment they like. 

And it's actually a good idea for them to invest in things *other* than the organization that they work for in order to diversity their investments. That is, if they are given company ownership in lieu of some compensation, then they are *even more* invested in their particular employer, and if their company goes under, they are doubly screwed and at higher risk of destitution.

In contrast, with the money they make, they have more freedom to invest in real estate, other companies, less risky ventures, etc. to help save for retirement.

Regarding this:

&gt; What I mean by this is that they're essentially share-holders, taking a lot of the profit and making it go towards free healthcare, education and infrastructure. 

I'm not sure how employee shareholders would take company profits and spend them on free healthcare, education and infrastructure.

Seems like a better role for government to provide those things based on tax revenue.

Please note, I'm not arguing against higher quality social supports, but it would seem like those should be provided by governments (that have some accountability to the people through voting) then through some sort of worker / co-ownership somehow leading to free healthcare system.

&gt; You're thinking that I support a command economy. Rather, I take the view the state mostly plays the role of a share-holder by taking a lot of the profit from major businesses, while small businesses remain free from state control. What say the state does is in the best interest of the community such as the movement of factories/jobs. 

Sound to me like what you're describing could just fall under higher taxation of large businesses.

If the state becomes a shareholder directly, that creates perverse incentives for the government to do things like prop up certain industries, bail them out, and try to engage in anti-free trade protectionist policies to support the government's ""investments"". 

That would destroy huge value for consumers and economies worldwide.

Consider that we can have far better supports under capitalism than the U.S. currently does - but the models are already out there in practice happening in other capitalistic countries, and don't require a rejection of capitalism, state ownership, or worker ownership (which can make workers more tied / vulnerable to the fate of their employer)."	20	['are given', 'should be provided']	2	2	0.1	1	['should be provided by']	1	1	0.05	1	['are given']	1	1	0.05	1	35879116974	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/km9kak/_/ghdhzu6/	1246721276	35879076836.0	2020-12-29 05:54:20	49737010.0	thethoughtexperiment	1	False	442	4	False	True	58.72

- create more value. Like inventing new stuff (apple). Or create a more efficient form of organisation (Ford). Or be the first to answer to a need. Or training until you are so good at something people will want to hire you whatever the price.

Buuuut it's difficult. It take time. It takes intelligence. It take skill. It take money.

The second way, way easier, is to take this wealth from other. It can take several form. You can associate with other people in cartel, to increase the price. 

You can use your money to get the monopole in some area and use it to lower wage (walmart) or, again, increase the price (what nestlé do in africa with water).

You can scam desperate people to push them to give you all their money (evangelist)

You can profit from uneducated people to make them sign up predatory contract/debt. With enough jargon and fine print that they won't realize what they sign for. 

Or just fuck with their contract and use your army of lawyer to intimidate them if they protest (when you are uneducated and lzck the money to get juridic advice, law is as scary as a knife)

And this one is really easy to do. Really. I'm a rzndom by i personally see at least 3 things that would garantee me more money if i decided to just ignore ethic.

Now the problem is, in a purely capitalist system, money give you worth. Money give you any pleasure you could want. Money give you sex. Money give you a family with procreation for someone else, money give you life as you can litteraly buy organs. And if money give you all that, money will give you friend and love too.

Infortunately, no money will suck. But you are right when you say inequality by themself are not a problem, as long as the poor live well.

No, the problem is...well the majority of people wanting to get rich won't follow the first solution. But the second. It's easier.

And all these people wanting to excract a maximum of money from a maximum of people will have big consequencis.

Take the healthcare in US:
- university ruler want a lot of money, so they put high price. They don't care they know you need this degree

- bank want a lot of money, and know you need this loan. So they will use big interest rare

-&gt; so phycisian who get their degree are hugely indebted. So the phycisian are fewer (it's an huge bet) and their price are expensive.

-&gt; maybe due to their expensive price,  or mayve to get rich, people tend to sue. Which mean phycisian, or at least hospital, need a big lawyer team and a lot of procedure

-&gt; it lead to the phycisian price to increase even more.

-&gt; people don't seek a medical exam for little problem, because medecine is expensive (and you just discovered it wasn't covered by your insurance

-&gt; the little problem grow, they finish in a pity state and can't work anymore. Society just lost a worker. 

- but it's ok because you can replace it with immigrant (if you are rich enough). Until the day you can't. Because the immigrant country developped, because they know how finish the people they send, because of a pandemic.

It's what happened in US. The covid did a massive strike into an already sick population, throwing them out of work, and because border closing they couldn't make more people come.

The incentive of bank, doctor and university to get more money indirectly led to a workforce crisis fucking everybody.

At the end worker paid an heavy price. Little company paid an heavy price. Corporation won a lot, but mainly because they scavenged the body of the other company.

Capitalism by itself is not a problem. If more food mean more money people will work the field to produce more. 

But if you give SO much importance to money, and almost no rule, people won't work harder. They will throw salt into the neighbourg's firld to become the only food supplier and become wealthy. 

This is why equality is important. To avoid a ""more money no matter what"" situation and ensure most farmer survive and continue to produce.

This is why regulation are important too.

2917	"&gt; To be fair, ""privilege"" and ""advantage"" are synonymous. 

People put far too much stock in the concept of Synonyms; Thesauri are dangerous because a word having the same or similar denotation is *not sufficient* to treat them as interchangeable.  For example, ""Cunt"" and ""Vagina"" are likewise synonymous, but that doesn't mean they are interchangeable, nor that there will be no change in listener response when you choose one or the other.

&gt; if were behind the messaging

You are.  You are behind your own messaging, and you can start pushing for that change *right now* if you choose.  

Since anyone who is concerned with the concept of Privilege is trying to change the world for the better, I think that any such person *should* so choose.

&gt; Honestly, I don't agree with that. I take it as its more literal definition 

And if you were the only person involved in the communication, that would be sufficient.  

In reality, however, you *see* that people are reacting to it in the way I described.

Given that empirical data, are you going to hang out on your wall, complaining about how nobody is helping you down, or are you going to *cooperate* with your listeners?

&gt;I am blaming the listener on his/her lack of willingness to take a few moments to think it over. 

And *I* am blaming *you* for having attacked them in the first place, then irrationally complaining that they prioritize *self defense* over cooperating with someone who *attacks them.*

&gt; In other words, I don't think that it's a clear cut example of how bad the phrase is. 

You don't *need* to know *how* bad it is to know that it *is* bad.  

And you *just* conceded that point, when you pointed out that your friends on social media react as though they are attacked.

I'm not saying it's up there with the N word or the K word or any such *obvious* epithets... but it's *still* a counterproductive term.

&gt; we'd still see the same defensiveness. 

Perhaps, but at least then there would be cognitive dissonance that you could leverage.

Would there still be racists that say ""No they don't!""  Of course (sadly).  However, that is not the question.

The question is whether there would be *good* people derailing the discussion with ""All lives matter""?  


Even if a change in terminology *did* result in fewer people helping you (which I *seriously* doubt), so long as a greater number of people *stop pushing back* that is a win, and gets you closer to changing the world for the better.

&gt; need to reevaluate our reaction to the term ""privilege,"" 

***NO.***

If the problem is ""our reaction to the term"" then *change the term.*

If I were to call you a fool (I'm not, BTW), and that were to make you upset (a perfectly reasonable reaction to an insult), it wouldn't be reasonable for me to demand you think about what I *actually* mean by that, the most reasonable thing to do would be to ask me to not call you a fool.

&gt; But I disagree that ""white advantage"" would be any different

Are you *quite* certain about that?  Are you sure this isn't just an unconscious desire to not ""lose"" this argument?

I ask because earlier you said: 

&gt; I will concede that if were behind the messaging, I would probably chose ""advantage"" over ""privilege.""

That means that you believe that it *might* be different, and that that difference would be of benefit.

You've conceded that point already, and it looks like now you're just trying to save face.  I *totally* get that, and am guilty of it myself sometimes, but... I'm pretty sure that is what's going on here.  You're defending a point you've already conceded because you don't want to acknowledge that your previous position doesn't make as much sense.  You're here in CMV, which marks you as someone who is more open minded than the average bear, so run with that.

&gt; we could further the dialogue if we simply took a few moments to think before we react. 

Except that reactions are *inherently* instantaneous.   You know this. You've seen [those pictures of people before &amp; after being told they're beautiful,](https://fstoppers.com/documentary/photographer-captures-peoples-reactions-when-told-they-are-beautiful-102444) yes? Do those people *think* before they react?  Or do they smile immediately?  You know the answer to that, even before you watch the video in that link.

*That* is the neural process you're asking people to preempt.  It is *never* going to happen, because by the time they consciously *think* about their reactions, it's already too late.  It would be like asking someone to not fight back when someone throws a right cross.  Is it possible? Sure, but the damage (real and metaphorical) has already been done.

---

But again, why are you putting ***ALL*** of the onus on the *listener* for miscommunication?

Why do you tell people to think before they react, but you aren't admonishing people to think before they *speak?*  If they have a defensive reaction that they need to override, doesn't that presuppose that there is an attack that they are reacting *to?*

Further, why do you believe that someone who *has an advantage* is going to choose to put forth the effort to *ignore an attack* in order to change things that rarely impact them, and almost never impact them negatively?

If white folk don't do anything, they neither lose nor gain anything, so, independent of what they *should* do, what to you believe most *will* do?

On the other side of the coin, those who want the change in society have *nothing* to lose by changing the language, but *do* have an opportunity to gain.


...if nothing else, *that* is itself an attack.  You're demanding something from people who will gain *nothing* from it.

I work in behavioral health research.

Although religion doesn't usually come up in a work setting, I've known several good researchers who attend services at Buddhist temples at least occasionally. I can think of one person who was a Mormon, though she eventually lost her faith. Mostly, I just don't know, but I can't imagine that **none** of the people I've worked with have, for example, believed in heaven and hell.

Also, some of the best colleges have rules which make attending the best high school actually disadvantageous. For example the University of Texas in Austin had (and maybe still has) a rule that they'd only accept applications from kids who were in the top 10% of their graduating class. Even though the worst student at my high school would easily have broken the top 10% at any other school in the region, someone who was only in the top 11% would have been denied in spite of the fact that they were likely among the state's most intelligent.

Honestly, I thought being non-binary was a response to social norms of what a woman or a man should be. 

That is why I was annoyed, because for me when society says ""you cannot/shouldn't/are not allowed to do that cause you're a woman"", the answer should be ""I am a woman and I will do what I want"" (a bit simplified, but that's the idea). 

I thought being non-binary was a way out from that statement above, by responding ""ah well, I'm not a woman, and not a man either"" instead. So it felt to me like going this way means giving up the fight against gender constraints in society, instead of trying to change them/prove them wrong.

The issue that plagued the comfort of 3D glasses is the vergence accommodation conflict, and it has already been fixed in various prototype VR headsets. This will be common among 2nd gen headsets as it's not that difficult to achieve.

&gt; To get the full range of what VR offers, it does require more space. Not all VR games can be played seated.

Yes, but even the space required for standing is not much at all. I've used a headset in a roughly 1x1m space for a couple of years and played a long list of games. Most people will have that space, and in the rare case they don't, can still get plenty of value seated once the library of seated content grows more.

&gt; I don't mean on screen multitasking. I mean I can be in a game while intermittently having coffee and messing with my phone or playing with my dog or whatever with a PC game while still attending to it. 

Today? Fair. Though you have to consider headsets like [this](https://gfycat.com/achingrepentantleafhopper-virtual-reality-oculus-connect-htc-vive-pro). You can see your phone there, or your dog, or another person. In the near to medium term future these will be able to very seamlessly blend any part of reality into the headset, wirelessly, and allow you to say, do some house chores whilst still being in VR if you really wanted to.

Ideally bare hand tracking needs to be available so you can drop the controllers and have your hands free.

&gt; you have to move things around to clear space to play anything involving foot movement, or have a separate space dedicated for it.

VR is an expansive medium. Movies. Are you getting the full experience by watching on BluRay at home compared to watching it in an IMAX? Technically not, but lots of people are fine with this.

Seated content can still be very immersive. Consider for a second the most immersive VR games you've played standing. The immersion will be downgraded next to the next generation of headsets even if you played seated games on the new headset.

&gt; But I don't have that hard of time being immersed in what's going on with a regular screen anyway.

Try something like Hellblade in VR.

Before my 24th birthday last year, I requested to not be forced to go to mass anymore. Because of that, my brother challenged me to a debate so that I can justify my views. Because I lost the debate, I have no justification to not attend mass.

I am **not** forced to attend mass because of some debt. The church does **not** expect me to repay them. However, I offered to repay because I was losing the debate and I was grasping at straws. I am simply so desperate to find an excuse to not be forced to go to mass that I'd offer to repay the church, an offer which my brother rejected.

One final note. You may be getting the impression that I am bitter, angry and resentful. That impression would be 100% correct. But I don't want to be bitter, angry and resentful. I want to be able to feel a positive feeling around the church because they helped me. I want to destroy my antipathy against the church because it created a rift in my family. Problem is, being forced to go to mass makes me bitter, angry and resentful, but my brother completely rejects this excuse."	21	"[""'re being forced"", 'be repaid', 'be repaid', 'is flooded', 'be forced', '* forced', 'be forced', 'being forced']"	8	7	0.3333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'re being forced"", 'be repaid', 'be repaid', 'is flooded', 'be forced', '* forced', 'be forced', 'being forced']"	8	7	0.3333333333333333	1	36467722713	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/m626e7/_/gr3xuxl/	1340435167	36467661861.0	2021-03-16 08:46:48	274620012812.0	Real_Carl_Ramirez	1	False	307	3	False	True	74.9

2943	"&gt;they do make it clear that anger, hatred, aggression, and impatience are to be stamped out in Jedi

Again I wouldn't really go so far as they are to be ""stamped out"". Lets go back to the vulcan argument.  You cannot expect a jedi to NOT have these emotions. The primary focus is their ""Control"" of them
 The force is harmonious in nature (its in the code), thus being ruled and corrupted by Anger is against the Jedi way, as it is a corruption of the harmony of a person,
 as the dark side is a corruption of the force.  Feeling Anger at all isn't really against the code, its rather a byproduct of being alive.
 
 &gt;Anakin is swiftly and firmly rebuked for his impatience with the Jedi Council
 
 And Anakin was continually showed to be brash, acting and making decisions out of emotion.  He was driven by his emotion, rather than just experiencing emotion.  Jedi were able to sense the corruption within him.
 
 &gt;The more usual message is that they should be used for good. In this way the Jedi are a break from other philosophers of emotion.
 
 Here is where things get interesting.  A Jedi isn't really called to be ""good"" but rather are diametrically opposed to a corruption that most people would consider ""evil""
 Similarly though it is theoretically possible for there to be a ""good"" Sith, the qualities that differentiate a Sith from a Jedi ""Passion, strength, power, victory"" lead to many instances of what we would consider ""evil""
 
 &gt;What I claim is that the example set by old Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, Yoda, and the treatment of Anakin make clear that anger and aggression in a Jedi are
 unacceptable
 
 Again I think this is more a ""control"" of anger.  And aggression does not apply IMO, can't someone be ""aggressively Good"" or ""conservatively evil"".  I think you are speaking of instances of instigation, or provokation,
 Which as I addressed in my OP, agree these are instances against the way of the Jedi. The force is used in defence, not in instigation.
 
 &gt;It was only in conflict to this Jedi way that Obi-Wan defeated Darth Maul.
 
 Here's where things get interesting.  You can actually look at this several ways
 
  1. Obi Wan only really beat Maul when he WAS in accordance to the Jedi code and devoid of emotion.  As you said earlier his emotion got him caught of guard by the force attack of Maul.  Only when he was hanging for deal life was he able to 
  forget the emotion of Qui-Gon's death, and focus on the fight at hand.
  
  2. (The opinion I tend to hold) Obi-Wan DID experience emotion through the death of Qui-Gon, Duh. And this emotion DID give him an advantage. However he was in accordance to the code because he was controlling,
  or at least attempting to control it.  If he was really in out of control rage or anger, wouldn't he exhibit more symptoms of this such as: Uncontrollable Shaking, Yelling, Crying, excessive use of energy, heavy breathing, 
  a disregard for saftey etc.?  Having a furrowed brow during a fight to the death hardly seams out of control.  Interestingly we have seen several instances where a Jedi who is a master of his emotion are more powerful than 
  those who have no emotion at all.  (redeemed) Revan and the previously mentioned Windu are perfect examples of this.  I think it entirely possible that Obi-Wan's ability to control his tremendous emotion gave him a better chance
  in an impossible fight against Maul.  Saying you can't feel emotion in a fight to the death seems like an impossible code, but rather that his emotion did not break the harmony of the force seems reasonable.

  3. Obi-Wan Gave into his emotions, enough to give into the dark side to overcome Maul.  This would be against the Jedi code, as the Jedi code stresses the harmony in the force (emotion), which is effectively anything that is NOT the dark side. 
  I don't buy this just for the reason that we have seen several instances where an emotionally driven character also gets crushed, Notably the fights Anakin lost, despite him being very talented.
  If giving into emotion and going to the dark side REALLY makes you stronger, why was Anakin so routinely defeated? Similarly if giving into emotion is a sure sign of the dark side, couldn't you make the argument that a cool
  calm collected Darth Maul WAS in accordance to the Jedi Code? (Look at the fights, Maul really takes defensive posture, even vs a more aggressive Qui-Gon)"	36	"['be stamped', 'being ruled', 'was continually showed', 'was driven', 'should be used', ""isn't really called"", 'are diametrically opposed', 'is used', 'gets crushed']"	9	8	0.2222222222222222	1	['was driven by']	1	1	0.027777777777777776	1	"['be stamped', 'being ruled', 'was continually showed', 'should be used', ""isn't really called"", 'are diametrically opposed', 'is used', 'gets crushed']"	8	7	0.19444444444444445	1	28165645752	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3w11es/_/cxt3jco/	235194724	28164792772.0	2015-12-09 16:38:30		SiliconDiver	1	False	763	5	False	True	66.88

2951	"I'm only going to address point 2 here, and address it more broadly - not her affiliation with PoP but her views on her faith and its role in the law.

In 1998, Ms. Barrett co-authored a paper entitled [_Catholic Judges in Capital Cases_](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=061081024013113030078023119013110014032053053031010004101021099030127028026095072124054054025045018036026022076122094118112102046012077044100022005070096094019067023036025095019079068021007077103069127087101088104009024091107127072030016030027025&amp;EXT=pdf).  In that paper, she explores how a devout person must reconcile their religious beliefs with the law when the two are in conflict.  While the paper is an interesting read, her conclusion is basically as follow:

&gt;...[w]e believe that Catholic judges ... are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty.  This means  that they can neither themselves sentence criminals to death nor enforce jury recommendations of death...

&gt;...Judges cannot - nor should they try to - align our legal system with the Church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge. They should, however, conform their own behavior to the Church's standard

She goes on in that same paper to say that even though her religious convictions would prevent them from enforcing a jury recommendation, any motion to remove a Catholic judge should be denied (for various reasons).

Now, taking your opinion of the death penalty off the table here, Ms. Barrett is basically saying that when her personal moral convictions are in conflict with the law, her personal moral convictions take precedent.  She flat out says that even if a sentence has been handed down by a jury in accordance with the law of the land (as juries often do hand down death penalty sentences), she must overturn said sentence not based on the law, but based solely on her personal religious convictions.  Moreover, she continues to say that the judge should not be forced to recuse themselves from such cases, even though their religious conviction prevents them from faithfully (no pun intended) interpreting and enforcing the law.  She basically says that a judge should ignore the law if their religion requires it, and no one should be able to request they be replaced, despite knowing that they will not faithfully execute the law.

Unless she has dramatically changed her tune in the last two decades, this should be a disqualifying statement for _any_ judge.  The Constitution is the highest law in the land, not the Bible and while I do not begrudge Ms. Barrett her faith, as a SCOTUS justice, the Constitution and the law must trump personal moral convictions.  It is not the role of a justice to dispense morality from the bench, but rather to provide clarity in understanding of law, free from any religious bias."	14	['are morally precluded', 'should be denied', 'has been handed', 'be forced', 'be replaced']	5	5	0.35714285714285715	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are morally precluded', 'should be denied', 'has been handed', 'be forced', 'be replaced']	5	5	0.35714285714285715	1	35244012321	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j0vmmf/_/g6vdhy9/	1150332999		2020-09-27 15:17:18	21491549.0	Ansuz07	22	False	422	2	True	True	57.61

It is a bit suspicious, but I don't believe that Kiev would have allowed for a referendum without some sort of foreign intervention. Nevertheless, I think Russia's actions were too aggressive -- they should have sought more peaceful ways to urge independence.

2960	"&gt; Which is not within their legal nor ethical power or authority to do so.

It doesn't change the fact that they have the power to do it. Whether or not the action is justified is not the question, it's whether or not they have the power. They are in a position of extreme power over the child. I.e, they are an authority over the child. What this justifies is another discussion entirely.

&gt; And do you consider it unethical for a corrections officer to use physical means or violence against an unwilling or threatening inmate?

[Non-aggression principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle). If the inmate was using violence, coercion, intimidation, etc. than it is justified. If he was not, it is unjustified. For the same reason, spanking a child that is not initiating force against anyone is wrong.

&gt; It's important to point out that the sort of violence you would use against me to defend against rape is radically different than what is used in disciplinary spanking; not all violence is equal and the same degree, and each can have different scenarios where they're justified.

I mostly disagree and where I do agree it's not relevant. Violence having different types and not being equal does not equate with some violence being justifiable. That is an assertion, not an argument. Furthermore, if you want this to be rational, you need a standard that can be applied to determine when it's justified and when it isn't. My standard is the non-aggression principle, as I referenced earlier. I aim to apply it consistently. What is your standard for determining what is morally and ethically acceptable?

&gt; Would you then consider it wrong if a parent attempted to explain to their child the wrongness of their actions first and then spanked them if the child kept repeating such behavior—all the while still trying to explain it to them?

Yes, never at any point did the child initiate force against the parent. It is wrong for the same reasons that it would be wrong for the parent to spank their friend or their coworker. The moral thing for the parent to do is to reason and negotiate with the child.

&gt; That would depend on the extent of the disability and whether or not the individual can learn from whatever behavior that is unacceptable.

How does their ability to learn whether or not a behavior is unacceptable or not affect the morality of the action when the action is performed? If a child is unable to learn ethics because of their current stage of development and so is a mentally disabled person, why is there a different standard applied to each of them in order to determine whether or not hitting them is acceptable?"	24	['is justified', 'is justified', 'is used', 'can be applied', 'is performed', 'standard applied']	6	6	0.25	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is justified', 'is justified', 'is used', 'can be applied', 'is performed', 'standard applied']	6	6	0.25	1	26890206412	5	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1o6gd7/_/ccpqg24/	101078107	26890132205.0	2013-10-11 15:41:18		Moriartis	2	False	456	5	True	True	62.17

I respond badly to being told that my success was given to me and not earned.

I accept your point that social justice is not the driving force behind corporations embracing diversity initiatives. I think that a fear of being shamed for only having white male employees was a greater motivator, however I think that ultimately those same corporations will realise a financial benefit from employing a more diverse workforce.

Absolutely I am generalising a bit. There are real-world (rare) examples of girls and boys who did not experience the gender stereotyping that I have outlined above, however it is true that in western countries where diversity initiatives are employed, these stereotypes exist and are widely pervasive. I'm not sure what data exists regarding the correlation between non-gender stereotyping childhoods and non-gender stereotypical occupations, but I wouldn't be surprised if such a correlation exists, and if it did, you would be right to point out that that would water down the legitimacy of diversity initiatives that I have proposed. I would argue that whilst there may be such cases, these would not be all that cases, and on balance these initiatives still produce an overall outcome of correcting for the adversity minorities experience."	10	['be told', 'being told', 'was given', 'being shamed', 'are employed']	5	4	0.4	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be told', 'being told', 'was given', 'being shamed', 'are employed']	5	4	0.4	1	32309522549	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cfr9qn/_/euc975h/	752060687	32309416028.0	2019-07-20 21:22:31	56556369.0	MoFauxTofu	1	False	292	0	False	True	41.84

Unfortunately I am going to have to bite on that, I'm just 'that person', you know, the crazy one in the background.

* **Requiring** cars to be sold with working seatbelts and airbags, and requiring crash tests so consumers can make an informed choice.

[Emphasis mine]. No, my rationale being the stated one. I know that's not going to be enough, so I'll elaborate. Under my odd definition, buying a car with seatbelts is not a right. Selling a car with or without seatbelts is, and so is buying one. The counterargument for this (as detailed at the bottom of your post) is that market forces are not guaranteed to provide all the safe/good/merit/quality products. My counterargument is merely *so what*. I do not even to pretend to deny this kind of government regulation makes this easier, and perhaps 'better' from my subjective view, but nor do I want to *enforce* this on both sellers and buyers (sellers benefiting from reduced requirements, buyers benefiting from reduced prices/different selection). If that makes cars with all the safety features more expensive/less available, then that is a problem, but not one I believe is within the scope of government.

All your other statements listed are like this, so I'm not going to reply to each one as other posters have been left unanswered, I will merely jump to the relevant end of your post:

&gt;This way, if a town wants to tell Comcast ""Sure you can build but you have to cover the poor neighborhoods also"", then a new ISP could simply opt in to that deal and say ""We'll build and we'll cover the poor neighborhoods and we'll pay what Comcast pays"".

&gt; **THAT ALL SAID**, this is probably never going to happen. The local systems will fight back with everything they've got and it will be very hard to ram it through Congress.

Even if I accept your premise, I think it's rather silly (kind of subjective I suppose) to fix a problem that arises from local regulation with more regulation. That means more rights lost for the same benefit as the stated win-win (which may be 'never going to happen', but the fault still lies in the existing regulation, not the lack of additional regulation).

2970	"There are a few asymmetries at play here that get in the way of the hypocrisy charge. First, as others have said, there is symmetry, where you can do what you want and they can do what they want, and nothing is mandating 2 weeks.

But in terms of norms, the reason is that if you are leaving the company, its often because you found a different job and *don't want* to burn your bridges. If your old company treated you well, but you just are looking to move on for some reason, why wouldn't you want to ""be professional"" so that if you encounter your previous employers / coworkers again in the future, they have a favorable view of you. But look at it from the flip-side, and there's a clear asymmetry here. If your company is *firing* you, they are already knowingly and intentionally burning the bridge. They don't *want* to work with you. The exception here is if its a different kind of termination that's not performance based, such as unwanted layoffs or just a change in direction of the company, but in those cases, a good company usually *will* want to give more notice if possible. So it's only a ""double standard"" in the sense that the two parties actually have different incentives in play.

Another related asymmetry is if you're giving 2 weeks notice out of courtesy with the intention of maintaining those relationships for the future, you have an incentive to continue working at a reasonably high level for those 2 weeks, ensuring a smooth transition and earning that last paycheck or two. If the company *fires* you for poor performance, why would they have any realistic expectation of you actually being productive in those two weeks after they've just fired you? In most cases, it just makes no sense to expect a fired worker to continue to work hard for 2 weeks, and in fact, there's tremendous risk of a disgruntled employee actually using those 2 weeks doing active harm to the company, such as through poor customer service. Any time that the employment is extended out of professionalism or courtesy or whatever, that remaining time still represents an exchange of labor for payment. The employee has legal protections that ensure that if they remain employed they will get the payment, but the company has absolutely no guarantee that they'll continue to get the desired labor just because they provide an extra paycheck, especially if poor performance was the whole reason for the firing!"	14	['is extended']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is extended']	1	1	0.07142857142857142	1	35374085436	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcdlzh/_/g90tf0c/	1169647757		2020-10-16 14:38:36	18604863.0	themcos	144	False	421	0	False	True	49.49
2971	"&gt; In Feudalism, if you fail in investing your capital, for example, when you make your vassal or knights very unhappy, or you fail to be sufficiently efficient to maintain a standing army of necessary size to defend yourself, you will be punished by peasant or knight revolt or conquered by a neighboring landlord. Therefore, you need to scout your human resources and manage your capital wisely as well.

Not necessarily. If you are twice as big and half as efficient as another competitor, you still have an excellent shot of winning. In capitalism, tiny upstarts like Netflix can topple kings like Comcast. There is a lot more room for error and unhappiness.

&gt; In Capitalism, large capital owner only merit is only to find good CEO, or good fund manager, which does not require much merit. However, people with large merit, like very efficient workers, or genius innovators, will be somewhat rewarded, like knights in feudalism, but not as much as the shareholder whose CEO are smart enough to spot them.

The knights in feudalism have only limited room to lead and innovate. Their power requires the help of others. In capitalism, a single person can change society (e.g. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Henry Ford, John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, etc.) They still rely on others, but a larger percentage is based on their personal innovation rather than the ability to exploit others. I'd argue that the capitalists who rely on CEO's and fund managers to build their wealth are the one's who are failing. Many studies have found that most CEO's are overpaid compared to their influence and fund managers are less effective than simply investing in exchange traded funds. Innovators are worth investing in. CEO's and managers are not great. Some of them are cost effective, but to the extent that if you give them $1, they'll give you back $2. It's not like if you give them $1 and they give you back $10 or $100.

&gt; Thank you for the example, I really love it. However, in this case, the ""winner"" are the shareholder who invest in the innovator, not the innovator themselves. It is not a meritocracy. In the feudal era, the lord also have incentive to spot the best knight and general to work for them.

I picked yogurt because I happened to be eating some when I wrote that message, but here is an example of [a Yogurt capitalist.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/a-windfall-for-chobani-employees-stakes-in-the-company.html) The person who innovates has all the power. Pick any founder of any company. The power (and the largest percentage of the shares) belong to them. In this model, capitalists (or specifically venture capitalists) compete to give the innovator the best deal. In the feudal system, the lord promotes their best peasants to be knights and the best knights to be generals. But they didn't to their competitor's lands and steal their generals. They want the best general, but if they were so popular that they could become a lord too, the lord would try to stop them. In capitalism, the lord would try to give them investments and get in their good graces. I can't find the clip, but on the HBO show Silicon Valley, there is a scene where two billionaires are competing to get the main character/innovator to accept their investment.

&gt; To some extent, both system are meritocratic, an able person could get ahead, though it is easier in capitalism than feudalism. However, in both system as well, merit alone, most of the time, is not enough to make you win, to move up from worker, to capital owner.

I totally agree with this statement. You really have to have significant merit, and there are a lot of barriers to this process. Plenty of capitalist politicians appoint their sons-in-laws to key posts, and plenty of of them give inheritance to their children. But this happens significantly less than in a feudal system when the first born son has full rights over the land when the father dies. In a feudal system, there is absolutely no ability to move up in the ranks unless the lord likes you because you won a war or something. In a capitalist system, a poor person can become rich overnight. Merit alone, most of the time isn't really enough in either system, but it's more valuable in capitalism than in any other system. If that's not enough to distinguish them, than what is their to distinguish capitalism from feudalism from communism from any other economic system. Throughout history, poor people have gotten screwed over by the rich. There has always been a hierarchy. The only difference is that in feudalism, monarchies, communism, etc. they put relatives of the already rich and powerful at the top of the hierarchy. Capitalism does that too, but a little less often. There isn't a lot of room for the poor to advance via merit, but it's exponentially higher in capitalism than in feudalism and other economic systems."	46	['will be punished', 'will be somewhat rewarded', 'are overpaid', 'are cost']	4	4	0.08695652173913043	1	['will be punished by']	1	1	0.021739130434782608	1	['will be somewhat rewarded', 'are overpaid', 'are cost']	3	3	0.06521739130434782	1	29066681664	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5p9a5d/_/dcpjv40/	344754337	29066658956.0	2017-01-21 07:56:34		McKoijion	6	False	828	4	True	True	62.38

2987	"I maintain the above points, although you are making valid ones too. Again, you develop what you use. If you use the right things, and the useful things, then you dvelop your skills in a useful direction, and indeed are able to build on it. 

Writing, for example, draws on numerous other skills, and various experiences and these don't all group into the same thinking at all. A Terry Pratchett novel is very different from a complete history of the Roman empire which in turn is different from a book on how to learn programming which is different from a cookbook which is different from a book on philosophy etc.. I would suggest that it might depend on the skill, because not all skills and experiences you have are necessarily good for your writing skills. It might be quite hard, in fact, to write about anything much besides accounting from behind a computer screen in an accountant's office. 

But that's kind of a risk you have to take. You don't develop from within your comfort zone, you just stagnate. If you learn to acquire new skills for the hell of it, you will naturally draw yourself to skills that fit your mental picture of what matters and what is useful. And as you do so, you'll get good at things that are useful to you. And you'll use them generating a self-perpetuating loop. Or you'll let some of them go, and find that they deteriorate as they're not useful anymore.

3001	"Ok. So one big issue I have with identity politics nowadays is that people try to take one category and shoehorn it. For example, some people believe that minorities will always be more oppressed than whites, although the reality is that a poor white person probably deals with more shit than a rich black. Intersectionality is a way to explain this, by pointing out that the reality is that its a whole bunch of stuff that determines you're quality of life. It does not aim to create a heirarchy of suffering. The ""I am a native american transgender pansexual disabled dragonkin"" stuff is usually just a meme. Everyone expresses their identity on different levels. Some people live in suburban communities where being gay doesn't really matter. Some people live in inner-city neighborhoods where being gay invites violence. Since intersectionality is incredibly complicated and is interpreted differently by different people, its hard to say that it can't be useful.

The criticisms of ""school-to-prison"" pipeline, which are really really harsh punishments dealt out by educational institutions, take into account both poverty and race. That's an example of how intersectionality is useful.

&gt;In this definition of intersectionality, the ultimate outcome is building a victimhood hierarchy. Why is this helpful? Isn't this a form of ""othering"" and actually going against inclusivity?

I hear the ""otherization"" argument a lot from people who want to claim that they don't see race. If someone is a woman she's a woman. If someone is black then he's black. It's really disingenuous to ignore these things, and blaming racism and sexism on the fact that race and sex exist, rather than on the actual racists and sexists themselves is deflection. You can recognize different identities without seeing them as inferior human beings.

&gt;Youth, specifically the teen-young adult age range tend to seek special treatment or want to feel unique, so I can see why they want to have some excuse for their situation being outside of their own control. But this isn't empowering, doesn't help them take ownership of their path.

I subscribe to intersectionality, but I take responsibility for most of my actions because I live in a pretty good community (and I'm at that age range you're talking about). If you're complaining that intersectionality makes people deterministic, then that issue would really be a matter of people misinterpreting intersectionality/identity politics, which does happen sometimes. That isn't an issue with intersectionality itself though. Some people actually do live really shitty lives because of their identity, and its important to recognize it. I don't think that its fair to discount intersectionality just because some over-passionate college students read some articles about it online, because it historically has been very useful in improving conditions for suspect classes."	26	['is interpreted']	1	1	0.038461538461538464	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is interpreted']	1	1	0.038461538461538464	1	29635795663	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6vyeti/_/dm4dya7/	416470662	29635074326.0	2017-08-25 15:55:09		PowershotWu	9	False	457	2	False	True	45.15

The reality is that for most of Western history, a woman's value was inexorably linked to her beauty.  Just about the only think that a woman brought to the table was beauty, so women who were less beautiful were less valuable.  Women internalized this, and even today beauty is a major part of how we evaluate women's worth (just look at all the people who will demean accomplished women by calling them ugly - who cares if a SCOTUS justice is pretty, right?).

These campaigns aren't really trying to tell these women that they are conventionally beautiful - they know that they are not - but rather that these women still have value beyond their physical attractiveness.

* A requirement that any company that provides a public discussion service refrain from discrimination on ideological grounds (the same way that discrimination on racial/sexual/etc grounds is banned)

* A requirement that rules be defined as objectively as possible, with the ability to appeal to some higher power in the event of inconsistent or selective enforcement.

So they starved the patients with some gross shake that has a quarter of the calories a normal person eats and they lost weight. 

&gt;Nutritionists counseled them in person and by phone, promoting regular exercise and urging them to eat more vegetables and less fat. But despite the effort, they slowly began to put on weight

And when they stopped drinking the gross shit, and began eating normally again, without ever recording what they were eating, they gained the weight back. Huge surprise.

Also that second quote of yours is 1 example a person who finds it difficult to keep the weight off, even though none of the things she described are particularly difficult. There's plenty of people who count calories and exercise, permanently, as in not a diet, but a lifestyle.

I don't think it's merely incompetent candidates one should be worried about, but also those which are potentially dangerous. As an extreme example, let's say there's a second Hitler. Even if literally no one votes for them, and they vote for themselves, they now have an actual chance of winning.

This causes a couple of issues, which is (1) the obvious consequences of having someone like this in office, and (2) the fact that this is now a very real possibility, regardless of how many voters mobilize to get rid of them or overcome them, thus potentially incentivizing people to believe their votes matter less than they already do, and consequentially choose not to vote. This leads to the legitimacy of the election being tossed a bit, which again influences perhaps less votes, and also disincentivizes people from taking the politicians seriously once they are in office.

3021	"Tax breaks and tax deductible are two different things. I would not disagree that granting targeted tax breaks to wealthy individuals and companies that invest more of their money in domestic growth could be a good thing, but giving them tax breaks just for the sake of relieving them of financial tax burden really just doesn't give them nearly as much an incentive to spend that money on things that would improve our economy as much as tax breaks for the middle and lower classes would.

The biggest hurdle to our continued economic growth is mostly just that American labor is so much more expensive than Chinese or Taiwanese labor. Almost all of the high-tech manufacturing that's needed for today's newest electronics goes on there because the relative lack of regulation and workforce costs in China and Taiwan makes it so much less expensive to operate there, so companies are spending their profits on manufacturing growth in China and Taiwan instead of here, and all of this money we are spending on these products is going overseas.

We have a HUGE trade deficit with China, in that we are importing less than 1/3 of of the value that we are exporting to them. This wouldn't be such a problem if other countries had a trade deficit with us in turn (which would make our relationship more of a circle to the mutual benefit of everyone in that circle), but this isn't what's happening. We are exporting billions of dollars in wealth to China every year, which is why they so recently experienced such a huge economic explosion.

This trend cannot sustainably be continued, though. The rich are continuing to get wealthier from their foreign investments, while the lower class (whose capital lies mostly in their ability to provide unskilled and manual labor) and the middle class (whose capital lies mostly in their ability to provide professional skilled labor) are finding that the job market is slowly shrinking and drying up. Republicans seem to think that deregulating and shrinking the government to encourage a freer market will help, and it might help to equalize things a little faster, but it won't change America's current course that's quickly leading us away from being the dominant economic superpower that we once were. In fact, we're heading toward an economic meltdown that's going to turn most of America into a poverty-stricken wasteland because pretty soon only the wealthy will be able to afford the cost of living here.

At least now, the economic explosion those other countries have experienced means they will soon have no choice but to also start regulating (hopefully their governments will be able to learn some lessons from us that we had to learn the hard way), which is probably why China's economic growth has started to slow. The fact that we got a head start and are suffering from our need for regulation is what has been putting us at such a disadvantage of late, but a certain amount of regulation and government are always going to be necessary.

3022	"&gt; Would you support either zoos or hunting if applied to humans? For example, if a preliterate rainforest tribe with a low median IQ were being threatened by habitat destruction, would it be okay to kidnap a few of them, put them in cages in major cities, and let people come examine them to promote conservation?

Humans have a great ability to adjust to other environment, so I do not believe such an action would be necessary.  I think in that case the most efficient course of action would be to provide aid to either relocate rainforest tribes or help them adjust to the changing landscape.

&gt; I'm not arguing that animals and humans are identical -- I'm just curious whether you're a strict utilitarian (maximize pleasure and minimize pain, even if we need to violate some autonomy principles) or whether you're operating off a ""speciesist"" frame (autonomy principles are sacred, but apply categorically to homo sapiens and nobody else).

I do think of myself as a utilitarian and a pragmatist foremost.  When it comes to politics I am in general in favor of more coordination at a national scale and less autonomy of state governments.  I do think that some degree of autonomy is important, and that animals are entitled to it, but that autonomy is not the golden goal that some people think it is.  

I am also a bit speciesist, I think the best way to treat every animal the best is to try and get them to fulfill [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs), but the way to fill those needs is different for every species and even has some differences between individuals of one species.  For some, autonomy might be important for filling self-actualization, but for others it is not.  I also believe that as an individual's intelligence is less, their needs for self-actualization become less complex until such point that all they need for self-actualization is to have the baser needs met.

&gt; Also, while hunting in isolated instances might accomplish the ecological goals you mention, PETA's position focuses on sport hunting generally -- they don't assert that there is no such thing as a ""good"" hunter, but rather that [there are better ways to accomplish the population-control goals of hunting](http://www.peta.org/about/faq/Without-hunting-deer-and-other-animals-would-overpopulate-and-die-of-starvation.aspx) , and there is also plenty of ""bad"" hunting, so the existence of hunting is on net a bad thing.

This link asserts that natural predators often take the sick and the weak, and this is true.  But often those weak members of the population that they take are the young which is detrimental to the overall health of a species.  One of the efforts I am involved with is to encourage hunters to only take the old animals that have already contributed their reproductive potential to the population rather than young individuals who have not yet had a chance to reproduce.  

The link goes on to suggest that the best way to reduce population numbers is to reduce fertility, which is laughably impractical.  For a birth control drug it would require catching every individual you wish to not make reproduce, administering a drug, then releasing them (a very stressful process), and then redoing the whole thing in a few years for every individual after the drug wears off.  This can easily hit costs of thousands of dollars per dose per individual, and when you are talking about a population that is in the thousands or millions, there just isn't enough money or manpower in wildlife management right now to make that doable.  Perhaps when better drugs are invented down the line, it might become more practical, but it remains beyond the reach of practicality right now.

The link also suggests the reintroduction of carnivores, which I addressed in my previous post.

&gt; However, humans compete for space with predators in a way that we do not with most prey species. The result is habitat that can effectively support prey species (even more so now that the green movement has encouraged the planting of more parks and greenways), but cannot support the necessary predators for a proper balance.

I would also like to add that we have reintroduced and supported predators where that is a viable option, but predators near population centers quickly become a hazard.  They don't discriminate between what we want them to hunt and what we don't, so they will also go after pets, livestock, refuse, and people if they pose an opportunity.  Coyotes in particular have shown that they are willing to brave human's presence and have become quite dangerous in some areas.

Finally, you say that hunting nets a bad influence on the environment.  [You might be interested to know that hunter contribute](http://www.dnr.state.md.us/centennial/Hunters_and_Conservation.asp) [more money to wildlife](http://www.ducks.org/hunting/du-and-hunting/hunters-do-more-for-wildlife) [conservation than any other group.](http://www.fws.gov/hunting/whatdo.html)  Much of this is through taxes on firearms, and hunting license fees due to the [Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration of 1937](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittman%E2%80%93Robertson_Federal_Aid_in_Wildlife_Restoration_Act).  I would argue that this means hunter provide a net positive influence on the environment.

Edit:  I would like to point out that I do not support poaching.  When I am talking about hunting I am referring to killing specific members of the population in accordance with research done to determine what would be best for the population at that time.  I am currently engaged in trying to discourage hunters from maintaining the ""It's brown, it's down."" mentality, and we are making progress on that front.

Aristotelian democracy: ""Say yea to kill the unwanted!"" ""Yea!""

I'm curious which of those you take as being a good thing or which is a benefit to this country.

&gt;He stood up to NATO for not contributing enough money into their defense costs.

This will become a bit of a theme, I'm guessing, but what actual consequence has this had?  No country sped up its timetable for increasing defense spending, and he has substantially frayed those relationships in the process (even ignoring his statements on potentially not adhered to Article V).

You have a lot of instances where it seems like your appreciation is just for showing resolve, rather than for any substantive changes.

&gt;He put an eye on corrupt and bias media outlets

You recognize that this is only true (or his actions positive) to the extent one agrees with his designations of media as corrupt or biased, right?

To wit: many view Sinclair broadcasting and Fox News to be far more corrupt and biased, which he not only does not ""put an eye on"", he actively supports and endorses.

&gt;put focus on illegal immigration

And did what with it?

So far we're talking about four examples where all you're lauding him for is a symbolic gesture or giving attention to something.  What benefit does ""focus"" on illegal immigration bring if the problem isn't actually being resolved?

&gt;He's created millions of new jobs and brought unemployment down to 3.9%.

If we're going to give presidents credit for the jobs created during their administration, President Obama created 15 million jobs in eight years.  That's about 2 million jobs per year.  Trump has (in two years) created about 3.5 million.

So by that metric, Obama was better.  And Reagan better than either.  And Clinton better than Reagan.

It's...  It's just a bad metric.

&gt;He put a focus on the opiod crisis in the u.s. including the corrupt drug dealing doctors who push them for their own benefit.

And, again, once the focus was ""put"" there, what has he done with it?

About $1 billion were put in place by Obama to fight the opiate crisis.  What is it you think Trump did or has done?

Did he pass a new law?  Put more resources into treatment?  Increase prosecutions of doctors?

&gt;He also put an end to DACA, which in and of itself was unconstitutional amd illegal, even Obama said so before he put it into action, illegally.

I'm willing to bet you a month of gold that you can't find anywhere that Obama stated DACA was unconstitutional and illegal.

And speaking as a lawyer, there is no consensus that what Obama did was anything more questionable than the use of prosecutorial discretion.

&gt;I fully believe that Donald Trump has done more for the betterment of thos country in his two years than any of our last four presidents did in their eight years.

For actual substance, the only thing you gave which is a measurable positive is jobs.  And that's factually false.

3078	" Currently, there’s a whole process of deliberate radicalisation that a person would go through before they “only talk to radical sexists”. Most people at the start of the process are not yet so isolated. This policy would expediate their isolation from general society, making it easier to radicalise. It would also make it harder to leave the vicious social group for those who do have a change of heart. I’m arguing this would worsen an existing problem, not create a whole new one.

In terms of leaving radical beliefs behind due to having some sort of personal connection outside the isolated group and facing challenges to their beliefs in dialogue, it does happen. For example, a former grand dragon of the KKK (also an ex neo-Nazi) publicly renounced his beliefs based on his conversations with Deeyah Khan (a filmmaker of Punjabi/Pashtun descent) and his African-American neighbour. ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-kkk-member-denounces-hate-groups-one-year-after-rallying-n899326](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-kkk-member-denounces-hate-groups-one-year-after-rallying-n899326)) . Here’s another article in which two ex Neo-Nazis talk, among other things, about how actually talking to people of colour forced them to confront the flaws in their ideology [https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/bmpn7q/ex-neo-nazis-explain-whats-driving-the-alt-right](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmpn7q/ex-neo-nazis-explain-whats-driving-the-alt-right). Harald Weilnboeck, the co-chairman of the working group of the Radicalization Awareness Network in Europe, suggests the key to changing a person’s underlying belief system is “that you need to engage in a quite personal -- not private, but quite personal -- relationship-based interaction” ([https://www.rferl.org/a/deradicalizing-violent-extremists-what-works-what-does-not-work/27229417.html](https://www.rferl.org/a/deradicalizing-violent-extremists-what-works-what-does-not-work/27229417.html)). There are many stories of such things happening.

In my first comment, I was primarily focusing on people who had formed the beginning of a sexist opinions who, because they were afraid of legal punishment, wouldn’t feel able to talk through these opinions in general society and would be easy prey for radicalisation.

&gt;Then you're starting to understand where some of the opposition comes from.

Fair enough, but I would think this is a fundamental difference in values, no?

&gt;There's no universal answer to this, but no one is talking about denying anyone access.  Only that the care is paid for by those who need it, and not necessary paid to be covered by those who never will.

Well, the argument we started on was debating:

*""a huge portion of the insured population still not being able to afford needed healthcare""*

The above is the problem that M4A is attempting to solve.  And in essense, you are stating ""too bad.""

There are many people that, barring subsidy or shared cost, would never afford the treatment they need.  To that end, we SHOULD be spreading that cost across the US tax-base through a system like M4A.

If there is an alternative where all people can have equal access to healthcare I would like to hear it.  Maybe there is a better way.

&gt;Right, that's the problem.

3089	"It really all depends on the influencer. ""Ultra popular instagram influencers"" tends to indicate people in fashion or modeling (since that's really the burgeoning market on that platform). There are minor  things that those influencers could do to support climate policy such as representing eco-friendly fashion products or things like that, but that's just highly dependent on whether those brands reach out to them. The ""decision pathway to leads to product purchases"" here is that the influencer fan is choosing to follow someone for a subset of reasons and they are only really influenceable in that area or closely adjacent ones.

Much like YouTube, having a large audience isn't the thing that matters for monetization anyway. The model for Twitter/Instagram/etc. obviously isn't *exactly* the same as it is for Youtube due to a lack of direct ads, but for example there are some very popular accounts that are just ""funny people tweeting things out"". Those accounts may have many more followers but they get fewer sponsorship deals or w/e because there isn't a translation between that and hawking products.

I think your experience with Sean Bean is fairly representative of how people engage with celebrities politically. People who have politics that agree with you, you get to re-affirm your own beliefs. People who have differing ones, well I don't watch them for their politics, I watch them for their acting. To go along with your Lebron James example, I think you can find plenty of examples of athletes speaking out for social justice changes and things like that and the result from an ""influencing"" perspective is that people who are inclined to agree do so and people who are inclined to disagree with whatever issue just fill their comments with ""Shut up about politics and play sports"". Same sort of thing with athletes and vaccinations (going in either direction). 

Don't get me wrong, there are certainly opportunities where an influencer of some type can try to sway their crowd, but it often requires a special set of circumstances.

Furthermore, the subsidies are used for specific purposes. Farm subsidies are to encourage farmers to overproduce food to protect against famine. But consumed food can still be taxed (thus focusing the subsidy on the excess supply). Oil subsidies are to encourage oil producers to overproduce and reduce US reliance on foreign oil. But gasoline is still taxed to cover the cost of wear and tear on roads, environmental damage, etc. 

So the subsidy and tax approach only works when there is a clear rationale for it. The net effect of a cotton subsidy would be that clothing becomes less expensive. It would have minimal impact on tampons because the effect would be diluted.

Given how little correlation there is between subsidizing the raw materials vs the product here, I assumed you meant subsidizing and taxing tampons themselves, which makes no sense.

One: You talk about relentless documentation, persistent action on the part of the protester, but present no data or figures to support your theory of how widespread or accepted police brutality is.

Two: The reason why you don't hear about follow ups for police brutality is that these investigations are ongoing at the time of the brutality. So whil ewe hear about the incident from the press, you don't hear about the police investigation into the offending officer due to confidentiality. In short, they cannot release details until the investigation is closed and the officer is punished. As the son of san officer who worked in 'internal affairs', also called 'professional standards', I don't have an overly lofty view of police. There are bad people in the force. But they are dealt with efficiently. 

The only thing I don't like about the system is that it is after the fact. AN officer is only punished after the fact (by requirement of actually committing the offense), but there is no way to objectively see that someone is going to commit an offense in the future.

Three: Vigilante 'justice' is actually the opposite of justice. If we look why police brutality is wrong, it comes down to the officer taking matters into his or her own hands. They are subverting the established system and imposing their will or force onto someone who does not deserve it. How is vigilantism any better? There is no accountability for it, and it follows the same path as police brutality- subverting the system. The only thing it satisfies is revenge, not justice.

Comparing their salary to the average American makes no sense, since they're given much more responsibility and power than the average person, and in our capitalist society, those sorts of positions tend to come with a lot more money attached as an incentive to attract skilled, motivated people.

People argue a lot that government positions are special in that people should do it out of a sense of patriotism or service or whatever, but since the rest of the society doesn't work that way, in practice it means you exclude some people you'd want in those positions and attract a lot of people you don't.  Paying a Senator like the average American might satisfy a certain sense of fairness, but smart, skilled people who also like money (which is large portion of smart, skilled people, not to mention the average American) will go find somewhere else where their skills are better rewarded.  What you *will* get though is people who love the power, who are so wealthy they don't need the money, who aren't actually skilled enough to make more money elsewhere, or who take the opportunity to still make money under the table.

2) I think that it's the only plan presented thus far that makes any sense. I am sympathetic to your goals. I just think that the methods you are using are nonsensical or founded on an insufficient understanding of the underlying economics.

Obviously: Just Work &gt; Unjust Work &gt; No work at all.

If your attempts to turn unjust work into just work puts as many or more people out of work then it's not an improvement on there being unjust work.

If there is really a race to the bottom then we would see more and more nations abandon other methods of doing things to adopt crappy sweat shop labor. But, they don't. There's just *so much more* money to be made producing high tech stuff that requires more skilled labor that it doesn't make any sense to keep sweat shops around if you can make the jump to higher value products. No one really wants to make Wal*Mart crap. It's just a step on the path to them making jets and computers like we do.

&gt; This is kind of the same thing I'm talking about - creating a system that rewards improving working conditions. Doing it through tariffs also makes it fair to US businesses.

NAFTA, the TPP, and various Bilateral Free Trade Agreements do precisely this. I'm not talking about something speculative. I'm talking about something that we've been doing since the late 1980's. Which, not coincidentally, is the same time period that we've successfully brought two billion people globally out of poverty and saw several nations mature from sweat shop Wal*Mart crap to being major world economies, like South Korea.

To try chuck these trade deals to create tariffs that we can then exempt people from would ruin both plans.

3133	"&gt;The emotional crutch and loneliness reasons can be especially traumatizing since it puts a burden on a child from a very young age, but the other reasons as well

Not sure this is a fair reason to have kids for the vast majority of parents or children. Plenty of kids hate their parents and vise versa. And the reason you have to put ""joy of parenthood"" in quotation marks is because its a bit of a comforting lie we all tell ourselves. Parenthood is hard, draining, often without joy and a thankless job. But that's not all it is however. 

&gt;I think it's wrong to bring them into the world just because you essentially want to play dress up

Although this is completely true, the vast majority of people don't have kids to play dress up. Mostly because the above stuff I've mentioned, there are easier ways of scratching that itch. 

&gt;As for lineage reasons, there is no reason in particular to keep the human race going (...) 

Again I know anyone who's primary or even secondary reason for having kids were simply the continuination of the species. Humans do have a innate desire to procreate but not simply so that their lineage doesn't go extinct, but also to continue passing on the unearned privileges of the past and the fruits of their own labour, in hopes that their lives may change and adapt the world for the better. 

&gt;existence is difficult to understand and, even if it is pleasurable, essentially meaningless

Although this is an overall objective claim of the universe its not a humanly objective claim. Humans desire meaning, to create it and be enthralled by it. Without meaning we cannot act, and if we cannot act we might as well die. So in a sense the meaning of life is to create a life that is subjectively meaningful to ourselves and one that helps others find meaning in their own lives. And parents want nothing more than for kids to live a content and meaningful lives, for the most part. 

&gt;It is an oversight to subject someone to human condition in general- pain and suffering, sure, but also search for meaning, the limitation of their own perception, and certainty of death.

As I pointed out above the search for meaning is essential for humans. It's not good or bad, it quite literally what you make of it. And as for pain and suffering, there can be no pleasure without pain and no joy without suffering. There will never exist a place without both sides of the coin.
With regards to the limitation of our perception, that is innate to consciousness. Bugs are not conscious, but they not even conscious of the knowledge that they're not conscious. In essence a large part of consciousness is the knowledge of our own limitation and we can never escape that either. We can however focus our attention to the limitation and concur them. 

&gt;I acknowledge that people who have children because of social pressure can't be held fully accountable

3134	"But you can't just declare yourself a World Champion if you don't play against other teams around the world. You may be the best, but it's complete non-sense that you give yourself the title of World Champion based solely on the fact that you feel (and in many cases, probably are) superior. 

edit: the only arguments I have gotten so far: MLB/NBA has the best players in the world, therefore they are World Champions. Being the best in the world does not equal being World Champions. 

**edit2:** so the general consensus seems to be that since the best international players play in the MLB/NBA, that qualifies it as a) an international competition and b) the best team in the world, therefore there is no need to play international teams.

**Firstly, sports are about competing.** Being the best is a right earned. Saying you have a larger talent pool (which the NBA/MLB does) is not equivalent to being World Champions. Yes, yes, yes--- the NBA/MLB team would win in an international format 99 times out of 100. That isn't what I am arguing.

Take the UEFA Champions League, for instance. European leagues is where every player dreams of playing, whether you are from Asia, South America, or Africa. European football is the pinnacle of football (soccer). They have the best players in the world.

**So, why then, do the winners of the Champions League (Barcelona, for example), not call themselves ""World Champions?"" Because there are other professional leagues in other countries. These leagues are no where near as talented or rich as Barcelona, and Barcelona are vastly superior. But that doesn't qualify Barcelona as a ""World Champion"", because it makes no logical sense to call yourself that when you haven't played the best teams from other leagues, just like the NBA champion doesn't.**

**In soccer, however, there is the ""Club World Cup"", where the champion of every continent goes to play in a tournament.** Often times, the European team wins. Butttttt every once in a while, a South American team will take it out of the hands of the Europeans. Most of the time (not always), the Europeans win easily due to their superiority, and **have thus earned the right to call themselves *World Champions* because of the international format and playing the best teams from around the world.** 

Make the comparison to the European teams and the NBA. Why should the European teams go and have to compete against subpar competition when they are clearly better? Because that is the essence of sport-- competing and earning titles. **Despite the fact that their talent pool comprises of the best international players, the European teams still have to go compete for the title of World Champion.**"	27	['right earned']	1	1	0.037037037037037035	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['right earned']	1	1	0.037037037037037035	1	28093500182	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3r8xsd/_/cwm57h2/	227165197	28093154548.0	2015-11-02 20:32:52		ehtork88	21	False	454	0	False	True	70.63

3150	"Let me start with the perverse incentives argument. I just don't think that parents will look at a socioeconomic policy and say, ""well, if we become/stay poor, my kids will get into college easier."" 

To me, that's kinda like saying, ""If my child contracts a near-deadly virus at age 14 and survives despite overwhelming odds, that's gonna make for an awesome college essay!""

While there are black families that have lots of resources and a tradition of education, poor families are poor precisely because they DON'T have the resources to help their kids compete with those from wealthier families. I don't see families striving to tie one hand behind their back.

The role model argument is an interesting one. But if you're a black kid from a rich family who did his undergrad at Harvard and got his MD at Johns Hopkins, the chances are not that you're going to work at an underfunded public hospital in a predominantly black community. You're likely going to go into research, ending up somewhere like the Mayo Clinic. And there's a good chance the kids who really need a role model will never meet you.

And here's a quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson.

 “I think on some level, role models are overrated. Growing up in the Bronx, had I required, as a prerequisite, that another black man from the Bronx had become an astrophysicist for me to become one, I’d still be in the Bronx.”

Obviously, Tyson is a brilliant guy and not all of us are like him, but I give black kids a bit more credit than you do, when it comes to looking at those outside of their race for inspiration."	11	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	28610322731	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4s1m2d/_/d55uiaz/	288969205	28610268865.0	2016-07-09 16:56:13		TraderTed	6	False	281	0	False	True	66.47

I wasn't making a comparison like that, I was just saying there are dickheads out there but it's not the majority of people that have this hate. There is always going to be at least someone that hates you for something stupid and might try to use it against you. This black lives matter stuff is going to an entirely other level to the point a lot of the ""activists"" are getting out of hand themselves. Like I said earlier the case of where that entire ""peaceful protest"" blocked an ambulance from rushing someone to the hospital. You don't do that no matter what cause you are fighting for. That ambulance should have just drove through. Same goes for all the dickhead cops that beat or kill anyone for no reason, they should have the same done to them. It starts as a push for equality, but then it turns into a full shit fest. You have to also understand a police perspective, their life is always on the line and if someone is trying to fight them off lethal action may be necessary. There have been a lot of BS deaths lately that I completely disagree with, but I do remember seeing ones where it was warranted you just don't fight cops, period. Police have to worry about getting their ass kicked, especially with all that equipment on them. Anyone with an attitude during a stop should have a police man on alert. And do you see the respect people have these days? There's countless videos on the internet of urban areas where theres like 50 people outside watching some teen boys whoop a girls ass in the street just cheering them on, of a group of people just destroying stuff because they can, most of those people from the crowded urban areas think fight first, ask questions later. How would your guard be making an arrest in that area? I am not covering up for police in any way, but I do think many actual mistakes do happen and its all because of the demeanor of the person being stopped.


I do agree college students get special treatment, but to argue the same point as you. College students choose to be college students and are trying to move forward in life. So a little break for doing some good is nice. Rape? No, I don't agree with rape one bit at all and I think if anyone seriously rapes someone they should just have their face smashed in because it's probably the ultimate form of disrespect. I am not discussing rape cases though because of problems with evidence and word vs word and there can be so much BS when it comes to that.


I know a lot of those mothers are single. A lot of those mothers are single though because of their own poor choices, their man's poor choices, and in many cases (especially with the black population) murdering each other. There is one big messed up dynamic there that needs to be fixed, but no one else but the ones involved are to blame for it. You can't blame your city, jim crowe laws, or your parents for getting shacked up with someone (unless it was like a planned marriage) and having a pregnancy. Yes mistakes happen, but I talk to many teenage boys that have children of their own. Many actually wanted the children for whatever reason knowing full well they couldn't support it. Many that didn't want the children will tell you straight out they didn't but they will brag about how many baby moms they have while they sit in a cell, some with the goal of getting out and knocking another up right away. There is a horrible culture among many of these inner city boys. Instead of breaking the cycle and started from the inside and working the way out fingers are pointed. I feel we are getting off topic though this isn't really about black urban culture it's about a push for equality that is going overboard and effecting people it does not need to effect in a serious way.

3156	"&gt; I have read studies about wage gap, and the fact women are slowly promoted or offered less salary is because they don't ask for it.

It's relevant to ask *why* women don't ask for promotions or salary increases as much. If our society tells women to be nice, and calls them ""bossy"" when they're assertive, but conditions men to be assertive, and calls them ""weak"" then they're nice, then that's a problem. Honestly, I think *both* sides of that are problems, and I think most feminists do as well.

&gt; I have never heard that if job is seen as more masculine, the pay is better. Any examples?

The NYT has an [interesting article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html?_r=0) about this. A main point from it:

&gt; A striking example is to be found in the field of recreation — working in parks or leading camps — which went from predominantly male to female from 1950 to 2000. Median hourly wages in this field declined 57 percentage points, accounting for the change in the value of the dollar, according to a complex formula used by Professor Levanon. The job of ticket agent also went from mainly male to female during this period, and wages dropped 43 percentage points.

I would also assert that we can see it in some cases without even looking at differences over time like that. Consider the case of high school teachers vs. elementary school teachers. Elementary school teachers don't get anywhere *near* the respect they deserve. People call it ""glorified babysitting"", ask if it's fun to have ""play time"" all day, and generally look down on it because they think it doesn't take much skill. The vast majority of elementary school teachers are women. On the other hand, high school teachers are more evenly split, and are respected somewhat more than elementary school teachers are. As a high school teacher, I can tell you that I am in *awe* of elementary school teachers...I have no idea how they manage it."	19	['are slowly promoted', 'is seen', 'be found', 'are respected']	4	4	0.21052631578947367	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are slowly promoted', 'is seen', 'be found', 'are respected']	4	4	0.21052631578947367	1	29340669844	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/69qoek/_/dh8odqs/	379158284	29340641004.0	2017-05-07 09:07:41		Salanmander	18	False	331	3	True	True	62.38

Largely off the cuff; I'm making assumptions based on a bit of logical inferences. And also discussions with friends. Here's some basic elements of my assumptions. First, I think very few people are concerned with a tyrannical government because I haven't heard many proponents really say what constitutes tyranny. If the underlying reason for your opposition to gun control is tyranny, you would have a good idea about what constitutes tyranny. Second, most gun owners own multiple guns. You can't defend yourself with multiple guns at a time. Third, defensive gun use in bona fide criminal scenarios are rare. For the vast majority of people, if they're shooting a gun, it's not for self-defense. Far fewer bullets would be sold in America if gun owners primarily owned their weapons for self-defense.

Furthermore, the pervasive use of absurd arguments by public figures makes me believe these figures are using justifications rather reasons. You can't say you need a gun for self-defense and also say that violent crimes would be at the same level if gun ownership decreased. You need your gun for self-defense, rather than a knife, because it's effective at killing quickly and easily. This same utility is the reason criminals use guns over knives. 

>In your yoga pants example, perhaps Bob only cares about appearance. Well, Bob isn't the only person in the conversation. I'm sure many people, particularly women, would have personal reasons to oppose it, and some would likely be pretty similar to Bob's justification. 

I doubt many women would have genuine reasons similar to Bob's justification. I think most women would tend to oppose the legislation on the same basis: they like yoga pants. And if the majority of men and the majority of women just plain like yoga pants, and don't care how it's somehow causing the GDP to falter, they can prevent such legislation from passing. If thats their underlying reason and they have concerns about the economy, they can support compromise legislation. But if that's their underlying reason, they have genuine concerns about the GDP and they use alternative justifications, compromise legislation will be far more difficult to enact because it'll address concerns that dont actually affect beliefs.

>People can also have multiple reasons to oppose or support a given policy. Using your gun crowd paragraph, why can't someone like their guns but also be concerned about self defense, maybe they think the gin control being proposed won't be effective as well.

You *can* have multiple reasons. But a reason is an explanation where a valid argument against it will have some impact on your overall belief. If all 3 are part of your reason for opposing particular gun control legislation, and someone makes a valid argument about why this law will be effective and why it won't impact your ability to defend yourself, then your view in the legislation should be changed. If you would still oppose the bill in such a scenario, then those latter two explanations were justifications rather than reasons."	28	['are concerned', 'would be sold', 'being proposed', 'should be changed']	4	4	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are concerned', 'would be sold', 'being proposed', 'should be changed']	4	4	0.14285714285714285	1	43961092260	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17j8xme/_/k71arvo/	2632375094	43960718534.0	2023-10-29 23:47:52	234258656534.0	BackAlleySurgeon	1	False	507	3	False	True	53.71

3163	Tony Stark's position is definitely more pragmatic, but that doesn't make Steve Rogers inherently wrong. You can argue he lost sight of the big picture, which I'd agree with, but at the end of the day he made his decision because he didn't want to betray his principles. He viewed it as only a **self**-sacrifice; becoming a fugitive rather than betray his ideals; which is very in character for him, just as it's in character for Stark to prioritise outcome over principles (see his argument for creating Ultron, for example). Neither of them are wrong, they just have different priorities in that moment, and it's that dichotomy that makes them interesting as lead characters in the Avengers. If Steve had had Tony's pragmatism he would likely have concluded that it was worth compromising to ensure he could still be useful, but on the other hand if Tony had had Steve's principles he would have trusted his team rather than create Ultron behind their backs. All this shows that someone's greatest strength can be a weakness in the wrong scenario; Steve may have been misguided but he wasn't **wrong** to choose the way he did in Civil War, he didn't do what he did out of any desire to hurt people or as an act of betrayal, he did it because he found a line in the sand which his sense of duty and personal loyalty wouldn't let him cross.	6	['may have been misguided']	1	1	0.16666666666666666	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['may have been misguided']	1	1	0.16666666666666666	1	38289257863	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/qxbehl/_/hl8fog7/	1628079897		2021-11-19 06:52:53	134575719273.0	DaedricHamster	10	False	239	0	False	False	48.0

3171	"The worst thing they could expect is actually that Thalmor attack Hammerfell again, have the Empire (and Skyrim) not interfere, take it, attack Skyrim, have the Empire attempt to appease the Aldmeri Dominion by not providing support, and fall due to the sudden nature of the attack and not having allies. The Empire won't provide aid to Hammerfell, that's not speculation, that simple induction on the fact that they didn't last time. I don't know why you think that would change in the next attempt. Hammerfell will be attacked again before Skyrim, and Skyrim NEEDS to be able to help them. Hammerfell+Skyrim&gt;Cyrodiil. As for things being patched up, I don't see it. I can see the Empire trying to reconquer Hammerfell in another century, but not a handshake and a welcome back to the fold.

&gt;Everyone hates the Thalmor. Lots of people also fear them, no one will be lulled into complacency

Well, actually, many important political figures in elf-hating Skyrim itself already view the Thalmor as a neutral force. The Jarl of Falkreath (a scumbag, but an empowered scumbag) explicitly sides with them, and it's likely that the Forsworn and Black-Briars could be bribed over with promises of power. In 20-30 years, many of the humans in power will not have been in The Great War, while the Altmer will all be veterans and victors, with the desire to dominate and without the animosity of loss.

&gt;Of course the elves have plans. One of them is the civil war in Skyrim.

Which is why it's important to end the war quickly and decisively, but which side you choose doesn't affect this point one way or the other.

&gt;It's important that the Empire also forms a plan to deal with the Dominion, and keeps an eye out for other Thalmor schemes.

With what intelligence, the blades who don't exist? The Penitus Oculatus? The Oculatus are the most blundering and stupid intelligence agency I've seen in any non-comedic work of fiction. They put a dozen guys guarding the Emperor a few hundred yards out of port the same night that 

a. an attempt was made on his life.

b. a force of them failed to wipe out the assassins.

c. in the middle of a civil war, where combat patrols from the enemy force are regularly that size. 

The currently nonexistent intelligence organizations in Skyrim have at least as much chance of uncovering and foiling plots.

&gt;it's always been a symbiotic relationship.

Yes, it had been, and now it is not. Skyrim doesn't ""owe"" the Empire their allegiance. And if they did, the Empire would not be within their rights to claim this debt with force.

&gt;which is precisely why there is a system in place to choose the High King.

Yes. This system also allows for single combat if both participants are willing. There are two rules of law, accepted law and traditional law. Stability is a factor of traditional law which in this case does not allow for the losing side of this agreed upon combat to say ""nuh-uh"" and then fight to keep what they lost. If we're talking about the text-book legality, Elisif and her imperial masters were the ones that broke the rules here. Now, would it add to the chaos to have Jarls be able to challenge each other to single combat again? Unlikely. The claimant to High King by all accounts a powerful tongue who would not brook infighting. In the long term? Perhaps, though I expect a whole lot of deeper changes than that to occur because of the Alduin/Second Great War situation.

&gt;If Toryyg had refused Ulfric's challenge, that would have made things even worse. He would have kept his throne in the short run, but the jarls and their people would have turned on him over time. He really did not have a choice. As things are now, at least the Empire benefited from Toryyg being a martyr, so a full half of Skyrim still supports the Empire.

I disagree on several counts here. If he had refused Ulfric's challenge, I think he simply would still have been on the throne when Ulfric rebelled against the Empire, and a much larger section of Skyrim would have quashed it. Acceptance was foolishness and pride. The Empire did not benefit from having a more valid claimant working with them than Elisif the Fairly Stupid. Moreover, half of Skyrim does not support the Empire, or at least not nearly as strongly as the half that opposes them. We have two approximately equal forces in Skyrim. One is Nord, Nord, Dunmer, Nord, Nord, Orc, Nord. The other is Nord, Cyrod, Cyrod, Dunmer, Redguard, Orc, Redguard. I don't believe that the rest of the Empires Nords are elsewhere when they would be most economical to use putting down this insurrection.

As for the LDB being supported by the Empire in a war, yes that would be better, but I feel is also way less likely to occur before the Thalmor weaken the Empire and Mundus with destruction of the towers, propaganda, and superior intelligence forces.

Now finally, my point about the Empire seeing the LDB as a threat is speculation, but far from baseless. Once again we need to refer to the Dark Brotherhood quest line, where one of the highest members of the empire commissions the assassination of the empire in a naked, and by all accounts successful, power play. I find it very hard to believe that the people in charge of the current empire would do anything but stab the LDB in the back at the first opportunity."	46	['will be attacked', 'being patched', 'will be lulled', 'could be bribed', 'was made', 'being supported']	6	6	0.13043478260869565	1	['being supported by']	1	1	0.021739130434782608	1	['will be attacked', 'being patched', 'will be lulled', 'could be bribed', 'was made']	5	5	0.10869565217391304	1	27295751962	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2cflx0/_/cjf6p0a/	141815988	27295574557.0	2014-08-02 18:58:46		VorpalWalrus	5	False	935	7	False	True	70.13

Not to be obtuse, but no, not really. I'm liberal and I'm a critic of both of those things. Being a critic of them really says nothing about how I vote. 

&gt;I think Christianity has been around longer to be understood and better defined. And the subcategories are more defined and understood. However Alt-Right is a new movement. I really think there are subsections of Alt-Right that haven't been clearly defined yet. You have a subgroup that is more isolationist where another is traditional. Isolationist Alt-Right - they want to stay out of international dealings. Alt-Right traditionalist - they want to maintain traditional gender roles. (I am making up these sub groups. But I think you might know what I'm talking about).

Sure. But seeing as that's the case, why bother using it? Why not just use the *actual* term you mean? This is kind of what I'm looking for to CMV: if you want to detail someone as a ""Nazi"" or ""antifeminist,"" why would ""alt-right"" be a better and more accurate term for that purpose?

Absolutely. That doesn't mean suffering. I don't view death as suffering at all, it's just the natural end to life. Why would death be suffering? My love of people doesn't stop death, that would be ridiculous for me to think it would.

Not true in all points of view. If my children have a more fulfilling/better life because of my work, then it meant the world to me. Maybe not to you.

Just because suffering is plausible doesn't mean the purpose is. That would be like saying the purpose of building a car is to break down. It is plausible that everyone's car will break down at some point, but their car still serves another purposes to them even if it will still likely break down.

3195	"ill put it for you on a platter (pun intended). 

I am not fat. I am a walking stereotype of a gymaholic with bodydysmorphia. I have always struggled with eating a lot. I just dont get hungry. Because of my experience with food, I thought fat people were crazy, how could one overeat? Was impossible for me. 

Then when I got into the gym, I had to force myself to eat more and it was fucking hard. It was a daily battle. Each battle was more discouraging because after I prevailed, I would look back on the struggle and realize that it is never going to get easier, I would have to go through the same struggle or worse every day. When I got on ADHD medicine, it got even worse, and I just gave up working out because I couldnt do the battle every day to eat enough to grow. 

4 years later, after withering to skin and bones, I decided I would need to get back in the gym to stop feeling like shit. Peptides have gotten big and I researched into them and found an appetite stimulant. GHRP6, its basically synthetic ghrelin, which is the hunger hormone, ie the thing responsible for making you feel hungry. I started taking this and everything including my world view changed....

I would be so fucking hungry, I would HAVE to eat everything in the fridge. I am now 108lbs more than I was when I started it. I realized that a lot of overeaters must feel this way all the time. I thought back on my struggle with eating, and the discouragement coming from having to face the same battle every day was just a brutal concept. That same concept applies to fat people trying to lose weight. They would have to mentally fight off this urge to eat every day without it ever getting better. You simply cannot win that battle each day for the rest of your life unless you are profoundly special and determined. People are actually losing weight with semaglutide (also a peptide) now because it is the opposite of ghrp6, it blocks hunger signaling, now people are not actually having to fight that fight, they just live without the desire to eat. All of these fat celebs who have been obese for their entire career, they all just magically lost all the weight as soon as semaglutide came out. 

Come to my house, I will inject you with ghrp6 3x a day for 5 years, If you are able to not gain any weight (by resisting the urge to overeat) for 5 years I will pay you 1 billion dollars.

3196	"While I do have mixed feelings about the militarization of law enforcement, I am under the impression that it is a small fraction of the US law enforcement. From looking online, it sounds like the US has 1,200 SWAT teams. With 18,000 police department, that is a small fraction (6%). I highly doubt that that majority of rural America and from my understanding is under the umbrella of the F.B.I. and not usually part of the local police. I would be **unpleasantly SHOCKED** if my town and neighboring city had an ""arsenal of military grade weapon."" FYI, onetime I called the police because or a suspicious package. They arrived with just their standard police vehicle. (A really funny story btw). 

It is also a bit beside the point I'm trying to address.  Which is that many people for ""defunding the police"" underestimate the need for a well rounded police department. Lets chew on your example for a bit. You are suggesting that someone in a Honda Civic should respond to traffic accidents. Am I right? And someone who is not highly trained like a cop and without hazzard pay? Sounds good on paper but lets think of scenarios that could happen. Best case scenario - the two parties exchange information and no one has to be involved. Or the clerk records the information. Worse case scenarios (outside a collision that obviously needs a medical team): Crash happens because of a DUI. The two parties escalate to a huge fight (this has happened to me). A hit and run. The person involved experiences a latent medical problem not apparent before the clerk arrives - like a heart attack or panic attack. The collision results in a traffic problem or in a dangerous place like a Highway ... so forth.

I think these examples are likely edge cases. And the clerk will need to be able to handle all these cases - unless the system includes a mechanism where an appropriate response team will accompany them. They will likely require hazzard pay. And they will likely require a safer modified vehicle to assure everyone's safety while they handle the traffic accident. 

I often hear ""Defund the Police"" in respect to mental health and drug addiction. I can only speak from **MY** experience in the region that I live. I understand that different parts of the US treat it differently. Also, the region I live in has the lowest incarceration rates. But I do know people who made very poor choices as a result of their drug addictions - leaving the scene of an accident, stealing, or harrassing people. The police got them into court. But it is the court system that decides their ""punishment"". And it is not uncommon for the court system to give them an opportunity towards a treatment plan. My friend choose a 1 year rehab over jail time - and I spent many years trying to get her into a treatment program. The justice system **WAS** her first step towards seeking help. My state also has work and educated programs that the court system oversees. So in that regards ... I see the inadequate of mental health an issue with the state legislation and court system.   Removing funds from the police does not guarantee that treatment programs will be funded. You can also fund both. Or do it differently (like they do in Portugal).

3205	"Hi! I work for an Organ Procurement Organization and approach families for organ donation, both registered and non-registered patients. In my state, when someone is legally declared brain dead after a series of confirmatory tests, and they are a registered donor, their registry status is legally binding and the family cannot rescind the donor’s decision: the document states along the lines, “upon my DEATH, I authorize my organs, tissue, and eyes for transplantation and medical therapy.” Of note, even though we all have the best intentions when we register to become potential donors, doesn’t mean you actually are suitable for donation. There are a lot of tests/procedures that come with it. 

Since brain death is legal death, we move forward no matter what. HOWEVER, if patients are NOT legally confirmed brain dead, and the family chooses to withdraw life support and you are a registered organ donor, the family can still decline donation (even going against your wishes). This is because your legal next of kind or MPOA can still make decisions for you since you’re not legally deceased (yet), thus not moving forward with organ donation. This type of organ donation that they pass up is called Donation after Circulatory Death, or “DCD” as we call it. After removing Life support, the patient has to die within a 60 minute timeframe in order to become an organ donor. I would say the most common answer of getting a decline is indeed timing (someone stated this above) since the patient does have to remain intubated while we run tests, find matches, set up an OR, etc which can take over the course of 2-3 days. Families have a hard time seeing their loved ones on a vent hooked up to a bunch of things. It’s a lot, I understand, but I’ve worked with countless donor families and the healing it provides them on their grief journey is truly remarkable. 

Please please please, tell your family what your wishes are. I know EOL discussions are not the most fun ones to have, but sharing with your MPOA, legal next of kin, and family will take the burden off of them.

Infants/children, elderly people, people with intellectual disabilities, or other major health concerns all fit into this category. There are very few lazy homeless people, but there are a ton with untreated mental illnesses. How many potential slave owners are willing to pay for another mouth to feed that can never generate even a small fraction of the revenue they consume. Maybe you can do it for your own family members or a lovable pet, but it's hard to do it for emotionally draining strangers. 

The insurance model works much better. For example, there's a 1% chance your child will get schizophrenia. It affects people of every race, religion, nationality, and socioeconomic status equally. So it makes sense for parents to buy insurance to take care of their children if that's the case.

The fundamental problem with your view is that if you own stock in a failing business, the best thing to do is sell it. If you can't, then you have to declare bankruptcy and dissolve the company. In slave owner terms, this means selling your least productive slaves or allowing them to die. There are a ton of ""heartwarming"" stories about slaves who finally gained their freedom after a lifetime of work, but that was a common way of getting rid of old slaves when they became to old/sick/disabled to work. Even if one slave owner was willing to accept lower profits to take care of their slaves, other slave owners would reinvest their returns into their business.

3214	"Ok here's the deal, as far as I can see it. Prohibiting the buying and selling of sex has been a dismal failure, and so has the full legalisation of buying and selling sex. When we look at the examples of countries which in a modern context have fully legalised prostitution, we see no real reduction in the violence and coercion surrounding the sex industry. In many cases, particularly those of Germany and the Netherlands, we actually can observe an increase in trafficking, violence, and abuse, following the full legalisation of prostitution, and the emergence of some very troubling phenomena surrounding pimping and coercion (ie. ""loverboys"" in the Netherlands). Now, one might point to cases like New Zealand, where this phenomenon hasn't been observable, but it's important to remember that NZ is a country that is not only isolated from the rest of the world, with a tiny population, but also a very developed country with comparatively very low wages, therefore making it a place not particularly attractive to traffickers. But in countries with ease of access, and relatively open borders, the reality is that fully legalised prostitution has made trafficking even more of a reality.

Here's the deal with legalised prostitution, it isn't something new or particularly radical. In fact, prostitution in Western Europe only came to be criminalised as a result of late 19th century and early 20th century social movements. Before that, it was broadly legal. When Jack the Ripper was running around London? Legal prostitution. It has never worked, and isn't really working today.

But onto the nordic model. It has its failures, granted, but overall, it is a policy grounded in years of studies and policy initiatives with the aim of protecting prostitutes whilst discouraging their patrons. And the model of illegal buying and legal selling does seem to achieve this aim with more ease than any other model. Think of it in purely economic terms, if prostitution is legalised, then the potential clients will be more likely to buy sex in the absence of legal restrictions upon this. But on the other hand, no potential prostitute thinks ""oh, it's legal now, so my dreams of becoming a prostitute can finally be fulfilled!"". That simply isn't the way it is, and this paradox results in a massive disparity of supply and demand. Legalised prostitution creates a demand which can't be filled by the amount of native sex workers, and creates a vacuum in the supply which can easily be filled by coercive and criminal elements. The myth of independent sex workers in countries with legalised prostitution has proven to be exactly that. Murders of prostitutes still happen. Legalised brothels tend to, almost across the board, be ran by folks with criminal records and few scruples. A race to the bottom is created economically, with prostitutes being pressured to service multiple clients for ridiculously low prices. And of course, very few prostitutes in countries like this are natives, they are almost all immigrants. And abuse is rife. We know this to be true, and no amount of libertarian posturing means that it isn't. Ever been to De Wallen? Well those men standing outside the brothel windows aren't there to check up on their friends. They are pimps, and they often become semi-legitimised by fully legal prostitution. Sex workers still get murdered regularly. Nothing has changed, other than the incentives for violent coercion behind the scenes have improved with increased demand.

Now onto the nordic model. It isn't perfect, but it has worked in its aims. It has reduced the coercion in the sex industry, it has somewhat equalised the sex worker/client power dynamic, and it has reduced trafficking, or at least made the countries this policy is enacted in less attractive to trafficking rings. It has seemed to have helped prostitutes who want to leave the industry do this. And moreover, comparing prostitution to drugs or weapons is ridiculous, because these phenomena involve inanimate objects. Prostitution involves buying access to a human body, and is therefore fundamentally different. And the buyer is in a far greater position of power compared to the seller - just consider how many prostitutes get murdered by their clients compared to the case vice versa. The nordic model seems to redress this balance. Now maybe it is unfair on the ""happy hookers"" that genuinely want to sell their bodies, but if that is the case, if it makes life less miserable for potential prostitutes coerced into the business, well then maybe that's a risk worth taking.

*TL;DR*: Prostitution is far more complex than Reddit-libertarians, who more often than not have never actually lived in a country with legalised prostitution, would like to portray it. Rather than being sexist and immoral, this ""Nordic Model"" has seemed to be the most effective way of protecting sex workers whilst discouraging demand for the sex industry to flourish. And if it protects human lives, then to dismiss it as immoral is heinous at best."	44	['be criminalised', 'policy grounded', 'is legalised', 'be fulfilled', 'filled by', 'filled by', 'be ran', 'is created', 'being pressured', 'get murdered', 'is enacted', 'get murdered']	12	10	0.22727272727272727	1	['filled by', 'filled by', 'be ran by', 'get murdered by']	4	3	0.06818181818181818	1	['be criminalised', 'policy grounded', 'is legalised', 'be fulfilled', 'is created', 'being pressured', 'get murdered', 'is enacted']	8	7	0.1590909090909091	1	27045911613	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1xd5em/_/cfafqyl/	116507038		2014-02-08 19:35:04		UnwantedInput	6	False	829	0	False	True	51.89

3220	"To me, there's a fundamental logical paradox in what you're saying. Maybe I'm not articulating it right. If we can be wrong, then we by definition must also be free to be right.  

If our incorrect beliefs are entirely caused by neurons firing, or environmental stimuli, or inherent brain structures, *then they aren't incorrect*. In a world without free will it is meaningless to talk about being right or wrong, or having correct or incorrect perceptions.  

On the other hand if it is possible to be incorrect about anything, then we must possess a will capable of more or less freely deciding among various given choices. To me, that is free will, and all it can be. I don't know how free will could be anything more than simply the ability to make choices given what we know and what we experience. What could it logically be beyond that?  

In other words I don't think you can have a little bit of free will. We can't decide, for example, to see gamma radiation. That's not one of the choices available to us. We can't decide to exist in more than one place at the same time. For the things that are beyond our physical capability, we are not ""free"" at all...we are constrained by what we are. But within the limits of being a human with eyes and brains and so forth, we must either be free to make choices given to us, or we should banish the language of ""incorrectness"" forever from our vocabulary. If we're not free to decide whether something is blue or green, good or bad, lying or telling the truth, generous or stingy, then we are not free at all. Our ""errors"" are not our errors, they aren't even errors. Neither we nor anyone else can be responsible for any mistakes we make. There is no such thing as ""delusion.""  

But... if we can be wrong, then that is all the free will we ever hoped to have. I'm not sure what the greater free will you seem to have in mind even is.

Well, it totally depends on your way to count. Let's take France example. If you look at World Bank data, you find the trajectory you're talking about (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?locations=EU-FR)

Now if you take sources that take into account emissions from imports, the result is pretty different: (https://asset.lemde.fr/prd-blogs/2019/12/Evolution-empreinte-carbone-France-1995-2018.png)

France just outsourced its heavy CO2 producing industry, but the global footprint of french citizens just grew. I don't have data for every western country, but I'm pretty sure the result would be sensibly the same. 

> If you have any idea, I'd love to listen, it doesn't have to be perfect, but I don't see any non-tech related solution.

Once more, I can't talk about all countries on earth, there are some specificities for each one. If we look at the (only one I know about) plan that was written to move France from 12Tons of CO2 per capita to 2 in 2050, there is a lot of different things to do, the main points would be (here for the details if you speak french https://ilnousfautunplan.fr/le-plan/):

* Redesign cities to limit the need for cars & trucks
* Grow train/boat freight (replacing road freight)
* smaller flats for people, and less houses (with better insolation/heating)
* Big nuclear program, with hydro and a bit of solar / wind turbines 
* More people working in agriculture, closer to where people live, less mechanized.
* Develop repairing / 2nd life industries, instead of trash and buy new stuff.
* Massively invest into bicycles (cargo-electrical-bikes instead of trucks for deliveries in cities for example). 
* Limit plane traffic.
* Make the transition quick with right financial incitations (using both carrot & stick)

Of course the plan won't be put in place, and it may not apply in all countries but it shows the amount of effort we should expect in the west if we wanted to respect our commitment.

But we see that most of what need to be done don't rely on hoping for better technology, but just changing our lifestyles with existing technologies to pollute less."	18	['was written', 'be put', 'be done']	3	3	0.16666666666666666	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['was written', 'be put', 'be done']	3	3	0.16666666666666666	1	43129016914	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158c65i/_/jt9wifm/	2493117990	43128770386.0	2023-07-24 14:32:53	28581827756.0	Nicolasv2	1	False	380	2	True	True	55.27

Also, another value in play in the abortion debate is that people are responsible for the consequences of their own actions. It turns out that sex leads to babies, and has since the beginning of time. Babies are a huge responsibility. A person who chooses to have sex assumes the risk that they cause a pregnancy or contract an STD among other things. The purpose of the government is not to bail you out every time things get difficult.

3227	"&gt;Mail in voting has been a thing for a long time, why is it now fraudulent?

Disclaimer: I'm from Europe, so I don't really have a horse in this race, but I do try to keep up with US politics.

It was tried here and there, but no, it was never used in such a large scale. And even then, a judgje just invalidated an entire city council election due to the problems with mail in voting.

[https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/20/politics/paterson-new-jersey-city-council-voter-fraud/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/20/politics/paterson-new-jersey-city-council-voter-fraud/index.html)

What seems to be a common misunderstanding is that people don't realize that absentee voting, which has been an accepted form of voting can be done through mail, and the universal mail in voting that is proposed now in some places are two entirely separate things.

In the case of absentee voting, you request an absentee ballot to an address and it goes through a verification process that is already in place. It is a fairly secure, tried and tested system.

In the case of universal mail in voting, they would send out ballots to everyone based on registered voter lists. There is a big room for failure in a system like that, especially if it's not something that has been carefully planned over a long time. Registered voter lists can be innacurate due to people moving, dieing, etc... Some people might not get their ballots. Some people might get the ballots of other people. It also means that ballots will be delivered to everyone, and everyone will know about it. That opens up a lot of possiblities to mess with other people's votes. Even if somehow everyone plays nice and the voter registration lists end up being 100% accurate, as you can see in the article above, 24% of the votes were rejected either way, simply because those were not up to standard. Yes, that was a very high number in comparison, but I wouldn't say ""No other municipal election that day had a rejection rate higher than **13%** according to the ruling."" builds a huge amount of trust in the system in me. That 10-15% is basically the error rate of signature verification to begint with by the way. Losing 10% of votes due to this is not and should be not acceptable.

Not strongly related to this, but something I also noticed is that while Trump vs mail in voting is a huge thing on reddit and on the internet in general, nobody really gives a fuck about the Dems playing just as dirty:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw4sOLfeHng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw4sOLfeHng)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhk16CsxEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhk16CsxEk&amp;t=13s)

I'm not saying that Trump is an angel and he respects your democracy, he definitely isn't, and he deserves a lot of criticism. With that said, I do think the integrity of your democracy has been in the gutters for a long time, and it's on both big parties. The entire election system is whack and the two big parties have absolutely no incentive to change it. If you are dissatisfied with one of them you can only go to the other."	23	['was tried', 'was never used', 'can be done', 'is proposed', 'has been carefully planned', 'will be delivered', 'were rejected']	7	5	0.21739130434782608	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['was tried', 'was never used', 'can be done', 'is proposed', 'has been carefully planned', 'will be delivered', 'were rejected']	7	5	0.21739130434782608	1	35199117570	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/iwigv5/_/g64n8xu/	1143000545	35198603889.0	2020-09-21 14:59:21	11351651.0	nbxx	10	False	499	1	True	True	58.82

3231	"Go back and watch “What is a Woman” again.  Notice how every person Matt Walsh interviews is deliberately selected to present a narrative.  The LMFT he interviews is non-binary, the surgeon he interviews is trans, the pediatrician he interviews has blue hair, the gender studies professor he interviews is “stereotypically gay” in his mannerisms.  The Congressman he interviews is openly gay.  These weren’t random “experts” on the topic, they were deliberately chosen to represent the side of pro-trans rights as being the very thing his audience is taught to be repulsed by.  Most importantly, they’re intended to represent the irrationality of the modern trans discourse.

Now, look at those he interviews who support his side.  The psychiatrist is professionally dressed, the old man is masculine, the high school athlete is straight and cis, etc.  They’re intended to show that those who push back against the modern discourse surrounding trans people are rational, intelligent, and well-spoken.

There are even a few interviews thrown in that imo clearly show the intent of the piece.  Jordan Peterson is only famous because he made a video saying he’d never use preferred pronouns.  That’s literally what founded his modern career.  The Maasai tribespeople he interviews also are intended to “confuse liberal SJW’s who are so scared of being called racist that they’d never critique black people who aren’t openly supportive of trans rights”. 

Even the way he conducts the interviews in the movie is straight out of the Ben Shapiro “Owning Libs” playbook.  His main aim as an “interviewer” is to try and catch his subject off-guard and make them uncomfortable so they get defensive, and by the time he actually asks any “real” questions, they’re so out-of-whack that they’re not sure how to respond.  Then, he collects his footage, edits it down to make it seem even better for his narrative, and then releases it.

This is how it can be clearly identified as “propaganda”.  He’s not actually interested in learning anything, and if you know anything about him beforehand you’re already well aware of his stances on the issues.  He’s not going there with an open mind actually intending to have a discussion, he’s going there with the goal of validating his own positions.  He works for a well-known conservative “news” outlet that produces content solely to make money, regardless of how accurate it actually is.  

So, when you try to ascertain what is and isn’t misinformation or propaganda, always question the person whose making it, their accreditations on the subject matter, and their motives before you question the actual content of the piece.

There are no new problems only ones you're (people in a general sense) just now seeing. Humans agree on a lot more in the end goal than we disagree on, it's how to actually get there that is usually debated. Also in many social structures the ones that disagree are few but they have the most power. For example, we have enough land and space for homeless people but the people that own those properties don't want to use it to help the homeless. We not only have enough money to completely feed the entire planet. We also print the money, so we can make more whenever we want. Some companies have more money that whole countries.

Even with police brutality, law enforcement has enough money to properly equip and train all it's officers so those things don't happen.

While it wouldn't be the easiest thing in the world, it's sure a heck of a lot easier than making your own gasoline.

While the ""future"" is infinite and anything is possible, I'd be hard-pressed to believe that civilized society is ever going to accept 50 year old adult men having sex with babies and toddlers.  But could society evolve to be accepting of *some* 30 year olds have romantic, sexual relationships with *some* 15 year olds?  Yeah, that's not overly far-fetched.

The world doesn't even agree right now how old is ""old enough"" to consent to sex.  Age of Consent laws already range anywhere from about 12 years old to ""not at any age unless you are married"".  In the United States, we tend to be very focused on 18 and that anyone over 20-ish who has sex with someone under the age of 18 is a disgusting pervert.

3239	"First, it's important to distinguish between copyright, patent and trademarks

Copyright is a form of protection provided to the authors of ""original works of authorship"" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, both published and unpublished

A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the Patent and Trademark Office.

A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device which is used in trade with goods to indicate the source of the goods and to distinguish them from the goods of others

&gt;I do, of course, believe that you can claim universal authorship of a work, and that is a crucial part of my argument;

This means that you believe in copyrights. It seems as if you've confused copyrights with patents. I agree that the patent system is a bit out of whack right now, but that's another conversation. If you discover or create something that isn't blatantly obvious, why shouldn't you have exclusive ownership and production rights to it? It's your hard work and research. Remember though, I feel like a lot of the patents being given out are absurd and many should not exist so I feel like we do share some common ground. Those do hinder research and development of new products and technology.

&gt;Furthermore, I believe that I have an argument for the betterment of society. I am not necessarily of the belief that information 'wants' to be free, but I certainly believe that the free, uninterrupted flow of information is crucial to human flourishing. This information can be scientific or artistic, it matters not. 

What if you develop a process for manufacturing solar panels that allowed for 90% efficiency? To do this, you'd have to come up with something very innovative and out of the box. Now, what if instead of solar panels you made medicine that could save lives and you're the first to make and discover it? It obviously wasn't a straightforward answer because no one had made/discovered it yet, so why should you be forced to give away your secrets from research and development when the person making solar panels worked just as hard? If you are price gouging that's one thing, but hard work should be rewarded. I want to reiterate what I said before, not everything is worthy of a patent.

The reason why any (I should say most) company succeeds is because it does something either unique or better than their competition. When you take away competition, innovation goes down. If you're smarter, harder working or more ambitious than the average person, shouldn't you be rewarded for your work? That's not to say every single thing you make should be patentable, but unique ideas should be rewarded.

You say that terms like ""get fucked"" aren't ideal but that they've become casual swearing. I suppose my question is, why are some of them taken in their figurative terms and some of these phrases interpreted as truly violent and sexual, even if ""suck my dick"" and ""get fucked"" are saying about the same thing in different ways?

You're right that I wouldn't say that stuff around someone suffering from depression and if someone I knew had been raped or sexually assaulted, I'd probably not say things like ""get fucked"" or ""get raped"" even if I were just trash talking while playing video games with them (the latter expression isn't one I actually use, just an example). 

So, context matters. 

But if you are playing a game with friends, none of whom have ever been raped but who do care about rape victims, is it still considered misogynistic or violent to say these things?

3252	"&gt; I dont understand the part of the quantum theory because i dont understand anything about that, i mainly follow biology. 

Well, suffice it to say that even if a person dies, and their body decays completely, the ""instruction set"" that describes how to make that particular person (information) cannot be removed from the universe. It's the same as the thought experiment I outlined, only the ""enclosed environment"" is the entire universe. So there is no ""oblivion"" in the sense of being forgotten - only in the sense that consciousness ceases (or does it? More further down).

&gt; As for the thought experiment, it is interesting. But, our atoms wont be in an enclosed area, and for the paper to be reconstructed, it would need to somehow stick back and go through a process which is difficult without intervention. 

The universe is an enclosed area, and features limitless space, an abundance of matter, and plenty of time. It's way more likely than you'd think! After all, we already exist, don't we?

&gt; I know i wont feel eternity, would be like before i was born. To be honest, i thought about it in the past about how i was before i was born and it scared me then. 

It is a scary thing, to be sure. But humans fear the unknown, and they fear it more when they have no measure of control. Psychology teaches us that the main causes of stress are a lack of control and a lack of information. Death features both. Regardless of how it is interpreted, it is natural to face it with a measure of dread.

&gt; I didnt think of the matter being in the same configuration tho, i thought that it would need to be the exact same atoms i have now. 

No, you don't need the same atoms. If you did, you'd be asserting that you ""die"" and are ""reborn"" every second, as cells in your body die and fall off, and are replaced by new ones made from the elements you get from your food. Any atoms will do, so long as they're in the right configuration.

&gt; But then the question would be that how would i know that it would become me. 

You don't *know* that it would be *you*. *You* aren't *you.* You are not the same person you were a few minutes ago, because your brain has changed (even if just a little) since then. An identity is not a fixed thing, it's fluid and ever-changing, and somewhat defies definition. But if you arrange matter and energy in the exact same way as would be found in your body, the result would be as close to *you* as you could possibly get.

&gt;And there might be something else in the universe that has the exact same configuration. But im not experiencing from his point of view. 

So, maybe once you die, you ""*jump""* to another point of view? After all, you can't perceive time when consciousness has ceased, so from your perspective, you die and are ""reincarnated"" right away, somewhere in the universe, none the wiser. 

In any case, eternal oblivion is *not* the only logical outcome - logic can support, perhaps even more readily, the position I've outlined. Can we be sure? No - nothing, and I mean *nothing*, is ever certain. But if there's an alternative, you can hardly claim that it's the *only* logical outcome, no?"	33	['be removed', 'being forgotten', 'be reconstructed', 'is interpreted', 'are replaced', 'would be found']	6	6	0.18181818181818182	1	['are replaced by']	1	1	0.030303030303030304	1	['be removed', 'being forgotten', 'be reconstructed', 'is interpreted', 'would be found']	5	5	0.15151515151515152	1	32832975432	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dexs5z/_/f2zwlzc/	811151063	32832919503.0	2019-10-08 10:17:04	228007731713.0	ZeroPointZero_	4	False	573	6	False	True	71.85

Notice that the Gallup poll you're citing is much older, from nearly a decade before the Atlantic article, which specifically said that the disconnect between parental beliefs and children's beliefs is the result of newer and more precise research.

&gt;it's a wild and unfair mischaracterization of my argument to assume it carries an implication that one need not act towards change if one has a kid.

It's not an assumption.  Many people shift rightwards after becoming parents: 

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/25/study-having-daughters-makes-parents-more-likely-to-be-republican/

http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/frame_game/2013/06/pew_breadwinners_poll_do_marriage_and_parenthood_make_you_conservative_about.html

Basically, it has nothing to do with ""implications"" or abstract moral arguments.  Parents are demonstrably less likely to act in the interest of progressive social change than non-parents as a result of having become parents.  

I would also point out that having children brings with it many entanglements that are incompatible with an activist career.  Mainly the fact that kids are expensive and time-consuming and activism requires a significant time commitment and doesn't pay.  I know that in principle it's not impossible for activists to be parents, but in my own activism career I have met very, very few people who continued to be activists after having kids.  I don't want to be cynical, but I think this is just how it is: once you've got kids and settled down, and you've got the nice house in the suburbs with the two-car garage and the white picket fence and the nine-to-five, the status quo just starts to get comfortable.  

The other thrust of my argument is that progressives having progressive children isn't a reliable strategy to bring about lasting social change.  

For instance, NYT also points to research indicating that there is no reason to suspect that each successive generation is more worldly, more progressive, and more driven to make positive change: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/upshot/why-teenagers-may-be-getting-more-conservative.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0

And in addition to that, the idea of people bringing about change by having enough children to tip the voter demographics in their favor is just not a strategy that plays to progressives' strengths.

> Also cherry picking the worst Republican senator up there. There are a few that preach but by and large Republicans pass laws and try to enforce their shit that way. We don't preach people mainly because we get shouted down my people on the left. So naturally we got tired of that.

And yet he's still Senate Minority leader...seems like the Republicans in charge are VERY happy with current leadership. Lots of other vocal dumbasses like MTG running around preaching all day, too. I know a SHIT-ton of local leadership here in the Midwest do nothing *but* tie their arguments to so-called Christian beliefs.

And ""shouted down""? Maybe if they weren't such obvious self-serving hypocrites, or respected Separation of Church and State, they wouldn't get so much backlash! Lots of corrupt Dems in leadership, but they keep their mouths shut and seem to get a lot less backlash. Biden barely speaks, while the previous few Repub leaders couldn't STFU.

3260	"&gt; I think this is the source of our confusion. I'm beginning with the assumption that it's a human life, but not that that automatically means it's equivalent to a person that's been born. As I explained above, I don't see a way it ever could be.

I agree with your assessment of the question of whether a fetus can be distinguished from a child.

The problem is that your analysis does not actually justify abortion if you take the pro-life premise, it merely equivocates on the semantics of what that premise is. Which is, simply put, not entirely in good faith. I did it too, for a long while.

Yes, if we use the term ""human life"" in a different way than they mean, we can come up with a different conclusion. But that's just talking past each other.

&gt;But nowhere did I see it stipulated that, if we accept life begins at conception, we also must accept the definitions and categories put forth by pro life people

That's pretty well indicated by his use of pro-life terminology, he is asking on a fundamental level ""if the pro-life assessment of what a fetus represents is taken as true, can abortion be justified."" If he were just asking ""can we define a human life differently from pro-lifers"", that's a very different question.

To say nothing of his repeated use of ""the debate is over how we define when it begins."" He is asking for whether there is something more to the debate than ""what does a fetus represent at a given point.""

&gt;I'm saying that, if we were to accept that a fetus is a human life

Okay, take the semantics out. Not a debate over whether ""human life"" allows for some categories wherein the life can be ended arbitrarily and by an individual, I'll ask simply:

Can you justify abortion if we begin with the pro-life belief that a fetus is ethically and morally equivalent to a child?

Not whether you can argue against that belief, or think the belief is dumb.

&gt;I'd imagine it would require its own category of justifiable killing as well.

That's kind of circular, don't you think? ""Yes in order to justify killing a fetus we have to create a category which justifies killing a fetus.""

&gt;Lol, come on now. Adoption exists. If it didn't exist, families, friends, organizations and random strangers willing to care for abandoned kids would still exist. Or are you suggesting this is happening in a world where only mothers and their unwanted kids exist?

More that as a thought experiment, introducing a solution which can't exist for abortion just doesn't do anything. It'd be like saying ""well we should ban abortions because there could exist a thing which takes the fetus out but it survives."""	23	"['can be distinguished', ""'s pretty well indicated"", 'is taken', 'be justified', 'can be ended']"	5	3	0.13043478260869565	1	"[""'s pretty well indicated by""]"	1	1	0.043478260869565216	1	"['can be distinguished', ""'s pretty well indicated"", 'is taken', 'be justified', 'can be ended']"	5	3	0.13043478260869565	1	29521005448	11	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6n7eru/_/dk81ll4/	401773962	29520960810.0	2017-07-14 15:22:21		BolshevikMuppet	1	False	466	5	False	True	60.24

&gt;  
&gt;But in the context of ""The Chinese, by and large, eat with chopsticks rather than forks"" it's very easy to see that ""the Chinese"" here means the people.

Again, neither one of these examples are of relevant, because the contents in which you can reasonable infer from are already in the sentences itself, the post's title however, is simply ""Fuck the Chinese"", which is more oftenly used when someone actually mean ""Fuck the Chinese people""  than the sentence  ""the Chinese are widely assumed to be behind several hacking attacks against US companies.""  can be interperted as "" ""the Chinese people are widely assumed to be behind several hacking attacks against US companies.""

Trying to imply that interpreting Chinese as ""Chinese people"" in the phrase ""Fuck the Chinese"" is the same as interpreting it the same way in your example is just dishonest.

&gt;No one, because there isn't a massive conversation about racism on reddit happening right now. There is a massive conversation about the Chinese government happening right now.

why should the amount of attentions on China and Hong Kong have any bearing on the unspoken meaning/contents of the phrase ""fuck the Chinese"" and how we should infer it? If I mean the Chinese government, I mean the Chinese government, if I mean the Chinese people , I mean the Chinese people, it's all up to the person's choice when they make the post, and I don't see why the amount of discussion related to the topic they are posting about necessarily have ANY bearing at all in how they chose the word, nor do I see why the people who upvote the post ""understood from contexts"" that Chinese refer to the Chinese government here.

And another point I'm address is, if reddit truly do not tolerate racism why is it that the post is sitting at 90% upvotes? when its title is ambiguously suggesting the OP has a problem with Chinese people?

3273	"I don't want to get too much into reddit tonight, I'm afraid this might be a messy post, but I do want to emphasize a few things. First that bullying is a two-party interaction. Coping skills are somewhat helpful for improving the quality of life of someone who has been bullied, of course. I sure wish I had discovered the stuff that works sooner, I got advice like ""sticks and stones."" However, it stands to reason to me that coping skills would also be helpful for improving the quality of life of someone who is inclined to bully, such that they are less likely to. The cliches are real as I'm sure you're aware, bullies very often have their own demons. It's economics in a sense, supply and demand of a service that harms the customer but is forced upon them. You're helping at least two kids, the bully and whomever he might target next, for the price of teaching coping skills to one.

The gist of my counterargument to your OP is this, I think. If I have a kid, I want their school to be keeping an eye on the bullying situation, right? I don't want those teachers, counselors, and administrators using their hunches about what is most effective, I want them to use whatever methods the consensus of science on the matter informs one to use. So not only my kid is less likely to get bullied at school, AND if he does get bullied he gets help, AND if he bullies another kid he gets extra help as opposed to getting arrested or worse. I can't know in advance which outcome my kid will have, or which particular protocol would be most effective for them. When he's one age he might be a bit of a bully, later bullied, usually only a bystander. I want the best for him in all of those sitations. The optimal approach for such a case-by-case problem is going to be one long decison tree.

Spending a year or two in a minimum wage while getting to know a new place is not a big risk. It lets you get your foot in the door in that place, it lets you get to know the work climate of your new place, and build a work history there. You often then apply to bigger, more stable, non-minimum-wage jobs and start working your way up.  

Yes, most Aussies in the Canadian mountains are there to spend a season or a couple seasons having fun.  Yes, that is different from permanently relocating. They are examples of the first type I mentioned: 
&gt;Some of them are just enjoying living a season or two somewhere cool and will then return home and get a more stable job."".  

But a smaller proportion are interested in staying, or get to know the new country and decide they are interested in staying. and they fall into the other mentioned parts: 
&gt; Some of them are interested in immigrating, and take whatever jobs are available until they can get established and work up to better jobs and eventually have a stable, well-paying job in the new place they like better than the one in which they were born.  
Some of them simply like doing different things and plan to spend some time here and then move somewhere else new and different and interesting and do the same thing there for a while and never intend to get a stable, well-paid job, in their homeland or otherwise.

Some other examples? I have a grandfather who grew up in Germany, got a solid job as a young adult that he could have stuck with and build a life on, but he just didn't much care for Germany and the town in which he lived. So he left. He moved to Canada. He took whatever job he could get to allow him to live there - picking tobacco.  And then he took other, better jobs, and worked his way into a stable life in the new country. And he lived a happy life there and enjoyed visiting Germany regularly, but never had any desire to move back to live.  
I have a friend who worked as a teacher in Chile, and could have stuck with that, but wanted to do something different. So she spent a year in Australia working minimum-wage jobs in beach towns, and then moved to Canada, where she spent a few more years in minimum-wage jobs improving her English and building her work history, and eventually got a more stable job and permanent residency, then citizenship, and intends to stay for life.    
I have another friend who was a first-generation child of immigrant parents who grew up happy in Canada, graduated with a degree in engineering, and could easily have taken a stable job and spent the rest of her life in the province where she was born, but she wanted to do something different, so she moved to India. And she built a life there, and is happy there, and feels no desire to go home to Canada.  

Search the internet. Search reddit. You'll find millions of examples. Some people move abroad, love it, and enjoy a few years and then move home. Some people move abroad, hate it, and decide they're better off at home. Some people move abroad, love it, and build a new life and stay in that country and live the rest of their lives there.

3283	"&gt;For children, gender is linked to what games you play, what clothes you wear, what groups you hang out with

I agree.  And kids are really fickle.  I'd be lying if I said that I never dressed up as a girl and played with dolls.  I had a younger sister who would constantly dress my little brother in girl clothes and put make-up on him.  We thought it was funny.  

But because of those future serious, sexual consequences that you mention, I don't think we should encourage or accept them claiming they are a different gender and requiring we treat them as such. 

&gt;But is it healthier to reinforce a position that is apparently causing the child problems now in the present while its brain is developing?

I'd treat it like a kid who wants to get a tattoo or join the military.  I'd ask my hypothetical child to really think about it, look inside themselves, and if that's how they want to live their lives, when they are an 18  year old adult, I'll accept them for however they choose. 

&gt;I am a male. I can't imagine how shitty my life would have been if people **insisted I act female all along**, and told me when I'm 18 I can switch it up if I'd like. 

I'm not sure I follow this, but it sounds like you are reinforcing my point.  I don't think we should insist anything about regarding a child's sexual identity.  I'd raise the child as their birth gender, I'd allow my child to behave any way he/she wants at home (within reason), but I don't think that behavior should be reinforced because it's very complicated and could have serious consequences in the future.

In what way are conditions worse?

Which means there is demand for their labor. Otherwise they would not be able to find a job and would not be better off.

&gt;he immigrant and refugee crisis in Europe is devastating countries and economies and it is 100% not self regulating

Refugees are very different than immigrants. Those people are fleeing, not moving, economics is not playing a role. 

&gt; In places like France you have huge immigrant populations that hate the French and create a breeding ground for turmoil and hate (though largely due to historical prejudice).

Well actually the problem is Islam. Again, not really relevant to the discussion at hand.

&gt; In the UK they are tightening immigration policies to force ppl out because the have an excess. 

Well that just isn't true. UK just left the EU, so again not really relevant when looking at EU's open borders policy.

&gt;Countries like Greece and other eastern Europe countries are plummeting financially, and not because of immigration and refugees but that is piling on top.

Greece doesn't receive many refugees and is doing poorly financially because of bad governmental decisions. They are part of the EU and their population is allowed to travel freely to other european countries if they so desired. 

&gt;I just didn't understand what you meant.


I meant that having open borders is self regulating and that the EU has had open borders (to other european nations) for decades now. 

&gt;You live in California and you're cool with it? Cool with what? Cool with 10s of thousands of people living in your state but not paying taxes while your state has some of the highest taxes in the country and is struggling financially?

They pay taxes and receive less benefits than the rest of us. They also tend to have incomes such that they don't really pay income tax. 

Their tax rate is between 10-15 annually and 1-4% for state taxes. They pay on average 8%. While it is lower than what they should be paying, it is not really our largest tax problem and they are an overall boost to the economy. This also not their fault. It is a side effect of them being undocumented. They would happily be documented if they could. 

We are going to have them no matter what, if we document them, there are no down sides.

&gt;You are cool with illegal workers taking jobs for 2 dollars an hour while places like San Francisco are chock full of citizens who can't afford to rent an apartment?

I am not okay with any illegal immigrants being payed 2 dollars an hour. If there are any I would like to inform them that they can and should sue their employer for unpaid wages.

I also think that if you don't have a good source of income you should not live in the most expensive city in the world. Just a thought. 

&gt;Like make them citizens and expect them to start explaining to their employers they now need 15 an hour for the same work and start taxing them and pay to put 11 million through the naturalization process?

Absolutely. For the most part illegal workers get paid minimum wage though. Gardeners usually get paid far above minimum wage.

But you are right, naturalizing them and collecting income tax is a way that they can help their state even more.

Yeah, but they **aren't** just saying that, they specifically try to cloak their inaction in a higher moral call, as a way to imply support for one or both sides, that is sadly limited by states rights. 

If a politician just said ""I don't have strong feelings about gay marriage, and I don't want to lose votes because of it, so I will oppose neither liberals nor conservatives on it"", that would get panned by liberals as a homophobic unwillingness to step up for equal rights, and by conservatives as an unwillingness to act personally opposed to immoral behavior. 

Saying that ""gay marriage is a states rights issue"", is a way to put an extra layer of obfuscation in front of it, let only those voters who can read dogwhistles figure out what it means, while posturing to low information voters as being morally concerned about a specific philosophy that isn't really relevant there.

But in this model, the clock is no longer a constraint (an overtime field goal is the same as a field goal with zeros on the clock), so what previously was an exciting frantic scramble now turns into a pretty normal drive that will still feel kind of shitty if it ends the game on a field goal in the first overtime drive, whereas if it ended on a last-second field goal, that would have been really exciting.

So the big concern here is that this is going to result in a lot of games that previously were resolved in regulation by a 2-minute drill ending in a field goal, but now are going to end in a first drive OT field goal, just because now there's no rush.

&gt;You get less experience with sex and romantic relationships so you will be more immature in them and be a bad partner so you will get less partners and have a lower chance of ever getting a meaningful relationship.

Not as correlated as you seem to think. Many people are terrible in relationships despite lots of experience, and in fact, people who are bad partners often have *more* relationships, because their relationships are short-lived and they hop between them quickly.

Secondly, inexperienced people can absolutely be good partners, because being a good romantic partner doesn't involve many, if any traits, that don't also go into being a good friend and family member. Romantic relationships are not that fundamentally different from other ways of being close to a person.

Third, any learning curve is not going to continue forever. Do you keep getting better at a constant rate as you spend more time in a relationship? No. Someone who's been dating for ten years is not inherently going to be a better partner than someone who's been dating for 5-8 years. Say it takes three or four years to get ""good"" at being in a relationship—so what? Doesn't matter when those four years happen, whether from 18-22 or 26-30.

And teenage/YA dating experience often *isn't* that helpful. High school and even college relationships are often unstable and dramatic, with many participants showing a lot of immaturity because of age, not inexperience. Who is going to handle a relationship more maturely, a thirty-year-old in their first or second relationship, or an eighteen-year-old in their fourth?"	14	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	29931148496	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7ilwbl/_/dr08dzk/	454517985		2017-12-09 17:03:05		PermafrostHeart	1	False	287	1	False	True	52.09

I mean honestly that seems like a *vast* potential for meaning.  To the point that it might [give ""set"" a run for its money](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/english-word-with-the-most-meanings/).

No. No court system can do that on its own. 

&gt; If not, why would Hong Kong even have a court system if it can't distill the truth from a matter?

Because it can rely on the police force not submitting manufactured evidence in the first place, it can (and must) rely on the internal checks against police corruption working. This is a worldwide issue - courts must be able to trust the police force is doing the right thing. If it doesn't, the whole system falls apart, everywhere.

3328	"&gt;OK. So someone has to make a sacrifice.

I think it's most reasonable to expect the non-sexual spouse to ""sacrifice"" by letting the sexual spouse have sex outside of marriage. If the non-sexual spouse is forcing the sexual spouse into a situation where they either have to choose between:

1) Poverty for them and/or their kids

2) Celibacy.

3) Cheating.

I think it's reasonable for the sexual spouse to choose the cheating because the non-sexual spouse is putting the sexual spouse is being **controlling** in a very unfair way. Plus, if the non-sexual spouse had no interest in sex or working to generate interest in sex, why should they care if their spouse was having sex with someone else?

&gt; Then you have to seperate. 

Do you really think that separation is the best option if it sends the kids into poverty?

&gt;Cheating doesn't fix anything, and when you get caught you won't be able to see your kids.

First of all, not everyone who cheats gets caught. If they don't get caught, how would you know that they cheated unless you're the one they're cheating with?

Secondly, how do we know that the spouse who isn't interested in having sex isn't having an affair? Sometimes when one spouse isn't sexually interested in the other, it's because they're cheating themselves.

Ultimately, not allowing your spouse to have sex with anyone, without any intention on that changing is very controlling, especially if you know that the family members are dependent on the marriage remaining intact."	13	['get caught', 'gets caught', 'get caught']	3	3	0.23076923076923078	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['get caught', 'gets caught', 'get caught']	3	3	0.23076923076923078	1	28615092532	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4s7sy0/_/d58oqpg/	289258056	28614978258.0	2016-07-11 23:00:33		jm0112358	2	False	254	3	False	True	60.14

3347	"In 1972 there was an attempt to turn some submerged reefs into [artificial islands and an independent libertarian micronation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Reefs). The reef was made into an island and announced in January 1972, and by September the islands were occupied by the nation of Tonga. Since then the artificial islands have been at the hear of a series of incident and disputes between the nations of [Tonga and Fiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji%E2%80%93Tonga_relations#2010.2F2011:_Minerva_Reefs_and_Mara_conflicts). Similar attempts have been warned off by national governments. It's pretty unlikely that someone would be able to build an artificial or reclaimed island in order to test a libertarian community from scratch.

All parts of major land masses are either nominally or in practice controlled by a nation. Even if you're talking about the odd slivers of land not nominally controlled by Serbia or Croatia are *in practice* administered by one or the other. There are a handful of ambiguous places that are so devoid of life and value that it would be pointless to try.

Attempts at ""Seasteading"" or establishing habitation in international waters outside the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of nations haven't gotten off the ground despite several organizations really trying for it. There are just too many technical challenges that have not yet been resolved. It's also important to note that according to existing international law they wouldn't create an economic zone around themselves either, so there is no diplomatic framework to protect the interests of seasteaders in conflict with citizens of recognized nations.

Quite frankly, if you want to have an experiment larger than the handful of ""Intentional Communities"" (there are a handful of libertarian villages or townships, but that really isn't proof of concept for larger political and economic groups) you're going to need to have something a lot like the Free State Project. There just aren't unclaimed, habitable places in the world for people to move to and build from scratch. Wherever they go or whatever they do they'll be at least nominally hacking off a part of an existing state."	14	['was made', 'were occupied', 'have been warned', 'administered by one', 'been resolved']	5	4	0.2857142857142857	1	['were occupied by', 'administered by one']	2	2	0.14285714285714285	1	['was made', 'were occupied', 'have been warned', 'been resolved']	4	3	0.21428571428571427	1	28710759089	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4z62y4/_/d6tn7ht/	300935020	28709935473.0	2016-08-23 16:19:27		A_Soporific	2	False	335	0	True	True	38.76

Okay. Have you noticed that some headphones, the heavily moulded ones in particular, produce a much more muffled sound when used the ""wrong"" way? Putting them on the right way fixes that particular problem right away. It's because of how the earbuds rest against different parts in the ear canal.

This is definitely not a universal thing, since dollar store earbuds (or even the old Apple earbuds) are basically moulded the same way. But for premium headphones you're just losing music quality by putting them in the ""wrong"" way."	8	['are basically moulded']	1	1	0.125	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are basically moulded']	1	1	0.125	1	27871768985	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3cqvyq/_/csy4ql5/	202808402	27871755913.0	2015-07-09 22:56:40		RustyRook	3	False	106	1	False	True	70.43
3349	"The reality from a philosophical view, I think, is that we don’t know if suffering is an actually evil thing. The so called “logical form of evil” isn’t convincing proof of a lack of god because we simply don’t understand the purpose of evil or suffering. We also don’t have the ability to measure all good and evil, we can’t say decisively which one prevails in society.

The way I see it, if god exists (and I do think he exists, to some extent, though I don’t consider myself religious) then suffering is pretty much fine. Victor Frankle said that if there is meaning to everything, then the suffering probably does have grand point. I mean, if god exists, death isn’t a bad thing, it could even be consider a good thing since the struggles of life would be beyond us and we can return to peace. There would still be evil in the world, but if death is actually one of the best things that can happen to a person, then all the death in the world would be a fantastic thing since it would take away the struggle. 

Put simply, I don’t believe all the evil in the world proves anything about God. It just proves we don’t like it, which I’m fine with. I’m glad injustice upsets everyone.

3350	" You've raised multiple points I wouldn't have necessarily thought of, and made the issue more nuanced. Thank you for that.

&gt; At many institutions a grade of A, B, or C gets converted to a pass, while a grade of D or F gets converted to a fail. Under normal conditions a grade of D still earns credit, and unless the course is for a student's major still meets the requirement.

A lot of colleges already allow you to take elective (non-major) classes as pass fail if you decide to do so by a certain point in the semester. I could see extending that existing deadline perhaps, since these courses aren't nearly as important career-wise.

&gt; Many students need particular grades in key classes in order to meet licensure requirements. If pass/fail is mandatory (and their licensing boards don't loosen restrictions) then all of those students would need to retake those classes. 

This is an argument aganst pass/fail in general then, since the optional version won't help these students anyway. That is of course assuming inflexible licensing boards. I'd imagine those boards are panicking as we speak about this very issue. I can't see them outright denying so many students, given the number of schools that have adopted or will adopt a mandatory policy.

&gt; Many students are currently retaking courses in order to raise their GPA. If pass/fail becomes mandatory all the money they spent on retaking those courses is now wasted. 

Sort of the same as above. Distance learning will make it harder for students to use any class as a GPA booster under letter grading, some disproportionately so. The whole idea behind pass/fail is that the crisis will hit some people harder than others, often the same people who have difficulty in the first place (their home is poor environment for learning in some way). If you already need a GPA booster because of those factors, then they are going to make it impossible to use a letter-graded class for that purpose under these new circumstances."	15	['gets converted', 'gets converted', 'is now wasted']	3	2	0.13333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['gets converted', 'gets converted', 'is now wasted']	3	2	0.13333333333333333	1	33932995536	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fmyu50/_/fl6tuxc/	945569556	33932913284.0	2020-03-22 11:19:56		[deleted]	1	False	339	3	False	True	60.85
3351	"&gt;I don't see the principled or the practical reasons for the Fifth Amendment ""right to remain silent"" in a criminal proceeding.


http://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=2545
 

I recommend this excellent comment about the 5th amendment (the comic is about law in general, but here’s the start of the 5th amendment stuff). 

&gt;I don't see a rational reason why the court shouldn't be able to ask you questions subject to the same rules that the court can ask questions of any other witness
 

Basically, you can’t get any witness to admit to elements of a crime if it would implicate them. So it is the same as any other time. There’s not some magic shield that only happens when you are the suspect. It’s that regardless of your role in the courtroom, the state cannot compel an answer that would self incriminate. 

&gt;why can't the prosecutor just ask you, ""Fine, if it wasn't you, then what did you see happen?"" What is a rational reason why we don't allow this?

Because that answer could self incriminate. What if someone else shot them, and you let them get away? Then you would be an accomplice to the crime. 

&gt;In that spirit, I'm looking for an answer in the form of a specific scenario where the outcome with the Fifth Amendment is better (by any criteria you can defend) is better than the outcome without the Fifth Amendment.

I think calls for a hypothetical don’t actually get to the point of the principle. It’s unlikely to get to the answer you want. The issue is; even if you don’t torture someone, police questioning is by its’ very nature coercive. Once you are arrested, you cannot leave questioning on your own. You can’t just walk out of jail. 

By realizing this coercion, you realize why people may say things that aren’t true, to try and make the coercion stop. Add in that the police can lie to you, and the idea is that if you can’t compel testimony that self incriminates, it makes the rest of your testimony more reliable. It means that you aren’t worried about telling a lie, because you need to avoid making yourself look bad. So it helps the courts, because they can now better trust what you are saying. You have an out if you need it, so by not taking it, it makes your testimony more credible. 

&gt;to ask her questions about Bob’s alleged illegal activities, and try to convict Alice if they find a contradiction.

Why wouldn’t Alice and her lawyer have a cohesive testimony if she’s innocent? I’m confused by this one. Also, if you start with a corrupt town, don’t you necessarily have corrupt results? I mean they could just do an ‘accidental’ no-knock raid on Alice and shoot her while she sleeps. So I don’t see why playing coy is important here. 

&gt;The problem is this statement about the ""burden of proof"" leaves out that the state is authorized to do certain things -- for example, get a search warrant for your house, or subpoena your friends -- in search of proof
 

Right, both of these are about things that already exist. The state can find things that exist (what you own, your friend’s testimony but not hearsay) and bring them to court. The state cannot force you to create some that does not exist (your testimony). That’s consistent. 

&gt;what is a rational argument for why the prosecution should be allowed to do those things, but not to ask questions of the defendant.
 

Because the state can obtain things that exist, but cannot ask for the creation of testimony. 

&gt;If you had to choose between having one of two rights that cannot be abridged until you’re actually convicted, and you can choose (1) the right not to answer questions, or (2) the right not to have your house and possessions searched, I would always pick (2). Wouldn’t you?
 

False dichotomy, you can have both, so I don’t see what is wrong here. Additionally, the point is that the state can find evidence, but can’t create it.

Here’s your example:

C is dead. B was in the room with C at the time (they were playing videogames). A poisoned C for reasons known to A. You can change video games to any activity you want btw. 

C goes into cardiac arrest after screaming at B for “leet haxxors” or something, because of B’s superior game-playing skills. B thinks they were part of the chain of events that killed C. B is legitimately mistaken, because C would not have had the fatal heart attack without A’s poison. So A is the true murder. All the poison in C’s system is metabolized before tested by the police. 

We (the omniscient observers) know B is innocent. However, the State finds B to be in the room at the time, and engaging in a behavior that could aggravate A’s heart.  So, when they ask B with the 5th amendment, B can take the 5th. They don’t have to admit to anything that happens in the room, they have no traces of the poison on them 

Without the 5th, the state can get B to admit:

B was there
B and C were engaged in an activity that could lead to the heart attack
(and because B thinks they were a cause of C’s death) that C would not have died if B was not present.

That’s at least some elements of a felony in some states (It’s no murder 1, but I think a case for negligence or recklessness is possible if B knew C had a heart condition for example).

3352	"^Then ^your ^title ^is ^a ^bit ^misleading ^;)

The problem with your point of view is that it could apply to a lot of things that we normally enjoy. 

There's no *necessity* to play an instrument or to listen to music. There is no *necessity* to read novels. There is no *necessity* to produce and enjoy any form of art. There is no *necessity* to understand quantum particles if you want to be a lawyer, as much as there is no *necessity* to understand Bilateral Investment Treaties if you are a quantum physicist. And thus, there's no *necessity* to understand any concept of philosophy if you are not a philosopher.

**That being said**, the fact is that we may have an interest in these particular things although we are not professionally implicated because - to sum it up - we like them. It can also *help* us in many ways, but not always is our career path. Nevertheless, do you really think we should avoid doing anything that's out of our career path? I think not. I happen to have taken a course in pol. phil. although I'm a law student, because I like it, and it allows me to have sort of a ""break"" in my week. In my opinion, building and enjoying yourself is as much important as preparing your career. Not every thing in life can be summed up into dolla-dolla-bills.

Now let's take a look at your sister's argument. She thinks you shouldn't take Philosophy because it will not help you in law school. I'll put aside the fact that I totally disagree with her, since philosophy teaches you how to defend a POVs you don't necessarily agree with, which is something you will do e'rry day as a lawyer or jurist. 

I think every subject you can take is beneficial to you. Every piece of structured knowledge you can acquire will help you somewhere and at some point. Philosophy and music have both helped me in my studies, though I was a ""scientific"" HS student, and now a law student. Not taking some of theses subjects because you assume there are not helping you in your career path is (1) Arbitrary: what do you really know about it? (2) Close-minded: not every thing in life (especially in college life) can - and *nothing should* - be summed up to career issues. Lots of successful people happen to be very good at mastering various sorts of knowledge and learning processes.

So I encourage you to learn philosophy: enjoy your life and learn new things, because these are the things that will help you go through your career. Not a *robotic* devotion to something.

He talked about how great Germany was and the Aryan race, but he wasn't German or Aryan, and the Aryan race doesn't even exist but was made up in the late 19th century. 

His book, Mein Kampf, was written in two parts. The first he did himself and it is just a long, boring rant about communists and how hard it was for Hitler to keep a job. The second half was ghost written and was more interesting and contains the racial ideology that he's known for, but he didn't write it himself.

Hitler didn't become known as a great speaker until desperation overtook the German people and they looked to the Nazi party because they had predicted the collapse of the German economy. This led people to go see his speeches where he went into a trance and just used the inherent power of the German language to play with people's emotions, and it addicted them.

English translations of his work seem powerful, but it was standard speech for German politics at the time. What addicted people was the false hope he was selling people and not the content of his speeches.

A little known fact is that that Hitler learned the art of his speeches from a Jewish mystic and conman, named [Erik Jan Hanussen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Jan_Hanussen) who taught Hitler how to get his audience into a trance, and Hitler had him killed then so no one would learn this secret.

Christianity tells its practitioners that faith, the ability to believe things without proof, is a virtue. That it’s worthy of respect and admiration. That if you believe something with no proof, then your faith is strong, and as the thing you believe starts to look incorrect, then your faith becomes stronger as you keep believing in it.

None of this is actually true. It’s okay to believe only things that are proven, and when others demand you believe something, it’s okay to demand proof first.

If I approach it from a view of what we define it as and get an official grounding on it. Then that would be a different approach. In the sense of we are looking and defined definitions.

Identity can be tricky, especially when we consider that yeah how a person approaches gender and sexuality does play a part into it. I think I can approach the respect route if I entirely endorse that while I do not see a firm grounding in all of them from a terminology standpoint. I can say that they at least identify as such, and while I may not do it myself and see issues with it. I can see from a viewpoint I adopt that I can see it being A-ok if I go with the there is no grounding, therefore anything is fine and deserves respect. 

Wrestling with my thoughts would be correct, but more so to challenge my idea that if I go with 110% respect on it, would another viewpoint still be acceptable, such as I do not find the idea palatable myself but if I take the viewpoint of there is no grounding to them, therefore it's all A-ok then you get my view in the OP.

3380	"I think you're conflating popular trends within genres to the genres themselves. Maybe that's justified in a more fluid genre like pop, but for rock, hip-hop, etc., it doesn't hold up. This is evident when you consider how many people are fans of rock, but don't like Nickelback, who have  pretty much become the epitome of bland commercialized music.

Or when you consider people who hate Justin Bieber and Ke$ha, but love Michael Jackson. Or who hate Nicki Minaj and Lil Jon but love Biggie Smalls. Just because music within a genre has become something that is easily produced and overly-commercialized, does not make that whole genre inferior.

&gt;if you look at many forms of art, it is often the case that an artist's most popular work (or performance) of art is not nearly the favourite of the artist himself

I think that's a poor metric. Going beyond music for a moment, a lot of authors whose books are turned into famous movies [hate](http://mentalfloss.com/article/31001/11-authors-who-hated-movie-versions-their-books) the movies even as audiences and critics worldwide love them. Ultimately, the artist's intentions do not necessarily translate to what audiences will see in their work, and vice versa. Harry Potter was rescued from the reject bin, as I recall. Suffice to say that the inverse is also true: it is often the case that the favorite of the artist himself is not the most popular.

&gt;it is often the case that artists create or perform popular works of art only because they need to

Why does that poison entire genres of music for you? Why don't you just say that some rap music is just for the money, for example? You seem to be jumping to conclusions when you castigate the whole genre. Most artists who start composing their own music do so primarily because they have a passion for it. It's only once they become blindingly famous that the secondary motivator of money comes into play, and even then, only sometimes. Hence why Nickelback used to be good, but now they're shit, for instance. They're bad now, but what's important is *they made good rock music in the past, before they just wanted the money*.

&gt;My view is that there are more pieces of classical music on the ""reasonably certainly good"" area of the spectrum than any other genre. I think it's reasonable to say this is simply the case because classical music developed over centuries whereas most other contemporary genres have not existed for more than a century. 

This is a point I wanted to make when I showed you those examples of classical-ish music at the onset. For one thing, yes, it is fair to say that classical has had centuries to develop and therefore has had far more time to come out with good pieces. However that knowledge hasn't ""gone away."" It's been used, and is being used, in modern music. I chose the examples I did because I think it's a little more apparent there, but throughout all genres, there are trends, trends which arose from previous songs, which were based on previous trends, which can be traced back to classical. As I said before, different scales, harmonies, deceptive cadences, crescendos, are all innovations of the classical period. They haven't disappeared, they've propagated. Maybe it's harder to see now with the lyrics and autotune, but you have to remember the whole reason autotune exists is to bring the singer to a certain key and pitch, a concept which was perfected in classical music.

So I think it could be argued that classical should be regarded not only as a genre but also a starting point for modern music. It was popular worldwide earlier than any other genre of music, and has influenced everything we hear on the radio immensely. So the lessons it imparts haven't been forgotten, they've been appropriated. And just as the first bananas ever eaten aren't ""better"" than the bananas you get at the grocery store, classical music that innovated what we've since perfected is not necessarily ""better"" than modern forms of music. Maybe people nowadays don't appreciated because they've become accustomed to more modern styles, but that doesn't make either style superior. Rather they have different strengths and weaknesses, and comparing classical to hip-hop is about as stark a contrast as comparing jazz to electronic. There's no clear winner; just favorites."	35	"[""'s justified"", 'is easily produced', 'are turned', 'was rescued', ""'s been used"", 'is being used', 'can be traced', 'was perfected', 'could be argued', 'should be regarded', 'been forgotten', ""'ve been appropriated""]"	12	9	0.2571428571428571	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'s justified"", 'is easily produced', 'are turned', 'was rescued', ""'s been used"", 'is being used', 'can be traced', 'was perfected', 'could be argued', 'should be regarded', 'been forgotten', ""'ve been appropriated""]"	12	9	0.2571428571428571	1	26682991535	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bn6nr/_/c9ad41b/	80023671	26682687838.0	2013-04-07 16:01:17		Fat_Crossing_Guard	1	False	725	3	True	True	60.04
3381	But like realistically what your asking for is simply an overhaul of our prison system.  If we tomorrow said that's it prison overhaul rehabilitation time, in no world are we just deleting federal prisons, we already have facilities all over the US that are designed for holding potentially dangerous criminals.  We can have nicer amenities in the cells, overhaul the rec time, overhaul the food, have therapists 24/7 available, have the inmates go to school, replace prison guards with buff social workers whatever, totally transform the prison system, but ultimately those prisons will still be the same buildings, we will still imprison people for years in them, and we will still release them when the terms of thier imprisonment is up.  We can even call them rehabilitation centers, but at the end of the day, we are still imprisoning people in the same exact buildings we used to with nicer outcomes, that's why this strange focus on some people go to prison and some go to rehabilitation is kind of pointless, ideally we just overhaul the system and people in jail for 2 months and people in jail for 10 years have a similar experience, livable conditions and support for how long they are there, the divide just wouldn't and shouldn't matter if the goal of overhauling the prison system is realized. There is no real point to making this distinction, I think people in county jail for 1 month should have access to the same things people in federal jail for ten years should and vise versa.  It makes no sense to give every violent major crime access to therapists and a education while someone who steals is stuck in a cell in county for 1 month with less access to therapists and missing 1 month of classes.  Any change to the prison system just needs to be comprehensive, no prison or rehabilitation shenanigans just rehabilitation period.  It seems strange to focus on rehabilitation then just make it possible for people to first time offend, get thrown in county for a month with less help, then reoffend and get thrown into federal prison for 5 years to be rehabilitated.

3384	"&gt;If you're in the position to be making decisions about pulling the plug on someone, you have taken on the legal caretaker responsibility then as well, so this is no distinction. You are definitionally the one responsible for their well-being since that's the only way you'd have the ability to pull the plug/starve them to death. The reason you can exercise your responsibility in this way is because they are brain-damaged. As you've pointed out, when you have this responsibility over someone who isn't brain-damaged, you can't do the same thing.

You have a responsibility for their well-being, but what that responsibility entains is very different.  In the case of a child, there's a standard-issue package of responsibilities.  In the case of an adult who is brain-dead, there is a different package of responsibilities which normally includes making the decision whether or not to continue life support.

In other words, the difference is in what we consider ""well-being"" to entail in each case.

&gt;The machine keeping someone alive that you're going to turn off isn't your machine either... I'm not sure where you're going with that one. And also, your relation to the person changes nothing in this example if you were going to go down that route too...if it was my spouse whose pacemaker I turned off because I wanted them dead, I would be guilty of murder then too. This is because they are not brain-damaged.

It is, actually.  In the case of brain damage to the extent where would would have power of attorney, you're the one with authority over the machine.  It's not ""yours"" in that you don't own it, but I'm sure you understand that's not really the point.  You're the one who's assumed the direct relationship with the hospital, so for most intents you're the one ""leasing"" it or similar.

You're right that the relationship makes no difference, but I never claimed it to.  The difference is who owns the pacemaker.  If you own it, you can turn it off or ask for it back.  If you don't, contravening their authority over it leaves you legally responsible for the results.

&gt;Even if there were, then one can just ""let them die"" in any case we're talking about. This doesn't change the overall question, whether its fetuses or infants.

It does.  In the case of a pre-viable fetus abortion only entails letting it die, in the case of a post-viable fetus abortion entails killing it.  This is what makes the difference in the first place.

&gt;By what standard? They're just choosing to favor groups they're a member of, regardless of what individual capacities a particular individual may have. That's what you're arguing for.

No, that's not what I'm arguing for.  From a rational perspective, it's not unreasonable to suggest that the human average should convey different rights/privileges/treatment than the animal average.  See your arguments on capacity.  The white average and the black average generally don't justify the disparate treatment that is being advocated.

&gt;There is no way to say that any arbitrary genetic group membership is more valid than any other, because those features are not what relate to any of the questions asked. How would race/sex/species ever be able to inform you about whether it's okay to, say, set someone on fire? There's no connection between those attributes. However, there is a connection between being able to feel pain and the question.

Just to be clear, does this mean you would consider it okay to set someone with CIP on fire?  Again, the point is about averages.  I'm arguing that in some cases it's reasonable to make those divisions based on genetics by looking at the group averages or archetypes, something that's in most cases reasonable.

&gt;I haven't acknowledged it, because that's the whole thing being contested...

No, you did.  You acknowledged that in general, the human average includes the characteristics required.  What we're arguing about is whether we can then extend those rights to the rest of the group.  My point is that whether the human average would grant those rights is settled."	42	"[""'s assumed"", 'is being advocated', 'being contested', 'is settled']"	4	4	0.09523809523809523	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'s assumed"", 'is being advocated', 'being contested', 'is settled']"	4	4	0.09523809523809523	1	26774340673	16	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h8c37/_/casr1hd/	89408563	26774313623.0	2013-06-29 16:08:52		carasci	1	False	680	6	False	True	64.2

However, they also previously took a risk by having sexual intercourse and getting pregnant. They accepted the fact that a child could result and therefore also accepted the fact they are responsible for the child because it is of their own free will.

3404	"&gt;&gt;What do you think about the fact that no Korean team has ever won the biggest title in Dota2, one of the biggest e-sports out there? Or the fact that the regions that tend to be disproportionately represented in Dota2 are primarily western regions, like Canada, Sweden, the Ukraine, etc.?

This could be any number of things really. Though if I were to offer a basic suggestion, there could just be a lack of interest in Non-Blizzard titles and thus a lack of talent for Dota2. 

&gt;&gt;I'd also like to correct your numbers a bit. One can live in most American regions on less than 50k per year fairly easily 

Right, but purses are not consistent winnings. You can lose a tournament. When a Korean player wins, they have their amenities handled for multiple years.


&gt;&gt; Moreover, many e-sports organizations pay their athletes a salary. Digital Chaos pays its Dota2 players 4k per month, which is certainly on the high end, but that sort of money is definitely enough to live off of even without prize purses.

The Esports hub of the U.S. is in the Bay area of California where 4k a month does not even begin to scratch the surface of a livable wage. 4k a month is being able to solo afford a studio apartment and have a couple of nice things. It's hardly luxurious. Especially if 4k is the high end. This is also doubly bad when you consider that it may actually be a limitation of resources if an individual could stream on their own initiative and make more than that.


&gt;And none of this speaks to the fact that people can just move to Korea or a comparable region if it's so much cheaper. By your lights it's not Korea that's suffocating the E-sports scene, it's Americans who insist on living above their means.


Setting aside my entire argument about inhumane treatment which you failed to acknowledge, expecting teams to leave their country is also not a positive thing for Esports, it creates a huge hurdle that players must reconcile with before pursing the career. This would have the same detrimental effects, since Korean players would not have to make this choice and would just bleed western talent by virtue of deterring the many who don't want to have to leave their home country to have a reasonable chance to compete.

One thing to remember though is that amendments supersede all previous regulations, acts, and precedents. The Civil Rights Act is already gendered. The passage of the ERA could result in sections or the entirety of the CRA being struck down by courts. The CRA specifically carved out protections for businesses that are based around a specific gender. For example, Chippendale’s isn’t required to hire female dancers. If the ERA were to be passed, men could sue gentlemen’s clubs for discrimination for not hiring them as dancers.

It deters crime and keeps criminals away from the rest of the population. Some punishments are rehabilitative. But purely as an end in its own right, I see no value in bad things happening to bad people. The very idea that anyone deserves anything is a defense mechanism we've developed because we live in a world that forces us to take risks with limited resources and our own safety. Otherwise we'd believe that good things should happen to everyone all the time.

3414	"&gt; it can, at any point, be suddenly invalidated completely by just one observation.

This is incorrect. Scientific theories can be wrong, and they can be improved. But our understanding won't literally reverse from our current understanding. Newtonian physics isn't false because of Einsteinian physics; there are just places where Einsteinian physics is more accurate. The next great theory will build on Einstein, not demolish him.

&gt; I'm saying that laws should not be grounded in the scientific process because of that very reason. Rarely is the situation even relevant

I don't understand how you could think this. All modern detection is based on the scientific process. We ask ourselves whether a person could have committed a crime and then attempt to prove or disprove that claim with scientific reasoning. This is literally the cornerstone of the modern adversarial justice system.

&gt; So, given those two assumptions, I would say it is safest to consider it murder than to not, if we inherent respect for the human life mentioned in assumption (1).

Respect for the human life doesn't determine that a fetus is a person (which, again, does need to be shown through the scientific process to establish a charge of murder).

&gt; so the innate ""conscience"" that is in us is, frankly, being ignored, or discredited.

This is a lot of your personal philosophy coming in here, that I don't know enough about to debate. But I'm not ignoring my conscience at all. It might surprise you to learn at this stage in the argument that I'm morally against abortion - I still disagree with your arguments.

&gt; But I believe that a scientific mind could not say ""we are 100% sure that life doesn't exist out of the actions of a human""

The scientific mind can, however, differentiate between a potential human and an actual human. Just as the scientific mind can differentiate between a chicken egg and a chicken. Surely one can lead to the other, but they are not the same thing.

Aside from all that: Your claim that it is ""safest"" to err on the side of calling abortion murder assumes that the only moral choice is whether or not to preserve a potential life.

I view it as ""safer"" to err on the side of allowing an adult full control over their own body, and the side of allowing an adult to privately make medical decisions with their doctor. It's not that I don't value potential life but (in certain cases) I view those freedoms as more important."	23	['be suddenly invalidated', 'can be improved', 'be grounded', 'be shown', 'being ignored']	5	4	0.17391304347826086	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be suddenly invalidated', 'can be improved', 'be grounded', 'be shown', 'being ignored']	5	4	0.17391304347826086	1	26740401924	4	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f9oa8/_/ca8jm6c/	86111792	26740351015.0	2013-05-29 23:12:47		gwhandle	2	False	424	5	False	True	61.26

They are inked on someone to be seen, I can't understand why you think because they are inked on someone's bicep opposed to their neck people want them to go unnoticed. 


Edit: I forgot to type that he had plenty of neck/face tattoos, and he was not looking to be perceived as rebellious or negative, he just wanted to showcase a piece of art on a piece of his body.

I'd counter that anything is innocent until proven guilty, and Islam at its core is not an extremist, misogynistic, patriarchal religion, only some sects do make it out to be like that. Just like the WBC and other churches take Christianity to be a ""God hates fags"" hellfire and brimstone religion, whereas most Christians don't accept that doctrine.

The key point here is that to call someone a Muslim is not, and should not ever be, synonymous with ""misogynist, oppressor, patriarch"". Thus - you mentioned nothing about the burkha, so let's get back to it - it doesn't naturally follow that allowing the burkha is endorsing repression or freedom.

2. You were told to bring it in for a warranty claim.
3. You explained that it was damaged because of your misuse.
4. You were told that this has no bearing and that the store would process the claim anyway and it would be fine.

The problem is being defined as Hollywood whitewashing, and not what it actually is (cultures are more comfortable with their own ethnicity in leading roles, and right now in America white people spend the most money at theatres). There is no mention of the fact that in Japanese and other cinema, American/white roles are populated with asian actors. In India the same is done with Indian actors. It isn't an issue unique to America, but this article portrays it that way. The problem is being mis-identified.

I say this as someone who is in the middle of quitting cigarettes cold turkey. And as someone who has lost over 70 lbs. (I'm going to have to change my diet again, as I am using junk food to try to help me quit tobacco)

The fact is, the 'fat acceptance' movement is pretty damn terrible. It's basically a 'lazy acceptance' movement. 

Now, all that being said: Shame is literally one of the worst tools you could grab out of the toolbox for this kind of problem. And that is one reason I can't dig on what you are saying. 

My dad shamed me most of my life for being a fatass. He would frequently ask me what I was going to do when I was in my 30s and couldn't walk because I was such a fat fuck. 

I didn't drop the weight until I decided I needed to do that. You feel me?

Walking around telling people they are disgusting, or they are pieces of shit because of the fat is a SURE way to make some of those folks weight problems worse.

It's the same with everything you've proposed thus far. Your answer to how to deal with it is to use shame to get people to stop. 

Lemme fill you in: Banning smoking from bars didn't make me stop. Banning it from public areas didn't make me stop. Having to smoke outside in 0 degree snowing cold didn't make me stop. Charging me more money didn't get me to stop. Telling me all the reasons being a smoker was terrible for my health and well being didn't make me stop. 

I could give a fuck if people are offended by my smoking. It didn't factor into me smoking at all. 

The ONLY reason I quit was because I wanted to quit. I actually **wanted** to quit. 

And it's the same for fat people. The vast majority of them CAN lose the weight, if they **truly want** to. They just don't want to. Treating them like shit isn't going to help them want to do it anymore. 

It kind of feels like your view is that you should be allowed to denigrate others who's personal choices are offensive to you. And that is going to be a hard view to change.

Now, experimenting with gender is completely normal for a child, and most kids who show signs of gender incongruity aren't going to grow up to be trans, but some will and there are some behaviors that can indicate a child is trans and will grow up to be trans, especially if they commit strongly to certain ideas and behaviors.

In order for a child to be possibly diagnosed with gender dysphoria, they have to exhibit at least 6 of the following 8 characteristics.

&gt;A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender

&gt;A strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite gender

&gt;A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play

&gt;A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender

&gt;A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy

&gt;A strong desire for the physical sex characteristics that match one’s experienced gender

I think in most all scenarios you can treat a situation with one of three overgeneralized approaches: encouragement (acceptance), indifference (tolerance), discouragement (rejection). My perspective is that the topic of pedophilia should never be treated with any approach other than discouragement (rejection). including if the topic is non-offending pedophilia. Other topic can be handled from the point of view of indifference (tolerance) such as child discipline methods. While other topics require a sense of nuance to decipher whether it is better to approach with indifference or rejection; such as aggressive behavior from a man towards woman (note that I did not say assault or harassment).

3469	"So I took the time to read this one over, and I appreciate your candor. While I may be correct in the literal sense of racism,  my issue lies in the assumption that the group is representative of the individual. Say society favors whites, OK. Am I as a white person someone who is responsible for this? I'll go ahead and diverge from my question to be more frank about my experiences in the hopes that my perspective is understood and my incentives for coming here are more clear. 
  
While I like your example, it is indeed simplistic.  
&gt;(or, alternatively, have all stand and stare at the student but only one call the student dumb).  
  
This is likely the closest to accurate example, but it assumes the group is homogenous. That the entirety of the standing group is impartial an act of hatred. I condemn racism, bigotry, misandry, misogyny etc. I will speak out when I feel someone is unfairly treated, regardless of who they are. I feel like a lot of my issue is with the tone of these social justice movements. They seem to incite a lot of anger and rage and promote generalizations. While not the entirety of SJ movements are this way, I can say in my limited experience, People are mad at me because the color of my skin. I don't own any establishment, I'm not part of any authoritative decision making group. I don't influence societal behavior in the way the entirety of a group may. I've never owned a slave, I've never insulted anyone based on their appearance, and I've never condoned harm or mistreatment of anyone. Now, there's this fervor and excitement towards whites becoming the less dominant race. When people say 'only white's can be racist' it's harmful. It doesn't explicitly say 'all whites are racist' but that's the extent of the message being absorbed. If I am to disagree with this premise, I'm met with vehement opposition that is fueled by anger not logic. (I am referring to my experience in real life, not your response). It bothers me, it's like I'm expected to feel bad because it's easier for me as a white person. I face discrimination in instances applying for higher level jobs due to minimum quotas of certain ethnic groups. I am not afforded the same scholarship opportunities. Living in a predominately black/hispanic neighborhood for the last 10 years I've felt unfairly judged. I can feel anger directed towards me, I walk through the grocery store and am met with sneers. This isn't my perspective or exaggeration, I'm gawked at and hassled solely due to my skin color. I'm not a fucking racist because I'm white, and I'm so fucking exhausted with this white guilt/privilege bullshit. When I was 8 a group of 10 black kids chased and attacked me because I'm white. I don't hold this against blacks, but their incentives were clear. A week ago I got pushed around by a group of black guys at the bar, and had to leave. I understand some prejudices are held by certain members of a race, but I WILL NOT ascribe those beliefs to someone by default, which is what I feel like is happening to whites. In essence I feel the issue is one of Indiscriminate Presumption.  
  
When Morgan Freeman was asked how to get rid of racism his response was: Quit talking about it.  
  
All this affirmative action and bad whitey rhetoric is... enraging. **I just want all people to be treated like people**. That's it. I don't care who you are, what your sexuality is, where you're from, can we all just treat others kindly? The assumption that I 'as a white' am fucking anything is my problem.

3474	"It's very easy to understand why religious people make this choice. For non-religious people as yourself, life is the single most important thing in the universe. They want to protect, value, and cherish life at all costs. Life must be protected and continued no matter what the situation calls for. Without life, any other action is pointless. Life can be given up under no circumstances

For religious people, life is just a small part of a bigger picture. They want to protect, value, and cherish life, but not at all costs. They believe in something that is more important than life. Life as we know it is a brief, passing phenomenon that could be enjoyed if circumstances were right but doesn't have to be if circumstances are not great. Life is not the end-all-be-all of the universe. Life can be given up at the right circumstances.

It might be hard to imagine, but think of it this way. Religious people refuse treatment for their children for the exact same reason why you want treatment for your children. If your child was at risk of losing his Life, wouldn't you want to do everything you possibly could to save your beloved son/daughter? In the same way, if your child was at risk of losing his God, wouldn't you want to do everything you possibly could to save your beloved son/daughter? Who are you to tell me what's more important between God and Life?

Think back to the people at Jonestown. If your child was one of those people who was going to give up everything he had for some crazy cult, wouldn't you at least try to stop him or her? Same way, religious people are trying to stop their child from giving up everything he/she has for that crazy cult of living a Life-centric life."	18	['must be protected and continued no', 'can be given', 'could be enjoyed', 'can be given']	4	4	0.2222222222222222	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['must be protected and continued no', 'can be given', 'could be enjoyed', 'can be given']	4	4	0.2222222222222222	1	26779593147	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hmxbb/_/cavvmbf/	90089255		2013-07-04 12:56:45		keeptrue	90	False	305	0	False	True	72.05

Aside from the fact Medicare isn't the only government run healthcare system in the US, that wasn't the point. The point was that it's more efficient and better liked than private systems. 

&gt; **Key Findings**

&gt; * Private insurers paid nearly double Medicare rates for all hospital services (199% of Medicare rates, on average), ranging from 141% to 259% of Medicare rates across the reviewed studies.

&gt; * The difference between private and Medicare rates was greater for outpatient than inpatient hospital services, which averaged 264% and 189% of Medicare rates overall, respectively.

&gt; * For physician services, private insurance paid 143% of Medicare rates, on average, ranging from 118% to 179% of Medicare rates across studies.

It's silly to claim the government can't implement something it's already proven it can do better.

What tax covers somebody coming in to the state with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in healthcare costs?

Except it's entirely possible it's financially feasible... which an incredible body of research shows is true... at the federal level, but not actually at the state level.

However, that said... I don't understand why it would be impossible for someone to have a gender dysphoria that manifested itself differently at different times. 

I mean, if we accept that it's possible (and not even that terribly uncommon) for a biological male to genuinely feel as though they are a woman, or for a biological female to genuinely feel as though they are a man... why is it so hard to imagine a person that sometimes feels one way, and sometimes feels another way?

And I mean, genuinely feels that way, not ""thinks they need to be a different gender in order to wear that gender's clothes"". 

As a side note, I will also point out that gender stereotypes, per se, and feminism aren't necessarily in any kind of opposition. One can justifiably say that it's ok to have neutral gender stereotypes as long as one believes that men and women deserve full social and legal equality. And indeed, many 3rd wave feminists argue this. 

So at most I'd say that genderfluidity might be in opposition to *some* feminists.

And that would be quite hard to argue against. TERFs are a real thing. Feminism, at one time, treated transgenderism *quite* poorly, for more or less the same reasons you're giving for genderfluidity being incompatible with feminism.

Don't take a number alone to indicate anything. What if the question was, ""Would you like to be governed in your current country by Sharia law?"" Saying yes, could lead to the above when paraphrased.

The comparison between Islam and Christianity has already been mentioned. You (along with most modern Christians) have chosen to emphasise the New Testament (and rightly so!), but that doesn't negate the fact the the Bible still presents examples like God telling Saul to ""put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys"" (1 Samuel 15:3, New International Version). You might claim that this is a minor part and modern Christians don't pay attention to that (or other arguments which we can discuss), but many modern Muslims say the same about their religion.

&gt;Christianity (Focusing very much so, as christianity does, on the new testament) is a religion that is almost as pacifistic as Buddhism

This is your belief as a person (Christian?) in this era. You can't make the same claim for all Christians even in recent history. If you did, then why couldn't a peaceful Muslim make the same claim for Muslims today since [Christians are still killing Muslims.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/central-african-republic-christian-militias-revenge)

It wasn't too long ago that the Crusades killed many people in the name of Christianity. Do you think people from that era would have thought Christianity was as pacifist as you view it? 

Jesus himself said, ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."" (Matthew 10:34, NIV). Every argument you make against a claim that this promotes violence can be made with respect to the Quoran.


In terms of a religion being out of date, how do you define this while not maintaining that all religion is out of date? Wasn't Christianity out of date from the moment Galileo was persecuted because he said that the Earth wasn't the center of the universe? Not to mention the advocacy of Creationism, not Evolution being taught in schools (such as in the US). 

If you go back 70 years, slavery and Christianity went hand-in-hand.

3492	"&gt;I'm not. Here's my actual theory: the brain is a device that holds cause-and-effect in abeyance...

What you've argued is a form of libertarian free will (not the political ideology). You're suggesting that our brains are indeterministic, or possibly chaotic (which is deterministic, but results in our mental processes being unpredictable even in principle, regardless of how much knowledge someone has) and saying that we have some freedom to choose our mental state within the boundaries of chance, within whatever 'error bars' physics might permit. However, the same critique applies in this situation. Even if this were possible, even if your will could choose as it liked within say, the bounds of quantum indeterminacy, you would still have to explain what the will itself is based on, and neither possibility works. Is this will uncaused? Then it's arbitrary, and the will is not yours. Is it caused? Then there's no freedom in that will (and if your answer is that it's caused by the self, the same questions apply to the self; either arbitrary or caused by something else).

Even if this objection didn't apply, you would still have to realize that you're saying we have control over the probabilistic laws of quantum mechanics, and this would violate the assumption that we're operating within the constraints of physics. As an example, suppose you're rolling a die, and suppose that rolling a die were a truly random event, such that there is no means of predicting the outcome. Having control of probability in this scenario would mean that you could get 1,000 twos in a row, if you so desired. That would be changing physics; the system no longer operates as if each side of the die has a 1/6 probability of occurrence. You're saying we can do this for whatever the analogous process is in our heads; this would certainly be a monumental discovery for physics, since it would involve violations of various conservation laws, but there is absolutely no evidence to suggest it can occur.

&gt;What happened? Well, I misjudged the ball. But when I say ""I misjudged the ball,"" my very language assumes that I could have made a different judgment. But according to your reasoning, that really isn't possible. My perceptions, my training, my reflexes and my fielding abilities are what they are, and I can't will for them to be any different. 

The perceptions and training in question can in fact change, and your will is part of the causal process that makes them change. It simply isn't itself uncaused, which is still what you're assuming in using the word 'can'. Your will/intent are the result of other factors, but are still an important part in attempting to explain why you misjudged the ball.

When you say 'my very language assumes that I could have made a different judgment'; not at all, I am in no way relying on this uncaused definition of will that's commonly used. I often use 'could' on a personal-knowledge basis; according to my very limited knowledge about your brain, I would say you could have caught the ball, meaning that it was uncertain to me whether you would or wouldn't. Although, that comes with the caveat that it seems quite likely that if I knew everything about your brain, I would be able to say you couldn't have caught the ball.

This actually brings up another sense in which people sometimes use the word 'could', which isn't quite my definition and is closer to another word altogether, but is useful; you 'could' have caught the ball in the sense that if you had been undergoing a slightly different mental state at the time of the catch, and/or if external circumstances had been slightly different, you would have caught it. This would transform 'could' into a measure of the degree to which someone's mental state would have to change to satisfy some desired criteria. Suppose you normally catch home runs with 99.9% accuracy; then it makes sense to say you could have caught it, since it would probably have taken a very small change in your mental state, and/or in the physical conditions you found yourself in, to move you to a circumstance in which you would have caught the ball. Whereas a lesser fan who can't catch home runs would require a vastly different brain, and thus couldn't say he 'could' have caught a ball he missed.

&gt;But it is meaningless. If we are unable to make choices, then it is meaningless to talk about ""promoting"" anything at all. It's meaningless to talk about valuing truth, because again that implies that there can be an option and that a choice can be made. It's meaningless to talk about preferring one option over another when no real choice of options is open to you. Either there is a choice, or there is no preference. Your entire language here is saturated with the assumption that you are free to make these determinations even as you suggest you are not.

Maybe this will make things simpler; assume when I'm talking about making a choice or decision, I'm talking about the brain making a choice or decision, rather than some invisible, causeless 'self'. And by choosing or deciding, I only mean the brain generating a certain series of thoughts, the conclusion of which involves certain thoughts being categorized by the brain as 'accepted' or 'rejected', 'true' or 'false', 'believed' or 'not believed', etc, based on how that decision process went down. So long as we're talking about some kind of realistic description of choice, we clearly make choices. However, the choosing process simply occurs (usually due to some kind of prompt or stimuli, e.g. a desire to answer some question), a 'self' does not make it occur uncaused. It's not meaningless to talk about valuing, promoting, thinking, caring, [insert any verb here], because these are things our brains really do; they simply don't do them uncaused.

&gt;If our brain causes us to believe that 2+2=5 and there's no option to believe otherwise, then we cannot ourselves determine whether that belief is true or false. It would take someone with a genuine ability to choose between options to do that.

The first part is true, I don't think it's very controversial. By definition, we are going to believe whatever is most convincing to us, and what's most convincing to us may or may not be related to the truth, unless our brains just happen to be structured so that we care about the truth. And to a decent extent, they do have that disposition, and care about what's true in many respects thanks to evolution; believing in true things is often a helpful survival trait. But here, again you're using 'genuine ability to choose' to refer to an uncaused choice; my main objection still applies.

&gt;Only one of two things can be true here: either I could have judged differently and so acted differently, in which case my will is free to make choices, or I could not have done any differently than I did, in which case it is pointless to use the word ""error"" since at no point in the past, present or future can I make any real choice that would alter the outcome. If it isn't my responsibility, then it isn't my mistake. The entire language of morality (should, would, ought) and modality (could, may, might) is meaningless and we should (there I go again) stop using it.

You continually use terms like real choice, but it's about as illusory as something could be; this kind of free will is not even something that we 'might' have, it's an incoherent concept that we couldn't possibly have. It's quite relevant to use the word 'error' here; doing so communicates to other brains that you weren't quite exercising your usual or expected skills in making the catch, and that your eyes did not track the ball accurately, or perhaps your body's movement wasn't as related to your intentions as you had hoped. These descriptions all require the existence of consciousness, or mental states, just not of free will. The entire lexicon of morality does need to change, however, that's not particularly related to free will, more so to the fact that hardly anyone even knows what they're talking about when they use the words 'should' or 'ought'. 

&gt;Your use of the word 'determine' here begs a question which is still controversial even within neuroscience. In short: the fact that motor potentials appear before a person consciously makes a choice doesn't prove that the motor potentials ""caused"" the choice.

I'm not claiming that the pre-motor potentials necessarily cause the choice; but they are either part of the causal chain involved, or some kind of distantly related effect of an actual causal process. The main point is that a person can be fully aware of what you're going to decide, by some process of inference or another, and if their methodology proves reliable, it makes no sense to say (from their perspective) that you're still 'free' to choose in any way you like."	53	"[""'s caused"", ""'s commonly used"", 'can be made', 'is saturated', 'being categorized', 'be related', 'be structured']"	7	6	0.11320754716981132	1	"[""'s caused by"", 'being categorized by']"	2	2	0.03773584905660377	1	"[""'s commonly used"", 'can be made', 'is saturated', 'be related', 'be structured']"	5	4	0.07547169811320754	1	26991462897	9	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1tkvr4/_/cee0q29/	110149312	26990286511.0	2013-12-31 08:54:52		Mablak	1	False	1517	6	False	True	61.8

3506	"&gt;since they're clearly willing to defend violent criminals just because the skin color of the criminal and the officer fits a narrative.

Actually, the movement is just as much about violent criminals as anyone else.  There's a [huge disparity](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/chicago-police-department-consent-decree-black-lives-matter-resistance.html) in how police treat white resisters and black resisters.  According to data from the Chicago PD, white people resist more, but officers use more force against black arrestees.  The facts in the Michael Brown case are unclear, because witness accounts differ, but BLM argues that, had Michael Brown been white, his resist would have been handled with less force.  And studies tend to support that conclusion.

You could argue that it's not great for a political movement to defend suspected violent criminals, but the crux of BLM is about disparate police treatment of all black people—even violent criminals.

EDIT: There have been a lot of wonderful responses to this comment, and I can't really respond to all of them individually anymore, so I will address two of the most common ones here:

* Here's an article that outlines the the [raw data from the Chicago PD](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-racial-disparity/).
* Many people have mentioned the famed [Fryer study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force), which finds that, while officers are more likely to use force against black suspects, officers are not more likely to shoot black suspects.  I have really tried to analyze this thoroughly because I think it's hard to tell how much the Fryer study contradicts my assertion.  There are a couple of *gigantic* methodological problems with that study.  First, the study fails to emphasize that black people are [five times more likely to be shot by police than white people by proportion to population](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jfeldman/blog/roland-fryer-wrong-there-racial-bias-shootings-police).  That's because the study is trying to determine if that number results from discrimination or bias.  Second, the study compares the pool of people arrested to the pool of people shot.  The study determines that black people are shot less in proportion to number of arrests than white people.  But this finding tells us little because police are [far more likely to arrest black people for minimal or non-criminal conduct](http://datacolada.org/50).  It makes sense that police would then shoot black people less out of the pool that they arrest, because they make more arrests of non-violent or non-threatening black people.  This finding tells us little about bias in police shootings, but rather tells us that police make extremely biased arrests.  I look forward to more investigations about this topic in the future, and I wish we had more analysis using different methodologies.  If more and better designed studies reach the same result as the Fryer study in the future, I would be open to changing my mind about this."	22	['would have been handled', 'be shot', 'are shot']	3	3	0.13636363636363635	1	['be shot by']	1	1	0.045454545454545456	1	['would have been handled', 'are shot']	2	2	0.09090909090909091	1	32433038753	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cntrfd/_/ewdskv5/	765613849		2019-08-08 20:25:44	39661647.0	speedywr	1729	False	445	1	True	True	42.61

Would it not be fair to fund the grandson of person B because of the fact that he has to suffer from old policies where reversing them is not enough?  Group A's grandchildren are not at fault, but they have gained stuff from the exploitation even if they didn't do it themselves, and they are allowed to keep it? If you own stuff that was once owned by someone else, was stolen by your ancestors, you don't own it, it was exploited, you may have it- but it is the other person's. The point of Reparations are not to shame the white race, but to rather make up for the actions that caused blacks to be in a less favorable state today.

&amp;#x200B;

\*  - Whites as a whole are not to blame, racists(namely real estate agents) are those who are at fault.

\*\* - Reparations don't have to be direct, for example, they can also be funding black neighborhoods and schools.

3514	"Gender is mostly a social construct, and for some reason the gendered rules for media are:

Boys like comic books, movies, sports and video games.

Girls like pop music, novels and television.

These rules are enforced by both genders and aren't anyone's fault.

Let's look at one of these rules that hurts men. Let's say you were a 13 year old boy that really likes to read, so you go to your book store and look at the young adult section. The selection of the books written for you is going to be small compared to the ones written for girls. Why is that? Because boys prefer video games and movies to reading.

Is there something with the Y chromosome that makes boys not like reading? I don't think so. I think a MRA would be totally justified in saying that society isn't encouraging boys to read and one of the ways of fixing that would be to include content that targets their demographic. If we could change that sociological norm so that boys wanted to read, publishers would double their customer base and boys would have access to content that was written for them.

Women have money and want to be included in these giant cultural events, but the industry still has the belief that women don't see movies that aren't romantic comedies. They want a character they can identify with instead of shallow characters that are anywhere from neutral to hostile to their gender.

I think that's the entire point of M4A.  People, based on individual cost, don't get the care they need.  Access to healthcare should be strictly based on the needs of an individual, not on their ability to pay.

What is being over-covered int he US as of right now, and how would denying that access help those patients?

&gt;Unfortunately, the cost of care has no concern about the ability to pay.  If I can only pay $5 for a procedure that costs $5,000, the procedure doesn't magically change to meet that cost.

No, but the cost would not be borne on the patient, but the system.  For example:

Three example people get that same $5,000 procedure, and that was it in that given year:

1. The person making $20,000 may pay $0 in M4A Taxes.
2. The person making $100,000 may pay $5,000 in M4A Taxes.
3. The person making $1,000,000 may pay $75,000 in M4A Taxes.

3538	"&gt; First of, if religion is really that important to make sure a kid learns moral compass and critical thinking where otherwise they wouldn't, you speak of a tool here and there are many of them which are equally if not more effective. 

&gt; I developed my own moral compass and apprecietaion of art without any religion and used other tool to do it called conversation. I'm just going to mention that tool can be used wrong, like how with dynamite, a tool for mining used in war.

I hope you realize that you are likely nowhere near the lowest denominator of effort. There are MANY people who have no care for philosophical conversation (I know multiple) or critical thinking (I also know multiple), and rarely develop a moral framework because of it. The purpose of religion should be to lay the groundwork, of which provides those who do not voluntarily dive into philosophy a base, to where they will be able to derive a moral framework from with little effort, but ideally will themselves be challenged by those who choose to do so. 

One problem I see is that you are focusing from the perspective of the child, not of the parent. You are explaining a technique that the child can use to engage with philosophy, but not one that every child will do so. What is a parent to do if a child is either to young to understand Aristotle, and the concepts surrounding eudaemonia, or are too disinterested in the subject to care? 

It is the responsibility of a parent to ensure that their child develops a good moral framework, and if saying that their imaginary friend will be sad, or that if they fail math, that Santa won’t bring them presents, is the only way to ensure this with you child, then the benefits by far outweigh the harm. 

&gt; Also you're making statements that are against each other. On one hand you speak of children as some very complicated beings which need a lot of care and all, but the next moment you say if there is no reward/punishement they won't learn morality at all. A system which can be very twisted and very outdated.

No... you clearly didn’t read my point if a requirement of fear for morality is what you focus on in that argument. Go ahead and read it again, if you would like me to clarify, ask. 

&gt; If you use example at which a person falls into depression since they have no spiritual or religious believe, then the opposite is also true, a person can fall into depression cause of the religion where they feel that have no way of redeeming themself cause they've done something very sinful and a lot of them.

Yes, but again, you are making blanket statements about religion. You continue to do this a lot. Many religions have something called repentance, of which is relatively easy to do, and absolves one of their sins, other than the most extreme such as murder. Many religions actively encourage, and have incredibly easily accessible paths of redemption. This is from my own experience being raised as a catholic, and my interactions with the confessional. If you weren’t catholic, I would highly recommend reading into it (or hell, I’d recommend going to it, I have personally gone multiple times since I left the faith, and am still on good terms with my former church’s priest, even though they actively know I have left the faith). 

&gt; If you think that somehow A lot of people are stupid but you are not, you are nothing more but an arrogant person, and should reexamine your points.

I’m not saying that, and don’t think that... I’m saying that there are a lot of people who are stupid. This is a fact. I could very much fall into them, in fact I DID fall into them for a while within this context (which was my point if you actually read that portion), to where I didn’t do any form of critical thinking or challenging of my own morality or philosophy. Yet, because I had been indoctrinated into basic catholic beliefs, such as charity, forgiveness, love, acceptance, responsibility, and empathy, and a basic concept of what was fundamentally wrong (pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth), I had a basic moral framework to rely upon without requiring any form of effort. This is in comparison with others who went through the same periods that I had, who had nothing built up at any point to properly fall back on.

Religion needs very little effort to follow, this can be used for bad purposes, but it can also be used for immense good to ensure that everyone, even those who are unwilling to, or incapable of critical thought surrounding philosophy, still have a positive moral framework. 




At the end of the day, my main problem is you continue falsely associating and attempting to pin many different things to religion, such as bigotry or exile, that don’t exist for a vast majority of people and their interaction with religion, as fundamental, common, and core pieces of religion, that rarely exist and wouldn’t develop without it.

Generally, because humans aren't naturally vegan, vegans have to be more aware of their diet in order to ensure they get adequate nutrition. Even if they aren't balancing nutrition well, the very act of being vegan is an intentional change to diet for most people. If you compare these people to the average meat eater, most of whom don't think about what we eat at all unless we're sick, you're comparing apples and oranges. It's the equivalent of saying that eating protein bars lowers blood pressure, it doesn't, but people that eat them are far more likely to spend time in the gym and generally being active that people that don't. So when studies compare health of vegans and meat-eaters, they aren't accounting for the additional variables.

Again, because humans aren't naturally vegan, there are dietary requirements that are really easy to meet as a meat eater but you need to be more aware of as a vegan. As a result, common vegan staples like soy and avocados are produced but are actually worse than raising animals on the same plot of land. Especially when you consider how far these foods need to be transported. And forget about it if you're a vegan that eats salad, there's no comparison.

Whether or not they need a psychologist to help them through these insecurities is impossible to say without knowing the individual on an intimate level.

Unwanted pregnancies are simply, on average, not being raised in good family situations.
* Lots more babies down syndrome babies and babies with other significant genetic disorders.
* Rich people can simply travel to other jurisdictions that allow abortions.  This will only stop poor people from having abortions, the ones that can't afford to raise a baby and for whom raising a baby will ensure they never escape poverty.
* The ""long wait list"" you described is only for white babies.  There is no such waitlist for black babies.  Just the fact that there is STILL a wait list for white babies even with plenty of black babies to adopt means that adding even more black babies into the mix isn't going to end well for those babies.  Also, the babies with genetic disorders... again, no wait list for those. It's just *healthy* white babies.

Why would turning an ally in Saudi Arabia who cooperates with the west into a country controlled by hostile Shia militias who with have to govern over a majority sunni population be helpful. There would be so many terrorist produced in such an unstable place.

You actually believe that a collapsing Saudi Arabia makes the world better? The chaos would destabilize the middle east even more and if anything comes out of the rubble doubt it would be any better for Muslims, Arabs and the west.

I'd rather have Saudia Arabia controlled by a monarchy that hypocritically indulges fruits of liberalism than be Iran which is basically a theocracy that's ruled by a religious fundamentalist.

From everything I've read they are liberalized slightly after decades of stagnation. Women being able to drive is obviously a buzz in the media but there's other stories that you can Google. It's baby steps but they don't make those steps without being integrated into the world economy. The motivation for these steps is largely to help create an economy that's future proof against less demand for oil. It's probably easier for a top down monarchy to do that than some some hardliners bottom up conservative revolutionary like Iran or even a revolutionary Islamist republic that needs to start over from the chaos of the Saudi being toppled.

If there are any problems with Saudi Arabia the best way to solve them is through diplomacy. Destabilizing another middle Eastern country is a terrible idea and will make more extremists.

The Sauds also can't just flip a switch and liberalize. They have to balance appeasing conservatives or risk being overthrowing like the shah."	15	"['terrorist produced', ""'s ruled"", 'are liberalized', 'being integrated', 'being toppled']"	5	5	0.3333333333333333	1	"[""'s ruled by""]"	1	1	0.06666666666666667	1	['terrorist produced', 'are liberalized', 'being integrated', 'being toppled']	4	4	0.26666666666666666	1	37640640386	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pcd1ml/_/hai9k02/	1532418429	37640392313.0	2021-08-26 23:31:47	44651552.0	VesaAwesaka	18	False	302	0	False	True	59.53

The use of the phrase itself has certainly been bastardized for the sake of argumentation, but I believe the idea of self awareness it promotes, at least in the way I understand it, is positive. So the idea behind the phrase is good, but people will use it to their own benefit.

Here in Denmark it costs $32,000 USD to adopt a child from a foreign country - these are just the base costs and do not include any additional fees involved in traveling to the adoptive country. It's even more expensive to adopt in the US - more than $36,000 USD. Remember, this is base cost alone, and more than many people make in one year to simply bring a child into your home. 

This is assuming you pass all of the qualifications for adopting a child into your home, and you meet the specific standards required by the agency (having sufficient space in your home, both couples are required to have work *and* be available to care for the child, maintaining a certain standard of living, etc etc etc). Not saying that you shouldn't account for these things before having a child, because you should. But it's vastly more expensive to adopt a child than it is to have one your own. 

In addition to that, there are very few children here in Denmark for adoption, because of excellent sex education, ready access to birth control, and abortion services for women who end up pregnant and do not want to have their children. I read that yearly, the number of orphaned children who do not go to family or friends is under 10 here. 

So it's not that adoption is impossible; it's that adoption is prohibitively expensive for many people when childbirth is an option."	10	['are required']	1	1	0.1	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are required']	1	1	0.1	1	26883313407	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ns85c/_/cclmpdr/	100414272	26883188450.0	2013-10-05 15:01:14		Ipsey	25	False	247	0	False	True	60.79

3569	"Part III: 2. Religion is a matter of individual choice. This is perhaps a more controversial one. First, it must be said that of course humans, to the degree that they have free will over their actions, are free to engage in religious practices or to abstain from this. It is less clear whether and how people have free will over their beliefs (For an introduction to this discussion, read http://www.iep.utm.edu/doxa-vol/ ), but if they are, then it is likely that they are also free with regards to at least some of their religious beliefs. (Again, given that there actually exists such a thing as 'religious beliefs'.)

However, the focus of my argument will not be on 'choice', but on 'individual'. The notion that religion is something the individual engages in, is again a rather modern one. This does not mean that individual conversions, or individual religious practices, did not occur  until modernity. Think for example of Paul's experience on the road to Damascus, or of the individual process by which Siddhartha Gautama became enlightened. Rather, the point is that religion was, and many places is, predominantly a communal rather than an individual thing. If you open a Bible and read Acts, you'll see that the Apostles frequently convert not individuals, but households. In the Ancient Near East, it was common to think of each area as having its own god. If your city defeated my city in a war, then that was a sign that your god was stronger than mine. Today, religious buildings function as community hubs for many immigrant communities in the West. By participating in religious rituals, you not only affirm your individual choice of religion, you reinforce bonds to friends and family, affirm and express a communal identity, keep your cultural traditions alive, and so on. This is a much broader connection than mere individual choice.

This is played out on the political scene as well. Pre-1945, Shintoism was important in binding the Japanese society together, and binding the people to their political leadership. Famously, the peace of Westphalia, ending the Thirty Years' War, stated that 'Cuius regio, eius religio', i.e. that the monarch decided the religion of the realm. The notion of the Mandate of Heaven tied together religion, the welfare of the people, and the legitimacy of the Emperor in imperial China. Religion is politically important not only for the rulers or the privileged, but for the oppressed as well. Think about the Nation of Islam in the US. Saying that the Nation of Islam is all about a religious belief system is absurd, likewise it would be bizarre to suggest that being a member of the Nation of Islam is purely a case of individual choice. Rather, the Nation of Islam instantiates community, solidarity, and affirmation of pride in the face of a communal experience of oppression. Much the same could be said about the Liberation Theology movement in South America. 

On a more sinister note, many of the people who end up joining Al Qaida or the Taliban will say in interviews that they do so to defend their country, or their brothers in Muslim countries, against foreign invaders. They will say this much more often than they will say that they do so because they want to make an individual commitment to follow the will of Allah, or the like. The religious beliefs and practices of Jihadists, however misguided they are according to traditional Islamic theology, can thus also very well be seen as communal actions in the face of communal experiences. (Though this is more clearly the case for Afghan Taliban members than for, say, a British ex-con leaving his family to join Daesh.)

Thus, I think we should say that, though there are arguably cases where religion is a matter of individual choice, quite often it is not. Quite often, it is the community as a whole that engages in religious beliefs and practices."	30	['must be said', 'is played', 'could be said', 'be seen']	4	4	0.13333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['must be said', 'is played', 'could be said', 'be seen']	4	4	0.13333333333333333	1	30185706255	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/81x7zl/_/dv7sg0f/	486959025	30185679273.0	2018-03-05 13:47:35		Gunnar_Grautnes	4	False	656	0	False	True	51.89

It's not insulting; everyone is susceptible to a poor self image, and nobody's self image reliably reflects the way other people see them. That's just part of the human condition.

It *is* invalidating, and it's good that you're being sensitive. You *are* saying that their experience doesn't match with objective reality, because you don't believe that it does. Neither do I. You've got to be empathetic about that, but the idea that it's always emotionally healthy or morally positive to validate people, even when you think they're wrong, is harmful.

You said that people keep the elderly alive for a really long time because they deserve the longest life possible. You are simplifying this. People want to use modern medical technology to give people the best quality of life possible until they no longer can. People use technology to keep them alive so long as they still have a good quality of life. Similar with dogs except when they have a bad quality of life, we end it for them.

I’ve seen the “having kids is unethical because of climate change” argument going around a lot. You as a person have no right to tell a person whether to conceive a child or not. Notice that I specifically said “conceive”. If you are responsible, other then in cases of rape, you shouldn’t even conceive a child unless you plan to keep it. I agree with you on one thing, that overpopulation is the biggest threat facing humanity right now. But telling people whether they can have kids or not is bordering on a socialist regime at that point and that is not what America is about. If we sacrifice our principles, even if we do curb overpopulation, we haven’t won. In countries such as China or India that have over a billion people, there is really nothing anyone can do outside of those nations and China cares about nothing but controlling the people and keeping their fear of the socialist regime.

3591	"Addressing things you said in other comments:

&gt; This depends on whether consciousness can arise solely from information processing, or whether it's more akin to an actual fundamental force.

These options aren't mutually exclusive. I believe one theory of consciousness (Chalmers'?) is simply that consciousness is a fundamental property of all physical systems. That is to say, every physical system is ""conscious"" in some sense, and different arrangements of matter lead to qualitatively different consciousnesses: the consciousness of an electron, of a tree, of a car, of a human, and so on. We could then posit that what defines a system's consciousness is how it processes information. I think that makes sense -- I have trouble seeing how information processing could be irrelevant to consciousness, and I think that consciousness as a binary property is absurd. Surely there are degrees to it, and I would have no problem stretching them all the way to fundamental particles.

On the other hand, I'm not convinced this is a non-trivial idea. It's a bit too simple to be truly interesting, although that wouldn't make it wrong, just trivial.

&gt; Thus, if it's possible for a computer program to develop a consciousness, then there must exist a mathematical equation that you can actually write on a chalkboard whereby the actual act of solving it would cause it to possess a consciousness. Come to think of it, even solving it wouldn't technically be necessary. Any equation you can write is just a different way of writing its end result (you can treat the string ""6 * 7"" as simply another way of writing the number 42 - you don't actually have to carry out the multiplication for it to have the same value). Merely the existence of this equation - a static, unchanging piece of information - would have to actually be conscious.

Consciousness is not the end result of the equation, though, it is a byproduct of its execution. I suppose the best way to explain this would be to go back to the ""everything is conscious"" idea above. Suppose that every physical system has some kind of consciousness, and that given the state of the system, you can compute its ""consciousness number."" Well, it stands to reason that a physical machine -- all physical machines -- would have a consciousness number. The idea is that this number doesn't really depend on the substrate or the physical properties of the machine, but mostly on how it processes information: it depends on how information is physically transformed by the machine, but regardless of what mechanism implements the transformation. So if the consciousness number of a human as a physical system is X, the consciousness number of a simulated human as a physical computer running software would also be X, but a trace of that execution, as a physical system, would be zero, because it is inert: no information is being transformed, not in the concrete way that consciousness requires. In other words, what has consciousness is the *motion* of the rocks while you execute rule 110, not the pattern in and of itself.

&gt; Basically, in computer science, there isn't necessarily a distinction between running a program and not running it. As you can imagine, this can have bizarre consequences.

I work in computer science (in an AI research lab) and I don't know what you mean by that.

&gt; That argument breaks down when you take a machine whose process is essentially a copy operation. A program's source code and initial data can be represented in one row of a [Rule 110 Cellular Automata].

The process of CA 110 is not a copy operation. It couldn't possibly be Turing complete if it was.

&gt; I'm not so sure the act of copying the color of a particular square on your graph paper is significantly different than first looking at the three squares above it, then looking up what the color of your square should be given that combination.

It's extremely different. The first process can't compute anything. The second is Turing complete.

Picture a ""person"" who is ~~physically~~ identical to you, but has absolutely no experience; their brain is just a machine that accepts nerve signals and outputs other nerve signals. There's no subjective perspective looking out of their eyes. 

What possible feature of any scientific theory could distinguish that person from you? 

I certainly can't argue that no such feature could ever exist. But it's also clear that it would be totally different than any other scientific theory yet invented. Consciousness is very different than everything else we describe scientifically, because we don't have *empirical* evidence for its existence. We don't need to do anything to be convinced that we are conscious and we've never experimentally connected anything to consciousness either.

Are you aware of the concept of the euphemism treadmill? It's the idea that as long as bigotry is pervasive in society any attempts at improving the language used to refer to minorities will be corrupted to the point exactly the same way.

The term idiot was originally a neutral medical term for mentally disabled people, until it became a so widely used insult  that it couldn't be used that way anymore. Next it was mental retardation. People started using that as an insult too, and so on and so forth. As long as people hate those with mental disabilities it doesn't matter what word you use for them, it will keep being turned into an insult. We see this with other terms as well. Colored people was a ""polite"" replacement for the controversial terms at the time, and is now equally inappropriate to call someone.

So if ""Jew"" became ""Zionist"" and now ""Zionist"" should become ""Pro-Israeli"", why wouldn't antisemitic people looking for an excuse to be antisemitic just vent their bigotry under that new term? What term should we use once Pro-Israeli is all used up?

3597	"The grade a student receives should be contingent on the professor's confidence in how much they have learned from the course, subsequent to the authority granted to a professor by the university that awards degrees.

Since we agree that papers and exams are actually not particularly good at determining whether someone has actually grasped the material and not just crammed some memorization or type up some bullcrap, why is it unfair for professors to gauge a small percentage of a students grade on seeing whether they *participated* in the classroom?

Yes, you can make up for some degree of missed classes with increased studying. But that is not easy for a professor to evaluate in general and especially for a classroom of many students. So, the compromise is that instead of your entire grade being contingent on your classroom performance, some small part of it is weighed on participation. This is the prerogative of the professor and their judgment, since they are the most qualified to decide and are vetted by the university and given the authority by the university to make these decisions.

&gt;I do not see how that reflects poorly on me. Students who attend class aren't necessarily grasping the material..

I've never been in a class where a student who performed spectacularly on tests got a worse grade than a student who failed tests but went to every class, so I don't think that this argument has a lot of weight for saying that the policy is really unfair to anyone. It's really not that big of a problem proportional to the utility it provides to a professor and the prerogative of that professor.

&gt;How much of a voice do you think students should have in university regulations? After all, students are paying for tuition.

Not to the extent that they can override core university policy and multiple professors. The university may listen to students, but there is no guaranteed recourse for students who want to override professor policies. Professors go through a far more intensive process of vetting than students do. 

Students pay for and earn the **privilege** to have the **opportunity** to earn a degree from a university. Just because one pays the university does not entitle one to a degree or leverage over the university. 

We pay for a  *chance* to be awarded a degree contingent on our performance in requirements set by universities and professors. The university makes the independent decisions and evaluation to regulate what requirements it has to *award* a degree to its students.

If this seems unfair at the undergraduate level, most graduate programs will seem far more unfair. At the graduate level, students go through far more grueling programs and requirements, including even more extraneous requirements than participation, including grading and TAing far lesser courses to receive their degree. Additionally, an individual professor/advisor has *far* more arbitrary influence on the complete outcome of years of a graduate student's life. Weighing attendance as a small 10% portion of a grade is a negligible concern in comparison."	20	['is weighed', 'are vetted', 'be awarded']	3	3	0.15	1	['are vetted by']	1	1	0.05	1	['is weighed', 'be awarded']	2	2	0.1	1	26888039388	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1o2xw8/_/ccofzz0/	100914200	26887988874.0	2013-10-09 18:19:10		convoces	2	False	506	2	False	True	49.15

3601	"You keep bringing up the concept of ""No choice"" but when it comes to what you do to another person in every situation we've described there is always a choice. Even if you don't like the alternative, it is still a choice you can make. Thus making a choice to kill, as a Judge, or in self defence is always immoral.  Lets say I do grab a hammer, I'll be aIming for what is in the sweet reach zone, if anything gets that close. Spceifically hands first then if hands are too close elbows shoulders etc. Never at any point during this will my intent be to kill. 

To your last point; the problem is, in the heat of the moment few if any people ""think twice about murdering if a noose is on the other the other end for [them]"". And for the majority of pre meditated cases, once their specific victims are gone, there's no reason left to murder. In both these cases rehabilitation is very viable.

The Dems are really not that socialist. Some are running on or recently won with Democratic Socialist stances which is actually different than straight up socialism. The party is actually pretty moderate, much to many of the more liberal members (me) disappointment. :) The problem is the divisiveness in the country right now is making the republicans have some really far right, extremely conservative takes, and the democrats look more extreme in light of it. But suggesting one of the wealthiest countries in the world should be able to protect people from choosing between dying or being in a lifetime of debt isn’t actually that extreme, for instance, which is the concept behind the “socialist” healthcare bills. 

As far as immigration, no democrats have spoken out in favor of illegal immigration. Only that people who do immigrant illegally are still human beings and our country shouldn’t do human right violations to them. The belief is that we should make it less challenging for people to immigrate because our country is better off with people who want to be here and work and contribute.

3607	"I can give you an example from my own life. When I was about 15, and studying at boarding school, my divorced mother remarried. At that age it's not really like getting a stepfather, but the dynamic was tricky to work out. He was coming into the family, but we couldn't really work out how to relate with each other. 

That was maybe compounded by the fact that both my parents went to a good university and I was on track to do the same, while my mother's new husband had left school early, joined the army, then become a truck driver and risen to the position of transport manager. So there was a kind of divide in terms of education, that maybe he thought I thought I was in some way 'better' than him. Or maybe I just thought that. 

My mother set me up to prank him. On Christmas Eve I called him on his cell phone, faked the voice of a coworker, and told him there had been a screwup at the office and a truck needed to be driven to London that night. Nobody else was available, all the drivers had already started drinking for Christmas celebrations. Then, after stringing him along for maybe a minute, I came clean. So did my mother, who was in the car with him at the time and had masterminded the whole operation. 

It's a prank, but it's a harmless one, and I think marked the major step in our getting along much better with a kind of blokey, banter-fuelled relationship.

3610	"&gt;You are actually getting it from existing shareholders. There is 100 shares that represents 100% ownership of the company. Therefore, each share is 1% of the company. The company issues 100 new shares, so now there is 200 shares that still represents 100% ownership of the company, so now each share is now only worth 0.5% of the company. You now own 50% less of the company.

That's exactly my point. When you buy an existing share on the market, you aren't investing in the company. You are investing in that stock. You aren't actually contributing anything to the company anymore, just collecting a (hopefully) growing piece of equity from that company.

&gt;But their investment, or money, went to buying the company or the assets of the company.

As we both agreed above, when you buy a share, your money goes to the previous shareholder, not going into assets for the company...Unless they are brand new IPO shares.

&gt;They own the company. One of the benefits to owning the company is to have a right to the profit.

I'd say that is the whole point of ""owning"" part of any company, to share in some of the profit. But if I were to buy a ton Walmart shares today and make $50,000 by the time I sold them to someone else, none of my transactions would have anything to do with creating assets for walmart. Walmart only benefited from the original purchaser of the IPO stock, and that asset remains unchanged, as equity climbs.

&gt;Another option is that the shareholders can fire senior people. So generally, if you like your job, you make the shareholders happy. And this doesn't necessarily force anyone to make the employees and customers unhappy.

I do agree that under ideal conditions, the employees and shareholders would have a mutual happiness about the company. But with a lot of companies that over-emphasize the importance of shareholder value over all else, employees tend to suffer due to staffing shortages, cutting of benefits and raises, etc. Not all companies, but many companies get carried away with trying to maximize profits. That is where I think it is wrong and that shareholder value should not be the prime directive."	23	['get carried']	1	1	0.043478260869565216	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['get carried']	1	1	0.043478260869565216	1	27000503036	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ul993/_/cejehh8/	111846423	27000211753.0	2014-01-07 04:43:01		mountain_woman	1	False	370	4	False	True	64.91

&gt; Unlike the other disciples that called Jesus “Lord,” Judas never used this title for Jesus and instead called him “Rabbi,” which acknowledged Jesus as nothing more than a teacher. While other disciples at times made great professions of faith and loyalty (John 6:68; 11:16), Judas never did so and appears to have remained silent.

For me this highlights the tension between Judas not believing in Jesus and his still choosing to follow Jesus. Was he in it for the money? 30 pieces of silver is probably a couple hundred bucks in modern currency, so probably not life-changing even in a poor area. I think it's more likely that he was hitching his wagon to whoever he thought would give him the most opportunities in the future. When it seemed like this Jesus thing was going to crash and burn, he jumped ship and chose to make a good impression on the Roman authorities.

2) that certain actions or scenarios would lead one to believe that race was the motive (i.e. wearing a KKK uniform or had just come from a KKK rally)  

I mean, let's take a huge example. The Nazis were very clear about their motives and intentions during the holocaust, therefore it's actually implausible that those stated reasons weren't their motivations. Sure, they may have been lying, and we don't ""know for sure"" whether it was really their intentions or not, but it's not plausible that they aren't, *even though it's possible that it isn't*.

&gt;What really gets me is that it's only a hate crime if you're not a minority. As racist, and cruel, and mean as this may seem, more often than not (in the US at least), someone who isn't a minority will more likely be charged with a hate crime than someone who is a minority and commits the crime. It's the sad truth.

Which isn't really part of the discussion. That they're unequally distributed is perhaps a topic for another thread, one in which I would probably agree with you. But hate crimes, in theory, aren't bad. You're not charging people with thinking certain thoughts, you're charging people acting on them - like we would a serial killer who tortures their victims."	15	"['are met', 'be addressed', 'be charged', ""'re unequally distributed""]"	4	4	0.26666666666666666	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"['are met', 'be addressed', 'be charged', ""'re unequally distributed""]"	4	4	0.26666666666666666	1	26835382212	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kvk1r/_/cbt3dfo/	95530815	26835365284.0	2013-08-22 13:49:25		schnuffs	2	False	308	1	False	True	70.02

3635	"&gt; Absolutely. I am not disputing the idea of betting at its core. But in all the scenarios you mentioned, there is a tangible service/transaction of some value involved. Betting with a bookie only gives a chance at that value.

Are you saying that it's hard to lose money when you're investing? Because that's definitely not the case. Stocks go down, and if that happens, you're losing money.

&gt;Recently, australian cigarette manufacturers were required to put the harmful effects of cigarettes on the boxes themselves to inform people and hopefully discourage them from smoking. My point is the ill-effects of betting isn't well informed to the people. All they see is how much they can win, not the probability of winning. The barrier to entry to betting is unbelievably low these days!!

Publicly advertising the risks associated with a thing is a far different action than making the thing illegal. But your initial post did not say that ""casinos should publicly display the probability of winning in all of their scenarios."" Additionally, I don't know how you actually calculate the true odds of something like a football game or a horse race.

Yeah, those people are wrong too. 'What a game stands for' is entirely subjective.

Look, your parents are being obnoxious if they keep forcing Nintendo and Zelda down your throat when you made it clear you don't like them.

3667	"So, my first economics class was actually my senior year of high school, and I wasn't really sure about it until after my freshman year of college. When I was looking into applying to college I was super unsure about what I wanted to major in. My interests were all over the board. I loved and did really well in AP Bio class, but couldn't see a career path I was excited about from it. I was always good at math, but found pure math (sin, cosine, etc) pretty dry. I loved history, but knew that there wasn't really a strong market for history majors. 

When I took Econ, it kind of clicked I guess? It allowed me to pursue and study that social-science element I found interesting in while still getting to work with math/empiricism/data that fit my skill set a little more. There's also a strong job market for Econ majors which was important to me. I ended up loving it as a college major, and now am going into economic litigation consulting which combines a lot of my above interests. 

For the most part, I think my high school classes served a purpose. I use tons of math in my field of study, so taking AP calc was good. History will allow me to better understand the context of the cases I have at work. English, knowing how to write well is hugely important in my field. Most of my classes have helped me at some point. 

 I think that when colleges make you take a bunch of GE's it's kinda dumb (my college makes us take 12!). For the most part, I see it as: high school is the place to figure out what you're interested in, college is the place to specialize in that. Sorry if this seems like a long diatribe haha but I used to agree with this and life experience just changed my perspective on the topic. 

So few people really know what they want to do in early high school. I didn't even know my career path existed until mid college!

I think without actual examples of what you mean precisely by ""based on science  [...] facts"" your argument here is not actually stating anything. I would say a lot of legislation is based on facts. I would say a lot of legislation is based on irrelevant facts. I would say a lot of good legislation is and should be more about values and process than it is about facts. How exactly does ""based on science"" fit into this? It's all empty words without falsifiability.

&gt;  Again this is an example of ""deal the hand your dealt"" or ""suck it up"", while these are true the frustrating thing is that it can be changed, its just very difficult to, and that in and of itself is enough to make people figuratively say ""fuck it."" I refuse that, I mean its the whole reason I made this post.

Frankly, these days what I find equally frustrating are people who find protocols and policy stifling without realizing that things often are the way they are for actual reasons. See for example the bitcoin community slowly realizing it wants to recreate a lot of the systems it was excited to dump.

&gt;  I bring that up as both CERN and the LHC are the products of a government that understands the value of science. Compared to our governments shunning of data.

Our current government appears to be the result of forces that are mainly unconnected to science. How would policy ""based on science"" have helped here? It wouldn't because the voter does not give a damn. ""Based on science"" does not implicitly create a better government. Having a politically active society that values and understands the strengths and limitations of science, that ***would*** help. But to get there... we need healthy politics.

Make sense? ""Science based politics"" does not inherently mean a healthier political environment. Both because science needs the right questions asked, and because it needs people themselves to give a damn about the science.

You can watch people living in the most scientifically advanced, healthfully, economically successful, egalitarian age that has ever lived, and see people vote against the very factors that brought them there. And in many cases, for good reason.

&gt;  The fact that such a flaw like this is endemic in ALL governments means that something needs to be done about, the way a government operates needs to be completely rethought.

I absolutely utterly do not understand how you think looking to science would help here. You bring up the Congo, which does demonstrate the power of government to do worse than 0. But the powers at the time were using science erroneously or in misleading ways to justify their actions. Again: science does not tell you what questions to ask.

I think your way of measuring government is flawed as well. The fact that something can go to shit may just be a fundamental property of the thing itself. For example, an apple can rot, a banana peel can allow you to slip. That doesn't mean it's a terrible thing.

&gt;  You add empirical science to that equation, where comparative or predictive data must support the legislation then that refines the RGB even further. Most importantly in a Science RBG the legislators would actually be required to understand the data behind the legislation.

Off the top of my head:

1. we can't expect our legislators to be experts in every field they legislate on. Workarounds would, I assume, have to contract out policy in ways that are ripe for corruption of the facts. Furthermore, this would take an incredibly long time.
2. how would we get to this point?
3. who says the science is right? There are entire industries of fake science.
4. a lot of government is about discussing what even gets to be discussed. There's a lot of room to sideline all climate change stuff for example. I mentioned the time factor about, it seems like any legislator could just say ""climate change hasn't been studied enough"" and all the other climate change deniers would agree, and we have exactly the same situation we have now.

In other words, politics is COMPLICATED. And unfortunately, it's complicated because people and facts and communication are complicated.

&gt;  For starters the academic profile of a legislator must not being one singular thing such as law or business as is such right now.

I agree, (that said, there's a pipeline reason why things are the way they are, diversity in legislation is a hard problem). I would say though that a government composed nearly entirely of scientists would be incredibly shitty. I've seen few things more cringeworthy than a room full of engineers who start out thinking that because they're all rational thinkers, they must agree on the important details.

&gt;  Policy is not informed by research, policy is informed by money. I don't think I need a better example than Net Neutrality and Climate Change.

Negative! You have no idea what you're talking about here! Policy is informed by both. You've picked two very obvious public examples of ignoring research, while ignoring all the examples you apparently haven't heard about. Research routinely informs politicians. Certain key issues get more charged though.

&gt;  Diversity through arbitrary things like race, sexuality and gender wouldn't matter. Diversity would be in thought, in experience, and the process of formulating and testing experiments (legislation). People are diverse in how they interact, not how they look.

1. It's provably not arbitrary, and does matter. e.g. Just including a black man on a jury will change the decisions of the OTHER jury members towards more just decisions towards both black and white defendants. Diverse representation matters.
2. Diversity IS diversity of thought, experience, etc. You do not have the experience of being female, if you are male, and as such you lack personal insight into women's health. We've seen this over and over and over again. From Silicon Valley, to research labs in Texas, to legislation in DC.

&gt;I actually think it helps them by making it clear that their friend, coworker etc. likes them romantically. They then get to make a decision on if the friendship or whatever their current relationship is continues rather than being mislead.

That is only if you assume they welcome it. As I said, most people don't welcome it. So instead of presenting them with a positive opportunity, you have burdened them with the task of either avoiding you or removing you from their life. Because there is no reason for them to assume you will respect their relationship in the future if you didn't from the start."	7	"[""'re harmed""]"	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'re harmed""]"	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	31734053896	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bctze6/_/ektmwp4/	686682222	31733926684.0	2019-04-13 17:42:26	160395050511.0	2r1t	6	False	125	2	False	True	65.83

3675	"&gt;Namely, you have given the family two health insurance plans. You're having them both get an average employer sponsored plan, and medicaid/an Obamacare exchange plan. 

I did have an error here in that I was applying the Obamacare Premium Tax Credits as discounts to the cost of employer sponsored healthcare. There was also a mathematical error in the healthcare premium calculations making them inadvertently additive across brackets (which had the effect of adding the premiums multiple times). 

[This version has both errors corrected and I've also removed the employer subsidy for medicare recipients.](http://i.imgur.com/emLCQdx.png) Since 35 hours/week at the federal minimum is below the medicaid threshold, I'm assuming anyone over the medicaid threshold is entitled to employer sponsored care under obamacare. Therefore, the exchange plans and premium tax credits are excluded entirely from calculations at all income levels. I've also pushed up the minimum income shown under sanders plan to reflect 35 hours/week at his minimum wage of $15.

This leaves a small gap on the lowest income levels where their effective rate is higher under the Sanders plan. However, if we're counting employer contributions as part of someone's total compensation, then we maybe we should consider the medicaid benefits provide by the federal government as well, since this subsidy enables employers to offer such low total compensation packages. [This version includes that by adding the same amount as the average employer healthcare contribution as ""Corporate Welfare"" for medicaid recipients](http://i.imgur.com/7yEhf5M.png)

In practical terms, low paying employers who avoid providing healthcare or depend on medicaid-subsidized workers will end up paying more for their workers, but there is little to no chance these workers will see a reduction in pay, especially with the minimum wage hike. Everyone not on medicaid and under $250,000 in taxable income will see savings under Sanders's plan. Everyone over $250,000 will see an increase in effective rates.

3679	"Hey OP, this is a topic that comes up a lot. I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/48usgx/cmv_i_believe_black_people_have_a_lower_average/d0mpy0w) was a pretty good comment that covers most points that come up. (Credit to /u/Doppleganger07)

The tl;dr of this is two things: 

1) IQ is an imperfect measure of intelligence, which doesn't actually have a unified, commonly accepted definition by all the experts. IQ tests show *something*, but it's not equivalent to ""intelligence.""

2) Many, *many* factors other than genetics influence intelligence. It's impossible to eliminate all these factors when trying to find out whether a demographic group as broad as ""all black people"" has lower IQ, and we know in the past that groups with lower IQs and actual genetic differences based on demographics didn't have lower IQs because of genetics but because of environmental factors, which are very much at play with the black population. It therefore seems quite likely that there's no genetically based difference to intelligence at work.

For convenience, I've quoted the whole thing below. The original post has links to sources that are not included in the quote, so please go there if you'd like them.

&gt;This statistic of course, doesn't take into account anything other than race. Let's go through why most of the academic community isn't concerned about this.

&gt;1) The gap we see here is not at all unique. There have been many instances of populations of people with lower than average IQ that have closed the gap entirely.

&gt;For example, women used to score far lower than men on IQ tests. This is no longer the case since women have gotten more educated. In this case, we are starting to see the IQs of women surpass those of men (in general)].

&gt;Another example is the IQ data gathered from East and West Germany prior to unification. East and West Germans were / are genetically indistinguishable, but there was a gap between the two reaching 17 points in some areas. If you take IQ as being mostly genetic, these results are highly problematic.

&gt;A third example (and I could go on for longer but this is already long enough) is the Flynn effect. This is the well documented phenomenon that observes populations IQs rising as they develop economically. The average black person today gets the same score as the average white person did in the US in the year 1950. The average black person's score is 15 points higher than the average white person just 100 short years ago. Unless you think there was a major genetic change in whites in the past 50-100 years, the rise in scores (for both races) was due to environmental changes. Whites have simply enjoyed a higher standard of living (then and now) which leads to them having environments more conducive to learning.

&gt;I know I said that was the last example I'd give, but let me do one more because I think it illustrates my point. Another big difference in IQ scores can be seen between northern Americans and Americans in the South. In fact, there have been studies done where blacks in the north scored higher on IQ tests than whites in the south. Are northerners different genetically than southerners? If not, then why the difference? If we accept whatever that difference is, why are you not using that to explain the black - white difference?

&gt;The above examples give pause to the idea that IQs for groups are set in stone (they 100% are not and that's a fact), and that genetics are the primary determination of a persons cognitive ability.

&gt;2) IQ scores only measure one type of intelligence (poorly)

&gt;IQ scores can only measure one type of intelligence, and it doesn't even do that as well as we'd like. IQ tests don't accurately measure strategic intelligence, or even creative intelligence. 

&gt;This is a huge problem since these forms of intelligence that the IQ tests cannot measure are some of the most important. Creativity lies at the soul of every major invention. It lies in the soul of every song, movie or play. Similar things can be said of strategic thinking.

&gt;Would we think worse of people like Jimi Hendrix and Ghengis Khan if we found out they scored low on an IQ test. If we would, we probably shouldn't.

&gt;3) IQ scores cannot measure potential

&gt;There are certain types of questions asked on IQ tests that you can get better at with practice. For example, pattern recognition and memorization are two things you can improve on drastically throughout your life (if you practice). This has two problems. One, it gives advantages to people who do similar kinds of thinking activities daily (this explains some of the Flynn effect we discussed earlier). Two, we may mistake someone had a low genetic limit based on someone not normally having to perform those kinds of activities, or not having as good of tools throughout their lives. Here is someone discussing this here.

&gt;4) At this point people will often say that when you control for certain variables the differences don't entirely disappear. For one, the differences fall away quite rapidly once you start controlling for things (income and neighborhoods mostly). Second, we have no way of controlling for other things that effect IQ testing scores.

&gt;One such example is Stereotype Threat. This is a phenomena that we've seen in not only IQ scores, but in math, reading, sports and (essentially) any other area where a stereotype exists. Stereotype threat is the phenomena that shows people perform worse if there is a fear that they will further a certain stereotype about themselves. The presence of this cannot be totally corrected for (although it can be manipulated somewhat).

&gt;Another example is cultural differences. We know that there are many ways that different races raise their children that influence their cognitive development. I really want to wrap this up, but one such example is the word gap.

3693	"While I do agree that it's difficult to be a housewife in today's society, I don't think it's because of social pressures and fear of ridicule. It's more simply that being a housewife is financially difficult to do. You need to have a pretty decent income to comfortably support a family. Let's say you have a husband and two children. You have phone bills to pay, a mortgage, car payments/insurance, possibly health insurance for your family, utilities, eventual college tuition for your children, clothes, food, and extracurricular activities your children may want to do, etc. To put the financial burden on one person to handle all of that is a lot to ask, especially in today's times where a college degree is borderline required to make decent money.

Your mother is probably against you being a housewife not because it's ""bad"" or ""lazy"", but because it's difficult to solely be a housewife and live comfortably. You'll have financial struggles that are going to have a lot of affects on your normal life. For example, guys don't want women who are housewives not because they're lazy or gold diggers, but because you're putting the entirety of the financial burden on their shoulders. You're expecting them to foot the bill after they worked hard in school to get a degree to earn a decent salary. Put yourself in the guys shoes: do you want all of your money to go into supporting your family, or would you rather split the expenses and have some extra money for luxuries or whatever you want to spend it on? You talk about cooking food for the family, having time for yourself, get your hair done, day drink, etc. Are you seriously going to ask any potential husband to foot the bill for the majority/all of that?

There isn't anything inherently wrong with being a housewife, but unless you have an inheritance or some kind of passive income to help contribute, life is just in general going to be difficult for you. Everything from finding a husband to paying the bills is going to be difficult. You're more than likely going to struggle and be stressed. Unless you land someone who makes 6 figures, you're just in general asking for a lot."	17	['be stressed']	1	1	0.058823529411764705	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be stressed']	1	1	0.058823529411764705	1	29721246267	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/72kwvx/_/dnj9ge3/	427598205		2017-09-26 12:22:41		Amp1497	1	False	376	0	False	True	57.5

This is just factually wrong, and a really dumb conclusion to make. Being overweight means you eat too many calories. That really is the only conclusion you can draw about someone’s character based on their BMI.

Judging someone’s character based on their weight is foolish, because you don’t know the story. They might well be 300 lbs because they just sit on a couch and eat chips all day. They might be 300 lbs because their kid died a year ago and they are still crawling out of that hole and putting their life back together.

Basically when you invest in the stock market, unless you are buying into an IPO or secondary offering you aren't giving money to a company to invest.  I don't see why that is preferable to spending the money on any product where the proceeds of that purchase will benefit the seller.  And the incentives to earn more money through investment are still there.  I'm not advocating a 100% tax, rather a tax on profits that is in line with the taxes people pay on wages.  	5	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	29806920187	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7908o0/_/doy9qt7/	438391008	29806884665.0	2017-10-27 00:59:51		dew89	2	False	96	0	False	False	68.91
3717	"You seem to be working off two similar but distinct ideas. One being that scientists themselves aren't influenced by philosophy of science and the other being that it doesn't influence their work. 

The former i think relies on a reductive assumption about what scientists find interesting. The scientists i know all have a pretty deep interest in the questions of what it is that they are doing as well as wanting to think about epistemological questions such as in quantification studies which has encouraged them to ask questions less about what the data show but what are the limitations in what the data can show philosophically based on what we are and what we can measure. 

The latter point strikes me as an excessively instrumental approach to understanding how philosophy is used. Showing that someone has decided to investigate a specific question or phrase it in a specific way because of some philosophical work they read is kind of impossible and influence doesn't have the kind of simple causation you want. For example how do you know that angrist and imbens were totally unaware of Cartwright and her ideas even if their only familiarity with them was that some other academic were talking about those ideas and that made them start thinking about those questions.

3724	"The intention of advertising is to manipulate behavior. It isn't driven by caring about you or your ""user experience"". It's driven by the desire to separate you from your money. Often, the best ways to manipulate behavior includes understanding subtle psychological factors about your target audience and then using these in ways that the consumers are not aware of. In many instances, your lack of knowledge of what advertisers are up to makes their strategies far more effective.

The intention of marketing is never to accurately represent a product or service, but to build up awareness of the positive aspects of your product or service, while distracting people from the reasons they have not to do business with you. The greater the degree of control you have over the dialogue, the greater the degree of control you will have over the outcome.

While there is nothing necessarily inherently wrong with people collecting data about you for ""targeted"" marketing purposes, you need to understand that no one doing this is on ""your"" side. People are collecting data from you for the express purpose of either making money directly from you, or from your data (because that will help others extract money from you).

So I guess the question is, how involved do you want people to be in the minutest details of your life, especially when those people (or organizations) have very different goals than you? I suppose it might be different if there was a certain level of transparency about what data was being collected and how it was being used, but there's really not is there? Do you know who has data about you now and what that data is really being used for? In what ways might you be getting manipulated that you're unaware of?

As someone who practices psychology, I can tell you that from the typical person's internet activities, there's a lot of available data there if someone had the desire to manipulate your behaviors (and they most certainly do have that desire). If you're convinced that you are either smart enough not to be manipulated or that people can't manipulate you, then you have a very poor understanding of how psychology works. 

I would rather people not collect the data about me, because I have a value for understanding (as best as I can) how and why the dialogue around me is being manipulated. When advertisers and large conglomerates have unfettered access to you (while you have limited or non-existent access to how your data is or is not being used, or what data is being gathered), you are at a historically unprecedented disadvantage in terms of your potential for being manipulated. 

From a psychological standpoint, you are the perfect consumer. You're okay with the information being collected about you and aren't necessarily concerned with how or why it gets used. While it may be true that no human is directly looking at your data specifically, if you think that this doesn't mean you're behavior isn't actively being manipulated by those who own your data, you're simply mistaken."	20	"[""isn't driven"", ""'s driven"", 'was being collected', 'was being used', 'being used', 'be getting manipulated', 'be manipulated', 'is being manipulated', 'being used', 'is being gathered', 'being manipulated', 'being collected', 'gets used', 'being manipulated']"	14	10	0.5	1	"[""isn't driven by"", ""'s driven by"", 'being manipulated by']"	3	3	0.15	1	"[""isn't driven"", 'was being collected', 'was being used', 'being used', 'be getting manipulated', 'be manipulated', 'is being manipulated', 'being used', 'is being gathered', 'being manipulated', 'being collected', 'gets used']"	12	8	0.4	1	27523246426	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2qjc2z/_/cn6mouy/	165504491		2014-12-27 14:36:34		smokeinhiseyes	125	False	513	0	False	True	45.39

3740	"&gt;Think of this hypothetical scenario: You are a MtF and you are stranded on an island with another person, a biological woman. You both are without any memory of what civilization is like or their judgements on you. Your only perspective of yourself is your own and the nice woman who is with you. (We’re going to say she’s nice for the sake of the argument.) The only world you would know is the one where you’re accepted for what you are. In this case would you really care if someone thinks of you fully as a woman? You get to act, dress and do what you want. Your shade of gender is fully accepted. The thought of someone even hating on you for being different doesn’t exist. You never experienced it. The real problem truly arises when we turn the nice woman into a hateful woman.

No that's not it at all. As someone trans I viewed the primary discomfort as not society but my body being wrong. I wanted female characteristics. A higher pitched voice, softer skin, thinner body hair, thicker, healthier scalp hair, breasts, hips/a curvy rather than blocky shape, etc. I hated many things about having a male body as well, but I don't need to discuss them (yet anyway).

Let's even take the woman in your equation off the island. I'm there forever by myself. Except there's an endless supply of hormone pills. Would I take those pills? Would I want to see a woman in any reflection of myself (no mirrors, but could see my reflection in the water)? ""You're god damned right"" is the answer to those two questions.

Now how society treats me is an aspect of being trans. No question about it. But it's a distant secondary to the primary, ie my body being correct rather than incorrect."	25	['are stranded', '’re accepted', 'is fully accepted']	3	3	0.12	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are stranded', '’re accepted', 'is fully accepted']	3	3	0.12	1	32046990260	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bwrexk/_/epzy7xw/	720154712		2019-06-04 16:01:48	25726289950.0	Weisse_Rose	6	False	307	1	False	True	75.91

3747	"Hi!

I'm not the OP but I'm interested in your view, especially those two points:

&gt; If if I as a Christian am wrong then as a result of my belief I lived a better (morally speaking) life then I might’ve otherwise.

Why do you say so? What, as an atheist, did I do that makes my life less ""morally speaking"" good?

&gt; If I’m an atheist then the consequence of me being wrong is (insert whatever the fate of non believers is for that religion). 

Isn't it also true if, by sheer bad luck, you got the wrong religion? For example, what if the actual ""after-life"" is horrible for Christians but perfectly nice for non-believers or people who believe in a different god?

Edit:
&gt;I don’t believe in leprechauns (to reference an earlier comment you made) but I also don’t care that others do. For you Leprechauns seem to be in same category as God. So my question is why do you care so much if people believe in God or not? 

Again, I'm not OP, but I can assure you that you would start caring about beliefs in Leprechauns if a small minority of Leprechauns believers started killing people in the name of Leprechauns. Or if (another small) minority of Leprechauns believers started lobbying so that certain stuff should not be taught in school because it's incompatible with the existence of Leprechauns. [Or if the head of the Leprechauns cult used his veto at the U.N. to avoid decriminalizing homosexuality worldwide](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vatican-homosexuals/vatican-attacked-for-opposing-gay-decriminalization-idUSTRE4B13QA20081202?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews).

3751	"The Apple Watch has gone from a joke to the most sold watch on the planet, and it really is an amazing piece of tech. Apple has also made the genius move of not targeting people who love cool watches, like most of their competitors did at the start; instead they've really put all their chips in the health basket, with some of the best- in-class exercise and health applications available. This means they get all the people (like me) who stopped wearing watches about 15 years ago to sit up and take notice.

I got a Series 3 for my 40th birthday two years ago and though I would hate it; I ""don't wear watches"". I thought I'd use it as a particularly expensive FitBit. But then something weird happened. I started using the apps. I got a sleep monitoring app. I got used to it. Then one morning, as I was sitting eating breakfast with my kids, an alarm went off. My heart rate was dangerously fast considering I wasn't moving. My wife suggested that the pulled muscle in my left shoulder might actually be my heart... I went straight to the emergency room. Turned out it wasn't actually my heart, but a very very serious bout of pneumonia. Luckily, thanks to my watch they caught it three days earlier than they would've otherwise. Otherwise I would've had about a 50/50 chance of survival.

Suffice it to say that I still wear it every day, I'm buying a series 5, and both my elderly parents got series 4's for Christmas. Just something small like knowing the watch will call 911 if my mother falls and knocks her head, or if my dad has a heart attack, is an immense weight off my shoulders.

Apple really are killing it with their watch. I'm sure there are single-use devices out there that do some of the stuff they do for half the cost, but Apple created a whole segment of new watch customers, while the competition were basically going ""it's a cool watch and you can also get texts and count steps on it"" and aiming them at early adopters, gearheads and watch-nerds."	20	['got used']	1	1	0.05	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['got used']	1	1	0.05	1	32657776734	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/d3db44/_/f03lhsu/	791720068	32655154409.0	2019-09-13 04:25:28	24355303.0	Urabutbl	234	False	363	0	False	True	78.38

3759	"&gt;I don't think it's necessarily fair to call the language ""deceiving"", even if you interpret it in a way different from its intended meaning. It might just be the result of people using the jargon of their particular field, and lay-people repeating and interpreting it according to their colloquial, everyday definitions, and getting the wrong impression.

I'm actually somewhat convinced that the jargon itself is already deliberately deceiving. I mean usually when you adopt a colloquial term into the jargon of a certain discipline it's because you want to create a relation and ease the understanding, by building upon already established mental images. That's not the case here. If you take that definition of rationality:

&gt;The second characteristic of game theory is that individuals are assumed to be instrumentally rational. This means that individuals are assumed to act in their own self interest. This presupposes that individuals are able to determine, at least probabilistically, the outcome of their actions, and have preferences over these outcomes. 

Then the only way in which you can act rational w.r.t. this definition, is to act in the way that **THEY** perceive is in **YOUR** self interest. Tell me how this is not hubristic and/or deliberately deceiving. 

Now take idk the Wikipedia definition of rationality:

&gt;Rationality is the quality or state of being rational – that is, being based on or agreeable to reason.

with reason being:

&gt;Reason is the capacity of consciously making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and adapting or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information.

Their use of irrational is **literally** an insult to other people's intelligence:

&gt;Intelligence has been defined in many ways, including: the capacity for **logic**, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, **reasoning**, planning, creativity, **critical thinking**, and problem solving.

&gt;""we are tasked with figuring out how hypothetical rational agents would play this game..."".

More like figuring out how:

&gt;individuals (that) are not fully rational but instead seek (to) solve complex decisions by adopting simplistic rules that are generally sub-optimal (would behave).

But fair enough, I'm starting to get sarcastic. And my interpretation might be worse than how that had been intended. 

&gt;The assumption of rationality cannot be flawed, because it's part of the problem statement itself. It is not a (perhaps incorrect) assumption made in attempting to solve a problem - it is the very definition of the abstract problem being studied!

I mean partially their definition of rationality might be flawed. Which would make their statements not sound but doesn't say anything about the validity of their findings. And their definition of rationality could be inconsistent with their application of that principle, which would also damage the validity of their statements.

&gt;Now, if somebody goes on to assume that this will necessarily correlate with how real people play the game, that would be overreaching - I'm sure the naive ""secondary math users"" you mention do exist.

That is precisely what they are doing giving the introduction and that they are literally trying to justify that in the next paragraph. 

&gt;What's wrong/hubristic with this? It's basically saying that people aren't omniscient robots. It's well known that humans operate under a whole bunch of cognitive biases. Obviously humans are not entirely rational in this particular sense of the word, and the writers here seem to be well aware of this. They are making the case for checking whether these abstract mathematical models concerning hypothetical rational agents correspond at all with reality, because they might end up having some utility/predictive power.

Those ""rational agents"" aren't omniscient robots either, they just follow a predefined logic to it's conclusion. To be fair I'm still somewhat under the impression that the spiralling downwards for example is itself a cognitive bias in which you assume the other player to be competitive which is an assumption that is not logically self-evident. It can make sense to make that assumption but it's just that, an assumption. To claim it to be ""rational"" and the only thing that is in ""the self-interest of the agent"" is hubristic.  
Especially the second justification confirms that, arguing that it's the result of natural selection, de facto pretending that it's the optimal strategy, despite having to backtrack on that due to a lack of evidence. 

So your argument here is that this is more or less justification for why it makes sense to research that and how it could potentially be applied rather than actually making overreaching claims? 

But then again according to their own mission statement:

&gt;According to this positive methodology the assumption of rationality should not be dismissed merely because it is believed to be unrealistic.

3762	"Sure. Let's go through the steps.

They put out comic 1. It offends some people. This happens. Options are to just ignore it (a completely viable tactic), to meaningfully engage it (research the issues and ideas being used), or to mock it.

They go with third one. Their second comic trivializes, simplifies, and strawmans the criticism of their first one. You don't have to agree with rape culture theory to understand that *no one was seriously suggesting their comic causes rapists*. The criticism was that their comic makes light of a real issue. Again, you don't have to agree with it. If I told a 9/11 joke, someone might accuse me of making light of a historical tragedy. I could respond by ignoring them (a 100% acceptable tactic). I could respond by genuinely trying to talk to them about why the think that. But if I responded to them by saying ""Oh, what, you're saying my joke is going to cause more 9/11s, you're crazy!"", which is what their second comic did, then I'm going from just making a joke that offended people to actively antagonizing them and doing so in a way that publicly ridicules their beliefs while simplifying and misunderstanding them. That's Asshole Move Number One.

This is what totally blows the issue up. Suddenly, you've got guys like me, who were totally on their side, saying ""Whoa, hold on, these people were wrong to be so offended, but there's no need to ridicule them and their beliefs."" Things become contentious. And sides start to form of Us (the people who back Penny Arcade) and Them (the people who are increasingly unhappy with them). So what are their options now? They can smooth the issue over. They can try to engage both sides. Or again, they can walk away and let it blow over.

Instead, they double-down. They make Dickwolves shirts for profit, explicitly selling to the Us a way to show solidarity and hostility towards Them. Claiming ""they're just capitalizing on a funny joke"" is either naive or denial. The entire reason ""dickwolves"" even became a thing is because of the controversy, and the shirt is a direct response to the controversy. And selling shirts to codify Us Vs Them flies completely in the face of their message of inclusivity and open-mindedness. It's an active way of letting people wear a message that makes people who disagree with them feel unwelcome. A person wearing a dickwolf shirt is saying ""I agree with Penny Arcade on the dickwolf controversy"". That's the clear intent. And it's an intent that makes even more people feel uncomfortable and offended. By this point, I've personally gone from having PA's back to being actively pissed at them. 

At the core, from the start, they took a position of ""The people who are offended are wrong, they're crazy, and we're going to both laugh at them and let our fans wear shirts that show they agree with us in laughing at them."" It's a hostile, defensive, and needless position to take, and it's an impossible position to take if you're also trying to fight for inclusivity and a safe environment.

I really only have one problem with blockchain electoral systems and it's that they can have serious problems enforcing ballot secrecy without compromising on the quality of the blockchain itself.

With secret ballots, the government has to not only ensure that others can't see my ballot, but that I can't share documented proof of who I voted for. That's extremely important for a democracy because it eliminates a voter's ability to provide evidence of their vote to someone that bribed them to vote a certain way.

Redrawing districts to give the Hopi a representative takes a representative away from some other group of people. I see that as candidates manipulating the rules for their benefit. Non-representativeness of the government is always going to be a problem with first past the post voting, and districts. I don't think candidates or bureaucrats should be able to decide elections before they happen. I think my proposal makes it harder to do that, and is more politically feasible than many alternatives.

&gt;Some poly relationships have a hierarchy of ""primary relationships"" and ""secondary relationships"". Some don't. Both can work, as long as everyone involved is aware, and ok with the situation.

These are more vague blanket statements that could be applied to any relationship (friendships, mono relationship, poly relationship, etc..). Sure they could all work hypothetically, but *how*?

Even with the most radical reform that cuts out all waste and makes the entire system as efficient as possible, it still takes so many moving parts to provide the standard of healthcare that we are able to provide and that people demand, that I don't think we can afford the fair and accurate base costs at $156,000 per person. 

But that $156,000 will go a lot further with collective bargaining power. Suddenly cost of an epi-pen could drop from ~$ 700 to ~$50 for example. 

I mean other coutnries have solve dthe problem. Wha tis it about the American system that makes it impossible to copy other successful strategies? Sure, there are some areas which are rural which will make it harder; but overall scaling up a system makes it more efficient. I’m looking at numbers for Japan for example:

&gt; In 2008, Japan spent about 8.5% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), or US$2,873 per capita, on health

&gt; Rhus, as of 2009, in the U.S. an MRI of the neck region could cost $1,500, but in Japan it cost US$98.

2,873 per capita is ~$239 per month, which is pretty close to your $200 per month mark. 

In Canada:

&gt; In 2013 the total reached $211 billion, averaging $5,988 per person.

So that’s ~$499 per person. Not great but a lot better than the US is doing. 

The biggest challenge to the US is definitely not knowledge and technology has exceeded our finances, because the US is richer than many other countries; it just pays more and gets less.

The first and most obvious is to reject the premise of self ownership. There are plenty of ways to reject that slavery is wrong, regardless of whether people own themselves (for example, we might say that the net suffering of slavery vastly outweighs any positive, etc). 


The second would be to say that our positive rights come from essentially the same place as a child's right to care comes from. I would hold that virtually any possible social order is in constant violation of all kinds of my negative rights, and as such, I can justly demand things like:

&gt; food - Healthcare - Housing - Water - Transportation ... you get the idea

In a world where my negative rights are truly respected, I could play frisbee anywhere where I wouldn't be throwing my frisbee at some nonconsenting person's face. It's hard to see how such a society could possibly support humanity though - for example, in our society, if I go to the fields in Iowa to play frisbee, a conflict will begin (probably with a farmer coming out and yelling at me), and if I continue to assert my negative right to play frisbee, I will end up carted away by men with guns. This seems like a pretty big infringement on my negative rights, though since it's not going to go away, no matter what kind of society we build, I might as well get together and demand things like healthcare in return for the tort committed against me."	8	['are truly respected']	1	1	0.125	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are truly respected']	1	1	0.125	1	34720650295	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/hs17bn/_/fy7s187/	1075010387		2020-07-16 00:06:35	38754269.0	model_railroad_alt	2	False	267	1	False	True	55.31

1) People who are vegetarians because they don't want to inflict suffering do not answer the question of late term abortion. You, for example, do not want to cause a third term fetus any suffering but you didn't say that you're against late term abortions. (Some people are fine with early, not with late.)

2) Another argument I've heard is that the fetus is an invasive species within the mother. If that life reaches a point where it can exist outside the womb in neonatal, then I would think they would against abortion. 

3) Quality of life. This is much more persuasive as the people who became vegetarianism don't want to cause suffering (in terms of the quality of life) and feel the circumstances outside the womb, or after birth would be wrong either from a dire environment or birth defect.

Perhaps you were reaching for a kind of Aristotelian ""purpose-virtue"" schema? As in, we evaluate the quality of a red color by seeing how red it really is?
&gt; And if they are separate, and not self-referential, then they only have the existing relationship they have because we have created/chosen that relationship. It is a sensible, logical relationship, but it is not intrinsic.

Well, no, /u/JustinJamm, if medical care works we train more doctors. They are intrinsically linked. If we establish medical care is good, training new doctors is the only way to get it (reasonably speaking, because I'd love to believe we could educate everyone about medicine and everyone would get great medical care but that isn't going to happen tomorrow, so we train more doctors tomorrow).
The issues you've stumbled upon regarding self reference is not that something being linked to something else is self referential, but that sometimes self reference is involved in some things that are intrinsically linked.  
  
&gt;You mean ""hard science"" rather than ""soft science""? Psychology, human development, political science, anthropology, etc. all investigate how/why persons and people groups think, live, and develop the way they do, using data very much like what I described. (not only, but including)  

No, I mean good science. Like where 'observation' isn't something we debate. We observe the sun rises everyday, we know one day that will end, we know that will be a sad day, but we cannot observe 'the spirit.'  
Good science is something that follows the discernible methods involved in professional practice.  

&gt;Interesting. Why did you just add philosophy into the discussion? Do you find philosophy to be methodical and legitimately evaluative -- like a parallel to science, but with the soft/abstract rather than the hard/concrete?  

Philosophy is involved in every discussion. I named it now because you keep getting broader and broader and taking the focus away from the specific arguments I started with so I wanted to respond broadly to cover both science as a whole and metaphysics since that is the way we approach non-empirical investigations, since you kept sticking to a broad science vs religion tack by trying to compare the process of investigative thought with affirming a religion by correlating individual spiritual experiences.  

&gt;Do you believe at least something exists without having ""come from"" anything else? It just ""is""? (e.g. that the physical universe ""just is"")
Or, do you believe literally everything had a ""beginning"" of some kind? e.g. that it came from something else?
(I'm not trying to be difficult, but rather to start from something simpler since we keep ending up at the phrase ""slippery slope"")  

I'm not going to discuss those beliefs with you because I'd like to stay on topic.

3831	"I’m speaking really generally because getting specific would drag this post out into an article. But I’ll try define the terms:

Ethnicity: a category determined by linguistic, religious, geographic, and cultural factors

Heritage: not a group, but the biological lineage of your ancestry

Race: categories which are social constructed based on physical attributes

Nationality: if you are a passport holder of a nation

So i mean you can be part of a particular African heritage (meaning your ancestry is/was part of a particular African ethnicity), but not be that particular African ethnicity. You might be ethnically African American, and within that category you will find various other divisions of ethnicity down the line if you wanted to taxonomies them.

But I don’t believe taxonomising ethnicities is correct, and that it is more accurate to see ethnicities as groups of attribute (those I’ve listed) that do not relate to race. Because I think it’s perfectly possible for two racially different people to have the same ethnicity in so far as they speak the same language, follow the same cultural and religious practices, and have grown up in the same place for the same amount of time.

So when you conflate race with ethnicity, despite it being historically apt (especially in a time where societies did not interact and where isolated), it endangers the modern racial minority’s freedoms by implying their race entails their ethnicity, when really it only entails their heritage."	7	['are social constructed']	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are social constructed']	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	34385566974	5	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/gvcgu2/_/fsoa1a6/	1020108602	34385017156.0	2020-06-02 17:39:11	345666318330.0	samweil	1	False	240	0	False	True	22.42

3840	"&gt; Well, what if someone proposed a law saying it was okay to kill Moroccans?

The thing is, as horrible as that is, I would still argue that should be legal.  There are many bills put forth that I think are despicable and awful and unconstitutional, or that go against civil rights, and for the most part in most of the western world these bills never go anywhere.  But if you can make it illegal to even suggest these bills, then whoever is in power at the time has the ability to punish those who disagree with them.  

&gt;How many steps removed from the actual harm can a speech act be and still be okay? 

Honestly, a lot of speech, from both the left and the right, does harm.  Should the demonetization of political opponents be made illegal because it does harm?  That sort of behavior is done by nearly every political party in every country and it does plenty of harm by creating an ""us"" vs ""them"" mentality, which leads to plenty of major consequences.  Many speech does both good and harm at the same time with unintended consequences to what you say.  People in the 60's and 70's who were trying to create a war on drugs thought they were actually doing good, and in the end they ended up doing a lot of harm with their speech and laws.  Should they be punished?

Bad ideas are always going to exist.  People will always suggest crazy laws, will always say things that can cause harm.  I think the best you can really do from a legal government is second degree.  If you tell people to commit a crime, that's a crime.  

&gt; But here's my other pitch against your view that his act was appropriate: changing immigration laws won't result in fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands. He wasn't proposing a law; he was saying that either Moroccans need to leave, or more need to die than are born. Those are the only ways there could be fewer.

This is a stronger point for me, and I'll need to understand better the context of what he's saying before I can agree or disagree. Is he arguing the deportation of criminals, or the mass deportation of all Moroccan citizens?  

I do agree that suggesting there would be fewer with him around is a bit troublesome.  I would want to see something specific about how there would be fewer under him before I make any conclusions.

3843	"Okay, here's my response to the free market idea for healthcare.

Singapore, as said elsewhere in the thread has a system where every single purchase is first party transaction, that is to say, you purchase a service with your own money for yourself. 

Here is an article explaining the difference between first, second and third party transactions.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/10/12/a-free-market-healthcare-revolution-why-and-how/#6d27d3ef7075

It's a bit long, so TLDR: 

First party: you pay for your own care.

Second party: You spend your money for someone else's care

Third party: You spend someone else's money for someone else's care.

As the article explains and backs up, First party is always going to be more efficient, as you will be far more incentivised to find the best cost/quality ratio you can. Government on the other hand, is always third party, and has no incentive to find a good cost/quality ratio at all. 

To quote the article
&gt;One of the best examples of a first-party transaction in healthcare is direct primary care services (DPCS). Direct primary care services feature agreements between a patient and primary care doctor whereby a patient agrees to pay a monthly or annual fee in exchange for a specified set of services. The keyword in direct primary care services is “direct.” Thanks to a loophole in Section 10104 of Obamacare, enrollees in DPCS agreements avoid interference from the 159 new organizations inserted between a doctor and patient that resulted from the passage of Obamacare. A study by Qliance demonstrated that overall healthcare costs could be reduced by as much as 20% by using direct primary care services.

The way that Singapore manages this, is by having the government focus on keeping costs low through incentives, while still giving the industry room to breathe,  as opposed to making sure absolutely everyone is able to get anything. They subsidize up to a point for the poor and the elderly, but not nearly to the level of the American government.  The government doesn't directly control the prices, just influences them.

Such a system does mean that the poor will be unable to access certain resource intensive treatments that the rich could get. But that's just a fact of scarcity. Otherwise, it keeps prices low for 99% of procedures. This means that on average, people will get better and cheaper care, even if certain rare edge cases (0.001% or so) fall through the cracks.

Basically, for the most efficient healthcare, you want to maximize first party transactions."	21	['could be reduced']	1	1	0.047619047619047616	1	['could be reduced by']	1	1	0.047619047619047616	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	29519275122	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6n4zvm/_/dk70igi/	401661346	29519243442.0	2017-07-13 22:24:28		Akitten	2	False	409	1	False	True	60.14

Tell that to the guy who's been married 5 times.

&gt; I feel questions like ""Should I buy her flowers?"", ""Should I kiss him now?"", ""When should we go out next?"", and many more could be answered easier and would work out better if you had some experience dating.

Your success in dating (and in life, really) is directly proportional to

Of course both were bad, but one was just the means to the end.

3853	"&gt;I define Peterson as more of a legitimate professional academic who I and many others don't agree with on things.

That's somewhat the role he fills in that alt-right circus, ""the professor"". He lends some reputation and ""neutrality"" to claims and positions that would otherwise be seen as way more ""controversial"" (crackpot lunacy), but if a lawyer (Shapiro) and a professor (Peterson) support them, then it can't be so bat shit crazy, you know the personified ""argument from authority"" and like a ""counterweight"" for all the ""leftist"" stuff that comes out of academia. ""Neutrality"" rather than facts. Which arguably makes him probably way **more** dangerous than the other two.

And it's most of the time really nothing more than this authority based on his professorship, because the topics that Peterson is most prominent for and most vocal about, have little to nothing at all to do with his field of research and he's mostly talking out of his ass, at many times even lacking amateur levels of knowledge about those topics let alone speaking as a scientific researcher in those fields.

Just take the topic that brought him into the broader public consciousness, which was not his academic research but his opposition to this Canadian anti-discrimination bill. Seriously he vigorously and personally (making it about himself) pushed back against the extension of civil rights to a broader group of people, with basically fearmongering and straw man arguments. He even made it into the Wikipedia article of that Bill because it had to be set straight that what he was preemptively and energetically fighting against isn't even in that law (according to the legal department of his university as well as 2 other universities).

No wonder the alt-right loves him, he spreads their talking points, or something eerily similar, as gospel. And he even manages to have a legit reputation and isn't some crackpot lunatic like those professional commentators or talk-radio people. And he reaches audiences that would reject those people. However if you compare that:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LquIQisaZFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LquIQisaZFU)

Spoilers it's him on ""Prager (not-a-university) University"" ranting about the progressive post-modern nihilists undermining western civilization with their push for diversity and against corruption and oppression.

Again displaying a profound lack of knowledge what ""post-modern"" or ""nihilism"" actually mean not to mention the straw manning and fearmongering.

I mean you could argue whether Peterson is a ""fascist"" or just ""does fascism"", by accident.  Whether he's just an old man ranting out of his ass and who has a fairly thin skin and takes most criticism personally and thus defends even indefensible stuff to defend himself or makes it a ""free speech"" issue when he gets offended by a lack of enthusiastic support. Where his defense of ""free speech"" is somewhat akin to citing the ""free market"" if one of his friends gets busted for selling heroin stretched with toxins (metaphor). You can give him some credit for disavowing the alt-right and neo-nazis (though if you think about it, that's a really low bar to clear and even Nazis do that to avoid a harmful labels).

But at some point it doesn't even matter, because at some point the ""reputable academic"" would have to do some soul searching and ask himself thoroughly why he resonates so well with far-right extremists and incels or why people ask him to talk about the Jewish question so frequently, I mean how absurd to ask him that if he's just talking about a shadow conspiracy of liberal progressivism and post-modern neo-marxists that seek to undermine and destroy the very identity of western civilization. How could people for and against him could ever see that as an endorsement of far right ideologies /s. And you can argue that this script and editing might be more akin to the views of Dennis Prager than Jordan Peterson, but that again doesn't matter if he voluntarily lends his credence to him (and not just once).

Not to mention that by now he pretty much is no longer a professor but a political commentator. His research proposals were rejected and his funding apparently comes from a fundraiser from a far-right media outlet:

So no he actually is pretty deep into that rabbit hole whether he rejects the labels or sees himself as something different is by now almost irrelevant. Also as time progresses it seems like that's also not a one off and even before becoming famous he kinda went for talking profoundly sounding non-sense for example his ""maps of meaning"" got the review:

&gt;is not a book to be abstracted and summarized. Rather, it should be read  at leisure (although it is anything but light reading) and employed as a  stimulus and reference to expand one’s own maps of meaning.

or by himself:

&gt;According to Peterson, until 2018 there had been lack of serious  critique, and he did not ""think people had any idea what to make of the  book.""

Before people got more interested in his work and came up with reviews like:

&gt;In 2018, professor of philosophy [Paul Thagard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thagard) wrote a highly critical review about the book for [*Psychology Today*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_Today), describing it as murky and arguing that it is ""defective as a work of anthropology, psychology, philosophy, and politics.""[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps_of_Meaning#cite_note-19) [Nathan J. Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_J._Robinson), in [*Current Affairs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Affairs_(magazine)) article, described it as ""an elaborate, unprovable, unfalsifiable, unintelligible theory.""

So no Peterson is not that reputable professor and he very much belongs into that group of people and that regularly joins this group by stuff like appearing on their mutual platform Prager (not-a-university) University or stuff like that. The link between them is actually there and not made up. But as said, at some point it doesn't even matter if he's a real or just a useful idiot.

Edit: Also that ""unfalsifiable"" claim, might make it sound more credible to a layperson as ""it couldn't be proven wrong so it must be right, ... right?"", however to anybody in science that's a death sentence. Because EVERY scientific theory **MUST** be falsifiable. That is basically a core part of the scientific method. Because science isn't ""the truth""(tm) it's the quest for finding explanations that are ""less "" more predictive than the previous one. If you have a theory that explains both it's thesis and it's antithesis, it's **NOT** a good theory it, it's rather worthless as you can't really apply it to anything if you don't understand how it works or if it doesn't work consistently."	47	['be seen', 'be set', 'offended by a lack of enthusiastic support', 'gets busted', 'were rejected', 'is sometimes cast', 'has been described', 'was fired', 'be abstracted', 'should be read', 'be proven']	11	11	0.23404255319148937	1	['offended by a lack of enthusiastic support']	1	1	0.02127659574468085	1	['be seen', 'be set', 'gets busted', 'were rejected', 'is sometimes cast', 'has been described', 'was fired', 'be abstracted', 'should be read', 'be proven']	10	10	0.2127659574468085	1	35555983210	3	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jsj80j/_/gc1448a/	1196783443	35554290404.0	2020-11-12 07:42:17	693099219670.0	ImaginaryInsect1275	1	False	1172	7	True	True	41.4

One go-to source is WHO, who recently released a smoking report where vaporisers are called ENDS:

https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/326043/9789241516204-eng.pdf

A summary of the chapter on ENDS reads:

&gt;What are the consequences of taking up ENDS use at a younger age? Recent surveys in the United States of America (USA) and some European countries have shown marked increases in ENDS use amongst youth. Between 2011 and 2018 in the USA, youth e-cigarette use rates have risen from 1.5% to a staggering 20.8%. Young people who use ENDS are exposed to nicotine, which can have long-term effects on the developing brain and there is a risk of nicotine addiction, given that tobacco product use is primarily established in adolescence. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence in some settings that never-smoker minors who use ENDS at least double their chance of starting to smoke cigarettes later in life.

&gt;What is the harm of ENDS relative to conventional cigarettes?
ENDS’ aerosols are likely to be less toxic than cigarettes but there is insufficient evidence to quantify the precise level of risk associated with them. Also, many factors will impact on the relative risk associated with their use. For example, the amount of nicotine and other toxicants in the heated liquid.

&gt;What are the health effects associated with ENDS?
ENDS pose risks to users and non-users. There is insufficient evidence
to quantify this risk and the long-term effects of exposure to ENDS’ toxic emissions are unknown. In addition to risks associated with emissions of ENDS there are also risks of physical injury brought about by fires or explosions related to ENDS devices.

&gt;Do ENDS help smokers quit tobacco?
As discussed in the background chapter on “O” – Offer help to quit, the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of ENDS as a smoking cessation aid is still being debated. To date, in part due to the diversity of ENDS products and the low certainty surrounding many studies, the potential for ENDS to play a role as a population-level tobacco cessation intervention is unclear.

Under the headline “ENDS are not harmless and must be regulated” we can read “Although the specific level of risk associated with ENDS has not yet been conclusively estimated, ENDS are undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation.”"	14	['are called', 'are exposed', 'is primarily established', 'being debated', 'must be regulated', 'been conclusively estimated']	6	4	0.2857142857142857	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are called', 'are exposed', 'is primarily established', 'being debated', 'must be regulated', 'been conclusively estimated']	6	4	0.2857142857142857	1	32598648866	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/czz8ac/_/ez4e6g2/	786024372	32598471549.0	2019-09-05 09:10:43	309046141921.0	BioMed-R	1	False	385	4	False	True	51.99

Still, if there are good people in USA military, that are in bad situation due to no fault of their own but their superiors and circumstances they cant control. 
Can we assume that there are also good people in a lot of those ""terrorist"" organizations that joined them to defend THEIR country, due to no other organization that is doing it and are  in bad situation due to no fault of their own but their superiors and circumstancess they cant control ? 
They invidualy arent the ones doing the bombings and killing civilians. Maybe there is other branch doing that. Maybe due to media blackouts, lack of education, economy, internet, etc, he doesnt even know that those things happen. 
But if we cant fault good individual usa soldier that personaly didnt do anything for atrocities that the USA army comited and commits like killing civilians, for example. 
Can we do the same for its counterpart. 
Id imagine they didnt recruit them with stories of murdering innocents in Belgium, same way Joe wasnt recruited because they told him he would drop bomb on some innocent muslim civilians. 

I just see that the end results are the same. Lots of murdered civilians, innocents, who had nothing whatsoever to do with any of it on both sides. MORE of those murdered on the middle eastern side, but those somehow get forgotten or not counted by media, due to fact that ""regular"" army commited them, even though innocent mothers cry at the end just the same. 
And if we relativize it in that way, USA citizen Joe is currently in Baghdad, holding rifle, enforcing order, while i dont see Iraqi citizen Ekrem doing the same in Washington. 

So yeah, when i think about it, i dont know if youre even the OP, but .. il go with, you either support the troops, or war. Cant support both.  
Idk, im frustrated, all i see are causes and consequences, and each one just brings more of them in effect. Belgium bombings = more good soldiers in middle east to defend from those bombings, more soldiers in middle east = more civilians geting kiled = more ""terrorists"" joining to defend their middle east, some of them get indocrinated to fulles and commit atrocities on civilians id assume because superiors told him that its the only way it can hurt ""the enemy"" who is destroying his country = more.. 

Id assume someone is massively influencing and profiting in this ongoing status quo, and public is buying it. 
Any end in that circle ? Dont see. And would definitely like for someone to CMV in that regard. 


Edit : Also, must admit that you changed my mind a little in this regard. I can see why good people would join the troops for all the right reasons, even though hes aware of everything that is done in USA name. 
Also see why someone would join the middle eastern terror group for all right reasons, with same knowledge.

3876	"I agree that if someone really wants a better camera or 5G, it makes sense for them to buy a new phone. (I think that's too obious for a delta, if you don't mind.)

For example there is a rumour that Apple and Android create software updates that make older phones perform worse artificially. I recently bought a new phone, just because the system files grew so big that my internal memory didn't suffice anymore. Just for the same software that was already on it when I bought it, but with less bugs? Also, phone designers made the conscious decision that I can't upgrade my internal memory.

Another reason many people buy new phones is because the battery isn't replacable.

Would it be a bad business decision for a company to create phones with replacable batteries – assuming people would be paying more for them in the knowledge they would have to buy a complete phone less frequently? So maybe they would sell two phones and four batteries instead of four phones with included batteries for a price that is something between the two. If they want to earn more money with the same amount of customers, they could try to make the product *better* – i.e. fulfill the needs of the customer.

The assumption that people are irrational is probably true, but someone who looks for a phone with replacable batteries doesn't harm the economy either, or do they?"	11	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	[]	0	0	0.0	0	38667346260	1	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/rxdkk4/_/hrhjfbo/	1688647252	38667222516.0	2022-01-06 11:13:27	55771550.0	JohannesWurst	1	False	240	0	False	True	68.3

I'm going to try and address your other topics. Libertarians often don't like the idea of government being so involved with education because it impedes on the educator's creativity and impedes on people choosing their form of education.

3880	"Look, I'm not trying to get you to actually think Bolton is a patriot. I am trying to take a neutral stance on this to show that the word patriot by itself is a meaningless term. Remember, the definition you gave me of a *patriot* was:

&gt; a person who loves, supports, and defends his or her country and its interests with devotion.

By that definition than you, Bolton, and the two terrorists from your examples are patriots. This is why I hate words like *patriot.* Since your intentions to help and improve the nation are the same, you are both patriots, the stark difference is how you believe patriotism should be expressed. You have a much more positive and mindful view where upholding integrity and core values is *patriotic.* To Bolton, being patriotic is doing anything that will further the interests of the US state, be it destabilizing Iran, trodding on long-standing allies, etc. the point is that he is working towards a goal he believes is to the benefit of the nation. The two terrorists you mentioned believe the same thing. I am not saying that they are in the right and that we should accept all forms of patriotism. But the nuance I am getting at is defining these situations as good or bad forms of patriotism rather than deciding if they are being patriots or not. You can, but it would be a distinction made from your own personal definition of patriotism.

For the record, I do not consider Bolton a patriot either, but I do want to make sure you understand that there is more than way patriotism can, and needs to be, expressed. Bolton and the other two are extremist examples that should not be allowed to continue, but there is a time and place for less moral actions to be taken in the name of serving the nation. I am not condoning most of the covert and backhanded actions the US has done over the years, but it would be naive to say that anyone not acting honorably is not acting in the best interests of the nation. It simply just isn't the way the world works right now. In an ideal world, it would and we would all work together, but it just isn't the case right now. So, to me, I believe some neorealists and less moral views on patriotism are also acceptable and the people who operate under those viewpoints can be patriots as well.

3885	"It sounds like your attitude towards the fatigue about the issue has been directed at ""not wanting to hear about it anymore"" rather than ""equalize marriage"". Your friend is right in saying you can't do both. ""I don't want to hear about it anymore because the issue should be settled"" doesn't really help or support the cause, I'm sure you see that, and why your friend called it indifference.  
Advocacy is something we really have to be clear about. Look at the Occupy movement and how easy it was for detractors to claim there was no coherent message.  
  
As far as you having the choice to be homosexual, saying you aren't willing because you'd always choose heterosexual doesn't seem as much of a moral failing like homophobia as it is you just being indifferent towards the point of the thought experiment. You are supposed to be able to *identify* with the cause you support and the people involved, and a thought experiment is you chance to figure out how much you identify with a different way of life.  
I think the clearest example for this would be if you give merits for homosexual and heterosexual life (they're largely the same) as though you don't see one as monumentally better than the other, and also to clarify that it isn't that you're unwilling to look at like from that perspective (especially when it comes to the absurdity of how long this has gone on without equalizing marriage, and how clarity is the best response).  
  
Perspective is tricky but if you do seem complicit by indifference or appear to *implicitly value* one perspective over another, it's easy to get taken for a homophobe if you aren't clear about how you're involved and why.  
Just to add something else to this situation, you need to know there are a lot of homophobes who will in a friendly way discuss gay marriage and then after a few minutes if asked how they see it from their point of view will say ""I like the dynamic of heterosexual life and I would never choose differently"" so you're using the rhetoric of actual homophobes here and that can be confusing to your friends.

3889	"I am thinking about a more primitive example then money. Money is just to represent units of utility.

Let's take a simple primitive tribe. 

Let's say you are Ogg, member of the Wookah tribe. You hunt with the tribe and kill mammoth. You and tribe brings mammoth meat back to village and store it in food tent. You can take only your share of meat ot take more then necessary. If you take more, it's less meat for another member and they may starve but you are full. Eventually, tribe members die off but not you. Problem is now there is less hunters. Not enough to hunt mammoth. Eventually tribe dies.

Now imagine that Ogg, like the rest of the tribe, believes that if he steals meat, the great ghost tiger will eat him in his sleep. There is no ghost tiger. But Ogg is scared nonetheless. Ogg is tempted to steal more meat. But ogg is scared of ghost tiger so Ogg doesn't steal meat. Everyone has food, tribe prospers, while alternate-Oggs tribe dies out.

This is one of the advantage of religion.

The other side of the coin is that Shaman Torg says ghost tiger wants tribe to give all the meat to Torg. And that's bad.

My argument isn't that religion can't be used for bad. We all agree on that. But it has it's uses.

I'm not that familiar with the vaccine debate, but I always elect vaccination for myself, fwiw. It obviously depends a lot on the points in question about vaccines. Do they have *x* level of effectiveness *y* often? Science has answers. Is it moral to force someone to get vaccinated? There are pretty robust arguments for this, but they aren't positive, they're normative.

It doesn't seem like you *strictly* have to deny science to be anti-vaccine (again, depends on *where* one is pro- or anti-vaccine). You could just have different values. Are we going to scientifically invalidate those values? Would that be science?

Relating this to the debate at hand, while the science clearly conveys info about the effectiveness (for certain purposes) of nuclear power, and (less clearly) its broad effects on different societies, science does not convey moral oughtness.

Good. We seem to have arrived at Ethical Transhumanism, which is a much friendlier context than eugenics and teaching children to suppress their needs.  We also seem to be avoiding saying anything simplistic or absolute like 'cure', because autistic kids (including me, and the moderators of those subreddits) tend to take such things literally. Now that you have been educated about the context, you can avoid saying things you don't mean. 

It took us a long time to arrive in this context. This thread is many posts deep. I've exercised considerable patience in drawing you here. Subreddit moderators cannot afford the social energy that this requires - even NT mods must budget each interaction.

We gotta deal. The only productive way that I've found to handle this kind of thing is to spend time ~~lurking~~ learning about a community.  

To address your actual post: I'm a huge fan of psychedelic self-transformation. It's been a huge healing tool in my life. But yeah, as you say, it is very much a grown-up tool. I don't really like the neurological explanations of how psychedelics(or autism) work; I've heard a variety of them, and while they all kinda make sense, none of those theories really have any predictive power. All I have is my personal experience, which has shown that it's a very useful tool, (esp. for cptsd) if used appropriately, and very scary otherwise.

I'm really excited to see what the future brings as far as neural interfaces. I think it's something even more potential for wonder and horror than psychedelics, even if it's only used for extremities.

3899	"No, this isn't exactly what I'm saying, so I'll clarify a bit more.

&gt; For police to act better and smarter they need more resources not less resources for mental health screenings, conflict deescalation training, non-lethal equipment purchases, smarter employee hiring process...etc. 

The idea is not to have smarter police, but to replace the police. A lot of police work could be handled *without* the police.

When I mention broad patterns of policing, I am referring policies such as stop and frisk where an abundance of officers are sent into specific neighborhoods to crack down on social problems. This has not been shown to directly reduce crime, but it a broad strategy of policing that creates large disparities. Police don't need to be doing this expensive and inefficient work.

There is also an increased presence of police officers in schools who respond to situations that could be handled by school staff. Instead, this creates a situation where the criminal justice system gets involved with criminalizing student behavior unnecessarily. Again, police don't need to be doing this work.

So it's not about police handling their duties more intelligently, it's about the transference of duties away from the police. This means increased funding to homeless services agencies, domestic violence agencies, mental health services, or agencies that assist food-insecure families.

Police departments such as NYPD often add a large number of new police officers each year. And PDs also spend their own money on certain types of surveillance technology such as facial recognition tech. The funding doesn't actually go to the type of training you're discussing. This type of funding should be eliminated 

Defunding wouldn't fully eliminate a PD's budget, so it doesn't inherently impede departments from making the investments you've described. Many of the things you've described are not large investments, and they also don't need to be provided by police departments. For example, a mental health agency could receive funding to screen police officers. Deescalation training could be provided by agencies that respond to domestic violence situations, etc., There is no reason that type of funding has to go to the police department.

And, most importantly, these things will be less necessary if the police have less work to do. This type of training will not be as necessary to provide to police officers alone. The training could be provided to different groups.

&gt; However, your solution is simply to get these resources from the police which seems like a bad idea

The solution is to eliminate police involvement with certain types of work, which reduces the scope of police work. The reduced scope means a smaller operating budget.  Police would have less of a central role in public safety.

Police departments are revenue-producing agencies, and so they have a lot of sway in budget negotiations. They have the ability to impact the town purse. All institutions are interested in their own growth and survival, so police departments and other revenue-producing government bodies have a natural tendency toward unnecessary expansion. There is a lot of fat that can be cut as a result of the fact that they have more negotiating power than other agencies.

&gt;  city pensions, public housing, government building contracts, welfare payments

You think cutting funding to necessary sources of housing and financial support will help these issues? Public housing in NYC already needs billions in repairs, which have been caused because historically the program has always received less than it's needed operating budget from the federal government. The buildings are in disrepair due to a lack of investment. 

How would eliminating funding to a source of housing that people need actually help reduce crime? If anything, we need to invest in programs that can assist people with financial training, paths to home-ownership, etc., In NYC, the public housing authority already does a ton of this type of work.  You may not like public housing, but defunding it will not reduce crime. This would just allow the homes of probably 600,000 people to fall into further disrepair.  The displacement caused by the demolition of public housing in Chicago did not reduce crime or result in beneficial outcomes for former residents."	34	"['could be handled', 'are sent', 'been shown', 'could be handled', 'should be eliminated', 'be provided', 'could be provided', 'could be provided', 'can be cut', 'have been caused', ""'s needed""]"	11	10	0.29411764705882354	1	['could be handled by', 'be provided by', 'could be provided by']	3	3	0.08823529411764706	1	"['could be handled', 'are sent', 'been shown', 'should be eliminated', 'could be provided', 'can be cut', 'have been caused', ""'s needed""]"	8	7	0.20588235294117646	1	35147675844	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ismq0l/_/g5a0o90/	1136480565	35147192777.0	2020-09-14 17:11:24		[deleted]	1	False	692	3	False	True	53.51

Where are you getting this definition from?

&gt;But I live down here in the real world

The fact that you voted for self-proclaimed socialists who enacted Social Democratic procedures does not mean socialism = social democracy and I don't see what your logic to the contrary is. Socialism is worker control of the economy, it's pretty clear. As a member of America's most popular socialist organization I can tell you most of our members know what the difference is.

&gt;That’s social democracy. And yes, mine includes socialists. It does not include communists (I mean, they exist but are a rather marginal phenomenon), because communism as it has historically been implemented refuses to cede power to dissident voices. In fact, it persecutes them.

As I mentioned, there are plenty of communist parties that are basically just as ""social democratic"" as the socialist parties you're talking about, so again, this separation makes absolutely no sense.

&gt;You may say I’m ‘theoretically wrong’, because true socialists (and communists, who in your theoretical understanding of the world are one and the same) by definition cannot function in a parliamentary democracy. In practice, reality would beg to differ.

No I'm saying you're ""actually wrong"" because the definitions you're using are incorrect. You're saying socialists act as social democrats in practice. I'm saying communists do this too, so there's no distinction there. Furthermore, the actual definitions of both words are the same. You're using this definition of ""communism = tyranny"" that doesn't actually connect to anything. Communism and socialism come from the same place.

It's not necessarily that anyone is morally bankrupt. It's that we don't have anything that binds us together as Americans anymore. It only makes sense for a country to exist when members of that country have something that unites them and separates them from the rest of the world - traditionally that's been things like ethnicity or religion, while in the US it's historically been more of a shared philosophy on things like freedom and capitalism.

We have precious little that unites us as Americans anymore.

Even on a simpler level, most children will have a high-end games console. If one does not because their parents cannot afford it, are they being denied a normal life? 

&gt; You try to pin this down on individual people, but I'm talking about this as an systemic issue. Obviously people can be part of the system, but they're not the same.

So you're saying they're not being denied by any actual person, people, or even organisation. They're being denied by the intangible concept of ""the society"", so how do we change this? If no person, people, or organisation is responsible for this, how can anybody ever change this?

The truth is that people as whole, or at least the government, are responsible for ""the society"".

&gt; The issue that prevents them from gaining those thinghs is that you need money to gain goods, and the way this money is gained heavily favors those that already are wealthy, which makes it very difficult for poor people to gain money.

That's not true at all. Its true when we discuss the ultra-wealthy, as in someone born in poverty has virtually zero chance of becoming a millionaire. But how do you reason that they cannot get an entry-level job that pays minimum wage? How is it very difficult for a poor person to do this?

&gt; I'm not saying that society is ""obligated"" to give them those things like it's some divine commandent. It's just a nice thing to help people in this situation when you can do at little cost to yourself.

I actually agree with you here. Society isn't obligated to provide for someone who cannot (or will not) provide for themselves. So on that basis, how is society denying them anything?

If we agree that the individual is responsible for obtaining the means to access something, and the onus is on them alone to do so, how is society not giving them it the same as denying them it?

This is where your point really falls apart IMO.

You're saying that it's on me to provide for myself, but if society *doesn't* provide for me, it is denying me. Those two things simply can't both be true.

Either society is obligated, and failing that obligation is akin to denial, or the individual is obligated and their failure cannot be akin to denial."	26	"['being denied', 'being denied', 'being denied', ""'re being denied"", 'is gained', ""isn't obligated"", 'is obligated', 'is obligated']"	8	7	0.2692307692307692	1	"['being denied by', ""'re being denied by""]"	2	2	0.07692307692307693	1	"['being denied', 'being denied', 'is gained', ""isn't obligated"", 'is obligated', 'is obligated']"	6	5	0.19230769230769232	1	36875065831	7	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/nafr8g/_/gxugmw7/	1408253344	36875017747.0	2021-05-12 09:32:03	702694347711.0	Slothjitzu	1	False	455	4	False	True	71.85

We can tell this by looking at the laws anti-abortion politicians have passed since _Roe v. Wade_ as well as laws making abortion illegal prior to that decision. With few exceptions, these laws do not attempt to make abortion murder nor do they treat abortion like murder. Instead, they use State power to do things like restricting the timing of an abortion, imposing waiting periods before abortions can be procured, and limiting the facilities in which an abortion can be performed. That is, the actual laws pro-life people try to pass to oppose abortion do not at all suggest a correspondence between abortion and murder.

The mistake you are making is confusing a political slogan (""abortion is murder"") with an actual argument made in earnest (this is not to say that there aren't crazy or ill-informed people who _do_ make this argument, but rather that it isn't representative of mainstream pro-life legal scholarship).

Your third party vote affects which candidates will decide that a run is viable and what policy choices they should choose. You have the freedom to vote for whichever candidate you choose, you have the freedom to express your preferences to current and future candidates, and you even have the freedom to run for office if you so desire.

3924	"&gt; I don’t think that needs to be determined, all that’s important is that you acknowledge that your failure to act or respond to a cause allowed for the effect to take place.

It's important, because you should compare how the thing you say is going to be perceived, both by the victim and the general public. 

A person who was recently raped is going to take the statements ""It's your fault"" and ""It's 0.005% your fault"" very differently. As I said, the first implies a huge share of blame, mainly because we expect the things people say aloud to be important -- not miniscule -- observations. Like you if I said ""You have some dirt on your clothes"" you would ask ""Where?"" and try to brush it off. If my response was ""It's in tiny invisible particles, I just feel the need to point out it's technically there"" you would probably roll your eyes at me and feel like I'm being pedantic. Because it is pedantic.

So if you say to someone ""It's your fault you were raped"" they are going to assume that the amount of fault is large enough to merit that remark. That it's perhaps large enough that people should perceive the rape different than if it were not the victim's fault. And if it turns out that what you mean by that is that there is *technically* a miniscule amount of fault of the part of the victim, people are going to be frustrated that you said something inflammatory over such a tiny amount of ""fault""

3928	"&gt;it doesn't really matter whether Hepburn or Nihon/Kunrei is used.

Can't speak for you of course since you're dutch, but for me as an English person, Hepburn is a very close match to the sounds I'm hearing, while most of the differences present in Kunrei are nonsensical. You can tell me that ""syozi"" is right all you want, but that ain't what I'm hearing, and if you asked me to write down what I was hearing, I'd write shoji. Kunrei straight up doesn't make sense to my English brain. 

Hepburn allows fu to be written as both fu and hu, which is what fu *is*. The Japanese f/h sound is another of the r/l cases where the sound lies pretty much on the boundary between h and f for an English brain, which means that slight variations in how it's pronounced can make it sound like a solid f or a solid h, same as r and l. For the record, that linked clip I hear hu, but I also hear distinct undertones of an f in there which is actually pretty unusual. This one must be lying right on the boundary, or maybe wobbling across it. If that guy said it slightly differently, it'd be a fu. 

Of course you are right that Japanese has been shifting over time, however, Hepburn has been too. The 'dictionary' form of it may not have caught up yet, but the people who are using Hepburn practically are using it differently.

As a result, the penalty of excluding smokers is too great and in turn no venue is interested in voluntarily banning smoking.  
Businesses will only voluntarily ban smoking if there is a clear financial incentive.

Your IQ generally remains static through life, absent illness, injury, or the like, so they're not just a snapshot.

>\-IQ tests measure ""fluid intelligence."" As I understand it, fluid intelligence was discovered when a Dean and a researcher noticed that students who performed well on some subject tests also performed well on other unrelated subject tests. There were other explanations, but the conclusion they landed on was that this correlation was due to fluid intelligence. This seems like an untested hypothesis

There is absolutely endless science around IQ testing. The tests alone are decades and decades of science.

>IQ tests can be impacted by the same environmental factors as every other test, so a low score can be due to any of those factors.

I don't know what you mean to say here. Yes, if you're taking the test under certain conditions it can affect it. That has nothing to do with anything.

That's noted in the scoring and can invalidate the test all together.

>\-It is possible to improve at every sort of puzzle found on an IQ test.

Well sort of but... yeah? Practice effect is also noted and a cause for invalidation.

>\-Basic test taking skills can help people perform better on IQ tests. For example, skipping a problem if it is too challenging, considering all elements of the problem, breaking the problem down into smaller parts, and even looking for answers with a lot in common as, on harder questions, it's likely to be one of the very similar ones.

I don't understand what any of this means -- first, skipping a problem does not help you do better.

If teenage boys don't have the ability to see any teenage girls as nonsexual and as platonic friends, then we've failed them as a culture and THAT'S what we need to intervene in.

&gt; Thats kind of misleading though isnt it? The quality and terms of a relationship with a sexual and romantic partner is vastly different in quality and tone to a platonic one, if it werent we wouldnt need to even make the distinction.

3950	Well put, that sums up a lot of my feelings on the issue. I honestly don’t have a ton of close friends because I tend to isolate for long periods of time when my anxiety gets bad, but I do have a few core friends who I’ve known for years, some of whom are POC. In high school I had a lot of desi (Indian &amp; Pakistani) friends, but since I’ve gonna off to college, my school is about 60% white, and the queer spaces and even the urban studies/activist spaces where I feel most comfortable don’t have a lot of POC. This has led to most of my interactions about controversial issues regarding race being with people online. I say “interactions” but I barely ever respond to stuff except when I agree with a POC, if I don’t I almost always just keep scrolling, or if it is something I find really cruel or misogynistic (or otherwise bigoted), I’ll stop following the person. Honestly it sucks because I loved being sort of immersed in the Asian American (and I mean East Asian, middle eastern, south Asian, and Pacific Islander) community growing up because of where I live, and I learned so much just from being around a lot of different people with unique perspectives within their individual community.

**1. SIZE OF THE GALAXY**     
       
This is not to be taken lightly or overlooked. The galaxy is absolutely enormous. I cannot stress that enough. Our galaxy is a [barred-spiral galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy), and looks something like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=barred+spiral&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vsQUsuSKor72QW0q4GwCg&amp;ved=0CDUQsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955). So how big is that? Well...     
      
1. In terms of distances, the Milky Way is 1,000 light years ""thick"", and has a diameter of 100,000 - 120,000 light years. (As per [NASA](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980317b.html)) So let's imagine the Milky Way as a massive cylinder in space, what is its volume? Well, volume of a cylinder = radius^2 * height * pi. That gives us approximately 10 TRILLION cubic light-years. That's a whole lot of space, and that's not including the massive amounts of [dark matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) in the Milky Way or the massive [Halo of stars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#Halo) that surrounds the Milky Way.    
2. So that is a hell of a lot of light-years, but what, exactly, is a light-year? In case you don't know what a light year is, it is the distance that light travels in 1 full year, which is about 5.8 trillion miles (or, 5,800,000,000,000 miles). The nearest star is 4.3 light years away, meaning it is about (4.3) x (5.8 trillion miles) away. [NASA explains it quite well.](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980211a.html)   
3. So, again, let's go back to our imaginary cylinder that is the Milky Way galaxy. That sucker is 10 trillion cubic light years of volume. And a light year is 5.8 trillion miles. Therefore, every cubic light year is 2.03 x 10^38 cubic miles. This means that the volume of the galaxy is 2.03 x 10^51 cubic miles, which looks like 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 mi^3. That is the volume of the cylinder that is our galaxy. (thanks to /u/jackfg, /u/stjuuv, /u/hazie, /u/Wianie, and everyone else who pointed out my earlier erroneous calculation!) 
    
**TRAVEL**    
Okay, you admit, the Milky Way galaxy is unfathomably huge. And, to top it off, it's only one of [hundreds of billions of galaxies](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/021127a.html). BUT, as you correctly would point out, most of the ""volume"" we calculated previously is empty space, so you don't really need to search empty space for other lifeforms, you just need to look at stars and planets. Great point, but it gets you nowhere. Why? Well...
    
1. Even thought we've cut down our search to just the stars, we still have the astronomical problem of actually getting to them. Traveling from the Earth to the Moon takes about 1.2 seconds for light. You can see it in a neat little .gif right [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Speed_of_light_from_Earth_to_Moon.gif). So how long did it take our astronauts in a rocket-fueled spaceship? It took the Apollo missions about 3 days and 4 hours to get there. So a trip that takes light about 1.2 seconds would take a rocket-propelled ship about 3.16 days, give or take. It takes light 8 minutes to get to the Sun. It takes light 4.3 years to get to the nearest star. Now just stop and imagine how long that trip to the nearest star would take going at the speed it took us to get to the Moon. A dozen generations of human beings would live and die in that amount of time. The greatest technology we have and all of Earth's resources could not get these hypothetical astronauts even out of our Solar System. (And in doing so, the radiation would fry them like bacon, micro-meteorites would turn them to swiss-cheese, and so on).    
2. So, our hypothetical aliens are not traveling on rockets. They simply can't be. The distances are enormous, the dangers unfathomable, and they don't have infinite time to be getting this mission done. Remember when I said that galaxy is 100,000+ light years across? Imagine traveling that in something that takes generations to go 4.3 light years. There quite literally has not been enough time since the Big Bang for such a flight to be completed. So, clearly, anything making these journeys would need a method of travel that simply doesn't exist. We can posit anything from [solar sails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail) that accelerate a craft up to 99% the speed of light, or anything else that allows travelers to accelerate up to relativistic speeds in between star systems. The problem, however, is that acceleration/deceleration (as well as travel between these stars, maneuvering while in flight, and so forth) still takes years and years and years and years. And that's not including actually *searching* these star systems for any kind of life once you get there. You see, once you decelerate this craft within a star system, you still have to mosey your ass up to every single planet and poke around for life. You might think you could just look at each one, but it's not even possible for a telescope to be built that can see a house on Earth from the Moon, so good luck finding life when you're on the other side of the solar system (and that's if the planet's even in view when your spaceship arrives). And how, exactly, are you going to poke around from planet to planet? What will you do to replenish the ship's resources? You certainly aren't going to be carrying water and food to last until the end of time, and without the infinite energy of the Sun beating over your head, you're going to have a tough time replenishing and storing energy to be doing this mission even after you get as far as Saturn, [where the Sun becomes significantly smaller in the ""sky""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_skies). So the logistics of getting from one star to the other are huge, unmanageable, a complete mess for propulsion systems of any kind. Everything Earth has could be pored into the mission and we wouldn't get out of the [Oort Cloud.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud) And even if we did, then what? Cross your fingers and hope you can replenish supplies in the *nearest* star? How are you going to keep going after that? How suicidal is this mission? And that's *just* to the nearest star. What happens if the ship needs repairs? How many of these missions can you send out? If you only send out one, you're looking at taking eons just to search 1% of our galaxy, but the resources to send out a fleet of these ships doesn't exist. And how will you even know they succeeded? Any communication they send back will take half a decade to get here because those transmissions move at light speed, and that's *IF* they manage to point their transmitter in the right direction so that we can even *hear* them. It would take us decades to even realize we'd need to send a second ship if the first one failed.    
3. Now remember how I said that the volume of the Milky Way wasn't relevant since you're *just* looking for stars and planets, not combing all of empty space? That wasn't 100% accurate, because now you're starting to realize that you actually have to *traverse* all of that empty space. To get from star to star requires crossing those unparalleled voids. That whatever-the-fucking-however-huge quadra-trillio-billions of miles is suddenly looking a bit more massive again. And keep in mind, all of these deadly, insurmountable problems I've laid bare are just getting to the *nearest star* from Earth. And there are a *lot* of stars in the Milky Way, as we will shortly see.

Warren Buffett (if we assume investing in Berkshire Hathaway as a proxy for investing w/ WB): Annualized return of 20.8% over 50 years

Stanley Druckenmiller returned \~30% during 30 years with Dusquesne Capital 

And there're tons more that have outperformed the markets over time. Same for not only public equities (but also in VC and PE indexes - tons of managers that have outperformed post-fees).

3965	"Well let me try to change it a bit. I agree with you that the winner takes all systems within each state is bad but that is not a property of the Electoral College (EC).

Each state itself decides how they divide their EC representatives (in fact in the past in some states people didn't even get to vote but instead the state government itself voted). Some states do decide to divide theirs up proportional to the vote (so in a state with 5 EC votes and if 20% votes dem and 80% vote rep then dem will get 1 point and rep 4).

Assuming that each state changes their own law to make their EC points be divided proportionally to the vote within their state I would say the EC actually is a pretty good idea. This would effectively result in the fact that a vote in a low population state would count more than one in a high population state.

First of all the common argument is that this prevents politicians from only campaigning in big states and thus makes sure the (often) rural minority doesn't get ignored. I think this is important to prevent the [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).

And next is an often forgotten reason. The US actually is a bunch of states mashed together. Without this measure to prevent the tyranny of the majority smaller states would have never joined. Just look at the EU (which hopefully is a predecessor for an EU federation) for example. Do you think all those (relatively) small countries like Slovenia, Bulgari, Portugal, etc would have joined if the political system was completely proportional to population?"	13	['be divided', 'get ignored']	2	2	0.15384615384615385	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['be divided', 'get ignored']	2	2	0.15384615384615385	1	36758884919	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mywfxa/_/gvxah4n/	1388876446		2021-04-26 09:56:06	24346059.0	Highlow9	54	False	276	0	True	True	58.42

3969	"&gt;Your argument is inherently opposed to your utilitarian view point. Utilitarianism demands the ethical choice to be that which produces the greatest amount of good the greatest number of people. You argue that legally allowing abortion kills the child but is utilitarian because it avoids the death of both the child and mother in a “back alley” abortion. The issue with that logic is not taking into account the numbers to go along with your argument. Between 2017 and 2018 planned parenthood preformed 345,672 abortions. In the event of abortion becoming illegal the number of abortions would obviously drop as with all things that were once legal then made illegal. This would mean that outlawing abortion would be a utilitarian action in terms of producing the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people.

There's no proof outlawing abortion actually makes it happen less frequently...

No, I'm saying they'll try to reorganize themselves to pay out interest to their shareholders.  This happens a lot with leveraged buyouts, where the firm that's bought out takes a large loan from the firm doing the buyout, and a lot of the profit to the buying out firm comes from interest on that loan.

This is only one example.  As I said before, tax lawyers who are smarter than you will aggressively fight to find loopholes.  Your proposal will cause an enormous amount of economic waste by people trying to avoid this tax.

It will also cause an enormous amount of straight-up tax fraud.  At 95%, the incentives to engage in outright tax fraud are enormous.  And given the insane complexity of this scheme, which comes on top of the already insane complexity of the corporate tax code, opportunities for fraud will be thick on the ground.

&gt;Well, firms would still have an incentive to innovate because of the 5% that they retain. Any other options must be worse by definition of economic profit. Plus, once the market catches up to the firm's growth, the firm can take a larger share of the pie.

5% is not a meaningful incentive.  The behavioral response to a 95% tax is nearly the same as the behavioral response to a 100% tax; you stop doing whatever is taxed that heavily.

&gt;Well, I'm still not convinced that the tax should be given up because of possible inefficiencies that could arise from firm reshuffling. In my view, the benefits still outweigh the costs.

Seriously though, what are the benefits of this?  You're basically setting a profit cap on companies, and confiscating the extra profits of anyone dumb enough to go over that cap, and not avoid or evade the confiscatory tax.  Why is it such a good thing to tax economic profits so heavily?  Economic profits don't represent deadweight losses, nor do they represent externalities, nor is earning an economic profit a morally bad act.  Economic profits are just the market's way of saying ""hey, invest more here!""  You'd be eliminating that market signal, and for what?"	19	"[""'s bought"", 'is taxed', 'should be given']"	3	2	0.10526315789473684	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""'s bought"", 'is taxed', 'should be given']"	3	2	0.10526315789473684	1	27985528483	10	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3jznil/_/cutuzz7/	214974669	27985440982.0	2015-09-07 20:02:34		huadpe	1	False	369	3	False	True	71.34
3972	"As I pointed out, Microsoft is already producing Xboxes in a depressed labor market to minimize overhead.  It costs them less money to produce 1000 Xboxes for Bangladesh in China (at a factory that will also produce millions of units for the US, Europe and China) than to produce 1000 Xboxes at a separate facility in Bangladesh.  That's just the math.  They aren't going to save money by setting up more logistics trains, buying more property and training and paying more workers just to reach a fairly small market that already can't afford the product.

Imagine you're an executive contemplating the policy you describe.  For the privilege of selling 1000 Xboxes at 1/2 price, you need to:

* acquire production space through land lease or subcontracting (which would be inordinately risky in the third world).

* buy the necessary equipment for production.

* secure a source of raw materials

* secure reliable means of shipping

* secure your new facility against an area that is likely in poverty and with a weak police force (read kickbacks to police or local power brokers)

* train and pay a work force (this work force will produce very little, so the money spent on them is not very productive)

Now imagine this is the case in an area where there is already a local market that sells a knockoff version of what you produce with 1/10 the overhead cost you have. (This is why indulging those markets is bad for the long term: companies have no incentive to fight themselves for market share.)

Why would you do that? Why would you fight through all of that for the privilege of selling your product at a discount?

3978	"Thanks for the delta!  I guess that under a certain point of view it could be considered forced labour, but I would argue that it doesn't strip people of autonomy or self-determination.

The first thing to account for here is what splits a moral obligation from an imposing force like a slave-owner, and the easiest answer is that although it is an *obligation* you can't be *forced* to do it - in many cases what people might consider moral obligations have notype of enforcement at all, and no repercussions for not obliging.  In that sense it is not forced labour.

The second, more interesting and probably more controversial take on it is whether we should be ""free"" to do bad things.  If not, our autonomy and self-determination exist *within* moral behaviour.  The easiest way to get this idea, I think, in to take the sentence, ""We should be free to do immoral things"" and realise that it means, ""We should be able to do those things that we should not do.""  That doesn't make much sense, and so I argue that it doesn't restrict our freedoms if we don't break moral rules (which is another way of saying that we should comply with our moral obligations)."	8	['could be considered', 'is not forced']	2	2	0.25	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['could be considered', 'is not forced']	2	2	0.25	1	27247425607	2	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/29mjiw/_/cimew5j/	137100632	27247399745.0	2014-07-02 02:51:00		thats_a_semaphor	1	False	206	0	False	True	62.41

3981	"Welp, now we have to get into knowledge. ""Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills"". All good?

""A proof is sufficient evidence or a sufficient argument for the truth of a proposition."" Still good? I'll assume so.

Let's call (generic) truth ""agreement with fact or reality"". This is a tricky one. Let me know if you have a different proposition.

Wikipedia (the source of all of these) says ""Reality is the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them."" Let's go with that.

Wiki also says ""Existence, in its most generic terms, comprises the state of being real and the ability to physically interact with the universe or multiverse.""

What do testable explanations and predictions require to be true (agree with reality)? Well, they require proof. Real evidence. Evidence that exists. Evidence that is able to physically interact with the universe.

How can we prove the following proposition:

**1.- ""Nothing can both be and not be""**

Let's try to find proof that it's true. Let's say i present the following piece of evidence: a bar of chocolate. I argue that the bar of chocolate clearly is, and it would be ridiculous to think it isn't at the same time. Well, if the proposition was true, then the evidence would be valid. But i can't really provide valid evidence to support the truth of the proposition without contaminating the evidence. If i provide evidence that argues the agreement of the proposition with fact or reality i am ex ante rejecting the possibility that the evidence may, in fact, be also in disagreement with fact or reality at the same time. I should not reject the hypothesis that things can be and not be at the same time because it is in effect what's being tested. If i do not reject the hypothesis ex ante, there is no possible evidence i can provide because i must accept the fact that it **might** be and not be valid evidence at the same time. If i reject the possibility, i just made an assumption and didn't prove anything at all.

Am i capable of providing real evidence, that exists, that is able to physically interact with the universe? I say no.

If the proposition is false, for starters it in itself can be true and false at the same time. All definitions are immediately useless because they might be true and not true at the same time. No logical deductions about a world where this proposition is false are valid. We simply know nothing of what the experience of having this proposition be false would be like.

So, if i cannot be aware if i am living in a universe where this statement is true or false, and there is no way to test this and there is no way to weight the likelihood of each scenario, can i really say i can provide testable explanations? Can i be sure there is such a thing as a valid test?

Do we really have any knowledge about the veracity of the proposition? Can we truly say we have proof of anything?

No, we cannot.

We can choose to ignore this problem, however, because it is a ridiculous concern. It is irrelevant. Perhaps we do live in this irrational universe, but for all practical purposes, what we perceive is the reality we're in (the state of things that exist, that can interact with the universe) What we perceive as our universe might as well be our universe. This is a practical solution, but we never gathered any evidence about the veracity of the proposition. We assume it to be true because this allows for other things to be true. However this assumption is not based on fact or evidence. Only practical concerns.

Yes, i'm using a closed system to illustrate a point. Does the model of what proof is that science uses require the proposition to be true? If it does then science relies on this condition, that is impossible to prove or falsify, to be taken as true.

Does science provide, then, ""**testable** explanations and predictions about the universe."" Technically not.

Am i missing something?

3991	"The slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" wasn't created in a vacuum.  You have to understand the context behind it, which is the idea that black lives are disproportionately lost to police officers compared to whites (and even compared to other racial minorities).  It is essentially a **response** to what supporters view as complacency on this issue.

You came up with 3 possible subtexts for the slogan:

1. ""Black lives matter *too*""
2. ""Black lives matter *more*""
3. ""*Only* black lives matter""

But there is a fourth subtext, which is a more accurate description of the meaning:

4. *It should go without saying, but since black people are disproportionately dying and it seems like people don't care, let's remind everyone that* ""Black lives matter""

With respect to the phrase ""All lives matter,"" the reason this upsets people is because it redirects the conversation away from the issue that the slogan ""Black lives matter"" is trying to communicate.  It can easily be perceived as dismissive, because there is no historical or cultural context for it, other than as a response to ""Black lives matter."""	9	"[""wasn't created"", 'are disproportionately lost', 'be perceived']"	3	3	0.3333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	"[""wasn't created"", 'are disproportionately lost', 'be perceived']"	3	3	0.3333333333333333	1	34755269912	0	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/hvc6ek/_/fyse1w8/	1080561260		2020-07-21 15:04:37	44586149.0	lunarquaker	5	False	181	0	False	True	59.53

3997	I think that toxicity in politics is not a measure of what everyone is doing, but the severity things are being carried out. The average person back then only heard about what what happening in their country. Now you can hear about what's happening all over the world and give your opinion on it. If we compared our technology back then to what we have now, the fact that the US pulled their troops out of Afghanistan and the middle east would not be as widespread as it currently is. It would have still happened, but less people would know about it. It would be very reasonable to assume that the different media outlets would have still portrayed the action as good or bad. Everyone is still trying to backstab the other no matter what point in time, it's just easier since information is spread so much more quickly.	7	['are being carried', 'is spread']	2	2	0.2857142857142857	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are being carried', 'is spread']	2	2	0.2857142857142857	1	37836222013	6	4855832	changemyview	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/psm6yx/_/hdqpjr1/	1559719113	37836095063.0	2021-09-21 14:26:45	146083589797.0	EE_Autumn	1	False	149	0	False	False	66.78

I'm asking why we shouldn't put guns and hacking tools in the same box as far as regulations are concerned? One's a physical weapon, the other is a cyber weapon. 

>The government does not restrict ownership of hacking tools, which is the key disanalogy with gun ownership. 

(EDIT: phrasing) And I agree with that regulation style, but should it be that way?
