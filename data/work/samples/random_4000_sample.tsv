For what you are doing i suggest having already a decently stereo signal (L+R EQ, reverb, panning, stereo recording) and then playing with the width and the loudness ratio of original and altered signal. If you want a lot of reverb you can put another one on the altered signal to make it even wider. 

You will see that it can sound somewhat weird if you have a very mono track and you put a very wide background on it and it's the only track that seems to happen in a cathedral. So try to fit the wideness of the background signal to the wideness of the main signal. Good to use this to make the final adjustment rather than the main element for a wider sound. Also the utility device will kill the punch and definition of the audio signal and it will continue doing it to the unaltered signal when you start layering it on top. Compression might help, but only to a certain point. So unless it's a pad synth or something alike don't go too heavy. "	1	False	188	0	True	True

I really wish your friends wouldn't say this kind of shit to you. Because no, he is in fact \*not\* in love with you, by his own admission. And he never made it exclusive and he continues to date other people, and you are not his priority. Regardless of his attachment to you (which is likely heavily influenced by your love for him), he is not your person or someone you should be with. I am so glad to hear that you realize that as well. Good for you for finally ending it! 

With that said, you are in a really tough situation now. I think there's only two ways to handle this: 

1. Limit contact with him as much as you can at work and go ""no contact"" in as many ways as you can (i.e. unfollow or mute him on social media, avoid drinks after work, etc.) 
2. Start dating around, Making connections with other people will help boost your confidence and distract you from thinking about him all the time."	4	False	193	0	False	True

While your proposed changes might make them more thematically Nids when compared to their tabletop play, I think it'd make a mess of the faction. 

Your proposal here effectively strips of the faction of it's current win-con (buff and burst) and worsens it's matchup against AOE's, which every faction has.

I would suggest that you investigate your ""live in one house, rent out the other"" options, anyway.  Find out what exactly you *could* do, before you dismiss the possibility of refinancing.

&gt;we both come from strict christian families and with that comes the doctrine of nothing before marriage.

Unless your parents and/or her parents have a stake in either of these homes (and could withdraw support, etc.), you shouldn't let this influence your decisions.  

Your parents - all four of them - are aware of your relationship, right?  

They are aware that you spend nights together, right?  

If both are true, and neither causes problems with your parents, then an objection on their part to mere cohabitation is unrealistic.  Why would your family expect you to pay more to live your life, in service of an ideal which holds that you should not receive mail at the same address?

In light of all that could go wrong, it's hard to imagine one's parents deliberately messing up their son's housing arrangement, just to teach him a lesson.  If this is just a moral quibble, then there has to be a way to explain your plans in a way that will satisfy them, *at least on grounds of practicality*.  If you explain that you have a detailed plan for what's to happen before and after you get married, and that sharing a home is a matter of making the best financial decisions possible, I don't know how they could continue to object.

And even if they dig in their heels, and continue pouting: They don't have to live with your decisions.  *You* do.  I want to believe they'll get over it.  Don't you think so?"	7	False	294	2	False	True

One being head voice dominant, which is what most technique should be focused on, and the other being slightly more chest voice dominant, which is a byproduct of good technique and not really trained. Some songs may require one of these modes/resonances, or a blend between these two for a neutral sound, or even gliding between multiple modes/resonances.

So there's a certain level of difficulty, in choosing or adapting to vocal weights and resonances that vary depending on the song.

One song in a set may be heavy, the next neutral, and the next very light/heady, and you have to be able to adapt to each one.

In general the main focus is gonna be on your head voice, because you have to get glottal narrowing down in your muscle memory. Otherwise without the glottal narrowing, your phonations will get too heavy."	2	False	155	0	False	True

It's one of the hardest things to treat with addicts, and confronting them will often lead to a depressive stage for them and if they fall back into the addiction, they'll blame **YOU** as the catalyst for their addiction. It's why I always recommend that if you have an addict in your family, you have to cut contact. You need to stress upon them that you wont meet with them unless it's at a rehab facility. You also have to cut them out if they wont accept responsibility for what they did in the past. This might take years for them to do.

As well as advertising when and where the funeral will be held? That's standard procedure for deaths. If your dad's phone never received even a single phone call in the 6 months it was active, she either knew he'd died, or they'd recently broken up before his death and he just hadn't told you guys yet. My money's on the recent breakup if she didn't come to the funeral. Probably best to leave it alone, but if your aunt is so concerned, she can do it. NAH, I get why your aunt feels bad about not having informed your dad's gf about his death, but I also understand why you're uncomfortable doing so four years after the fact.	1	False	131	0	False	False

I used it the first time, but won’t ever use it again.

The road’s fairly wide anyway, so it’s not difficult for other traffic to overtake me, other than a few pedestrian refuges where it’s a bit tight. The cycle lane abruptly ends at the point where the road narrows to a width at which it’s difficult for them to get past me, so it seems pretty pointless anyway.

In the meantime, there’s numerous junctions where, although the cycle lane has markings showing that it crosses the minor road, anyone turning in or out of the minor road has priority. Every time I come to one, I have to look over my shoulder to see if someone’s turning left across my path, look ahead to see if someone’s turning right and look left to see if anyone’s coming out of the side road. The first one in particular relies on anyone intending to turn left to indicate, which they often don’t. It nearly went horribly wrong for that very reason.

Partly because of those junctions, and also one or two others with traffic lights where I’m supposed to push the button and wait my turn, and also of course trying to negotiate pedestrians with headphones who don’t hear me coming up behind them, makes it much slower, so tips the balance in favour of just getting the car out and adding to the congestion :-/"	2	False	255	0	False	True

-I honestly blamed my lowkey boredom in my jetlag but then after sleeping more and processing the play further I’m still landing on underwhelmed overall. 

Highs: 
Ruth Negga’s  energy. I found her to be the most present seeming-like she was in a flow with heart and mind, and was playful and powerful. Especially in the first section pre intermission

Daniel Craig’s consistency throughout, as well as humor when playing a bit of a bumbling person amidst his descent into more paranoia and aggression 

Michael Patrick Thorton was consistently my favorite person on the stage. I kept having a “this guy knows what is going on” response to him on stage and was drawn in by him. 

Bloody: I appreciated the gore on stage as I hadn’t seen a show go there in such a way. 

Singing: nice song at the end, with a soft ending


Lows: 

Costumes—I felt like everyone was off to burning man in their combat urban drab clothes sprinkled in with flare like Ruth and Daniel’s dinner party clothing. The combo of the current era but low key wealthy apocalyptic desert wear on a very bare stage gave a dull feeling. I think sometimes a stripped down vibe allows for the story, the emotion to fill the space. For me this didn’t happen and the whole aesthetic felt half empty 

Daniel Craig—He was also a high. Partly as I’m a bond fan and seeing him on stage was a highlight for my fan girl vibes all the way. Can confirm-he looks good in a henley and boots on stage too. Objectifying him aside, I found myself wanting more emotional range. Felt like there was intense speaking and some inner considerations, but he relied on volume a lot and to me I didn’t experience a full emotional connect in a way I was hoping and have felt in other plays. 

Macduff/Macbeth: I felt that Macduff was not well established and the escalation at the end made sense from me knowing the progression of the play as it’s written but I felt/observed minimal connection to him/his story or to him/Macbeth until the very end when suddenly they’re fighting. Literally had a “did I fall asleep?” moment because again there was something missing. 

Witches: underwhelming. They made so. Much. Soup. I had reverse asmr, so irritation?!, at the many preparations of food scenes and background noises they made. I found them frustratingly kitchen-bound and not fun to listen to. 

Overall: I’m glad I went as it was a interesting production to watch but overall definitely not my favorite play. I don’t think I would rec this play overall—honestly my Daniel fangirl vibes coming off of No time to die,  and now newly learning of Ruth Negga and loving her presence, are the only reasons I’d encourage someone else to see it. All talented people, but just an odd combination and vibe that to me felt flat"	3	False	497	0	False	True

Though for my series, it's totally possible to enjoy them out of order. The only thing a reader loses is to not see the escalation of what the two characters do (it gets filthier with each book).

That said, I just (like, five minutes ago) published a new standalone title. So, here's hoping. ;)

The string is completely useless as the hat sucks the head of the wearer so hard it creates a vacuum. The strawhat has it's own will and only accepts wearers who are strong enough to endure the incredible succing power. Getting your head succed increases all your stats and willpower. The longer you get succed the better the outcome. However, if the hat ~~ sucks you off ~~ , i mean ~~ gives you head ~~ , is attached to your head for too long, it takes over the wearers body and robs them of their free will. That is why luffy takes off the hat sometimes. This was stated in the last SBS and also mentioned in CFYOW recently.

One thing is that 6 years isn't seen as a ton of experience in higher ed settings. Yes, there are people who cycle in and out of entry-level/asst. director-level positions quickly. But there are a lot of senior people with 20 or 30 years in HE (if not all at the same institution), so to them, six is a small number. 

Also, if you are just scanning the job postings and then submitting an application/resume and sitting back, you may not have as much success as if you actively network for a role. I.e., establish and use 1:1 connections on campus with folks in various  administrative and academic units. You will find out that Mary in Athletics used to work for the Dean of Students, and knows the person there who is hiring. She can mention your name or give you scoop on how to stand out/look more appealing to the hiring manager.

Sign up for a couple of on-campus workshops or certificate type professional development things, to beef up your MA degree. HR usually offers things like ""Being a Good Manager"" or ""Leading Effective Teams"" etc. You can use the info from those, and can list the credential on your resume too. 

Final comment - the Advancement/Development Office/Foundation (ie, fundraising) will always be looking for asst director folks, especially in annual giving (high turnover). If salary is a major concern for you (sounds like it) you will get a little bit higher pay scale there than in student-facing roles.

My nmom thinks my husband is manipulating me into hating her because he spoke on my behalf before (with permission because I was pregnant &amp; very stressed and needed her to lay off a bit).

Also yeah. I wouldnt eat anything my nmom gave us... she was big on bringing homemade food meal prepped for the freezer. Very nice, right?
Well after a few meals that ended with hours on the toilet... I wasn’t convinced she didn’t load up the frozen food with glass or something. 
We would get sick every so often when she would bring food or whatnot. Enough times to make us question. 

When I’d bring up how we ate something she made and got sick... just passively, not attacking...she’d do that “I have no idea what you’re talking about or how that happened” hand in the cookie jar tone that Ns do when gaslighting.

~~Her HP and DEF are pretty low, having a beefier shield on top of this damage bonus will make her more self sufficient.~~

It treats capital and labor differently, which is why it doesn't see the changes happening. For capital it uses GDI, which looks at profit. Profit subtracts out operating costs. For labor it just looks at income, which does not subtract out operating costs of labor, such as housing, transportation, utilities, etc. This would be like including office costs in the income of capital. For capital it subtracts out depreciation. For labor it does not subtract out depreciation, roughly represented by food costs. Just like a machine or building decays over time, so does the body. I think the issue is that economics is not used to talking about people in the same manner as they talk about infrastructure, so when someone tries to compare the two they don't do such a good job.	4	False	137	0	False	False

Why ?

When Liebe passed to the physical world he was thrown in the sky from the underworld 

When Asta cut the bamboo, Ryu said it was grown with magic power, suggesting that the vegetation is an illusion made with magic.

Daizaemon said they can only eat delicous food because the Ocha-ami dolls provide food for them, suggesting that they cant find food by themselves and only grow tatoes.

The only one to ever leave was Yami and coincidentally Yami can cut through dimensions. Even if he learned it when he was an adult. We still don't really know what happened when his clan was annihilated or how he got there. With the same train of thought, Asta was sent there by Lily who had the strongest spatial magic.

They call this place the land of the sun because the people were so impressed when they saw the sun when the inventor of zetten first did it as like an homage to the legend."	45	False	197	0	False	True

I know some 20ish year olds wait (hell, I know a girl who is still a virgin at 30) but by 21 I think they should brace themselves for the fact that their daughter MAY NOT BE A VIRGIN. 

I have friends with teenage and 20-something adult children and find that the ones who aren't in denial about what's going on tend to have the best, most honest and open RLs with their kids. Obviously nobody wants to see their family members fornicating (I know some do, but we won't discuss that here), but shaming your daughter like this seems silly to me. 

""Kids will be kids"" and all she's going to do is go to greater lengths to hide her behaviors if she really wants to be out getting pounded by her bf. "	6	False	173	0	False	True

Je peux vous confirmer que dans les peintures, les sculptures, les films, il y a plus de nudité que de gens habillés, parce que le nu a eu une période d'appréciation bien plus longue en comparaison des sujets plus habillés. 
Historiquement parlant, le nu c'est LE truc porté aux nues (pardon je pouvais pas ne pas la faire), c'est ce qui vient clore l'apprentissage des académiciens, c'est la référence à l'antique qui a été pendant longtemps la base de ce que l'on définissait comme beau, une espèce d'Eden perdu, la référence ultime en matière d'idéal à atteindre. C'est ce qui est présent dans les peintures religieuses, les statues antiques, les copies des étudiants, sans parler des œuvres érotiques :)

Et ce n'est pas l'époque victorienne qui a foutu le bazar au nom de la pudeur par exemple, c'est simplement qu'on a changé de vision en matière de beau, mais le nu n'a pas pour autant une aura moins forte. On est passé au néoclassique, puis au romantisme et au réalisme, et il y a toujours beaucoup de nus, ils sont cependant de moins en moins porteurs de vertus morales, plus orientés vie quotidienne et sont moins estimés de nos jours pour leurs valeurs esthétiques, car ils sont plus utiles historiquement qu'ils ne sont séduisants aux yeux des amateurs d'art. (Et puis bon, faut dire aussi que d'un point de vue histoire, les historiens de l'art sont vus comme les sous merdes de l'histoire, on est dans une civilisation où l'image a moins d'importance pour le commun des mortels que le texte...parce qu'on ne se rend pas compte de l'omniprésence du visuel ;))"	1	False	288	0	False	True

They hail from an agriworld known as streizia-2. The world sought to prove itself to the greater imperium, thus they sought the aid of more experienced imperial guard regiments. Unfortunately for them, the Death Korps of Krieg answered their call. They were rebuilt to resemble the deathkorps. Even down to the standard issue of gas masks. Since then, however, they have picked up a few strange characteristics. For example, they love to pick up any war gear they come across and repurpose it for their use. They have encountered and repurposed multiple strange vehicles yet unknown to the wider imperium. These vehicles appear to be standard-issue imperial armor. Apart of course from the fact that all of them appear to have been modified to become walking variants. They use these in a spearhead doctrine where armor ravages the enemy before the infantry finishes them off. This has drawn suspicion from the mechanicus. They condemn them for the hasty refurbishing of such machines without even studying or identification of what they truly are. They have even been banned from inspecting such vehicles for fear of them breaking the valued machines. Nonetheless, however, the mechanicus still work with the fusiliers in hopes of using them to acquire more of these war machines for their study. The fusilier's shaky relations with the mechanicus have however caused significant strain on the resources given to them. This has caused a semi-ragtag and repurposed look in the fusiliers. Nonetheless, they are still a force to be reckoned with.	1	False	261	0	False	False

By 8:30 one of my team was so unbelievably drunk he couldn't speak or remember who he was. He disappeared, no notice or anything. Just vanished. 

Being the caring folks we are up north, we didn't think anything of it and didn't chase it up until the morning after. 

He went to catch a train home, trying to be sensible. He fell asleep on the train and woke up in Manchester. Around 30 miles from where he lives.

The taxi driver charged him £85 to get home. Reduced from £100 because he felt sorry for him. 

I found this very funny, you may not, as you don't know him but I hope it at least puts a smile into your evening.

If you imagine a number pad on a computer that will correspond to which way you have to hold your stick or D-Pad. For example 2 means hold down. 6 means hold towards your opponent. And 5 means you don't need to hold any direction. This is a universal way to notate commands even if you are playing different games. One important note is these commands are always given assuming that your character is facing the right. So 3 C will always be down and towards your opponent and hit C. It's It's bit weird at first but you will shortly become used to it and reading them will be second nature.	2	False	135	0	False	False

I just want to add that fully *discharging* a lithium battery is even more damaging than fully charging it, but most EV's have a much more conservative limit on how far they can be discharged compared to smart phones. This is why EV's can be used daily for a decade or so while smart phones struggle past even two years and very few are designed to make replacing the battery easy (yes, it's planned obsolescence since most people but a new phone every 2-3 years anyway)	2	False	91	0	False	False

Possibly the most beautiful, sad and hilarious series I've ever seen, but unfortunately it was given bad reviews because people thought Gervais was mocking the mentally handicapped. He wasn't, he was making a remark on how society tries to tell the mentally handicapped what would be best for them, whether they are happy with their lives or not. It's also largely about society's treatment, or lack thereof, of the elderly and how they seem to just be put in care homes and forgotten. The whole thing was so moving.	91	False	100	0	False	False

I played rugby union through university. Did not know what AFL was until I moved here.


AFL players run 9.5 miles (15.28k, sorry bro) a game, take vicious hits during a mark or catch (Google ""screamers"") and require immense hand-eye coordination to execute an accurate kick while running full speed. The average age of an AFL player is 24 where the NFL is 27.  This speaks to the fact you must be young to play AFL and the players don't last long due to injuries that most RBs get. Ice hockey requires the same athleticism but if you look at Sidney Crosby he averaged 21 minutes a game over 82 games a season and AFL players play a non-stop hour game for 23 games. Still hard to compare but I still tip AFL.


I love sports. Cricket, F1, ping-pong, soccer, darts, dressage, ninja warrior, golf...I love sport. I **live** American football and ice hockey. So, I don't think I am biased and feel pretty neutral when I say that Australian Football League players are the best athletes in the world. Everyone on an AFL team looks like ""they have been carved from wood."" *-Fight Club* 


You need to be stronger to play on the line in the NFL. You need better hand-eye coordination to play NHL. You need to be faster to sprint in track. You need to be tougher to play hurling. You need more endurance to race in le Mans.


But you need all of it, for every position, for every second, to play Australian rules football. Just my opinion."	3	False	276	0	False	True

I think it has to do with the fact that the damage received is proportional to the weight of the animal (which depends on volume) divided by surface area of the impact. As creatures get bigger, their volume (and therefore weight) increases faster than the surface area of their body.

As a result, bigger animals (and any objects, really) get hurt more easily. I believe mice, for instance, can fall from any height and survive. If you want to go way smaller it's pretty easy to comprehend with insects. Insects always manage to survive giant falls for this reason. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, a beached whale can't even survive since its own weight is too much for its body. It certainly can't take a fall of any kind.

e: [Here's a source.](http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html)

&gt;Gravity, a mere nuisance to Christian, was a terror to Pope, Pagan, and Despair. To the mouse and any smaller animal it presents practically no dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force.

Sooo yea, it's at least more likely for a dog to survive this fall than a person (although maybe still unlikely? IDK)"	17	False	298	1	True	True

Rebels need to abuse hand disruption, it's a really powerful tool that the Empire doesn't have access to and removing a key card before the Empire can play it is really strong, especially when drawing cards is not easy. The Forcw starts with the Rebels, so buy strong stuff and hit hard early.

Empire is the ""control deck"", they can't disrupt enemy hand but they have a lot of control over the galaxy row so try and remove the key cards before Rebels get to buy them and manipulate the row (you can often look at the top facedown cards as well) so that  it's full of trash/neutrals or your stuff. 

Capital ships are definitely really strong. I suggest playing on the full galaxy mode, so you get more bases. There's some good bases that can set up power turns but don't have a lot of HP, and they're just not worth it on the basic 3-base mode. Our last game I managed to snag a free early Star Destroyer as Empire that gave me a huge early power boost."	1	False	195	0	False	True

You just posted to r/onlyfanspetite less than 24 hours ago! We want to give everyone a chance to post and be seen so we limit everyone to **one post every 24 hours** *(that is exactly 24 hours nothing less)* .  This means 24 hours from your last post to your next post.  **Deleted posts or posts removed by the mods for rule violations still count against your 24 hours**.  Please be sure to read our rules they are the same for each sub in our network.  The rules and our subreddit list can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyFans101Network/wiki/index

**If this is your first offense** This comment is your warning.  If you break this rule again (*today, tomorrow, two weeks from now, two months from now*), you will receive a temporary ban.  If you break this rule repeatedly, you may receive a permanent ban.  Please keep track of your posts, don't just assume ""the bot will take care of removing them or warning you.""

**Check your post history**  Sometimes reddit will glitch and post something twice. The Reddit app is buggy and the bot cannot tell a glitch from a deliberate rule violation.  If the bot did catch you by mistake.  You can contact the mod team via modmail and we will remediate the issue.  

Please see the comment at the bottom of this warning for your last post and when you can post again.

I don't see a justification for that distinction.

But *why* as a policy matter should it be covered?  I'm not covered if I fall over in my shower at home, so why a shower at a motel?

&gt; In any case the whole matter would be much better handled by no-fault universal insurance which would cover accidents due to sex, showers, and space shuttles, but that's a whole other discussion.

Agreed.  But until we have that, I think it's a bit abusive to require Comcare to provide that insurance by stretching the concept of injury in the course of employment to cover everything under the sun."	0	False	132	2	False	True

Men are women are not the same, and treating and expecting them to be is not only unnatural it is also very harmful as we can see today. I don't see how my comment would degrade men, nor do i see the competency hierarchy as a bad thing, since it is a fact of life and happens all around you every single second of the day. By men and women. Men social groups also work differently to women social groups. This is all established and know in the literature. Seeing my advice as dividing people is weird, what is wrong with saying men need men to learn how to be men for example? 

Of course it would be amazing if we could all be generic amorphous individuals able to morph into any situation, gender, role, environment, culture, setting and so on at whim. But that's not how it works, at all. Life doesnt work like in your netflix shows where people get lots of emotional nourishment, work out their issues and get along smoothly in social settings. Life is messy, confusing and increasingly more complex and difficult for men and women despite changes, or even because of them, from the last few decades that have radically altered our society. No surprise then that men AND women today are completely and utterly confused. And resorting to the 'its men's fault' narrative at every opportunity is sexist as FUCK.

But yes, generally like you say going around and treating everyone the same is a safe bet. But going around and pretending that there are no differences going on behind the surface, will create problems, and is not sustainable."	1	False	282	0	False	True

I don't think it necessarily implies a dichotomy, you could be educated + socially adept or you could be educated and socially inept or cold in some way, and some might call the latter overeducated (rightly or wrongly). It's a colloquialism, not really that deep. Obviously matt is using it as an insult that doesn't really make any sense. As far as I'm aware, culturally, it'd more commonly be used if like - you meet a lover who is well educated/upper class but they have no idea how to have fun and  make love and chill out with you, see [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5MqyfmU3AE) for an example	3	False	129	0	True	False

**SOURCE:** [*'The Orchard' - PBDW Architects*](http://www.pbdw.com/pbdw/projects/the-orchard%E2%80%A8/)


&gt; *Onteora Park was developed in the late nineteenth century as a Catskill retreat for artists and writers seeking to escape summer in the city. Today it is a year-round destination occupying a 3,000-acre preserve with houses scattered throughout the woods and a central clubhouse for members of the Onteora Association.*

&gt; *The Orchard, one of the premier houses of the original development, was designed in 1902 by Canadian architect George A. Reid. A massive rubble-stone base enclosed a generous ground floor porch and large public rooms, but the original house was curiously undeveloped above the first floor, both internally and externally. The resulting composition was that of a rather stunted head on a substantial body. It also fell short of contemporary expectations in its small kitchen (residents were expected to take their meals at the clubhouse), a general shortage of bathrooms, parsimonious sleeping quarters, and antiquated services.*

&gt; *Our design reconfigured the plan and doubled the interior floor area of the house. We upgraded or restored interior finishes, installed new services and bathrooms, and added a service wing with a large kitchen, mudroom, and laundry room downstairs and additional bedrooms above. On the exterior we replaced all windows and doors and added a porte cochere and shingled cladding in decorative patterns, as well as upper-level porches and fanciful dormers to give the upper stories and roof a character that now fulfills the expectations created by the base.*

&gt; *With the expansion of the house completed the owners have turned their attention to the site. Current projects include demolition of inappropriate structures and the design of a new, 3,600 sf carriage barn, whose walls will be enlivened by a full range of decorative shingle patterns and vernacular carpentry details.*

The show was based on the books by John Silvester, whose father was, from memory, a police officer involved in investigating the underworld in the 70s. Highly recommend.

It sounds like this is maybe some kind of deeper issue-- perhaps P is testing out his identity as separate from his sister? Whatever the case, sometimes punishments can just act as a bandaid without solving the problem-- i.e. the kid may act ""correctly"" some of the time to please the adults but it's not going to fix the root issue. 

It's normal for siblings to go through ebbs and flows in closeness and bickering both. The book has really good advice for setting boundaries about unacceptable behavior (meanness, lying, hitting, etc) and good tools with language to use and points of view you may not have considered. Check it out on Amazon. If you like it I'd let MB know that you're going to read it and that you'll let her know what it says. It might open your eyes to some parenting issues that are sometimes awkward for us nannies to address, but having a book to point to is helpful to take the heat off you. "	1	False	180	0	False	True

Miners *confirm/mine* transactions. *Verifying* happens by anyone else (that's why the saying: ""Verify. Don't trust""). You don't have to trust the miner because you (your full node) can verify everything that miners (and everyone else on the network) are doing.  

&gt; The more people want to use BTC, the more ""verifiers"" we need.  

No, it's not how it works.  

&gt; The less the reward, the less people will be willing to mine.  

Roughly right, but you also have to keep in mind that rising prices (in fiat) incentivizes more people to mine, even if the rewards are dropping in bitcoin terms.  

&gt; How will cryptocurrencies ensure there are enough miners? How will they motivate them?  

In bitcoin there is something called ""difficulty adjustment mechanism"". It isn't there to ensure that mining stays profitable, but it definitely helps."	1	False	147	4	False	True

Well the ship had an accident with the nuclear reactor, and by accident I mean it freaking exploded. Fortunately no one was hurt but the damage to the ship was severe, essentially the ship was completely disconnected from the drive section and was running on backup power (I had some retractable solar panels that where stowed away after the ships completion) and i didn't have enough monopropellent to put it In a stable orbit around duna but I did have enough to change the trajectory to start areobraking and combined with the remaining monopropellant I was able to put it in a rapidly decaying orbit, the aerobraking had torn off more of the ship but fortunately I had put the non-essential crew into the space planes and those remained in tact. After the breaking was complete I was in an extremely elyptical orbit around duna. It gave me enough time to get everyone into one of the space planes and using what remained of the ship to break the craft even more I was able to then disconnect the plane during reentry and it actually ended up creating a scene very similar to this.	75	False	222	0	False	False

Racists have been trying to pit white and black working class people against each other for over a century. Who receives things like free school lunches is a frequent tactic racists use to divide us. Every downvote is a moron saying they don't understand that."	-5	False	123	0	False	True

Having found God bugs, Cisco bugs and even a God bug in NSA systems, I have a fair idea.

NSA doesn't find these bugs, they find out about them. Sometimes from the vendors themselves, or from independent researchers or organizations. Very few of the bugs used by NSA are known only to NSA.

Letting a God bug become public knowledge is a sure way to kill it, so the pros keep it close. We may use it, or even share it with a trusted friend or two who have a proven record of keeping these thing private. We don't publish this stuff, but we do use it.

So now NSA, Cisco's PSIRT (for example), and 3 or 4 private researchers have this bug, and are using it. None of these parties has any control over how the other parties use the bug. So if I use it to play with an Iranian bank, and the Russians happen to snarf it off the wire, NSA may not know that the bug they're intentionally not fixing is in hostile hands. With something like a Cisco bug, that can result in a catastrophic failure. I'm talking about hosing the whole internet. 911 systems shut down. Phones dead. Power off. Cybergeddon type shit. Or, let's look at a Windows bug. Imagine a cryptolocker that propagates in under 24 hrs. Every SMB now has their Quickbooks shredded. Think the banking crisis of '08 was bad?

The Cisco bugs in the recent dump were at least **3 years old**. Even if only NSA had these bugs (which I highly doubt), there's a very good chance that they used it in circumstances where another nation's security agencies could snarf it. And the patch is just now being rolled out, which means many networks won't actually be fixed for months. It's a good bet that Russia could have used this bug to hose our infrastructure last year. And maybe make it look like Israel did it.

There's no reason to sit on bugs like this for years. Yes, we have been doing that for a long time and have been getting away with it. But our adversaries are more sophisticated now, and our luck *will* run out. These bugs should have been patched a long time ago.

It was to delay the certification of the electoral college votes just long enough for Trump to pressure his VP and to come up with alternative votes."	4	False	79	1	False	True

Handsome ""supermodel men"" has also attacked me unprovoked, and sometimes I have not even spoken to them.

THAT'S INSANE! Reminds me of this other totally real story: 

I work as a hostess for a henna company. It's a really busy and fun job, and I always have a crowd of people around my desk looking at henna art. Though once in a while the creepy ""funny"" guy shows up. This time it was a couple, late 50thies early 60thies I guess. She wanted intricate henna on her hands and fingers, looked trough our books for examples, asked for prices and I helped her out. My artists are really skilled and experienced and makes amazing small details.

Insert classic interruption of women doing business by obnoxious husband: ""How much for drawing cock and balls on my cock and balls?"" I did not miss a beat, looked him in the eyes and said with a serious face: ""We can't do that, we need a bigger surface."" Then turned back to his wife to continue our talk.

She cackled! And when he stood there, deadfaced starring at us, she EXPLAINS THE JOKE TO HIM! In front of my crowd of people. He never cracks a smile. She buys the most expensive henna piece she could get, and was still laughing when I put her in line to match with an artist.

The husband? He gave me the stink eye (which I ignored, I have a job to do) then vanished into the crowd.

Bonus: when I told my boss, he cackled too.

Edit: I did not think my little workstory would get this kind of attention. My mom called and I get back here seeing a ton of comments and even awards! Thank you guys!

I told mom my story too, she is very proud of me, lol! Though... The real hero is the wife! I've shut down men like him more times than I can count, but never have I had a wife back me up like that! Thank you, lady who loves henna art. You made the day for a lot of people &lt;3"	0	False	360	1	False	True

Trust me, the game is hella fun. The siege battles are more linear, but they're in line with the warhammer table top over past total wars.

Personally I prefer this style, as in campaign it is a much more dynamic battle each time because the garrison force actually has a chance to cover important bottle necks. I loved Rome and Rome 2, but hated the sheer size of their city maps. It alwayd felt like each map was supposed to fit 4-8 players as opposed to 1v1.

I think the op has the wrong expectations with sieges, but I wouldn't say no to a few more different map iterations.

Also, to attackers as a whole, maybe a few siege weapons to knock down a wall or two could be useful in creating some alternate paths into the fortress. "	7	False	153	0	False	True

The answer that you're trying to bait is ""corporations"", but the average person is on board with the majority of those policies.

Not at all. The average person probably thinks about such things a half dozen times their whole life. 

> If there's a bunch of profit to be made by building houses in areas with artificially high prices, do you really think that the ""greedy"" shareholders of construction companies are going to refrain from building?

Ok, so lets actually think this out:

A real estate investor or company sees a chance to make a profit in an area with artificially scarce housing raising prices. 

Most can't just drop the tens or hundreds millions it will take to buy property and build enough new housing to make a difference. 

Those who can are choosing to make a huge investment for long term profits, meaning they have to accept passing up short term profits. Which isn't how anyone gets rich, because investors and banks aren't going to like hearing that you'll get a return on investment in a few decades. 

It is far easier to buy up existing stock to get into such a market, just as we have seen since the pandemic with companies like Black Rock buying up foreclosed homes. 

>It sounds like you're on board with deregulation and limiting the government's ability to intervene in the market.

Actually, no. These same interests that are doing *spectacularly* for their bottom line now aren't going to suddenly eat themselves in competition if zoning laws changed. 

They'd save money putting new houses by industrial parks and selling shoddy housing, then claim there just isn't enough incentive and demand some other concession from government. 

I'd rather take the power out of the hands of the ghouls and give them some actual competition through public housing and housing co-ops, like that in Vienna."	0	False	313	3	False	True

You mentioned elsewhere that you are oldschool only on Nid colours, blues and purples only, not sure if that is a preference or your understanding of the old schemes, as essentially the Nids were split as genestealers + hybrid cult elements in the blues and purples, but the warriors and termagants were varying shades of red with bone platings. The 2nd ed Tyranid Codex describes termagant variation in colouration in depth more anywhere from bright orange to deep umbers speculated at the biomass used in their breeding, through to the age of the termagants themselves (the from the Imperium perspective is sometimes annoying). 

The prices on Zoats is a bit nuts, but the ludicrous prices are what people want or expect for Grabber Slasher Squigs (and squigs in general), $50 to $80 USD such a joke for an enmass released model that was 1 GBP on release. The squigs look cool as a set though, I was stupidly lucky, picked up 250ish squigs of all sorts (not that many grabber slashers or spider squigs alas) 5ish years back, and another 100 last year both as parts of larger lots and at a reasonable price to my mind. I've found with rogue trader and also 2nd ed Tyranids that it is all about patience, granted, I'm at 10 years building up an insane sized collection (yeah not painted yet, got an age of sigmar army project to get me up to scratch modelling and painting then will tackle the Nids). I met my first big total units goal of 6 broods of 30 hunter slayers (a standard troops allotment for many editions of 40k) mid last year, but instead of hitting 180 even...I had 182...which irked me as I can't have 2 termies not on the field, so ummm, I may have revised that to 360 as the goal and am sitting at 228 total now (last year was amazing for Oldhammer acquisitions...sadly due to covid, but as an essential services worker, I still had a stable income to capitalise on it and at least what I scored has gone to a good home unlike some of the lots of say metal purestrains picked up and then put up on ebay at twice or more the cost each, so frustrating as people see those prices and assume that's the standard on ebay and newer stuff goes up and languishes for years. Sorry for rambling, it's so rare to see rogue trader tyranid forces no matter the size painted up that I usually get excited by seeing them and then can't help but talk about my stuff I've yet to tackle despite collecting now for so long. 

You should check out the rogue trader 40k compilation, it has the original genestealer cult lists and background and that background and lists meld seamlessly including how the cult is equipped based on whether they are based on a feral/primitive world, a frontier or a developed world. Genestealer Cults also commonly allied with Chaos as a pseudo chaos cult incorporating chaos beastmen, mutants, and daemons into the mix.

I'm from the global south, and You're kind of right, but also kind of wrong.  Marxism-Leninism was for, pretty much the entirety of the Cold war, the primary, most popular ideology, not only in the USA but through pretty much the entire world. Partially, this was due to the USSR funding a lot of these parties, though even then, in a lot of those  cases there wasn't exactly 'ideological purity' enforced (ZAPU was a Marxist-Leninist and *Georgist* party in Zimbabwe, for example, opposing Rhodesia and Mugabe's Mao Zedong thought adhering ZANU).

The other Significant factor is repression of any sort of socialism or leftism in great swathes of the world, including the first Red Scare in the USA and here in Brasil the Vargas Dictatorship.  So you Mix the two and you get primarily ML parties having a great deal of influence, alongside stuff like, first the repression of Anarchists, syndicalists and trotskysts in the Spanish civil war by USSR aligned communists, and then the loss of the civil war, those sorts of movements have a hard time through most of the cold war.

Here in Brasil, for example, there were strong Anarchist and Syndicalist movements through much of the early 1900's alongside (and even before in some cases) the communist movements started.

But then  you get to the 90's and 2000's. The USSR dissolves, China is doing reaproachment with the west, the EZLN is a non ML movement (not a anarchist movement eitheir despite what some might say, but very much libertarian) that is one of the most sucessful armed leftist movements of the last 30 years, and a financial crisis combined with alot of mixed feelings on the USSR means alot more anarchists.

However, especially more recently, there have been alot of USA ML's and they have some atrocious takes. 90% of modern day Tankies i know about are English language speakers first, because CPUSA is, from what i understand, a joke.

PT, the big workers party that is probably the most popular leftist party here in Brasil had it's start in a lot of syndicalist, union organizing and even Liberation Theology.  The second most popular leftist party, PSOL, is also a libertarian Socialist one, though much more radical, especially as PT has turned into a much more socdem, big tent party.   A example of that is Guilherme Boulos, PSOL's Presidential candidate, being a important member of MST,  the largest radical agrarian reform movement in Brasil, that participated in a great deal of armed land occupation.

Not like ML's are a unified bunch anyway. the PCB, the brasilian communist party and the PCdoB, the communist party of Brasil (Yes really) split along idealogical lines after Krutchev's Destalinization, though for a while during the Military Dictatorship they were maoist doing a bit of (Very failed) people's war.

It's also important to remember 'Tankie' as it is used now doesn't apply universally to ML's anyway. Plenty of Trotskyists and Maoists are way worse than the vast majority of ML's, especially here in South America (Like the shining path).

While it's true that our modern view of things can be affected like that, you need to understand the vast historical context for why things are like that."	38	False	538	0	False	True

Do not have to be sexual
More often they are not
For when they are; 
They are often gone too soon


The Loves of My Life
Are always sensual
They warm my Heart
They soften the pain in my Soul


The Loves of My Life
Their eyes comfort me
Their eyes reassure me


The Loves of My Life
They lessen my self-doubt
They ease my insecurities 

 
The Loves of My Life
Are in my Dreams
Are in my Nightmares
They make me happy
They make me sad
They put my heart at ease
They instill fear into my heart with their absence


The Loves of My Life
Their words are true
Their words are sharp
Because their words are real


The Loves of My Life
They make me wonder
They make me wander
They open my mind
They make me hopeful
They make me foolish

 
The Loves of My Life
Their confidence is quiet
They have opinions
Yes, we disagree
Yet, they stick around


The Loves of My Life
They act as they are;
Not as they think they should be
We do not play house


The Loves of My Life
They are not my Mother
They make her uncomfortable
They are her competition
They fill places in my Heart that she cannot
They make me secure where she cannot


The Loves of My Life
They do not play games
But, they do play games;
Because they are smart

 
The Loves of My Life
They are intelligent
Yes, they are bright
Yes, they are dark
They can lighten up my day
They can close my shades
Their happiness is my hope
Their pain is my pain

(It took 4 months for me.) There is this thing that affects my life so much, and I am pretty sure that it is ADHD, but knew that I couldn't bring up my self-diagnosis partially because I was seeing psychologists at university, and also because I do not fit into the stereotypes of ADHD. My parents being in denial didn't help, either. 

So, for a week, I wrote down everything I forgot and everything I lost. I also wrote down how I lost track of time, every single time that happened. I also wrote down my concerns, like how much extra work I have to put in to just pay bills on time and get my cat well fed. 

The thing with ADHD is that, if you just say ""I forget so much, and I lose important things all the time"", there is really no way to tell the degree of the symptoms for the psychologist. It also sounds like anxiety and depression. Everybody forgets and loses things to some extent. Everybody gets stressed out when they lose important stuff. It's the frequency and severity that hinders our lives. So you have to write them all down to just prove that the degree of those symptoms are bad enough to qualify for a disorder. 

There is still a possibility that they would end up giving you antidepressants and/or anxiety medications. My advice would be to just take whatever they give you, and see if it makes things better. Pushing for a specific diagnosis almost always backfires, especially if it's about ADHD. So, if you get diagnosed with something that you don't identify with, just express that you don't really see it in yourself but that you trust them enough to give it a shot. See if it works. If it does, great. I think I would rather be depressed or anxious than to have ADHD. (I have been severely depressed for 10+ years, suicidal and all, but I would still take that again if I could get rid of my ADHD. I know that even though I am predisposed of depression, I can crawl out of it eventually. But ADHD, not so much. This thing is permanent and I am still having a really hard time dealing with the fact that I will never really get better.) And If what they gave you doesn't help, you can get back to them with the list of your current symptoms. It can be frustrating, but you will definitely get through it. "	1	False	430	0	False	True

Like doctors, therapists don't know everything and don't always get it right. There is nothing wrong with seeking a second opinion at all, in my opinion you're doing the right thing. Having a diagnosis hang over your head is something that sticks with you the rest of your life. Now if you had just stopped her appointments and that is it, then I'd agree with everyone else here. You should also be prepared that the other therapist may diagnose her with anxiety as well, and be ready to support your daughter through that.

Wrong. There is no dietary restriction that prevents a plant based diet unless you are allergic to every single fruit, vegetable, grain, legume, bean, and nut on the planet.

And if that were true, you'd be dead. There are far more plant options than animal flesh options.

>There’s too many factors to assume that a vegan diet would automatically solve all the problems

It would free up 75% of agricultural land, completely clear our emissions goals for climate change, save 86 billion Land animals and 2 trillion fish, and extend everyone's lifespans by several years and substantially improve everyone's quality of life by reducing the incident rate of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer."	1	False	127	2	False	True

It’s super easy to get people to smile at you. If I wanted to see someone smile, I would smile at them. When you smile at someone, they smile back (usually).

The intent behind GG EZ is basically entirely negative. There's no value to it, it's not funny, it's not saying ""I've done awesome, hurray"", it's purely and simply spiteful and negative in function, only existing to try and get a rise out of people or to annoy people on the other team. It has no other conversational function in that setting.

Why wouldn't you want to punish that? A short term ban isn't exactly a big deal, if it gives them a warning then why not? If they're persistent in being a jerk and it ramps up to a permaban then it means they've done it consistently to many people."	2	False	147	0	False	True

5. Yes 

6. Only the immediate after-surgery binder, which effing sucked!!! I mean it did it’s job but I hated it so much. The post 7-days binder you need to obtain yourself—I used a smaller zip-up sports bra with the pads removed and it worked great. 

7. After the consult they need to run your insurance, which can take 3 weeks. They then schedule your surgery after that approval, which can run anywhere from 2–6+ months. You will have another pre-op visit 1 month before your surgery.

To me, Mythras seems very generic and ready to drop into any setting you choose. In the book itself it talks about freely picking and choosing parts that give whatever setting you want the best flavor. It's also part of idea behind things like fighting styles, things that have a solid uniform mechanic core but can easily be customized and skinned to whatever the GM and players want.

As for the settings you mention, Design Mechanism has a [Mythic Earth](http://thedesignmechanism.com/Mythic-Earth.php) supplement series that currently contains several different places and eras, Rome being one. The Mythic Rome could be a good start to modify a Greece setting.

Format:

    *Video Transcription:*

Your final transcription will look like this:

*Video Transcription:*

---

(mm:ss)  
[*Description of scene, kind of music playing, actions happening, etc.*]
[*Tone of dialogue]* Dialogue.

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

The primary concerns of anything in DnD should always be whether something is actually fun or not. GMs are allowed to break, deviate from or make up rules and mechanics in the pursuit of a good campaign.

In this case, something like ""you can still cast spells but there is a chance things will go wrong and your patron will interfere with your spellcasting which means I get to roll on this table for a random effect"" would perhaps be more fun than just taking away spellcasting. Make it have consequences, but make sure the consequences allow for engaging storytelling and interactivity for the player. You should never ruin a player's enjoyment of the game by just taking away a massive part of their character, unless said player is okay with it. Always discuss this sort of thing with players beforehand to make sure everyone is on board."	1	False	170	0	False	True

If you save 2k an month, that’s 24 000 a year or 240 000 over 10 years. That’s enough for an downpayment on an million euro house. Most downpayments are around 10% of the market value of the house. A good loan on top of that, and tell me why it’s not possible?

And if you are afraid that your money will lose value over the time, but you are ready to push for it, maybe then invest it, in something stable. Like an extra apartment that you rent out. It migth be riskier than having your money in an fond, but at the same time it migth just pay off. 
All of these people I know didn’t just “like that” save and buy an house. It took them careful planning, connections and knowledge, to different tricks, to get an good house for cheaper than they should have. This mostly meant, owning the land, or making an good deal directly with the construction company. 

2k is an very good, and if you keep on saving, I bet you will be pretty good off in the future."	-1	False	193	0	False	True

In my case I had a lot of problems with holding. First of all, my shoulder rest wasn't good for me so I had a lot of tension in my neck and I used to use a lot of my left arm to hold the violin. 

Now I use 75% of my arm and head but still, my left hand helps me ( I consulted it with my teacher about a year ago), and that's ok. its natural that, u don't use your all power from neck and arm to hold the violin. It creates a tension (too much tension is not good for ur health). 

Although if u use too much power from ur left arm it will be hard to learn vibrato. I had that problem, then I changed my shoulder rest to a higher one and it really helped. I still can't do vibrato very well, but it's easier now. 

I hope I helped :) Have a good day and practice 40 hrs

He's 100% untoxic and they banned him why?

They're probably not giving out his logs publicly, 1. Because they only do that when you rage and act like you didn't deserve to be banned because they don't care what people think of you and 2. He's a pro player and showing his history of horrible behavior and incredibly volatile language would cause him to get trolled more in his games.

If they had no evidence. They would not ban him. How you can believe that is insane to me. I think you have some serious trust issues, and some other mental issues aside.

If HE has a problem with it, contesting the toxicity and not the punishment, I'm sure they'd gladly show it to the world. He KNOWS why he's banned."	2	False	136	0	False	True

I don't know about big cities like Moscow, but I can say that in my town people are quite homophobic. However I know some bisexual females that are taken pretty well
2. Honestly, I can't tell. Neutral views, I guess
3 and 4. Yes the Russians are very homophobic. You (as a male) can be easily beaten by bydlo/gopniks/punks/etc if they find out that you're gay. At least here's what it's like. I don't think that's right in any way.
5. No. My town is full of Armenian people and most of them are pretty good. However, younger Armenians are quite insolent, but that disappears when they grow up (or it doesn't, but that doesn't happen really often)
6. Honestly — I dont know. You may have trouble with that, but I don't know any gay people, so I can't tell.

I highlighted the text ""*congress applauded Zelenky*"" and right clicked and did a search.    
  
First result: [https://i.imgur.com/dsDP21L.png](https://i.imgur.com/dsDP21L.png)  
  
So I (obviously) clicked that link and went here:  [https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-did-marjorie-taylor-greene-not-applaud-volodymyr-zelensky-1688769](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-did-marjorie-taylor-greene-not-applaud-volodymyr-zelensky-1688769)  
  
Around a 1/3 of the way down that page, there's this:   

&gt;[C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?518685-1/ukrainian-president-zelensky-calls-us-back-fly-zone-provide-defensive-weapons) recorded the entirety of Zelensky's speech, and at about the 2-minute, 45-second mark, the Georgia Republican can be seen applauding for the Ukrainian president. 

So I clicked the link for the C-SPAN article, made it sure looked legit, and posted the link to the page.  

It took me WAY less time to find the clip than it did to make this comment.

Your demographic is either missing or doesn't adequately reflect your survey. Who are you interviewing in this? Are you after a specific set of people? You have to be asking the right people, you know.

Our most common issues when removing posts are as follows, all to do with broad demographic tags such as ""Everyone""
* No accommodation for gender outside of the binary. If your survey has this issue, please add an ""other"" option (doesn't have to be fill-in-the-blank) to your gender question, make that question non-mandatory, or add M/F to a repost with a corrected demographic.
* Questions related only to the United States of America, when this is an international subreddit with an international reach. If your survey has this issue, then please specify in your repost with a corrected demographic that your survey is for USA residents only
* Demographics that aren't audiences. What we mean is your class subject, compensation you're offering, or subheaders to your subject. Your demographic is your audience, and if your post was removed for this reason, then you need a whole new demographic in the title.

With all this in mind, ask yourself ""Who is my audience?"" If you have a specific audience in mind, then that needs to be expressed properly. You can't be asking for ""Everyone"" if your survey is restricted to your country, your state or province, or specific to a binary gender(s). Double check how your survey is framed, and try again.

Please remember that your demographic goes in (Parentheses) at the end of your title.

Examples of this are:
* Public opinion on the quality of Mercedes cars **(everybody who has driven a Mercedes)**
* German opinion on alcohol **(GER 18+)**
* Mental state of US students **(US students 16+)**

If you have any questions, please reply to this message or use the modmail form on the sidebar. Thank you!"	1	False	328	0	False	True

For example the intuitive equation `(fst x, snd x) = x` only holds under strict evaluation. That's what the paper in [that recent thread was about](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/z4tk7u/datacodata_symmetry_and_its_interaction_with/).

Also, personally I don't find pattern matching in let and where expressions intuitive at all. The only way I understand it is through that desugaring. I would find it much more intuitive if `let (x, y) = z in w` would be the same as `case z of (x, y) -&gt; w`.

Why?  Because EVERYONE has faults and nothing is ever perfect when it comes to relationships.  That doesn't mean that they're not the most magical, wonderful person who makes you ridiculously happy(and sometimes angry, let's be honest, the people we love the most piss us off the most) and that you won't adore them the rest of your life.

I never 'dreamed' of my husband.  I don't know what I really ever thought of, but it wasn't an ogre of a DIY guy who has the emotional depth of a thimble.  I can guarantee you every drop in that thimble is dedicated to me and our kids though.  He's an extrovert where I am an introvert, I am sensitive to his boorish, he is challenging to my passive, and he's my entire god damned world and I wouldn't give up a moment of the time we've spent together.  He's my dream person because that's the person I fell in love with, not because I dreamed him up.  Dream people are only real if you allow that person to become your dream."	10	False	184	0	False	True

I was so dumbfounded and told the other two. I'm not sure what the point of that conversation was. It wasn't like it was a huge deal. I thought maybe he was joking or I would be the idiot who didn't listen to his advice because I am not a terrible person.

In all likelihood it is not hyperparathyroid as it’s rather rare, though I try to at least tell as many as I can about it because I’m not certain it’s rare because it’s actually uncommon or if it’s just missed or undiagnosed much of the time. 

I figure that it is better to be aware of it just in case. I am doing very well after my surgery, thank you for asking!

E.g f you had a person in the mob named Alice, the mob won't use that name even if its about another person or place.

Letting her stay with a therapist she feels safe with is something that does you absolutely no harm. But removing her from that therapist can cause her unneeded distress. 

If you disregard her wishes around treating her mental health, you're telling her that you don't see her as trustworthy, and that you don't see her as a person. 

Obviously a 15 year old needs guidance. I'm not saying turn her out to make terrible decisions completely on her own. But this? Is not a bad decision.

At first I wanted to be a game designer (when I was like 10 years old) because video games are awesome. Then my Dad introduced me to computer programming so I could make games of my own (I made some super crappy ones in Visual Basic). As I got older I became more interested in the programming itself, and less so in the video games, and so at that point I decided I'd like to be a programmer. I really fell in love with mathematics in high school, and I guess I realized engineering was a great field where computer knowledge, mathematics, science (which I also enjoy), and creativity all have a role to play. 

My role models and heroes include John Von Neumann, Jiro Horikoshi (at least as depicted in *The Wind Rises*), and Isaac Newton. Von Neumann and Newton are awe inspiring because of how many fields they had expert knowlege in and I'd be happy if I could contribute a tenth of what they did to math and science. Jiro is simply a good example of a flawed but overall virtuous man struggling to create something beautiful, and that movie (*The Wind Rises*) really speaks to me about what it means to be an engineer.

Yes, about 6% of the population of Malaysia is of ethnic Indian origin. There are also pockets of Indian expat and Indian migrant worker populations in some cities.

The perception depends on who you are talking to. Most people are quite nice to Indian people. But some people are horrific. If you're unlucky or careless or not paying attention to what's going on around you, or pick a fight with the wrong person, things can go deathly quickly. Do not expect the police/justice system to protect you, but then again, you wouldn't expect that in India either so just keep your wits about you and things should be okay.

With Misty, May, Dawn and Iris, yes you could understand them just seeing him as a friend, but Serena was the perfect opportunity to actually ship Ash with someone since the writers made it so blatantly obvious that she had a crush on him.

But alas, they didn't do such a thing and instead they made Ash ditch her like he ditched every other companion that's ever travelled with him.

It was also the perfect opportunity to completely reboot the series - after all, the anime turned stale as far back as the Johto arc because the writers never aged the protagonist beyond ten years old, never gave Jessie, James and Meowth any actual character development or purpose beyond being 'the bad guys trying to snatch Ash's Pikachu in every single episode', and spent all of the anime's 25 year history portraying him as an utter moron.

Then again, I wouldn't expect the Pokémon anime writers to know a thing about writing. Their idea of 'switching things up' is having Ash meet a new Pokémon in each episode."	1	False	194	0	False	True

First, because you need to clear the air and stop worrying about what she might think.  Honesty is always the best policy, even when it's painful.  Second, if she has been hurt (and she very likely has), you both probably need each other more than either of you could ever know.  It's so frustrating that there is such a shame aspect to sexual assault that people feel they can't/shouldn't speak up (I'm guilty as well: never been fully raped but have had at least 3 different assaults).  It's quite possible she is keeping a horrible secret burden from all of your friends as well.  Talk with her.  Share your story, and make sure she is okay.

You got better in four months? CONGRATU-HECKIN-LATIONS! Your daughter is not you and her mental struggles (particularly with everything going on in the world right now) are different than yours. I also speak from experience, my mom and I both have things that cause us to have disregulations of our emotions, but they are completely different causes. It took me a long time to get mine even diagnosed because besides some stigmas in the mental health industry with mine, my mother was in complete denial since I wasn’t how she was.

I am slightly concerned that the therapist does not believe in meds. (If it’s just your mis-interpretation of them thinking your daughter can handle this without them, that feels quite a bit better to me) Simply because I know how life-saving they can be if you do need them. Not everyone needs them and that’s WONDERFUL, but some folks do.

Anyway, YTA for making a bunch of assumptions, let your daughter follow her own path to wellness.

The best challenge he can get would be Mew and Mewtwo; they are some of the few Pokemon with true sentience, along with having some of the greatest destructive power and versatility in terms of offense and defense alike. I think if Mewtwo decided to Mega Evolve especially into Y Form, he could take down Kraven. Beyond that there's not much to challenge him.	6	False	91	0	False	False

HC169 is not law but guidance, effectively best practice. You can tell the parts that are legally mandatory because they use language like MUST NOT and in most editions will include the statutory basis for the section of the code. 

Therefore cyclists do have legal right of way, and are not legally required to pull over to let traffic pass.

Edit (after reading other comments in the thread below): the only important thing here is that HC169 is guidance, it has no statutory basis. It is not law and nobody is required to act on it, nor can rely on it being enforced in their favour on the roads. Whether it applies to cyclists or not is immaterial, because compliance with it is entirely voluntary. There is no need for a deeper analysis of the text."	12	False	146	0	False	True

You assume that everyone’s ideal outcome is that this guy approaches a girl and they live happily ever after. But tbh I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: women are largely fine with being left alone. We won’t wither up and die if you stop asking us out, and we don’t really get the majority of our self worth from whether or not a random dude on the street thinks we are pretty. 

Sure some women may like it. But many might also find it rude to interrupt their breakfast or their shopping or their walk with unsolicited interactions. The most respectful thing is to not assume that people will enjoy this until they put themselves in an obviously social place. And even then, it doesn’t have to be an “approach.” You can just start conversations like a human. Follow the normal social rules of the place. 

Ex, you’re at a climbing gym.
Walking up to a girl and saying “mm. Those are great yoga pants.” Or “wow I don’t see many girls climbing hard” =NO!

Noticing a cute girl who is not wearing headphones and seems to be chatting with lots of people is working on the same climb you are and saying “wow great job. I haven’t been able to get that move. Can you tell me more about how you did it?” =sure, but walk away if she doesn’t seem interested in talking, because that is a completely valid and normal response."	4	False	250	0	False	True

I'm not saying that there aren't women out there that put men who tend to be fixers by nature, in the conundrum of hear my problem but don't fix it and hear my problem but theres either no answer or no easy answer. Some women go way overboard, some don't, some are balanced between the two extremes. 

I'm also not saying that you cannot or should not go to your gf or wife with something extremely difficult especially with something as serious as loss of a loved one - or any other significant hardship. 

What I'm saying is that if throughout the entirety of your relationship with this person the only person that you put everything on, all the time ever is the gf or wife, she will be burned out within a few years. Emotional energy is finite, there needs to be a way for her to replenish that so they can be a support without strain which will lead to eventual collapse of that support system

Think of it like a car, it only has one engine that fails or breaks, that's it you're screwed, stranded and stuck. Some planes have two engines one fails not Ideal but you have another to keep you in the air long enough to find a safe space to land. Some planes have four engines one fails that's fine you got three others to keep you going. 

That's why I'm advocating for a support system that's more than one person. Let me clear I'm not saying infidelity or cheating or anything like that I'm speaking to friends and family. It's smart to have your bases covered, partners be they men or women can only sustain the entire emotional weight of the other for a limited time before the system fails if they are the SOLE SUPPORT. 

Women tend to have these supports in place and use them, men however tend to not. It's my understanding that is not socially as acceptable from a societal stand point, it's also my understanding that there are some men who dismiss the idea as being weak or 'gay' or general discomfort opening up or that they don't know how or if they can trust other guys. What I believe is that whatever the reasons are it needs to happen. Guys need to find a way amongst guys to have supported friendships, brotherhood, bromances etc.(pick your poison) that include genuine conversation, support, that guys have a space that they can talk about things that are deeply important to them, where they can experience some relief so they don't have to feel like the worlds on their ass 24/7. Whatever that looks like, how it functions that's upto guys, build the framework in the way it best suits men. BUT in needs to work it needs to meet some of the emotional needs men have. Without this is it any wonder that the rates of suicide for men are so high, along with depression, and strong feelings of loneliness or isolation. 


Speaking to what you mentioned about problems - In my experience when I'm talking to my friends and the things they discuss are situations like the above, more often then not they just want someone to listen to them - meaning I just sit there and listen, I nod and say ahh ok or oh that sucks in the appropriate spaces but I just listen I don't talk more then that and then when they finish up I politely say was that just something you wanted to get off your chest or were you looking for advice, your girl will most likely let you know which. If she snaps at you or says that you should know that's a her problem not a you problem. Women can be more intuitive with emotions but we're not telepathic either, or at least I'm not. So a reasonably well adjusted woman will appreciate you actively listening and being supportive by asking the above. On your side of things you should tell her the way she's coming to you with these problems just stresses you out alot and makes you feel helpless when you're either not allowed or not able to fix things then she needs to hear exactly that from you. Then together you guys talk and ask how can we make this better, what can we both do that gets us the benefit of talking/listening but also leaves you feeling like you helped her and she appreciates you listening. You guys gotta sit down and brainstorm that stuff like they made us do in school. 

I get that the emotional stuff is outside most men's comfort zone but guys have to learn to be kinda fluent in the form of being there if they expect to be able to interact with women. AND that elasticy and fluency absolutely has to go both ways, you're not the first guy to mention the I'm not feeling any particular kind of way so when I say that I get in trouble because women think im lying or something along those lines.

What women and men need to understand each other is get to know how and why both parties act/ react the way they do, however I don't know that a significant number of people put in the time or effort understanding and becoming fluent in the opposites perspective.

Women need to understand how men function, and men need to understand how women function and then apply that understanding when interacting with the opposite sex not just generally but with the specific partner theyre with."	6	False	972	0	False	True

Autism was discovered before Asperger’s so there’s no reason to use that name. We have functioning levels to help people understand needs. I believe people using the label Aspergers (after learning the history) are totally fine with white supremacy and will not even try to learn what white supremacy is and it’s impacts.

I almost went with Acme Relocation. I’m moving from Ohio to Colorado at the end of June and it’s my first time doing a long distance move. I didn’t even know brokers were a thing until I saw the BBB reviews for Acme Relocation. I called them and they also did a rushed inventory and the rep was super pushy and talked over me. I signed the contract with them and gave them my bank info for the “deposit.” Looking back, what was I thinking giving them my bank info because they claimed there was a “huge processing fee for credit cards.” After I called them I called my boyfriend who’s also moving out around the same time I am and he told me to go to the bank and change my bank info immediately. After reading the reviews with him, the panic set in and I managed to get everything moved around so that they couldn’t take the deposit.

After I did all of that, I called them back to say I no longer needed their services and then was bullied by the sales rep for canceling and told that someone from customer service would be calling me. It’s been 3 weeks and I still haven’t heard from them. Based on their reviews and claims, it’s safe to say they’re a scam. I believe they had every intention of taking my deposit and leaving me without movers. 

I ended up going with the Uboxes from Uhaul. A few friends of ours did it and it worked out well for them. So here’s hoping it works! Best of luck on your move!"	1	False	279	0	False	True

If your at home all day doing nothing that's on you and that's just selfish. If you both are working then I can understand but this only sounds well in certain situations. If they are the breadwinner they come home exhausted and just wants to relax and have some self time, cleaning the house should be expected at the bare minimum if you are living off of someone else. And most of the time we are just too tired to listen, our minds are just blank, everything goes in 1 ear and out the other. We literally think about nothing, we just shut our brains down, it's just want men do when exhausted. if you want them to listen or remember, tell them in the morning or on their days off. There's no respect for doing the bare minimum of help so there's no reason to do any major help. You are supposed to encourage the small things so that they do big things.

When watching his interview I looked up the most recent ban because I honestly didn't remember it happening. The story basically went someone brought a particular example to Riot that caught their attention enough to warrant an investigation. That investigation turned up the fact that he's been reported in something like 70% of all his games in the past month and obviously they went back and checked the chat logs for the games and then came to a punishment.

So let's say Riot reached out a month or so prior and was like ""hey you're doing really well, keep it up"" that still falls in line with the ban scenario. It's totally plausible that he was doing well, they weren't active checking in on him and then the report came through that kicked off an investigation. We could probably also assume he'd been reported during the period prior, but wasn't acting in a way that warranted a punishment from Riot (because the logic here is that everyone gets reported for everything).

Outside this, Forg1ven gives the story of him having issues with his behavior and seeing professional help. It was helping him. He was on SK, they did well, he was doing well. As soon as he moved to Gambit and they had their rough streak he admitted to having a really hard time emotionally. Then after a couple weeks of losing, he gets banned for bad behavior he practically admits to for the prior rough period of Gambit.

So just from the interview alone and his own personal story I'd come down on the side of he had behavior problems because he openly admits them to the audience and Thorin. Thorin asked him ""can't you just not type in chat?"" and his answer was basically a long winded no. Maybe I heard it wrong. It was late. The guy is good and driven so I hope he finds success in the scene and a healthy environment to grow as well."	0	False	344	0	False	True

It exists because fanfiction written before AO3 was published on various platforms which were privately owned businesses, all of whom liked to just nuke all the fanfic from orbit when they wanted to go mainstream or if they got a scary letter from a Disney lawyer or something. People would put all their blood sweat and tears into a fanfiction community only for their work to vanish or become unwelcome even though it was their work that drove all the site traffic in the first place. 

Fans immigrated from one site to the next with their fictions and readership, suffering the same sort of fate as the whips of commerce found them yet again. 

AO3 was a response to that, an Archive Of Our Own. That is why people think it's ""the best"" fundamentally. Fans managed to put together the resources to host and run a website for fanfiction, Wikipedia style. 

The situation is a lot more resistant to things like litigation threats from whoever owns the characters that fandom is writing about, and allows the fandom to set its own standards, for example by making it clear that explicit sexual stuff is fine to write, post and read. 

Recently they've worked to receive an influx of Chinese users who are joining the community to escape heavy government censorship. It's the kind of thing you can do when the site is yours as a community, where a private site might just start banning Chinese users to save itself the hassle or worse, to avoid angering Chinese censors because they want access to the Chinese market. AO3 is in a position to ignore the wishes of the PRC and welcome whoever they like.

The site isn't beholden to shareholders and gets funded through donation, not by investors who are itching for it all to be mainstream-friendly so they can get their IPO. 

AO3 is famous for its tagging system, which runs on an army of volunteer taggers who go through the mass of fics putting accurate tags on them, which at least, in theory, makes it much, much easier to sort through the stuff you do and don't want to read. The website won a Hugo award for all its work. 

It's not all golden, and it's not perfect, but it belongs to fandom and there isn't really anything else like it online. Fans have had it a lot worse in the past, and that's why so many people say it's the best."	7	False	446	0	False	True

While they work together closely, sales and marketing are totally different. It's almost like finance and operations. You can't really do both effectively, although some marketing positions have sales elements, ie partner marketing where you can 'sell' your brand to other businesses. These are usually more senior roles though, anything entry level that claims to be both is probably something to stay away from. 

It seems pretty typical for sales careers to start in less than ideal jobs as you can move up pretty quick in sales when you have some experience. Marketing I would look into non-profits, local municipalities, etc. if you're having trouble getting started and stay away from anything that seems shady. Sometimes communications jobs also have overlap with marketing so you could expand your search there if you wish."	1	False	136	0	False	True

I think their multi-stem product alone is worth far more than what the company is being valued at. The stroke market alone is billions/year if they can bring the product to market, and it's in phase 3... so really not that far away. If you look at it in terms of ROI, a $2 Billion (as an example not a suggestion) purchase plus a much smaller amount to bring it across the finish line would likely see a return in 2-3 years, and quite possibly an exponential return by year 3. That's a no brainer to any BP company that wants to acquire the stem cell.

And that's one potential line from a product with a number of positive indicators. I used to work in Pharma (not on the science side). 20 years ago, I was told it was 5-10 years and a half billion to bring a product to market. I'm sure those numbers aren't smaller at this point, but anyone acquiring them won't have to put nearly those resources into it to get it across the finish line and can instead focus on manufacturing, marketing, and selling. Best case, I think you have a few BP companies like Pfizer, Merk, Lilly, etc. trying to buy them out. I could see it going for a few billion in that scenario, since that's what I suspect the drug itself would sell for if they were to go bankrupt and be liquidated, and that money is pocket change to BP.

On the other hand, they have no leverage. I'm sure they'll have bidders, but the bidders certainly won't pay top dollar. If there's only one company looking to acquire them, it will be ugly for shareholders. If multiple, I wouldn't be surprised if the purchase price exceeded their high point in 2020."	8	False	309	0	False	True

But those were my first 2 big waking experience. The reason i got sucked into the new age movement is because i tried to and did astral project after watching some new age channel alt history video that woke me tf back unlike anything prior. I would call that my first mystical waking up experience. 

&gt;This has zero relevence to anything else stated other than you calling me silly or something. Ill go reply to other reponse now.  

From the other comment xd. 

Normally id out my phone dow  by this time but someone is texting me. I actually posted on the con sub from my pc a couple hours ago. My fave speaker uploaded today and i am very content for a while. I have spent so much time down rabbit hole a lot of my time is now spent inside myself inwardly seeking. Unpacking trauma. Getting the feel of all the energy stuff again. The animals i interact with can already feel it again. But more this time than years ago. 

Thjs chain was about AI. I wanted to go into more detail with OP about how AI as a whole is the very backbone of the beast system and it isnt about people loosing jobs i just wanted to start there. I was even going to take it into the egrgore and maybe great cycle conspiracy where great civs of past cycles may have gotton to AI. Without a full convo jt just sounds lala fairy shit id imagine. Hence my little poke about AI always being a thing or something earlier. Buy if a chain goes weird i am always happy to mirror banter for many commments. Some of my best chats started 30 comments down a dumb af comment chain. In which the two of us could never have seen eye to eye before. Kinda like that respect you get for someone after having a fist fight. 

The post i linked is titled see in the dark. https://youtu.be/OvBaZH2L8bg the first few mins are a 2 parables told by the speaker. Give it a peep if you bored. Or maybe peep some of his other work like the narrow gate or no master. He has a very interesting way with words. 

Edit: almost forgot. Yes most consoiracy is system enforced garbage or actual psyop. I am here for the bants, the like minds on new, and to plant seeds in 1st grade truthers. Also debates on shit i disagree with like using emerging AI techs. Which i would normally end on, go get your bread dude. Ill starve. You eat."	4	False	452	2	False	True

My therapist warned me before we started the heavy work that it would be worse before it was better, and she was absolutely correct. You're going over trauma, and processing that comes with immense depression and anxiety. 

On that note, trauma doesn't always take obvious forms. Sometimes comments your parents and teachers make, innocent as you may intend to be, are haunting and hurt. And on that note too, parents are human, and therapy has helped me accept that some (not all) of that hurt they caused was simply their own trauma and I was able to forgive them too. It's so important. Now, 6 years after starting therapy I still go once a month or so (with a sliding scale therapist who's a lot cheaper) just to check in.

It always gave me an insane comedown headache and nasal ache if I snorted it, so I tried smoking it which was bad. But then shooting it. It just escalates to avoid the negative comedown of one form of using it or another. And none of it is a safer way to do it.

Coke now can be cut with fentanyl I hear. Glad I haven't touched the stuff in 15+ years since that near death experience where I almost left Mt body and couldn't walk and had tunnel vision and collapsed trying to get to a payphone. TG someone was with me who got to the payphone.

tahleel marriage, is a practice in which a woman, after being divorced by triple talaq, marries another man, consummates the marriage, and gets divorced again in order to be able to remarry her former husband.

This Case in not Tahleel.

she married him to get children Nothing wrong with that! But she committed Haram by divorcing him without a valid Reason. Soo she won't enter jannah

I know women who looked at having sex with someone no more meaningful than having a date. Such a person has found it easier to discount a sex act as an important thing one way or another may have that attitude for life. It’s just sex.

I have known a couple of happily married men that think this way about sleeping with women as they travel away from home. “It meant nothing to me but a little fun, it had nothing to do with how I feel about my wife. Of course such a betrayal would crush a partner but they think as long as it’s not an affair they won’t be busted. 

For women the likelihood of divorce is higher for those with 9 or more partners prior to marriage. There may be a lot of stuff that goes into that besides besides wanting to bang a lot of guys. 

If you’re a normal single person until 28 without many long term relationships, how do you keep the number lower than 10?

&gt; As the population of green sea turtles rebounds in and around the Florida Keys, cases of fibropapillomatosis have exploded too, filling the corridors of the United States&amp;#039; oldest rescue and rehab facility, known simply as the Turtle Hospital.

&gt; A visit to the Turtle Hospital costs as much as an afternoon at the movie theatre, but offers a glimpse of real veterinary teams as they operate on sick turtles behind a plate glass window.

&gt; He says 75,000 people visited last year alone, fully funding a hospital which currently hosts more than 60 turtles and costs about $1.5 million a year to operate.

A quick check shows that Encor also qualifies as the CCIE written, which also renews the CCNP.... so technically,   we're both right. 

However,  I'll break down my question a bit more....

Encor has an accompanying instructor led course. That course will have a syllabus and associated materials.  No matter where in the world I take this course,  the material should be the same.  Very much like a Big Mac. 

On the old RS, the material used were the official FLG books and the Cisco Learning Labs. Sold by Cisco,   publically available and enables students to save a lot of money doing it on their own.  

My question is relating to how would I follow that syllabus on the new Encor.  It will be the cheapest and fastest way."	2	False	133	0	False	True

I'm on the spectrum, although my spouse is not. My biggest piece of advice is to realize that everything is a learning opportunity. My spouse and I have been dating since the end of 9th grade, almost 11 years, and we still find things that need to be explained to each other. Just keep talking it out and find accommodations for each other. You both may have to work on some of your personal behaviors and reactions, especially if it seems like the other person really can't adapt their way of thinking, because with autism, sometimes you can't. Feel free to let me know if you need help or someone to talk to.	2	False	117	0	False	False

Though the inflation has so far only increased the prices and not the wages. Thousands of locals work in Finland with about 3x the wages of Estonians and then come back after a period to enjoy their vacation.

I'm not sure how welfare works here for the less-earning, people with disabilities, people with kids etc but I like to think that the state provides some sort of a soft landing for the unfortunate.

Housing market is rising to the heavens but only with the prices lol. My rent hasn't been raised for a while, idk if others have it the same. Winters are cold and electricity prices are expected to hit a all-time high this year.

If you do literally any IT, it's easy to find a job, I am told.

I'd say it will be refreshing to move here for a while as many of the problems we locals live with feel interesting and/or foreign to you. I don't suggest learning the language, you'll be fine with English and Russian.

A while back I would've said that Estonia was the best country on the planet and that might've even been the case but with the stagnation of the pandemic, the rise of conservatism, and the shockwaves of the Ukraine war, every month just feels like hoping and coping. I would like to move elsewhere but definitely not Finland or Sweden."	4	False	238	0	False	True

- I didn’t call you a misogynist. Read my post again. I said women might assume you are if you use language like this, because most of the time when a guy says this, it means he lacks some respect for women.

Which you obviously do, with your insistence that I get my opinions from who I “follow” and that I’m here to “flex on social media” instead of being an adult with my own mind and opinions. 

No dude, I responded to you to help you come across as the advocate I thought you were. But again, here you are proving my instincts entirely right. I was trying to help you be better at what you do by pointing out, tactfully I might add, something that you might not be aware of.

But then you had to double down and not only ignore my advice (which other women clearly agree with), but call me egocentric. When you’re the one who wrote two whole diatribes to try to prove yourself correct and put me in my place. The fucking irony.

- “Female” is first and foremost an adjective. An adjective is a word that describes a noun.

The correct noun forms of male and female are man/boy and woman/girl. In case you don’t remember, nouns are words that are people, places, and things.

(This is where you’ll leave this post and go to the dictionary and look up “female” and see that the second definition says “noun,” and come back and say “SEE I WAS RIGHT YOU EGOTISTICAL CUNT.” 

Stop, you’re missing the point. The point is when women hear you talk about “females” as a noun, it feels gross. That’s how you talk about animals, and electrical components. Not women. It makes us feel like you don’t see us fully as people. Especially when you use the proper noun form to refer to men in the same damn sentence. 

You can rage all you want about “female” meaning women AND girls and “male” meaning men AND boys, but this is not how most people typically use these words. And since other people can only see the way you express yourself, and not your intentions, the way your audience uses language is what actually matters if you want to be understood.)

Let’s review:

“Female *leadership*” is the correct context. The word female is describing the type of *leadership* the group focuses on. Leadership is a noun. Female is an adjective.

In the same context, I wouldn’t describe you as a “male” without an accompanying noun, like for example, “*asshole.*”

Incorrect: “The *male* I’m responding to in these comments has some deep-seated problems with women that he’s too much of a pussy to explore, and hides behind the work he does as though it’s the black friend he trots out to prove he isn’t racist.”

Correct: “The *man* replying to me in this thread can’t just take a note from a woman and listen to it, even when she’s describing how WOMEN FEEL. He should probably sit with that for a while and think about what kind of person that makes him.”

Also correct: The male *idiot* (see what I did there? I added a noun to make it work) in this thread doesn’t understand the nuances of language, which probably makes him much more convincing when he’s posing as a tween online.”

Edit: close quotes

Also, apparently, “please call us women” is something dudes aren’t ready to hear. 🙄"	3	False	590	0	False	True

I know that both sport the same aircraft. Agreed too, I assumed it was Ukrainian since the Mig-29 (tho old) is still used by both air forces. I believe in larger quantity in proportion by Ukraine. Theres no data that I could find on if the UAF sent up Su-27s, but I dont think they could afford many. Russia on the other end, very much. So good points.

My theory is that the plane is flying so low as a maneuver. I'm pretty sure no pilot would like to ever fly that low. Especially when in an attack vector for a ground target. I do know Ukranian Manpads and Russian AA systems are up across Ukraine, so flying low is one of the only options unless they have strong confidence in their countermeasure systems. Firing any ground attack weapons that low puts the plane at risk of small arms fire and getting a shot on the target is more challenging too. I think this was a maneuver to evade. I did notice that too tho, one missle exploded while the other didnt which is odd. 

I'm not a pilot, but aviation combat fascinates me. I believe those missiles were infrared and the plane jigged at the end rendering the missiles without any target signature and crashing. That's the terrifying thing about infrared missiles, u have little to no warning they're fired at you. You hope u spot it, pop chaff (flares) and hope the missile finds the heated up flares more tempting than your heat exhaust."	1	False	259	0	False	True

Repent and rejoice. We're a faith of joy.

&gt; I don't have godly sorrow and I tried to come to Christ several times but I damaged my life forever at age 14.

You think you damaged your chances at eternal life because of something you thought about the Holy Spirit when you were a teenager?

Come on, be serious.

&gt;I don't have genuine saving faith or repentance.

Very few Orthodox Christians have that. We go because we're born into it. The saving bit comes later.

You're asking me to get into the head of a senator and speculate as to his reasoning, which I simply cannot do, making your point unfalsifiable.

Whatever the Republicans may be on or not on the record for, the issue of Roe v. Wade should it EVER be brought to the Court for a review will depend on the merits of the arguments.  Personally, I am pro-choice, but even then I recognize that Roe v. Wade lies on shaky constitutional ground.  It was a major error both of the women's rights movement and the LGBT movement to rely so heavily on it.  _Even so_ there's two facts you're completely avoiding.

1. Just because a case relies on an overturned case doesn't mean _it_ gets overruled too.  It becomes easier to challenge later, but there's been so many LGBT decisions since then I highly doubt it'll be overturned entirely.

2. The Supreme Court _does not like_ to overturn its own precedents when it can avoid it, and overturning Roe would create a MASSIVE amount of disruption because so many other, totally unrelated, precedents were set relying on the foundation laid.  You can rest easy on this count: even if Barret, which again I highly doubt, votes against it, Gorsuch almost certainly won't (none of his opinions indicate he would overturn) and Roberts wouldn't, giving you a 5-4 decision and putting the issue to bed for another generation."	9	False	247	0	False	True

Any of the senns that I’ve had were great for hearing footsteps in apex. Especially the 58x. You can hear them from a mile away and can pick them out really easily and determine their direction. Not so great for other games really, kinda boring and not very immersive. They sound really thin and closed in for most games. For hearing footsteps they only really work well in certain games IMOP.

The 4XX would be my most “fun”set of headphones for games. I didn’t find them very comfortable because I have big ears and they were sorta heavy, but I loved the sound. They didn’t sound artificial and had plenty of bass, soundstage, and good imaging to make games really fun and immersive, but as far as footsteps go they weren’t all that great.

The DT990s were very comfortable, open and had nice bass, and great imaging. So basically it has less detailed midrange but great bass and treble detail. Very fun and immersive, and great for hearing directions of things and picking out footsteps. 

4XX is great for both gaming and music, HD58X is best for music and dt990 is best for gaming. They sound nice for music too, but they aren’t nearly as crisp and detailed sounding as the 58x especially with vocals. 

He4xx is a good all around fun headphone but if you purely want competitive gaming, dt990 is the way to go, and maybe 58x for some games. 58x is a great all rounder and it will last you years. All three of these headphones are great options, skip the 599 IMOP. Removable cables on sennys and hifimans are really nice. You’ll probably want an amp for all of these especially the he4xx and dt990. I have a magni 3 I got on close out for 60$.

If I were you, I’d order them all. Try them out for a month and send back the ones you don’t like. It’s the best way to do it because all the shit everyone says on forums or YouTube reviews is completely subjective. A lot of it downright contradicts each other. Sometimes audiophiles are snobby too and you’ll find that they argue over the smallest little details that a new audiophile would never notice nor care about. You might completely disagree with my description of these headphones, it’s worth trying them all because you’ll never be able to determine what you like best based on other people’s opinions. It’s all about what sounds best to you. Everyone’s ears are different and everyone’s preferences are different. On top of that, we all play different games than you and listen to different music. There is never a “best headphone” like there is with graphics cards or monitors, only a best for your certain needs. There is no right or wrong answer. For example I think the dt990s arent as detailed as the hd58x, but you may feel that the dt990s sound much better for the music you listen to.

Good luck in your search and let us know what you go with and what you think. Welcome to the audio community!"	3	False	529	0	False	True

Three physical locations. It’s kinda like the hanger method but much more obvious (granted, takes more space) and will force you to confront reality vs ideas when it comes to what you think you want to wear. 

My suggestion would be, start everything in your  main storage (where it is right now), which will start as location 1. If there are items that you wouldn’t be able to wear in the next three months because they are unseasonable, move them to a designated area to repeat the process with later. 

As you wear an item, move it to location 2 (a clothing rack, if you want). If you hated wearing it, as yourself why? If it’s any reason other than “I liked it but it wasn’t good for this season like I thought”, then consider getting rid of it instead of moving it to location 2. Also, if you loved wearing it, equally take note of why so you can start to learn what aspects work for you. If the item just wasn’t correct for the season, move it to your “out of season” designated area. 

Every day, when you get dressed, you CAN’T pull from location 2. Go back to your location 1 and pull from there.

If you absolutely need something you’ve already worn that’s now in location 2, wear it, then move it to location 3. Items that make it to location 3 will likely become “essentials”, which are the foundational pieces of your wardrobe. Again, try to avoid pulling from location 3 if you can help it, go to location 2. 

Either make your way through every single item in location 1, or figure out why it is that nothing left in location 1 is wearable, and evaluate getting rid of those items. If you have too many items and didn’t get thru them all because the season changed first, that is also valuable information that could help you prioritize what you keep. 

Once you’re done, either move everything back and repeat the process (the more times you’re forced to wear an item, the more realistic you will be about if it truly fits in your life). Or, if you feel confident, make a capsule. If the seasons have changed, swap stuff, and repeat the process."	23	False	430	0	False	True

This is coming from a navy jet mechanic of 13 years so it’s accurate. 

First things first armaments are almost NEVER jettisoned. They are insanely expensive, cause a danger, and you don’t want that tech in enemy hands. Even worse it leaves the aircraft defenseless. What is jettisoned usually in a situation like this is external fuel tanks mounted to hard points. That’s much cheaper and has a huge impact on the total weight and aerodynamics of the jet. 

So what happens in a situation where they do have to jettison their armaments? Not this... you can see this was fired. Note that the missile is ahead of the jet and has a vapor trail, that thing is cooking. 

How do you know it was armed? Maybe this is how they jettison their missiles? NOPE. Believe it or not the pilot doesn’t have the ability to activate their munitions like this. These missiles are armed the second they are launched and it’s purely mechanical. When a missile is launched as it leaves it pulls a pin which arms it. So since it’s been launched, it’s been armed. 

So how do they actually jettison stuff like this? In the rare case it happens (and I mean RARE), there is a charge on the pylon itself. When they jettison these missiles it blows the whole pylon off. At this point the missile doesn’t launch but actually falls to the earth. It doesn’t arm because the pin that gets pulled to arm it goes with it on the pylon.

Not what people told me, overrated and an country of facades. And I know a lot of other people, many of them Swedish who too, are planning or allready have moved to Estonia (/or back to Estonia, in case of Estonians). So if the choice for you comes down to Sweden or Finland, I recommend Finland, just because of the fact that I can’t recommend Sweden.
I am amazed every time I visit Estonia on how much freedom people have, how much nature there is in cities, and how modern most of all it is. Tho I am from Tartu, so I would recommend moving to Tartu or other small towns if moving to Estonia, as I don’t personally like Tallinn. 
The wages are high, above what the state says the average wage is, so don’t fall into the trap of your employer trying to pay you a little bit under the average wage, as he would actually be paying you few hundred Euros less than to an Estonian. 

The language barrier might be hard tho, and in that case Finland migth be better, as you can blend more in with English. As in Estonia you should at least learn Estonian while living there. 

Otherwise, maybe if you have some money over, try traveling, look the web for cheap apartments and so on, and job opportunities. I think they will play an bigger roll, when trying to get your feet of the ground."	4	False	257	0	False	True

It’s the ”main” part of the song, after all. Personally I feel like a lot of songs nowadays have great verses but horrible choruses, which ruins a lot of otherwise good songs for me. I’m probably not going to listen much to a song where I only like the chorus either, but I feel more inclined to give it another shot that way.	6	False	74	0	False	False

You gotta look at the puck sometimes, but this was a bad time for it. The neutral zone, especially at the opponent's blue line, is a big danger zone. Lots of open ice hits happen there.

I can concede many things. It might be cheaper, of good quality and availability (I only have anecdotal evidence of friends that have lived in Canada and the UK to refute that), It might be good for the public at large, It might even be the morally correct thing, etc... and I stated that I'm not fully decided on the issue simply because I haven't researched alternatives to that, or our current and pre-Obama system.  Yet hostility and condescension abound.

What other countries' governments have done has little bearing on what our government (in it's current 2 party state) will do.  I stated this before, but again here we go.  Democrats would have to be the ones to push this through, and democrats won't lower taxes.  Republicans might lower taxes to do it, but they would not want the system.  That is why I think a single payer system in the U.S. would not result in lower taxes, for anyone. (Which many people in the thread were saying).

I enjoyed the one other class I've taken with Erik (the Oktoberfest one) and he was great here too- very jolly!  I enjoyed hearing him say ""booty break"" in English a bunch of times.  As I suspected, I had no trouble following the cues for PZE via subtitles.  I think it would be harder in a regular class.  I will definitely keep an eye out for German PZE classes in the future.

I promise I'm not trying to sell you on ESO...

Apparently there are rare spawns in the game at specific shrine locations that feature a vampire or werewolf which can bite you, unlocking the ability skill line for your character that allows you to train and become that creature. Furthermore, if you advance the skill-line enough, once a week *you* can bite a player and unlock the skill-line for them! 

I found it cool that any class was able to be a vampire or werewolf, as it makes it somewhat realistic. Imagine being a holy templar that stumbles upon the altar, and upon investigation, is bitten by a vampire.

Did a little more research and think I have it figured out. The hard bag version, which is the rocket 3 TOURING, was released in 09 officially, but some were released late in 08 (this has confused me for a while). The rocket 3 CLASSIC TOURER, has soft bags and was basically a classic with bags added and no other changes, and still the 240 rear.  What you have is an 08 rocket 3 touring, not a rocket 3 classic tourer. So yours will have the de-tuned engine and 190 rear tire. Check the size of the actual tire on the bike for confirmation, but I'm pretty sure this is the case. Enjoy the monster man. I have to say I'm envious.

idk about ontologically evil but its a fucking apartheid state that was founded by guerilla fighters and rich (comparatively speaking) refugees on land that was divided up by an imperial power, that had established peace pacts with neighboring villages and then [proceeded to wipe them off the face of the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre), destroying arabic structures and planting pine trees where they once stood to cover up genocide. then they started wars with their neighbors to secure dominance rather than thriving through cooperation and have only dug in their hostile position further, assassinating the leftist movements that could be viewed as sympathetic by the international community and bolstering the religious fundamentalists.

Is this an intentional snub stemming from a sour relationship? If they consistently and deliberately blow you off, you need to mend that relationship.  I do not recommend worsening the relationship by antagonizing them over this. Win a battle, lose a war.

A somewhat related story from my agency job many moons ago when I was a junior person on the team. We had a big national brand client looking for media coverage in a highly competitive consumer magazine (pre-Internet). Getting a mere mention in pubs like this was incredibly difficult and we were trying to get into the pages of a very popular section that is a recap of a lot of news. The client specifically wanted to be mentioned in this section.  

We were able to secure the coverage for a non profit project they did, but the headline of the section failed to mention the client name. In the body of the paragraph, the client name was mentioned twice, and the most important aspects of the project were highlighted. You really couldn't pay for better visibility.  

The client was livid that the name wasn't in the headline section and that's all they cared about, and they insisted we call the magazine and complain to them. My bosses composed a pretty accusatory note to be sent to the magazine editor of the section. I was mortified. They actually sent it, too!  This burned that bridge for good. The magazine never wanted to work with the brand again. 

I was too junior to push back at the time but I did think this was an uncomfortable and inappropriate reaction.  The editor didn't even write the section header, and if you looked at it, they have a tight space to make work and literally could not squeeze one more word into the sentence to make it work.  The client got great coverage in the paragraph itself. 

This was one of the most depressing things in my career because it was my biggest ""media hit"" to date, and it was totally soured over a client with unreasonable expectations. The lesson here that is related is that pissing off a news outlet because they didn't deliver what you wanted is a surefire way to destroy any chance of coverage in the future.  If you want guaranteed coverage, buy an ad."	4	False	399	0	False	True

The Rogue Trader Tyranid aka Protonid, was a limited release model in blisters across multiple continents including Australia. 

A decade ago when I started collecting rt Tyranids and GSC, you saw 2 to 3 Protonids on ebay for a few years running, selling for between $600 &amp; $800 USD each. But that was also when the Oldhammer movement started gaining traction so the rarity basically outstripped demand. It's also why 2 decades ago you could get zoats for $5 to $15 USD each, 10 years ago for $30 to $35 USD but now, in 2021, around the $50 to $60 USD mark, on average.

To your Hunter Slayrrs, I love that on the tails, you've highlighted/painted all the individual bone plates that run along the top from the mid section armour plating all the way to the tip of the tail. Most people file those flat or paint them without highlighting them and miss out on one of the subtle details that adds a lot of charm to the sculpts. Great to see."	2	False	198	0	False	True

Take all of your past messages to the police and file a report. You need to block him on all social media and never ever talk to him again. He is a nightmare, but you are feeding into it by continuing this relationship. If he posts nudes of you without your consent, that is illegal, and it can be reported to the websites and to the police. Just keep reporting everything and cut this guy out of your life.

...11 issues in and not a single issue felt like something I'd want to ever go back and read twice. In contrast, I've read Endgame three times, Court of the Owls four times and Zero Year twice. Those stories were THAT good to me. 

King's first arc was ""ok"" so I gave him the benefit of the doubt but we're on #11 folks. Time to figure something out.

If I keep this on my pull-list it will be strictly because they're just $2.99 an issue and I can likely eBay the entire run down the line for some cash.

I agree, but the wording of the ruling implies that Forg1ven lashed out a lot and I will just take anything they say at face value because Forg1ven didn't deny the allegations in the SI episode.

Lashing out should be a boiling point, not your usual and daily response.

&gt;What makes you even more close minded is the fact that you think everyone who defended forgiven ""wanted to be allowed to be an asshole""

I'm pretty sure that the part where I said ""A ton of comments implied it"" clarifies that while I think that a lot of people think this way, is not everyone. Otherwise I would've used ""everyone"" instead of ""a ton"".

&gt;Those people simply didn't agree with Riot and their ""toxicity"" bullshit that's being thrown around all the time to an extend that it has brainwashed the players and take everything as a bad thing.

Played WoW, CS and SC for years, trust me, people taking everything in a bad way has been the norm when it comes to online play (with huge communities) way before LoL even existed. Try giving someone advice in an online game with a huge community, most of the times you will get insulted and be called an asshole. 

This is not RIOT's fault, for some reason it has always been this way. 

I'm sure you are not trying to say that people are afraid to say anything because they could be punished, because if that was the case SoloQ would be a paradise for me.

Honestly this isn't anything new.   Frankly, we operate in a grey area with regards to things like this.   Immigrants are just way too important to America to start really shoving people out.

I'll provide two examples:

I have an M&amp;P Shield (9mm) that I bought from the very first batch of shipments.  That trigger was atrocious.  I could not group shots within any measurable (I'm talking 3""+) circle even at 7 yards.  I put over 500 rounds through this thing, and couldn't get a clean break without jerking the gun.  Just didn't fucking work.  Apex drop-in trigger, now it's a tack driver.  

I compete IDPA with my 229.  It's a DA/SA setup, and I have a 17lb mainspring that makes the DA pull between 7-8lbs.  I've trained with this horrible habit of having my finger on the trigger as soon as the gun is pointed downrange, that way, as soon as I'm on target: boom.  I can hit a postage stamp at 10 yards, consistently, with that DA pull.

Now, I recently bought an HK USPc, which is DA/SA.  It has a heavier trigger.  I've been shooting that exclusively for the past 2-3 months.  Just a few days ago, I go to the range, and decide to break out the sig and ensure I still have it.  I go through my DA drills, where I start a low ready and make that DA shot as quickly as possible.  It surprised me and fired too soon (safely, downrange, because I'm not a total moron), because I was used to the trigger weight of the HK.  It goes to show what habits can do to you.  

People have carried cocked and locked 1911s for 100 years now, many with 4lb or lighter triggers.  It is up to the individual and how they trained..  "	2	False	284	0	False	True

A big part of the shortage is plants going from packaging in (real) wholesale quantities which supplied places from school cafeterias to large restaurants where that demand went to essentially zero but they weren’t able to just start throwing in retail packages. The real tragedy are many farmers that have seen prices crater. Plants can buy for 50% of what they were paying two months ago and no, don’t expect that savings to be passed on to you. Also, I’m willing to bet that if you gave millennials raw chicken that isn’t boneless chicken breast 50% of them would be disgusted and instead get something delivered by door dash. Fear not, no one will starve to death in this country, by choice anyways. There has already been a ton of spoilage/plow over of fruits and vegetables in this country which is really sad.	-41	False	149	0	False	False

Not only that, the prescription only lasts 30 days and wait lists aren’t that quick. I had a prescription waiting to be filled at a CVS that hadn’t become available at the 30 day mark. My doctor had to call in the prescription again and I was placed at the end of the list once again. 

My suggestion is to try your local hospital, doctors office or small family owned pharmacies. They have had better stock lately. 

You can also ask your doctor for smaller dosages and double or triple it if you’re not on extended release (if you’re taking 10mg, ask for 5mg and you’d take two). It sucks for those on the lower dosages because a lot of people are doing it and now the lower dosages are running low but if you need it you need it."	11	False	165	0	False	True

The majority of the resources will without a doubt be going to SM’s new groups debuting later this year and early 2024. In addition to some of the current groups that already have resources of course, however I think there may be a shift there as well after LSM was finally kicked to the curb earlier this year. It’ll be interesting to see how SM’s priorities change with the implementation of this new SM 3.0 system.	1	False	77	0	False	False

There are a lot of small private companies, but they're not always hiring. You basically have to wait until someone leaves or they expand.

The university will have openings pretty regularly; the pay isn't awesome, but the benefits are phenomenal.

There's tons of freelance work in the area if you're patient and willing to sell your soul.

More and more agencies are popping up, so that is a growing scene, but it's still small. But growing.

If you're looking for a job, give it at least a year to find something.

What I described is additional symptoms, the fatigue is not something I normally have off the medicine, and the mood dip is stronger than just my normal unmediated state, it’s not just me getting used to it over the days that makes it get better (my depression has never rly worked like that lol it doesn’t get better just from being used to it) suddenly cutting off a medication can cause discomfort like that. And like I said “withdrawal” doesn’t imply a dangerous drug, or even an addictive one, you get withdrawal from lots of psychiatric drugs. I don’t think withdrawal should be treated as an indicator of a drug being dangerous or addictive (which btw adderall can be if misused, it’s an amphetamine, that doesn’t make it illegitimate or make people taking it drug addicts) you may personally not experience withdrawal but others do and I personally feel kinda weird abt that being thought of as a taboo thing that indicates something bad about the medicine	2	False	199	0	False	False

ARDS is a US trial as I understand it. I think it would need to be a US company with more FDA experience. Healios is light on cash too apparently. I would think BP could probably get it across the finish line quicker, and they have much deeper pockets to simply throw money at it to get it approved. I simply don't think their pockets are deep enough to give ATHX enough life support, not to mention to push ARDS across the finish line quickly. 

There's no treatment for ARDS, and ARDS is what ultimately kills people who die of Covid. BP could rush that to market and potentially give ATHX some licensing revenue down the road on top of a large enough lifeline to see Masters 2 through to the end. Honestly, that would have been smarter a year or two ago. They likely could have sold it for more, but given that there's no treatment for ARDS presently, it should still have a lot of value to BP."	2	False	181	0	False	True

with Ghost, it's either 1) someone who didn't like the content of the post or 2) personal - someone trying to hit his account.  Since they only targeted the post in one sub, it seems a little more personal but I'm not sure.  I still don't see anything in that post that would go against reddit content policy.

The account is definitely not suspended because you would click on the username and get to the page ""this account is suspended"" with the big gavel.

In terms of wallaby, once your account is suspended from reddit, they (reddit) have your ip address flagged.  So if you want to make a new account, you have to use a vpn religiously for about 3-6 months.  In addition, if you use the same username, and someone is targeting you, it's fairly easy for them to report a ""ban evasion"" and get you repeatedly banned.  I'm a little fuzzy on this though - I think they do it by ip address.  But if you use the same name, it's fairly easy for people to keep reporting you ...

Wait, sorry, ignore that, sometimes I get impulsive. I will check back with you next week after I really mull this over. What is a good day for you? Also, unrelated, but do you like cats? I have 3 cats and they are “purrrfect” lol sorry, just a little cat humor! Anyways, back to business, sorry. The PS5. I will think about this and do some research, and get back to you.

But as far as growing in my faith, that was due mostly to my parents and hanging out with my youth group. After my sophomore year, I had to transfer to public school because my parents just couldn't afford $10, 000 a year anymore, and I feel like I grew up a lot and learned a lot more about life in public school than I would have at Catholic school.	2	False	83	0	False	False

There's an Australian version too but I've heard that it's currently getting shit for editing and frankenbiting too much..... This is a Bachelor show were talking about so that says a lot.

Then there's it's predecessor Bachelor Pad. I remember it as being extremely mean spirited and icky about women but it's been over 100 years since I saw it.

Paradise Hotel was the American predecessor to Love Island and has a ton of spinoffs in other countries. It's a lot more raunchy and drunk (at least the Danish one I've watched). I don't remember much about the old American version but avoid the awful attempt at a revival of it last year. One of the most boring things I've ever seen.

Ex on The Beach US is okay. They've had Georgia, Sam and Nathan from season  4 on. The UK version has become to directed for me.

ITV did a show called Singletown I haven't seen yet but looks like it could be interesting if you like Love Island.
