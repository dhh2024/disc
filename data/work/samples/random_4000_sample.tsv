#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 2000 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 2000 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 1900. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/JackEllis151/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/wiki/index/faq.**

It's pretty much the defining trait of trans people, and from the one genderfluid person I talked to, it sounds like they have something like it as well.

Yes, I experience pretty severe gender dysphoria. Being intersex helps, since I already have an androgynous body, but I still feel bad about some of my sex characteristics.

&gt;It seems intuitive to me that non-binary people would fall into a similar camp as genderfluid people. What are your thoughts on this? Are they simply two labels for the same concept, or do you see a distinct difference between genderfluid and non-binary?

I think most people would view genderfluid as a type of nonbinary.

&gt;What does being non-binary (and to a lesser extent intersex) mean in day to day life? Most legal stuff requires f/m, and most people use sir/ma'am and he/she. Do you simply use the 'male' option given you're AMAB?

Being nonbinary makes me more aware than I'd like to be of how gendered things are. I ask people to use ""they"" pronouns for me, it's taken a while but people are getting used to it. It's not the kind of thing I'd tell someone the first time I introduced myself (unless I were in a specifically queer space). I generally don't like being addressed with male language (like sir, or brother, etc.). Female is slightly better, but it still doesn't fit. Hopefully I can get my legal documents to reflect my being neither, since two people in America have done so already.

&gt;I know for trans people, we associate with the opposite sex. And have interests, mannerisms, and behaviors that typically line up with the sex that matches our gender identity. However, non-binary and intersex stuff doesn't really have something like that. Do you find that you are equally unattracted to typical male and female behaviors? Or do you lean more one way or the other?

My behaviours tend to be a mixed bag. I've never attached gender to a lot of interests and behaviours in the first place, so I typically go with the flow. I don't make a conscious effort to be androgynous with respect to mannerisms, it tends to come naturally, though I do feel self conscious about more masculine things, since I don't want to be read as male.

&gt;And lastly, a couple questions on terminology. I know you mentioned you're asexual, but if you weren't, what would the proper terms be? Heterosexual/homosexual and gay/straight don't really work, do they? And for formal greetings (sir/ma'am) what is the preferred non-binary way of going about this?

Typically we use ""androsexual"" for being attracted to men, and ""gynesexual"" for being attracted to women. For nonbinary people who like other nonbinary people (exclusively or not), we've come up with the term ""diamoric"" but it hasn't caught on yet. Although I'm asexual I still identify as biromantic, so I don't face the issue as much."	1	False

1. You‚Äôre not a doctor or a psychologist, therefore you cannot say your daughter has anxiety or not. Trust the experts.

2. As someone who was diagnosed with depressive anxiety, I‚Äôve had VERY similar symptoms to your daughter. It‚Äôs very likely that she is having anxiety. 

3. Listen to your daughter. If she wants to stay in therapy and says she trust their therapist, listen to her. Changing and starting all over will be prejudicial to her healing process, and it sucks to have to tell your story all over again. Plus it can be really hard onto find someone you can truly trust (speaking from years of experience). 

4. 5 months is not a lot of time to start seeing improvements, and it‚Äôs possible that she might need medication (not saying she will necessarily need it, but it‚Äôs a possibility you have to accept. 

5. Don‚Äôt compare your children. I‚Äôm happy for your son‚Äôs improvement, but each person develops and improves on their own time. Please don‚Äôt compare their journeys and hardships, this will be bad for the both of them. 

Maybe you could benefit from therapy yourself, to better understand your daughters condition, how to deal with it and how to support her through this phase. 
If she gets the appropriate treatment, as recommended per her therapist and/or psychiatrist, she will be able to live a happy and normal life."	1	False

The west isn‚Äôt running out of weaponry either - the US could carry on what we‚Äôre doing indefinitely. The amount of ammunition alone that we‚Äôve donated is just staggering. The problem with western donations is that the majority comes from the US, and we‚Äôre supplying it from the other side of the world. It‚Äôs a whole, very, complex process of getting things to staging points and slowly sneaking it into the country with varied supply routes. The issue is not running out of equipment. That‚Äôs practically impossible. Some of the things we‚Äôve run short on are very precise or new technologies that were never really expected to be used like this. Some thing we may run low on - like artillery Ammo, we have a staggering capacity for production, it‚Äôs a non issue. And lastly when a country says they are ‚Äúout‚Äù of something, it means they hit their level of inventory they need to keep their own military supplied at certain levels.

Also, it may be required by law or by insurance (if it's not private pay) for the therapist to put down some kind of diagnosis and they were being ethical in keeping you informed about their impressions. Secondly, even if you did want to pursue medications, that would mostly likely require your daughter to officially be diagnosed.

Lastly, the therapeutic process takes time and is unique to every individual. You saying she's made no progress could be extremely hurtful to your daughter who probably feels like she's actually made progress. Much therapeutic progress is internal first and takes time to show itself through external changes. This is especially so with adults and teens vs children. You should not be comparing each of your children's therapy journeys. The therapeutic relationship is the largest factor for change in therapy. The fact that your daughter wants to continue and trusts this therapist is literally the most important thing in all of this."	1	False

I was in a narcissistic relationship for 7.5 years. I felt wonderful after leaving him. He kept cheating and thought I should 'help him with his urges' like a 'poor me I can't help myself'

Anyway I start dating a very different wonderful man. Who has faults like everyone but is very kind and empathetic. He also has a lot of life experience with abusive people. So he gets it.

When we first started dating I would get triggered so easily by him. Especially if we argued. My emotions would shut off. I felt no love for him. Because my mind brought me back to being with my ex. It gets better with time. Standing up for myself and saying what I want to say helps. I never had that in the past. 

But mostly time and therapy helps. Also try to remind yourself you are safe now. Grounding techniques help. Writing down the abusive incidents also helps. Painting helped me a lot. Also exercise. For all the panicky adrenaline. 

You are not alone in this. It does get better. Slowly. Like watching a plant grow. In a month, 3 months. The triggers won't be as shocking. Finding a good therapist was key for me as well. Best of luck and I hope this helps &lt;3"	3	False

The film reshaped perceptions of America being trounced to soldiers bravely holding their ground against 'the mob'. The film, of course, also minimised and diminished the role of the UN, which is likely why their role is not much considered in public consciousness.	44	False

Your ultimate goal is to write a poem that's good enough to stand on its own, no explanation required. Unconventional meter and rhyme are fine when done purposefully in a way that works. But you never want your word choice to jar the reader, and it did for me multiple times during this poem - ""did your schtick"" is a good example of this. Poor word choice takes your reader out of the poem; it interrupts the flow you're attempting to create.

And to go back to where I said the cursing feels gratuitous, it's not that I'm offended, it's just that I don't feel most of the profanity adds anything to the poem. Lots of novice writers think peppering their work with profanity adds an element of anger or edginess, but most of the time it just feels forced, like a sixth grader cursing just because he can.  For example, the line ""And like a goddamn idiot, I thought I was in fucking heaven"" would have the same impact and message without the curse words. ""Fucking"" especially doesn't add anything here, it just makes the rhythm of the line really awkward.

It just doesn't feel like you put a lot of thought into this. You may well have, but I didn't get that feeling from reading it."	1	False

Florida man isn‚Äôt really a thing Inside Florida simply because there is no more or less crazy than there is anywhere else it‚Äôs just that Florida has really really excellent and very open public information laws (sunshine laws) including publicly available arrest records the minute somebody gets booked, so it‚Äôs very easy for lazy news companies to write bots to troll those records for funny arrests. most other states arrest records do not become publicly available until after a conviction

On the pedestrian laws there‚Äôs some other weirdness too, such as mirroring pretty much everywhere else in that cyclists travel with traffic and pedestrians travel against traffic when using the road. but different than most other places in that if a sidewalk is available (on either side of the road) pedestrians are required to use that sidewalk and any collision involving a pedestrian on the roadway the pedestrian is at least partially at fault if a sidewalk was available. 

Cyclists operating on the roadway have statutory authority to control the entire lane, Anywhere there is a substandard with Lane which is defined as anything less than 15 feet wide which is basically everywhere outside of actual interstate highways.

But even though cyclists are allowed to control the entire lane they are not allowed to ride more than two abreast so‚Ä¶ If somebody riding by themself is in the middle of the lane there A-OK but, if three people riding together are over as far as they can and only taking up a third of the lane but they‚Äôre riding three wide all three can get a ticket

But then we get to more weirdness, a peloton, group ride, paceline is not considered a single traffic unit like it is in most other states, in Florida each individual cyclist is considered an individual traffic unit. so if half the group enters an intersection under a green light and the light turns red before the rest of the group does, everybody in the back of the group can still get a ticket for running a red light. 

Jaywalking is essentially not a thing in Florida. There is a statute that says pedestrians may not cross a roadway midblock but it also specifically specifies ‚Äúbetween signaled intersections‚Äù and the only time you‚Äôre really going to find intersections with traffic signals adjacent to each other without any other intersecting roadways is in the middle of the densest cities. 

Florida statute also says that every single location where two or more roadways intersect each other crosswalks exist. If they are not painted on the road surface they are considered ‚Äúunmarked crosswalk‚Äù and exist in line with the sidewalks, if sidewalks are also not present then they are considered ‚Äúunmarked crosswalk‚Äù and they exist in line with the edge of the roadways. 

A pedestrian in a crosswalk whether marked or unmarked always has right of way over vehicles unless there is a ‚Äúdo not walk‚Äù pedestrian signal, or the pedestrian ‚Äúleaves a place of safety and enters into the path of the vehicle so close as to make it impossible for the vehicle to avoid a collision‚Äù (basically as long as you don‚Äôt walk right out in front of a car you have the right of way)"	2	False

But to what you said about using all things from rl to in game, I totally agree it'd be busted. That's why they refrained from adding the explosive and incendiary ammos the shotty has irl, among other weapons. It'd be unfun if they added that type of stuff, I agree. But I find the flash ammo fun in squad play &amp; solo. It may need a nerf or rework, but I don't think it ought to be removed from the game. It's a new concept that hasn't been used (to my knowledge) in any relevant shooters, making it interesting and unique for future game play that evolves from it.	-1	False

It's only a security feature in that it secures the sale of new CPUs, instead of allowing them to be upgraded, getting more life for less expense out of a server system and allowing a few dollars to be recouped on the back end for going into systems for small business, far from the data center.  


Small businesses that need a file server or domain controller that they are running in house, don't really care to much about chain of trust. They care about keeping costs down.   


If I could ever get my hands on data center hardware, I would be over the moon, but instead... I'm relegated to buying the least expensive hardware for email servers, file servers and I have to fight tooth and nail to upgrade CAD/CAM workstations every 7 years, even though it's CLEAR that the old hardware is not at all up to the task anymore."	-9	False

Too often I find (professional mechanic) eBay injectors from peoples attempt to rectify problems or even the belief more power can be had using bigger eBay fake injectors common source. I admit I got fooled once. 

Real injectors cost around $100ea new. Salvaging oem injectors from other engines would be leaps and bounds better than eBay cheapies.

It could cost you an engine. I'm currently salvaging a e36. Young man got eBay injectors put in himself. Engine ingested couple pintle caps, as well as extreme over fueling has cylinder/ring seal failures. Low compression now because this car needed an O2 sensor before kid murdered it. 

You can if your clever enough bench flow your injectors to see who is not performing well, and perhaps ""backwash"" them. I have had success when $600 wasn't available for new ones.

I was trying to be polite before, but at this point it's pretty obvious you're just click farming a low-effort video.

1. If you can't have an actual human narrating the video, don't bother. There are too many of these robo-voiced videos on YouTube as it is.  

2. The video content is just a bunch of scenes from Hollywood movies strung together in low-effort fashion. This is another technique that is far too common on youtube these days. If you want to have meaningful visuals, you should be using diagrams to illustrate some of the concepts you're referring to.  

3. Another note on the visuals. At many points in the video, what's being narrated doesn't match what the video is showing. I realize it's YouTube and not YouSlideShow, but continual video distracts from the content. If you want to make a video of every scene from a movie involving a nuclear weapon then do that. Don't just fill visual time with random video.  

4. The grammar in the video's narration could be better. I can understand how that may be a challenge if you're not a native English speaker, but that means you should have a native English-speaker proofread your script or the transcript.  

5. I don't have time to go through the factual and technical errors, but there were a number of them. You need to do more research and have a better understanding of the concepts involved before attempting to provide an ""expert opinion"" on a technical subject like this.  

6. It was fairly obvious when and where you were adding in your own little factoids and recommendation content. For example, if you're using a ditch for shelter from direct effects, it doesn't matter which side of the road the ditch is on. You don't need to come up with original science. In fact, you'll sound more credible if you don't. Presenting existing recommendations in a clear, concise, and accurate fashion is far more important than coming up with your own content. You're clearly not doing cutting-edge WMD research, so don't try to make it sound as though you are."	5	False

The more you practice it the more comfortable you'll be with the mechs in general.

One thing you could do is slow down 90% of the fight, only worry about burn in the ring phase and portal phase. This will let you focus on mechs and adds.

NB are pretty strong single target and less strong in cleave so you may be pushing mechanics while not dealing with adds if your focusing the boss too much.

I'm not sure about the shade wall, but the explosion and giant skeleton are percentage based. So by limiting damage on the main boss you can make sure you're in position for the grapple and only have one giant skeleton at a time.

You can also trigger the skeletons early just to get them out of the way. In each phase you only need to kill the skeleton once and they're gone. 

They come back if you take too long in the portal. Not the end of the world but it will prolong the fight. I'd recommend trying to save an incap for both DPS checks (shade wall and portal) 

You can also save a potion so if you get a DPS check and  don't have an incap ready

Also those alcast builds aren't particularly good. The skills and gear choices aren't what I would pick.

For one thing there's really no reason a NB should be running 2h fb. You already have a class execute and brawlers damage shield isn't strong enough to justify it's use.

There's no twisting path to proc concealed weapon. 

If you swapped to fb dual wield you'd have better stats and could drop mirage. Mirage's buffs could be covered by echoing vigor (which you're already using) and deadly cloak (a damage skill)

You may not have access to RoPo (ring of the pale order mythic) or certain trial sets. If limited by beginner sets there are still better options you could choose.

Something like venomus smite, tzogvins or aegis caller fb and orders wrath body would be preferable to any set up with hundings rage or briarheart (you can make up the healing somewhere else).

The build is just kind of a mess. It's not as important fixing your build as it is executing the mechanics but you're playing with one arm tied behind your back.

For group dps Skinny cheeks builds are the gold standard, though Ninja Pulls will be much more approachable if you're newer to the game. (Eigh1 puppies is somewhere in between).

For solo you can tweak your group pve build. RoPo is best option, but if you don't have it you can just slot a few dot or damage skills with passive healing (structured entropy, blood craze or swallow soul/funnel health) swap twisting path to refreshing path, and be sure to meet your penetration needs and cast a shadow skill at least every 6 seconds for major resolve.

All that being said even with no changes I'm pretty sure you've got this. If you can get the boss down to 5% you can get the boss to zero"	2	False

NYC has a pretty high tax rate compared to most other places. I guess this will also depend on whether your husband has income and how you will file.

After that your highest expense will be rent. Look into the commute to choose what areas are suitable and get a sense of the average rent. Be mindful of the fact that most cheaper apartments will be far from public transit, so finding something in Brooklyn or Queens for x amount may mean little without taking proximity to transit into account. Lots of people need/own cars in NYC for a reason, some combos of bus/train commute can be atrocious especially in bad weather (summer as well as winter).

After that, there‚Äôs metrocard $127, utilities and internet. What utilities will depend on your lease, some people have to pay for gas/heating/hot water and some don‚Äôt, mostly everyone has to pay for their electricity but the cost will vary dramatically depending on what kind of heating your have (electrical or not) and how well insulated your apartment is and what your options are for cooling in the summer months. Sometimes a cheaper rent will be offset by some of these costs too. Search for coned bill in this sub to read about other people‚Äôs experiences (coned is the electric company).

$300-400 on groceries sounds right for one person, are you going to be packing your own lunch? If you buy food around your work area you should probably add at the very least $15-20 per work day.

After that another thing to consider is what are your extra expenses? Haircuts, gym memberships, etc will be probably 3-10x the cost you‚Äôre used to depending where you‚Äôre from, something worth briefly looking up.

Good luck!"	2	False

First thing first, go talk to the ROTC program at your school and take the PT test. To be competitive for either ROTC or OCS, you'll need at least a 280 in the beginning but maxing when you get to OCS. You're 22...you should be outperforming freshman/sophomores. Anyway, the cadre in the ROTC program will tell you a little bit more about the Army life and answer questions as you figure out if it's for you.  They'll also be a huge help if you aren't accepted into OCS or decide to go the masters ROTC route; the LTC at my undergrad helped me to line up point of contact and scholarship packets at several different schools. 

Your next step is to find a recruiter that will put a packet together for you. Your GPA is decent for STEM but a lack of athletics and extracurriculars are not in your favor. Reach back to supervisors at your internships as well as professors on campus that can assist with letters of recommendations. 

Of course recruiters are going to give you a ""good vibe""...they want you to apply to their school.

Also, temper your expectations. Ask your dad how much time he spent at a desk. Above all, Officers are managers of personnel and equipment. Even as a tank platoon leader, you'll spend more time riding a desk than riding a tank especially in a ""fiscally constrained environment"".  "	1	False

Last year in the NBL, Giddey played 28 games (900 mins total). NBA workload is a huge step up from that. For reference, he's already at 1500 minutes. That is going to be a difficult transition for anybody and it makes lots of sense to ease him into that. To make it even more challenging, we're in a brutal stretch right now. Just played 4 games in 6 nights, including a 3 in 4 (3 of which were on the road). And we're about to do that all over again after today's off-day. The all-star break will be huge for everyone on this team, but Giddey especially and it's important to just make sure everyone gets there as healthy as possible. I'd imagine a similar wind-down as they get to the home stretch of the season. We want to make sure he's set up for a productive summer + he'll be well-adjusted for the workload going into future seasons.	1	False

Also, reason why Ogerpon weren't vibing with Kieran because compared to you (MC) Kieran isn't as ""pure"" why she shy'd away, which probably deepens Kieran's ""competitiveness"" towards you.

Did you know that there are people that claim that Putin is a Christian because he supposedly saved a cross necklace out of the embers of the burned down house of his parents. And he still has it and wears it...

[https://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/comment/2022/02/16/essay-on-vladimir-putin](https://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/comment/2022/02/16/essay-on-vladimir-putin)

&gt;However, the story of this little baptismal cross is one which Putin has highlighted on several occasions and figures prominently in a passage from the biography written by Hutchins and Korobko.\[xv\]  
  
The story goes that this baptismal cross was given to Putin by his Christian mother when she had him secretly baptised in the early 1950s and it has apparently been an object of great sentimental value to him ever since. Putin did not wear it while he was an active KGB officer, but he reports that ‚Äúin 1993 when I worked on the Leningrad City Council, I went to Israel as part of an official delegation. Mama gave me my baptismal cross to get it blessed at the Lord‚Äôs Tomb. I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since.‚Äù\[xvi\]  
  
The story takes on a mythical element to it, however, in an account of a fire at the Putin family dacha.\[xvii\] According to the story, the property burned down in the mid‚Äì90s, destroying many of the family‚Äôs key possessions including a good portion of their money. However, the cross survived the fire and was presented back to Putin by one of the firemen.  If the account seems extraordinary it is nonetheless one which has been repeated often. It bears, in fact, a close resemblance to an ancient Russian religious myth in which an icon of St Nicholas was said to be impervious to flame.\[xviii\] Whether or not that connotation is deliberate and the tale of Putin‚Äôs cross is a mythical construct, it is striking that this story is one that forms part of the official narrative on Putin‚Äôs faith. Putin certainly wishes to portray a strong personal faith that is exemplified in these stories.

I recently heard one of the Dutch [Putinverstehers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putinversteher) on national television repeat this claim without any irony too.

Although I don't actually believe Jericho's done with NJPW and I've had a sneaking suspicion he stops Naito from beating Suzuki to set up their eventual match. But maybe instead he attacks again at Dominion instead to set up Naito (c) vs. Jericho at the Cow Palace. Interesting times!"	3	False

And it's relatively new by military tradition standards - popped up in the dress regs in the 90s, iirc, before that Reg F commissioned officers could technically wear DEU/CFs with a white shirt/bowtie (or blouse) just like everybody else. 'Technically' because in reality you were virtually forced to buy one anyway by pressure from your CoC.

There are practical solutions to the logistical challenges you mention. As others have said, look online for used ones you can have tailored (lots of us retired folks still have mess kits in the back of a closet that we'll never wear again). And most businesses that make mess kits will do so based on measurements you send them (diy - it's not hard with a friend's help - or go to any tailor shop), and then they'll ship it to you, you take it to a local tailor for any final adjustments. (Not recommending them specifically, but Andrei has an online ordering process).

Honestly not a hill to die on. Raise the issue, certainly. Nothing changes if no one says anything. Object in writing, outlining your reasons for wanting either an individual exception or recommending the rule be completely scrapped (I personally think mess kits and mess dinners, and even messes themselves, are past their due date in modern society). But they'll almost certainly say no. When that happens, imo, you put your heels together and comply. Military service and 'civil disobedience' aren't the best combination, so I wouldn't put my job on the line for it unless I were looking to get out anyway."	3	False

I used to drink to take the edge off when I was anxious. The thing that people don't realize is that using alcohol regularly even if it's just a small amount has an effect on your body more than just the time you spend drunk. It affects your sleep and your whole body's function. My rule now is I ONLY drink when I'm with friends, because drinking alone is when I would use it as a coping tool.	2	False

I was worried it was gonna come across crooked and be offensive. 

I've been in therapy for a long time and it definitely took a lot of work to get to a place where I was feeling okay about myself and all that. I actually had some pretty severe anger problems and I'd fly off the handle really easily. Unfortunately lost my beloved therapist (he moved), amd recently got a new one and I don't like her for a similar reason you stated. I really don't feel like she hears or sees me like I need her to. Actually in our last session she told me like five times ""you're a mess"" while I was talking about the crap going on in my life. It is a mess but that hurt to hear you know? Anyway, I'm probably going to find a new therapist. The right one is going to be someone you truly look forward to talking to, you shouldn't feel bad when you're talking to your therapist at all. Sometimes it takes a bit of shopping to find the right one, but the good fit exists and you'll find it. 

I'm rooting for you!! I know I'm just a rando redditor, but I want you to know I care. I really really hope you find the inner peace you deserve."	2	False

Either way, I do think since heterosexuality is the norm and people have straight up made homosexuality illegal and people die and get treated horribly for that all the time and it‚Äôs probably not something that‚Äôll stop for the near future, I believe they have all right to hate straight people if they do. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a homosexual in government that‚Äôs fighting to make it illegal. I will agree though. Es users are actually fucking delusional for disagreeing with that post. It‚Äôs literally as the op of this post said, saying that people shouldn‚Äôt hate on anyone regardless of their sexuality, it‚Äôs never simple enough for everyone to conform to that idea but the original post had the right idea.	4	False

He has tankhunter and wrecker to ALL of his own attacks and also grants tank hunter and wrecker to the heavy weapon shots of his attached unit. Doesn't matter what gear you give him, he always buffs in this way.

The forge lord has a much wider range of gear (full access to techmarine gear and most of the consul gear) and usually comes out more expensive than a praevian. He also has to but the cortex controller seperately and I think if you want vorax or castellax he has to buy them as seperate forge org slot, whilst the praevians robots count as part of the praevisns own hq slot. The servoautomata I mentioned though are part of a techmarines loadout, basically toughness 5 meatshields but ones who can get rad missiles. 

If you want mechanicum robots generally the praevian is the most efficient choice. The forge lord is generally brought along for rad debuffs in melee or shooting. I won't go any further as you already state you don't have any books yet and I could be here all day answering the basics.

If you are on the fence about the game it's possible to find pdfs of all the books on various 3rd party websites online. I am not recommending anyone seek these items out nor download them for free to see if 30k is the game for them. I am simply stating that they exist.

Really, these are big decisions in life. If that's the man that you decided to make you pregnant, then you're doing something very wrong. Far far too many people get involved in marriages, relationships, and having kids with the wrong people. Wrap up (gents &amp; ladies).	-8	False

Except for one situation... Health Link.

Any other mob, health link is a benefit. I like to see it, they group up, I can aoe them down pretty quickly.

Mobs that run away? Fuck that. Fuck all of that. Takes so long. Usual tactic is to target them one at a time, stick to them, nuke them down, move on.

When they have health link? Takes FOREVER. Gets so tiresome. I run past coward mobs with health link. Just isn't worth it."	0	True

Flamethrowers are also planned (and for the support role iirc) and those two would make the support role have the ability to support the team with special firepower along with its current ways to support a team, that are more logistical.

Babies are cute, and they are a source of a lot of potentially interesting stories. Abortion is a heavy, depressing topic. So are miscarriages, which are also rarely covered. The simplest explanation why abortion is not covered much in TV, is because people prefer to see babies than think about abortion.

Pickford I'm not sure on really, not saying he's not talented but when you're at a lower table team you can appear better than you are at times. You need a slightly different skill set at a bigger club because you're called into action less and you might have to play the ball more, or be stronger from crosses/high balls. 

I'm not sure how long Cech has left really, he's strong and reliable which is good for us but he kind of reminds of Mertesacker. In the sense, he's a good leader and good positioning and reliable but maybe a bit sluggish. His passing this season too has been fairly woeful, I don't mind him booting the ball out as much but trying to aim for Walcott for a knock on is probably worse than just kicking it out of play.

My wife gets roped into a little family time every other Sunday, but she loves my mom. 

For the show thing, maybe y'all can find something you both like, but my wife has definitely gotten roped into some stuff she didn't care for. I try to be more cognizant of making sure we both like something now because it's not enjoyable for me if she's not into it. (I generally end up picking the shows because she ""doesn't usually watch stuff"" and we only turn on the TV during dinner together.)

I have never once forced myself to go to bed at the same time as my wife. That one seems odd.

Really, the point is to find what's right for you. If this stuff is bothering you, talk about it with her. Who knows if the answers you get to questions on Reddit are legit people with real answers, or 14 year olds trolling. If the two of you can't come to an amicable balance, then maybe this relationship isn't right for you. There are all kinds of people and all kinds of relationships. 

I knew a lady that was married for 40 years and when I asked if she did everything with her husband (while I was with my clingy ex) she said ""Hell no."" and looked at me like I was crazy. Though, now I'm married to someone I \*want\* to do everything with because we enjoy the same things."	2	False

For starters, lets think about our current system. When one gets sick, or hurt, they go to the hospital. At the hospital they get treated, and get charged, and use their insurance to supplement the price. This sounds like an alright system, until one thinks about what could happen within this system, which is what does happen in America. The care that one receives has inelastic demand. Which means, no matter the cost, one will figure out how to pay for it. This leads to hospitals and medical suppliers charging prices that give them 600-1500% profit margins. That's ridiculous. However, there is no one holding medical suppliers responsible here in America, so they can charge whatever price they want, and people will pay it, because they don't want to die or be disabled. These high prices also apply to the healthcare we DO subsidize, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and VA benefits. These ridiculous costs being paid through taxes lead Americans to pay the highest healthcare taxes in the entire world. If we adopted a single payer healthcare system, a 3rd party, the government in most cases, negotiates prices before it is necessary for one to go through whatever procedure they need. Basically, the government figure outs exactly which medical supply companies can provide various medical supplies of the best quality at the lowest prices. This ensures the lowest possible prices for everyone.

In high school, you learn a little bit about a wide variety of fields. A bachelor's degree is about a specific topic, so even though it takes (about) the same amount of time, you know a lot about that topic. A master's degree is even more specialised; for example, you might get a bachelor's degree in sociology but a master's in inequalities and social justice. A PhD is granted for performing original research (though the diploma won't actually be any more specific), so you'll be an expert on an extremely narrow field, like gay men's experience of and resistance against weight and sexual orientation stigma.

My sister is the youngest also. Child-free with no intention of having children, she doesn‚Äôt babysit for me ever. And that‚Äôs ok. It was a thing at first when I was struggling through nursing school after leaving the child‚Äôs father but I came to understand that some people do not feel super comfortable around kids and do not want to be responsible for them. That was completely fine. HOWEVER there was an instance I had an emergency, one not nearly as dire as OP‚Äôs, and of course she agreed to watch him. She plays and interacts with him at family events because, jesus, why wouldn‚Äôt she? My son is still a person and still deserves basic human interaction from his aunt.

This is according to my friend who tried to find a sugar daddy while in Malaysia. They only try to find sugar babies because 1) they are younger and 2) they only wanted sex. Sex should be a normal thing in this situation but the condition is that she will only get paid after sex. Several of the old men try to force her to follow their car even tho the date was just supposed to get to know each other. In the end, she said it's more like prostitution with an added twist rather than an actual sugar daddy sugar baby relationship.	15	False

I just don't see the point of completely closing off the border when Japan is still going to have community transmission for the foreseeable future. With testing and quarantine, imported cases should represent only a tiny fraction of total cases. Sorry to break it to you but subsequent waves will happen no matter how strict border restrictions are unless Japan adopt the zero-tolerance approach / zero-covid, which at this point is not happening. I mean, I would understand your point if the dilemma was open borders vs. Covid-free life. But here you have both border closure and living with COVID, it's really the worst of both worlds.	-1	False

There's a state that exists under those conditions. You can go there if you want to find out what happened to it.

The Puerto Ricans who went to your city didn't go there to receive welfare. Welfare exists in the island of Puerto Rico too so if they just wanted welfare they could have just stayed home. And by going to your city they made a choice to pay federal income taxes, something that they didn't have to do at home. So, why did they go to your state if they had nothing to gain in terms of free money? Because they wanted to live in a state that had the benefit of being an equal in the union because such a state will always provide better opportunities to their residents. They went to your state looking for better jobs. But the fact that they were handicapped with being raised in poverty, with a lack of education, and the fact that they ended up in a place that discriminated against them made many of those opportunities irrelevant to them. And as a result they had to default to the welfare that you say that they went to your state to exploit.

Blaming them for their current situation is not fair at all. They were never given the equality that every other American takes for granted and enjoys."	3	False

Something that is empowering makes you more confident and makes you feel that you are in control of your life:
For me, learning to drive was an empowering experience.

The girlfriend simply had to be a pretend girlfriend and spread her legs every now and then to get that financial help. She didn't put in the work to get through it herself, like so many people have done both before and after her. I'm not faulting her for having done it ‚Äì as I said, I agree with what she did ‚Äì but it wasn't empowering.

On the other hand; going to classes, studying, passing tests, writing essays, getting jobs, putting in the work at those jobs, building her career and business reputation to what it is today, is empowering."	-8	False

sure ask away but if mother chooses not to then you cant force them.

options seem to be tell mother she is wrong. not sure that will help.
or try to convince mother somehow to text, maybe through kindness and compassion. or find a different way to communicate that mother feels comfortable with. or find a way to work outside the home. or move out of home. or learn to deal ""not ignore"" with the constant interruptions and build that skillset that will help for the rest of your life. there will be many times in ops life where they will need to work in a noisy, interrupting environment and wont be able to put on headphones."	1	False

1. I hired another dev who charges twice more. Rate does not matter to me as long as I get HQ work. I gave you the actual reasoning, transparency is key for me.
2. Your work was a paid test project as we've agreed, and also as we've agreed: if I like the quality we'll continue working. So I reserved myself the right to not continue working.
3. Your work was reviewed by 3 people: 1 non technical, me and another technical person. As I was saying in private: I needed HQ work, attention to details. Will not go into details but everyone agreed the attention to details was not good enough for our clients.
4. It was not done in the agreed timeline, and you set the constraint yourself.

Overall: I set the right expectations, I gave you feedback on your work(so you can improve in future), I paid for work I won't use and I left you all 5 star reviews so that does not affect your future projects. What could I have done better if 3 people were not satisfied with your work?

Havubg yeo bosses is ridiculous and if they can't understand that being sick and having to take care of sick little ones means you won't be working at your best, they are an idiot/don't have kids and have no idea how hard it is.

And with your angry boss situation and your untreated ADHD, I hope your husband is going to take on more kid watching so you can focus on catching up at work! It's only fair that he do this.

Ah, I get it. Well, it's good that you were diagnosed. Just know that as a neurological condition, not all brains will react to the different meds the same and it will take a while for you to find that right dose and med but it's worth it in the end. Also know that meds are only 30% of the solution, and 70% is learning coping mechanisms. The meds help give you power on focusing but therapy from an ADHD trained psychiatrist/therapist on how to use that new power is the most impactful.

THEN, a family emergency happens to your brother and all you can think is to say 'no,' which yes, is a complete sentence, but you have to be prepared to reap what you sow. and when the fuck did childfree mean no empathy or supporting others in times of uncertainty and emergency? just imagine if you needed some support during extenuating circumstances, but you won't have support as you've burned all those bridges.

Most people hope for $40k. That can get you a decent one bedroom apartment in the city, and cover other bills if you are smart when your spending. Not much left over for other fun things though. With $60k you'll be golden.

My job is also hard on the body. I got a slipped disk last year from lifting something heavy the wrong way. But we also have WSIB (Workplace Safety and Insurance Board) that paid for me to get physio twice a week for 4 months. I only got that cause it was a very obvious work injury, and not something caused by repetitive strain, and preventable with proper care.

My boss also pays for us to get health benefits. It's not required for employers to do this, but my industry is really lucrative, and landscape companies are always hiring gardeners, to the point where it's hard to find help. So she knows she has to give us incentives to stay. Benefits, vacation pay, and regular raises are all good starts.

The benefits include massages, and I think it works out to about 3 per year. I usually book 2 during the summer, when we are the busiest, and then one near the end of the year. Acupuncture and physio are separate from that, if we also need it. Along with the regular dental, and prescription coverage."	1	False

How can you broad brush the entire country and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs boring and you will be shot for no reason‚Äù. You may think it‚Äôs boring because of your personal experience and the type of person you are and also because it‚Äôs restricted and can‚Äôt do the things you used to do before such as hiking, rivers, beaches, road trips, liming, making new friends, meeting new ppl, exploring the country and it‚Äôs diverse culture, food, spending time with family and friends to name a few. 

Because of our culture we are afforded to have these freedoms we take for granted, it‚Äôs a relaxed and stress free place to live compared to other countries in North America and Europe. You think if leave and go in the States, Canada or England or any other country outside the Caribbean you will have a life as relaxed as we do, and sure there are instances where random people were shot and killed, and as unfortunate as that may be, it‚Äôs not like all citizens choose to live their life in fear. You still have a life to live regardless, just be more vigilant and cautious of where you are going or who you with, and stay away from the hot spot areas and you should be fine.

My opinion and comparison is based off of experience growing up in Trinidad and currently living in the US, and let me tell you living in the US is not all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be as you may think, despite what friends and family may tell you. Cost of living in the US is rising as well (depending on which state you live, it may be cheaper than others) and if you don‚Äôt have family or anyone to help you out financially you‚Äôre basically on your own. Also you have to deal with extreme weather conditions depending on where you live, (hurricanes,tornadoes,snow and hail storms, cold freezing temperatures, flooding) Unless you are prepared to live and deal with conditions like these or you‚Äôve lived and experience the difference in culture and way of life, only then you will truly understand and appreciate life in Trinidad a lot more than most countries."	9	False

I've been through a lot of shit in my life and if it wouldn't for music I wouldn't be alive. Here's a few that always get me, I might edit if I come up with more later.

[Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad-Moby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7mzmfvBAI&amp;list=PLscoPRboebQMPdnJKq3gzALbkb8GPgLDh&amp;index=16)

[Country Feedback-R.E.M.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMazXiv-lg&amp;list=PLscoPRboebQMPdnJKq3gzALbkb8GPgLDh&amp;index=22) (This was the first song I learned on guitar. It's a good one for wallowing in misery.)

[Stoned and Alone-Hank Williams III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp6JfX7HxZ4) (I like how the pedal steel adds an element of hope to the sadness of the song.)

[Waiting 'Round to Die-Townes Van Zandt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4zfEkKs2ZM&amp;list=PLscoPRboebQMPdnJKq3gzALbkb8GPgLDh&amp;index=34)

[Waiting (Phase One)-Porcupine Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4zfEkKs2ZM&amp;list=PLscoPRboebQMPdnJKq3gzALbkb8GPgLDh&amp;index=34) Check these guys out. Steven Wilson is the primary songwriter but his whole band is legit. Criminally underrated. I used to listen to this song growing up in LA as a kid on my way to go work another shift in my dad's cabinet shop, dreaming of someday leaving that hell hole.

[Broken Window Serenade-Whiskey Myers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4zfEkKs2ZM&amp;list=PLscoPRboebQMPdnJKq3gzALbkb8GPgLDh&amp;index=34) Possibly the saddest song I've ever heard. This one always gets me, drunk or sober.

[Nutshell-Alice in Chains (Unplugged MTV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EKi2E9dVY8)\-Layne Staley's last great performance before he diminished into the depths of terminal addiction. I know exactly what he went through. Heroin used to be the most important thing to me in the world. It seems like such a perfect solution to so many problems at the time. RIP

[Radiohead-Daydreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU) Now this one is fucking sad. Thom Yorke (the writer of the song and guy in the video) is looking around for his dead wife (edit: sorry, partner and mother of his two kids.) She died of cancer in 2015; they had been together 23 years.

Whelp, that's all I got for now!

I'd better go get stoned and listen to some reggae to balance out the pity party. I'll check out all the suggestions in this thread as well. I love hearing new music!

Charis y'all.

Edit: Something weird, fun and uplifting for when the waterworks have subsided.

‚Ä¢ dissociative disorders are caused by multiple kinds of trauma, not necessarily ""extreme trauma"". It's more likely that they develop due to *complex* trauma (complex as in cPTSD - sustained trauma over a long period of time, or multiple different kinds of trauma at the same time/in a short time period). 

‚Ä¢ one very important fact about dissociative disorders is that they're a way for the brain to protect itself. The people you may be accusing of faking due to not having trauma *could* have trauma after all, and may just have repressed the memories to the point they don't know they have trauma. That's... Literally one of the reasons why DID forms: so the brain can disassociate from trauma. That is not a reason to accuse someone of faking.

‚Ä¢ medical neglect is a thing. I didn't think I had to say that. Some people may struggle getting a formal diagnosis. Some people may have been unable to go to a decent doctor until adulthood, and so they got diagnosed with DID later than expected. Those are not reasons to accuse someone of faking.

‚Ä¢ it *is* more likely for trans people to be traumatized. It is also more likely for trans people to be autistic - and it's a lot more likely for an autistic person to be traumatized. So yes, you're going to see a lot of trans people with disorders correlated to trauma. So a lot of trans people having a disorder caused by complex trauma during childhood doesn't mean that they're all faking. It means that a lot of trans people went through multiple traumatic situations during their childhood - which is, sadly, true.

But your question does have some caveats that need to be addressed: mainly based on gender, where are you coming from and the culture you are currently a part of and do you have any close and reliable family / friends here. 

Gender is a big deal as it determines the level of personal security you would experience and the types of things you can do by yourself. Mainly if you‚Äôre built like Master Chief John-117 you‚Äôre going to have less of a concern. But if you‚Äôre a woman there are a host of restrictions on what you can do solo and even with the company of a SO. It is a sad and unfortunate truth that there is a serious issue of misogyny and sexism prevalent in some men. Not to point fingers but education and socio-economic realties tend to exacerbate how disturbing the interactions maybe. Not discounting that other men in better circumstances don‚Äôt behave in a similar manner based on positions of power but poverty and education play a major factor. All this to say certain places simply aren‚Äôt safe for women to travel or visit alone.

Culture shock can be, well shocking. Having lived abroad for a while and experiencing a certain level of freedom of movement, the fact that you can‚Äôt just pick up yourself and go for a walk by yourself anywhere and anytime without too much worry can be a bummer. Solo life in Trinidad, if you‚Äôre very introverted can be very lonely. Socialization is a big part of our culture. People who belong to big families or friend circles would never complain about not being able to move around as they are almost never alone and the crew will never have less than 5 people rolling. However, there are some hotspots that you just have not visit unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. This is a blessing and also a curse if you‚Äôre an introvert because as a culture I believe we are very accommodating to everyone. So making friends and overcoming some parts of the culture shock isn‚Äôt much of an issue if you are able to overcome your own insecurities and idiosyncrasies. Once you can get over this living and studying here can be an amazing experience. 

As is almost everywhere around the world it is getting harder economically. If you have the family support to financially weather the current storm that‚Äôs cool. Cost of living is going up but it isn‚Äôt Venezuelan hyper inflation. Normal Trini family life is one of the best support structures you can have. You will always have somewhere to rest your head and a meal to eat. This is the same if you make good friends. Once you pass the vibe check, we will always check for you."	18	False

We finally were on the correct path when we visited the university's photography department. The senior photographer was not optimistic about being able to get the photos back, but after multiple attempts we were successful in quickly copying the photos.  
We were finally able to see them, there‚Äôs lots of photos of sheep, moose, and even some people feeding a black bear cub in what appears to be someone‚Äôs home. The most important of the photos are of the owner, so we can potentially get them their photos back. I plan on going on relevant subs such as r/alaska or r/anchorage to see if anyone may know them. They will be considerably older now.  
  
Here is a collection of the most noteworthy photos

You could emulate the first outfit you linked with floral tights and a sweater dress.

Add [colorful statement necklaces](http://www.charmingcharlie.com/jewelry/statement-necklaces.html) to to neutral colors.

[Colorful](http://www1.macys.com/shop/handbags-accessories/scarves-wraps/Accessories_type,Scarf_type/Scarves%2Band%2BWraps,Lightweight?id=31957&amp;EFCKEY=%7B%22EXPERIMENT%22%3A%5B1922%5D%7D&amp;SEED=-8184559908158303770) [scarves](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=&amp;Category=acc_scarf-gloves&amp;ProductID=1000233700&amp;VariantID=)

Maybe a couple of these $10-20 [floral kimonos](http://www.forever21.com/Search/SearchResult.aspx#brm-search?request_type=search&amp;search_type=keyword&amp;q=FLORAL%20jacket&amp;l=FLORAL%20jacket)?

Basically, what I'm going for here is trying to come up with one or two pieces you could easily pair with your dark neutrals to make an outfit read as full of color without you needing to buy a whole new wardrobe. Scarves and tights are good ways to go because they're often relatively cheap."	4	False

It's completely maddening, but I am a stubborn SOB, and want to complete the manhunt and snag all the GE stars that I can while the event is ongoing. 

This also occurs on my second gaming rig, so it's not anything on my main rig. I've tried different GPU drivers, deleted the DirectX cache, verified game files,  turned off DX12 and run it in DX11... I've done pretty much everything people suggest as a 'fix', but nothing helps. Every so often I don't get a CTD, as the cash is so bad it reboots my PC. Note this is a recent build (Feb 2023 build) running a Ryzen 9 7900x with an Asus B650E-F board and an eVGA 3080 Ultra FTW3 that plays plenty of other games with no crashes or hard locks."	12	False

Period. Even if people did volunteer to sell their battery cycles at a huge loss, it would literally be better if they donated the money value instead towards utility storage because it would result in more storage for the same price.

Utility storage is also superior for grid reliability because it's *always* available and *operators* control it, instead of customers deciding when it will be available. Imagine if Texas had this V2G solution back during the winter blackouts. Customers would have all taken their vehicle off of V2G to power their own home, sorry emergency services and poor elderly people who desperately needed the energy more than the people who could afford EV's in the first place. But if they had 3 days worth of *utility* storage instead (or just **one** more nuclear plant), the blackouts would have been mostly avoided.

But the main reason that this fundamental inferiority of V2G to utility storage matters is because it's being toted as a ""solution"" to the astronomical energy storage requirements needed for a ""100% renewables"" grid, even though it does nothing to reduce the amount of energy storage needed or reduce the price thereof. It's just changing **who** is paying for it while **increasing** the total cost. Germany and California have demonstrated beyond all doubt that the 100% renewables pipe dream is absolutely treacherous to both the economy and the environment. We can't afford to repeat their mistakes, but V2G hype is keeping that dangerous pipe dream alive, drawing attention and resources away from **real** solutions like building more nuclear capacity, adding insulation to old buildings to reduce energy *needs* (which actually pays for itself pretty fast), and adding generators to the thousands of non-powered dams we already have."	2	False

Castro himself at the time was unaware of this as he was too busy trying to defend the Cuban peoples revolution from American Imperialism. In 2010 he personally took responsibility for this and said it was his greatest regret that members of his government committed such acts.

Persecution of gay people wasn't a government mandated policy, but an abuse of power by homophobic people within the Cuban government at the time.

1st: this is not a post saying ""don't use bisko."" Fielding your waifu will always be a perfectly valid choice. What this is saying is IF the goal of the devs was to make bisko really stick around in the meta THEN the only way to do that under the current systems of increasing a given ship's power was to put out a type 2 version of bisko.
2nd: blatantly ignoring historical capability/incapability to arbitrarily give ships strengths they should not have or remove weaknesses they definitely should have sets poor precedents for future game health. Because AL does use ships that actually saw wartime service in history, it should stand to reason that AL puts a reasonable amount of emphasis on portraying the ships that it chooses to release (and just about everything else this can apply to) with a reasonable degree of historical accuracy. You see this all the time, from ship nicknames being adopted as skill names to the reason why we have different equipment instead of ""generic good BB gun."" How things compare to each other, whether that be a ship's capabilities or a weapon system's capabilities, clearly IS reflected in the numbers that the devs give to ships and equipment. KMS ships have bad AA because historically, compared to their Allied counterparts, they had bad AA. Even if you gave bisko a retrofit, I don't want her AA to suddenly be good for no reason. Is anyone complaining that Musashi's AA sucks and therefore she's absolutely unsalvageable? No, she's still #1 BB in the game. So why would bisko need more AA? Her job is not to be a fly swatter. Leave that to the vanguards. 
3rd: what YOU put on YOUR bisko is irrelevant to this conversation. I could make my fusou equip triple 460s and the devs will just look at that and say ""cool."" They can't control what you, the player, decide to kit your ships out with. What they do control is ship stats and efficiencies. And as I said above, what are those stats and efficiencies reflecting? Real life capabilities. I'm not saying that the German 15"" guns are bad guns. They are perfectly modern BB guns for their time period and impressive when you consider that Germany was not in the business of designing ships for a significant period of time following WW1. I am saying that biskoZ powercreeping sushi's damage output is not good, from both a game perspective and a historical one. What does that say about the two H-class ships we have already? Shit design, overrated, go home kid, germans can't design modern ships? And biskoZ is busted because? Pride of the German navy, took 5 battleships to sink her, ""her armor was never penetrated (historically false, please go watch any Drachinifel video on Bismarck)""? 
Others on this post have said enough about story, and I won't claim to be an AL story expert. But from what I know, it makes sense. And as for complaints about the type 2 system, what are the chibi ships? What are the muse ships? What are META ships? If you've been playing long enough, you won't really have had to pull for the chibi ships, but there's no getting away from pulling to obtain muse ships.
Objective lenses. Please try to keep them on if you want meaningful discussion, or go make a meme about it to see how well hot take #87 flies in this community because that will get more eyes on it."	1	False

Also, all he contributes is stating the obvious.  Occasionally he has something interesting to say about growing up with TJ but let's just say it is OBVIOUS scotty is just a family member riding on TJ's coat-tails because he has no fucking talent, is completely unlikable and is the only person who has ever been on the show (guests like Gman included) that has made me consider not watching the show.

Kaya kung gusto mo na wala na yun or ma-lessen significantly, then move out. If it‚Äôs not an option, tulad ng sabi mo, then you‚Äôre tied to the rules of their house. 

As for your relationship and making it work, talking to your parents about it and reassuring them that you‚Äôre trustworthy enough to be able to handle your own relationships might help. Inform them and update them from time to time about your relationship para they also don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre strangers in your personal life . Take note din na magkaiba ang ipaalam sa mag-paalam. 

I was in a long term relationship with a man in his late 20s and he was still living with his parents. He was also still working for his parents.

I remember reading some YouTube comments on a language video where a commenter bemoaned the lack of common diminutives in English.

The comment (written in Russian) was like ""For example how would you translate —Ö–ª–µ–±—á–∏–∫* to English? Or think about that you can call a cat kot, kotik, kotichek, kotyara, kisa, kiska etc""

I hit the auto-translate button for kicks and got ""you can call a cat cat, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty""

\* —Ö–ª–µ–±—á–∏–∫ (hlebchik) is bread (hleb) + a diminutive (chik). So best translation would be ""little bread"" but a lot of nuance is lost (arguably, all of it.) I agree with the commenter that the lack of diminutives can be hard to get used to for ESL speakers. Hell, there are even Redditors who seem to subconsciously realise the benefits of diminutives and invent things like ""doggo"" and ""pupper"" (and dont forget their friendly cousins on /r/doggohate)"	3	False

A few days ago on Mars, while located south of 'Bridger Basin' during mission Sol 1126 (October 07, 2015 UTC) Curiosity Rover acquired four overlapping grey-scale images using its Remote Micro Imager which is part of its Chemistry Camera (RMI-ChemCam). I have have roughly stitched them together into a simple mosaic.

Between acquiring the 4 RMI images Curiosity's ChemCam was acquiring 'passive reflectance spectra' of the  surface materials at those locations, the RMI images will provide geomorphologic context when analyzing the data provided by the spectra.

Basically: Ambient light from the target area is captured by the ChemCam mast mounted lens, this is passed to another unit inside the rovers body by a 6 meter long (19.7 feet) fiber-optic link that connects to a demultiplexer, which splits the light into appropriate spectral ranges suitable for each its 3 on-board spectrometers.

The 3 spectrometers produce a spectrograph which divides the light into its constituent wavelengths, creating a series of peaks on a chart, each peak representing an emission line of the elements present at the target. The spectrographs and images are then sent to earth for detailed analysis.

This is the third time in recent weeks that they have acquired RMI images around that area of Mt Sharp, the passive spectroscopy data acquired could be combined with orbital data already available, to select geologically interesting science targets along the rovers future path. Time will tell.

A pair of right mast camera images were acquired during the same imaging session, but were bayer encoded and then compressed by JPL before being released, I was unable to decoded these effectively.  Therefore in order to provide context, I have highlighted the area covered by the RMI mosaic on the recently published right mast camera mosaic (PIA19912) acquired earlier from a nearby location.  Please note that the colours of that mosaic were adjusted by JPL so that rocks look approximately as they would if they were on Earth, this helps geologists interpret the rocks. This ""white balancing"" adjusts for the lighting on Mars overly compensates for the absence of blue on Mars, making the sky appear light blue and sometimes giving dark, black rocks a blue cast. The sky is not blue during the day on Mars!

The design and engineering, the construction and permits to install EV charging stations is around $7000 per unit. The 1000 EV charging at UBS is a $7 million dollar project if you do the math.

The fact that Jon Ledecky owns the NY Islanders whose home is UBS and is on the Board of Directors of XL needs considering. Pivotal Investment ll which is the SPAC that merged with XL on 12/22/2020 was founded by Jon Ledecky too.

You might expect the unit cost to go even higher than $7000 considering Ledecky is on both ends of the transaction. This doesn‚Äôt even begin to touch the solar panel installation, the battery energy storage and the vehicles for use by the Islanders. 

Saying the 1000 EV installation is small to you doesn‚Äôt really matter. The fact is there has not been an installation this large. This is a game changer for the arena model in a community. Lieweke who owns Oak View and who is building UBS is currently building 5 arenas at the same time and all with environmental thought put into them. The one arena being built in the UK will be the largest in that country."	2	False

Same way people that pirated a game wouldn't pay to play it anyway.

Can a good game last only 2 hours? Sure. Why not? An example? A handcrafted puzzle or adventure, a visual novel, etc, can be amazing experiences even if they last only a couple of hours. The price would have to reflect it for sure, so the game would be quite cheap as well. 

There is no rule a good game must last 50 hours, or have repeated content, etc, right?

The major rules to note: Don't be a jerk. Don't be sexist or racist or homophobic. Don't post or mention any pirate material- this includes the website that rhymes with kiss-seam- at all. Don't post Hentai or Pornography, or anything 'suggestive' in the adult manner. (Includes visual and written works.)

Certain sites are on a blacklist due to being used to spam self-promotion- this includes websites that rhyme with Wetsy, Saidbubble, Winsta-maam and wickblarter-- and similar websites. Overall, we're not your advertising platform! Someone asking 'If you have a place to buy it' doesn't absolve people from following this rule! Small Watermarks on image with your 'Winsta-maam' tag are okay- as not to completely stymie artists.

Also if you post bootlegs, make it clear.

Jets gifted a safety for an incorrect call. The following drive, Jets get gifted a BS horse collar tackle call (it wasn't - even the broadcast was nope) which led to a conversion on 3rd and long and the Jets scored later that drive.

Once, I was visiting a country on the other side of the planet.   I was walking back to my accomodation, and I saw a toddler burst out of his house and run into the middle of the road.  From his grin, it was obvious that he knew he wasn‚Äôt allowed on the road and was Being Naughty.

There was *no one* around.   The street was completely empty except for him and me.   So I, being an adult human, said to him, ‚ÄúYou have to get off the road.   Go back inside your home.‚Äù

He looked at me, then did as he was told.   About five seconds later a truck came barrelling along the road way too fast.   It just about gave me a heart attack because that toddler would have been *flattened* if I‚Äôd hesitated to tell him to get off the road.

There were only a few cards, and it was much easier to know what each of them did and what they couldn't do.  I'd pour over the cards I had looking for advantages and memorizing.

Now those early cards have 10 different evolutions and most of them are crap. But there are almost 8,300 cards overall and there is no way to have them all memorized.  It's just too much.  

I recently have my kids start playing, but I realized there was no way for them to really get caught up.  It's too much work.

Now that PADX is gone, things got even more difficult.  I'm thankful for Ilmina, but it's more difficult to use.  That just means more barriers to people playing.  Even worse, when you search Puzzle Dragons on Google, you get tons of broken links to PADX.  I had to dig to find Ilmina.

It's sort of in the same way that, if a guy you know at the pub had lost his wife, for a while when he came back to the pub you and your mates might avoid mentioning wives in general just so you didn't make him remember and feel sad. Sort of...that, but long term. 

You can still refer to the person, without saying their name - you don't completely shun them off out of existence or anything; you might say 'the landlord' or 'the tall one'. 

It doesn't necessarily last forever, but I don't know enough to know the intricacies of the length and how it's decided amongst different peoples. A year minimum, as far as I know, with some people entirely avoiding all potential mention or imagery for much, much longer (if not permanently).

With regards to it being a word taboo, you're right. The idea is that the spirit of the dead might be called back to play tricks and suchlike."	17	False

My newest is a bigender heterosexual/lesbian komodo dragon named Brutus. I also have a cis male, ace Sabertooth tiger named Thunder I adopted as a fursuit. 

I for one think it's fun to keep multiples, though honestly I find myself using Judith most of the time as I love her design. I finally found a design I can be happy with for a long time. Took me 14 years, but sometimes it just takes a but of time to find the perfect sona...

BTW, I love carnivores, so I tend to have carnivore OCs that I make in to vegans. ;)"	2	False

It needs to be understood in the context of the time and in the media used (typewritten personal letter), it isn't out of line with any other political campaign at the time. It's pretty scary, in 1978 they were still quite open about what they were doing, and had no problem proudly signing letters like this.

When I play, I do the base nin combo, and try to put doton and feint on enemy. Then while I wait for cool down to refresh, I just try to damage the enemy as best as I can with remaining abilities. My knowledge has primarily been from the novice training course in the game on how to play melee dps.

So - I'm not an expert nin, but I can see some problems here.

1) Huton. You want to start every fight by having this active. It lets you use your abilities faster, which in turn will significantly raise your damage.

2) Suiton -&gt; Trick Attack should be a priority for using your ninjitsu. Trick Attack causes the target to take extra damage for 15 seconds, effectively buffing the damage output of your whole party. You should be looking to land this every time trick attack is off cooldown (and then following it up with some of your bigger attacks like Dream within a Dream and Assassinate)

3) Doton is great for fighting several enemies at once, but in a single target scenario consider using Raiton instead. It's 800 potency (vs the 900 of doton, if the target stays in the circle for the whole thing) and one less mudra to cast.

4) You have two base nin combos; one that ends with Aeolian Edge, one that ends with Armor Crush. You want to be using the armor crush one often enough to not loose your huton buff."	11	False

He seems to think the checks and balances were created to prevent progress rather than to keep one branch of government from running roughshod over the others.

Jefferson, whom he suggests would be pleased by this obstructionism, was also is the same person who suggested that a revolution every twenty years would be good for this country. Hardly the statement of a man who believed in slow, incremental changes.

Jefferson also wrote ""I hope we shall take warning from the example and crush in it‚Äôs birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and to bid defiance to the laws of their country."" So I think it fair to suggest that if he were alive today, he would not be calling for slow, incremental changes to undo the slow, incremental changes which gradually destroyed the democracy and replaced it with an oligarchy.

This subreddit no longer uses reddit image uploads. We encourage uploading to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/r/fakemon), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/), a [Pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/) / [Serebii](https://forums.serebii.net/) / [Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/c/fakemon) post, your Twitter/Instagram, or more.

Further help can happen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fakemon/wiki/index#wiki_how_to_upload_images_to_r.2Ffakemon

One additional ask is to also not use Discord links as they are temporary and will not stay online for long.

This change was made due to [admin actions on moderators and users of reddit](https://redd.it/mbmthf). Unfortunately reddit image uploading cannot be turned off at submission time without also blocking uploads to third party image sites.

For fun I watched probe vs Rogue today and up until about 75 workers, probe was basically either ahead or at he same pace. Rogue built 5 more but was in the end at about 60, while probe was at 80.

First, 80 workers to 60 is a significant difference. In actual income, It's the equivalent to a 20% income boost for rogue. (Depending on the perspective. It's 30% more from probes point of view) 
Second,  how many bases matter. Probe was probably on 3 base, while rogue was 4-5. Unless Probe gets a 4th secured, the efficiency of the probes goes downhill quickly as bases start to mine out. Which can lead to rogue having a income advantage on even workers. 

&gt;Protoss has the same ability to max out fast, maybe about 0.5 - 1 min later, but as said, chronoboost helps with the first 3 bases and protoss gets their tech buildings earlier usually. While zerg has to basically *just* drone for the first 7-8 minutes, he ***can't build army units***, because all larvae goes into workers.

This realistically isn't true. Protoss would have to go mass gateway for this to happen, which simply isn't a good style as it loses pretty hard. 

&gt;Given a goal like 70-80 workers, protoss won't be far behind, because he can start building army while also keep building probes. Assuming that would be a general 4base saturation, depending on the tech choice, Zerg needs to have built *at least* about 18-22 more workers than protoss, simply because for each building a drone will be consumed.


18-22 is extremely generous. 3 for bases, 4 for spores, and 7 for tech builds (spawning pool, roach Warren, bane nest, and spire/Hydra den double evo) is all they need, which is 14 workers. 


&gt;Nexi aren't particularly expensive, so protoss could also build like 1-2 additional ones, once he starts floating minerals to have more chronoboosts available.

Horrible idea. Wtf?

&gt;Keep in mind that Protoss doesn't need the same amount of workers because Protoss army units are much more cost efficient than Zerg's.

That is the going theory. 


&gt;Not sure if they had exactly this in mind, but zerg was definitely designed to be less cost efficient, therefore they need a better economy. A slightly better zerg economy means its about equally good economy as Protoss/Terran, because those have more cost efficient units and don't completely rely on a huge economy.

Slightly better and 20-30% better are not the same."	1	False

How long have people complained about how toxic an experience the challenger and now master tier is? If you deliberately feed, threaten to afk, or otherwise try to ruin the game for your team you get a warning or two, maybe a personal notice from a Riot employee as a last resort, and then you get your account deleted and whatever email you used is barred from making new accounts. If that makes you quit, then nothing of value was lost, if you make a new account either your learned your lesson or it's just a matter of time until you get banned again. In general flaming is a symptom of bigger problems and that goes double for pros, and so it should be treated as such.

Then we lived a year in England when I was 5 yo, and I returned speaking like a proper little bloke in English, while barely speaking Spanish.

Returning to Mexico, I was the most bilingual of my siblings. We went to the American School in Mexico City, where all the kids spoke code-switching _within_ sentences.

In formal situations we stuck to one language or another, as we were taught to. Nevertheless, in informal conversations we tended to use the word or phrase in the language that best suited the intended meaning, embedded in the language's grammar that best suited the intended meaning.

This made for a very quirky, information- and nuance-rich version of Spanglish. It was pretty bewildering for those listening and not accustomed to it. My siblings and I would sometimes do it for fun when with non-Spanglish-bilingual friends.

Now in my 50s, and a long time away from others that spoke that way, I don't code-switch as much in conversation, but I still have that internal fluency."	1	False

The investigation is pretty much the same as the initial.  be aware that they do have access to your prior investigation files, so that you may have something come up in an interview that you consider old news.

Keeping the content posted here up to a certain standard has been very important for building up our member count, I've been observing many other music subs I've noticed that many of the ones that struggle to attract active users are usually filled with more self-promo than relevant scene-large releases and news. Many of the self-promo spammers we try to avoid are the types of users that never engage in the community outside of promoting their own content, these are not the types of users we want to attract as they are looking to only use our community in a selfish manner. I've personally tried to reach out to many of the excellent and active members of our community, much like yourself u/ed_music, to allow them to promote their art here. I believe when members are acting in good faith to be a part of our community that they should be welcomed to be supported by the community as well. I can certainly do better/be more effective in my outreach to the other artists in this community by keeping current with a weekly mixtapes thread where all of our fellow artists can make their presence known and connect with each other.	7	False

The reason there aren't enough good and novel discussions is because people aren't making enough of them. If we want more of that, we have to make and support it. It's easier to post a funny picture or make a sarcastic joke or pun than it is to come up with a meaningful topic for discussion, and so that's what ends up making up the bulk of the content."	0	False

Arrowhead and a Stab. MW to make hitting all shots of a burst more reliable at max. dmg falloff ranges. Rapidfire frames have 9 shots, so if you're missing one of those you're instantly missing out on your 20% from controlled burst for your next shot.

Accelerated Coils to speed up the charge; I crafted mine with Overflow, so having 88% of my total ammo in a mag is enough for me and I'm not going with a charge time MW. Also IMO a double charge time reduction isn't necessary if you're going for dmg and not relying on something like a quick freeze from chillclip on other fusions.

As said before, Overflow is the play for me. Major shredding, backup boss DPS, autoloading on any ammo pickup; I just dig it a lot more than Slice.

For instance, in a randomised experimental study among young men in Denmark, exposure to (nonviolent) pornography led to less egalitarian attitudes and higher levels of hostile sexism. And in a longitudinal study among US adolescents, increased use of pornography predicted more sexist attitudes for girls two years later.‚Äù

https://theconversation.com/amp/pornography-has-deeply-troubling-effects-on-young-people-but-there-are-ways-we-can-minimise-the-harm-127319

Just one example.

It is evident the effects porn has and is having. Literally just common sense. And the ones who mostly bear the consequences? Women.
So of course it‚Äôs usually men trying to deny it. Ignorance.
Although it does effect men too. Impotence/struggling to achieve orgasm/erection with real women and dissatisfaction in sexual life just one example of how it does.

I‚Äôm done now. Trying to explain to men that are desperate to defend porn that as women, we very obviously understand and even experience the negative effects of the vile misogynistic mainstream porn industry is exhausting, when you try to patronise us by telling us it‚Äôs just a bogey man.

Whatever. Watch your porn. You just cannot convince me and many other women that it‚Äôs harmless. We know the deal. It‚Äôs a fucking vile industry and vile mentalities towards women are being preached because of it. But I guess that doesn‚Äôt concern you, cause who cares about misogyny when you can just binge watch misogynistic porn, right?
Also telling me that personal anecdotes don‚Äôt count is also incredibly ignorant. These aren‚Äôt just isolated events. Trying to dumb it down as ‚Äúpersonal anecdotes‚Äù is ridiculous.
These are the collected, constant experiences of women. The constant, relentless misogynistic porn content on this very website and the users on it expressing those views. Hundreds and thousands - probably combined, millions.
And that‚Äôs just on *this* website alone.

So no, it‚Äôs not just a few ‚Äúpersonal anecdotes‚Äù.

But anything to defend porn, right? Oh mighty porn. üôÑ 
It‚Äôs a male dominated industry, both produced and its‚Äô audience. Of course there are male centric opinions regarding it.
But the damaging effects are obvious, beyond all that defence and bias.

Like I said, I‚Äôm done. I tried. But you‚Äôre determined to dismiss me and many other women.
Won‚Äôt be saying anymore on the matter because I should not have to try this hard just to get one unbiased opinion from you where you consider womens‚Äô perspectives for *once*. Exhausting and disappointing."	1	False

One of them was the hotel person's brother who just left them and joined because (like Chris thought) he was joining the winning team. So the supermarket group could've been made up of a lot of noobs who thought they were tough and powerful.

And when they got run over in La Colonia, it did look stupid. But perhaps this emphasizes how undisciplined they are. They have a simple rank system (big leader, everyone down below) but had no experience or proven method when dealing with a *huge* group of zombies that could quickly encircle them, since they were always tucked away safely in that supermarket.

Rick and his team look like they had a system. Even the way they stand back to back and hold knives in preparation makes them look efficient and smarter. 

Cartel group just does random shooting with no strategy from the leader besides ""Stay close!"" Why not lure them to a choking point? Find taller ground? Or actually secure the perimeter 100% before celebrating? The leader was cruel and remorseless, but that doesn't necessarily make him effective and smart as a leader. When he freaked out, all his men freaked out. 

I have no explanation for the one who died on the road reloading his gun. That was just stupid. Maybe he was stupid-high on oxy and had trouble judging time."	7	False

""Woman"" is a label that refers to roughly half of the human population, the female half. There are countless differences between the two sexes in humans, a clear one being that males commit 97% of all violent crimes. This is a statistic that is used all the time to safeguard women and girls. 

Many people see the term women or female as being something a human can identify into or out of. It's actually just your recorded sex. Adult female human. Where often its an adult human male claiming to be female- an error.

 I say this as a bisexual person who enjoys to wear traditionally female clothing and fashion in public. I do not think that this, nor ANY potential feelings or theories about myself that i come up with, could change my biological sex that was determined in the womb before my memories even formed. There is no way that i could ""feel like a woman"" or know what ""feeling like a woman"" could feel like. Womanhood is not a fucking feeling or result of your personal feelings in life. Half of earths population knows what it feels like, and the other half will never know. Accepting this is very healthy and productive."	-1	False

All the complaints about how slow it was and how nothing happens and the plot meanders was leading to this. 

Everything's finally tying together and the slower stuff before means that it can explode now. I felt tense, and a little sick, throughout the entire thing (even though that Instagram account wrecked the big reveals), something I haven't had since Threadson and Lana in series 2.

It seems that for many men, just seeing their partner shirtless/naked/in form fitting clothes/in a sexy pose is enough to get them aroused (hard) and dripping with the natural lubrication. Why does that not work for women? Are men that much less attractive to women in general?

I personally think that due to the amount of suppressing and shaming of sexuality in women and girls during formative years it results in them being completely out of touch with their sexual side. Just as many men struggle to get in touch with their emotions (suppressed due to toxic masculinity), so do many women struggle to get in touch with their sexuality and express it freely and comfortably. 

I don't think men getting aroused just by seeing their SO's boobs somehow makes men ""broken"" or ""primitive"". In fact, I think it's completely natural for humans to be sexual beings. The fact that so many women seem to lack that wild and free sexuality is unfortunate. Why shouldn't a woman get aroused/moist seeing her partner shirtless and stretching? I would really like to hear women's take on this."	4	False

You‚Äôre socially awkward, an over thinker and seem a bit paranoid when it comes to meeting/interacting with people that it gives you anxiety while doing so. Its not necessarily a bad thing but it CAN prevent you from growing as person and acknowledging the good in her/people in general. I won‚Äôt say jump out the window and tell her ‚Äúlisten bitch I‚Äôm not interested‚Äù, because you may interpret her actions differently than how she‚Äôs coming off. But this is where communication comes into play. It‚Äôs not what you say, but how you say it. If you strongly believe she‚Äôs into you and you don‚Äôt the feel same way, address it with her. Tell her you‚Äôre not in that headspace to consider anything more than a friendship with her, and that you‚Äôre bringing this to her attention because you noticed (X,Y &amp;Z ) behavior on her end, and although you‚Äôre flattered , you don‚Äôt want to mislead her emotionally and mentally.

Trump can say whatever he wants, the fact is he offered to let Kasich (sp?) take care of foreign and domestic policy while he focused on ""making America great again"" translation: ""bullshitting""

Kasich turned him down and Pence took him up on the offer.

Pence is part of the American Taliban.

I'd rather have Democrats who at least pretend to care about our rights in office instead of the people Bush had who were busy shoving protesters in cages and shitting on civil liberties.

I don't know where you are in terms of growth but lowing your amounts of E might actually make your breasts larger. Most MtFs seem to believe that higher amounts of E/AA's make breasts larger. We did a long forum on DIY yesterday and most of the learned folks said that lower and very small amounts of estrogen are very likely to increase breast size, not diminish them. People using injections seemed to have far more complaints than folks on the patch or oral E about poor breast growth, shrinkage and conical boobs.

Piecing together what you say, I doubt that you have any worries about losing the little bit that you have.

Much is anecdotal but I believe that until you reach the point of no return, your breasts will diminish if you completely go off hormones for a few months especially if you lose the weight that statistically most of us put on due to HRT. That was my experience. What's the point of no return? Probably a B or C cup. Very, very few MtFs make it above an A cup. That's why every other question on AskMtFHRT is about poor breast development. Plus our chests are broader making the apparent size of our breasts look smaller when clothed.

Being non-binary, I have gone on and off HRT the last seven years and I tried to be only male for a couple of years and lost a ton of weight and lost most of my breast tissue. When I started back though, I had rapid and essentially cis-female growth and I am now much larger and past the point of no return. I have lost 35 pounds and my breasts have not shrunk and look much larger on a petite frame so I am past the point of no return.

I would worry more about losing the uncanny anti-ageing effects of HRT which essentially everyone experiences and the improvements in fixative thoughts from being a cis-male ruled by T. You don't mention your beard but no one will think anything about you seeming effeminate if you still have your beard since cis-females do not have beards. It is the number one thing that people notice by far.

Since I continue to be in a similar position, I am going to continue on low dose E to maintain results and continue with my beard removal which is pretty complete while gradually butching things up, as Chandler Bing used to call it. I still believe that marital vows are important promises and requested if necessary a Catholic divorce but my ex finds me ""icky"" now. Depending on time on HRT, you are likely to be more attractive now regardless of how you present. Except for guys who are ""ruggedly"" handsome all adult cis-males are more attractive after beard removal regardless of presentation.

When I asked a very similar question to yours last week seeking help from others in our community, I got answers very similar. But when I looked through them, in actuality they mostly said the same thing. Wives do not like husbands who cross-dress or openly transition. This is your marriage and no one else's and you will live the consequences. Many, many MtFs end up isolated and living alone as we age and in terms of community, that differs for all of us. MtFs are incredibly diverse and I have found essentially no one similar to me. Younger MtFs are growing up in a different environment so hopefully being isolated will become more of a thing from the past.

I am also a lawyer and especially non-binary, non-passing females are gaslighted still for showing up in dresses one day, and men's suits the next. There is also a not so subtle feeling that persists regarding: ""how could you do this to yourself intentionally?"" None of it is legal or humane or right but stamping my feet has not helped one iota with my custody matter.

Gays and lesbians appear to rarely face substantial discrimination any longer at least in metropolitan areas. We know what the difference is? They don't look any different from other folks of their gender and many of them are gainfully employed without any issues and most dress in conformance with their cis-gender.

There are two kinds of stealth, continuing to present as male, which is easy for most of us, although I am getting closer to the point of no return regarding that. The other stealth requires being able to pass as cis-female, in voice, dress and looks and the more attractive one is, the better one's chances not to end up alone and to have success in earning a living. I know that no one likes to hear this. I hoped my wife would sing kumbaya to me but this is life and reality and even though she claims that she does not hold my gender change against me, the timing of the divorce and the intervention she held indicate to me, that she holds it against me very much and thinks that I am ""off"".

If you are hard-wired as a female, that complicates things a great deal but generally wives and family know if we seem and I mean this as a goal of mine, ""effeminate"". Being androcentric might mean that in terms of consort, marriage might not work for those of us preferring cis-males, but I try to encourage folks on the fence to stay cis and in their marriages or with good friendships with the wife. I blew all of these because I thought since we had a transgender pastor, my ex would accommodate me. She has not.

I try to help people who desperately need to pass for their dysphoria or find different fulfilling approaches that work for their families because while we hear about de-transitioning, we rarely hear about regret regarding wife and children and that incredibly important aspect. Transitioning after several years of marriage or with minor children is incredibly disruptive. It just is. I thought that we would be two mommies united as co-parents. Nope. Some females are willing to do that but our transitioning to them, is a subtle or not so subtle implication that our wives failed to keep us happy and that our wives weren't attractive to us. It doesn't matter what we think as former cis-males. We are also putting ourselves into competition as to who is prettier as a female, the former husband or the former wife. Women don't like that either because to them, it is encroaching on their turf in terms of psychological impact.

Anything that I can do to help you or others, and we are many, please let me know. May the Goddess keep you and bless you regardless of your decision."	2	False

Yeah, I agree that you shouldn't fix anything when somebody is venting.

So you think venting about things I did is normal then rather than discuss them? I always try to validate her anyways, but I guess I've not been doing a very good job at it. I usually try to take her perspective and tell her I understand xyz, but she has been really hung up on how I phrase things in general. That is to say she wants me to not say I understand her as a statement, but to phrase it as a question.

i.e. ""I understand that you have xyz and that makes complete sense and I'll try to do better""

Do you really want a piano-like experience or do you just need the 88 keys to have an  ""unlimited""  playing space for two-handed playing, split sound setups etc ?

If you are looking for the first I can only give you one advice :

Go to a/several shop(s) and try them out.

There's a big difference in the feeling/response of each of these keyboards, and personal preference plays a serious role in this.

As an example (I think you can have similar experiences with other brands, depending on your own background and preference) :

I made a mistake of buying the latest NI 88 (mk2) keyboard without first testing it. This is supposed to be an excellent keyboard !

But for me it was an absolute disaster : it was way too heavy to play, and my hands/ arms would become physically tired after a while.

I  had a Kurzweil and Roland before, and while the Kurzweil wasn't exactly light, it still was a lot easier to play on then the NI. 

For the ultimate comparison : I own a real (acoustic) Yamaha C3 grand piano and I can play that thing for hours without feeling fatigue. Same thing for the several Steinway B's I had the chance to play one : no fatigue.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't buy from reviews or specs (there useful for features), get your hands on them !

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your search :)"	3	False

I understand that my issues seem very minor. But I'm a hypochondriac and very worried I might have scleroderma due to other issues I've been dealing with. I've had petechiae mostly on my legs for years. Sometimes they show up on my arms, in my mouth, on my fingers or around my eyes. But not many of them. Only my legs are very dotty. I have this unexplained pain in my body, arms and legs, which could be fibromyalgia and caused by the excessive stress from my mental illnesses but it's hard for me to believe that there is no physical reason for them. Sometimes, like right now, my stomach gets upset and I have some sort of acis reflux for a dew days which usually goes away after taking helicid and some gastric drops. I have sore throat all the time. Weird tingly sensations in extremities. My vision gets blurry, have almost constant tension headache.. And I could probably go on naming many more things that worry me about my body. I've been diagnosed with focal epilepsy at 9 years old but haven't had a seizure since I was 12. Now I'm 21. Im still taking levetiracetam (an antiepileptic) because of the anxiety from getting another seizure. I've had basic bloodwork done multiple times and only had a little neutropenia for whatever reason. Have had a brain mri done for ms but came back normal. Recently I started tianeptine for anxiety from my psychiatrist and later I went back on isotretinoin (accutane) for my acne after the summer break managed by my dermatologist. I'm also taking b-complex, omega-3, these hair vitamins (no vitamin A in them, I'm very careful with my supplements) because another one of my symptoms has been severe hairloss. And I'm taking a corticosteroid nose spray from my otorhinolaryngologist. Also I'm a female. A veterinary student with loads of mental issues as you can probably tell. I'll hopefully get to my derm for bloodwork after I finish this month of accutane so I might ask her to also do the tests for stuff like scleroderma and general bloodcount, not only the liver emzymes. But I don't know if I will be able to ask because of the anxiety. I just really don't want the doctors to find my issues irrelevant just because I run to them with everything and therefore I struggle to tell them stuff more and more with each visit. Also the reason why I believe I could have scleroderma without the major skin manifestations is because of the accutane. I've read that it was experimentally used for treating this disease and what it did was ease the skin symptoms with no effect on the internal organ demage. So I'm super scared that the disease is hidden on the inside where no one can properly see it and that once we do find it it might be too late and that I'm gonna die with complications before I ever have a real, possibly anxiety-free and happy life. So why I'm writing here is basically because I want to hear that I'm not gonna die that soon I guess. I'm so sorry for sounding stupid.	1	False

Me anote a una licenciatura en Biolog√≠a que al final termine abandonando.

La facultad en la que se da la carrera es bastante poco conocida, entonces, por lo general, los primeros dias, nadie conoce a nadie.

Eso hace que puedas conocer gente muuy rapido si te animas a hablarle a la gente que esta sola,

Entonces, hice muchos amigos los primeros dias, que despues duraron durante el a√±o.

Cuestion, que termine estando con varias de mis compa√±eras de clase y disfrutamos pila de todo,

Un dia, con una compa√±era con la que tenia ""Algo casual"", queria ver la puesta del sol y decidimos subir a la azotea de la facultad

Iba a una facultad que tenia muchos pisos, pero la puerta de la azotea siempre estaba cerrada. 

El truco estaba en que todos los pisos tienen una puerta ""mata fuego"" que da a la escalera de incendio que conectan a la azotea. Entonces, ibas hasta el ultimo piso y de ah√≠ sub√≠s a la azotea por medio de la escalera de incendio. 

Cuestion, la puerta de incendio solo se puede abrir por adentro... No sabiamos...

Quedamos a las 7 de la tarde, encerrados en plena azotea de una facultad en pleno malvin norte... 

Es bastante privada, no se como, se dio que tuvimos sexo en la azotea de la faculta (Esta fue mi segunda vez ""sexual"")"	4	False

I am now 17 days clean and rarely cut myself anymore. I personally find hyperfixating and leaning about a topic you enjoy very helpful and a great way to distract myself. Even tho recently i've been going through a tough breakup these past days i have still managed  to keep myself from cutting. My parrents personally reacted pretty badly when they found out (june 2023) that i was harming myself. I feel like they felt betrayed that i didnt tell them or even gave them hints that i was in a very bad mental state that made me take it out on myself.

I never said anything about the men needing a platform of support or that it is a huge problem or anything like that. Just stating the fact that misandrists exist. That is all. Nothing more, nothing less. Nothing about those men needing help or are opressed or anything like that. Because they don't and they aren't. I'm on your side here with everything else you are saying i am just disagreeing with the part about misandry because those women are on this earth somewhere. And just like a racist African-American, it makes sense why they are that way, at least from a historical perspective and I do not blame them for feeling that way. Same with the misandry. If I was opressed and have been fighting it in the system since at least 1848, not being able to vote until 1920, etc. I would hate the people that did that too. I see where they are coming from, at least as much as I can with my limited perspective. Also when I say ""misandry"" i am talking about the strict definition of the word itself, meaning it can be used interchangeably with ""prejudice towards (against?) men"". If you are defining misandry as a social platform where men are complaining because women are mean to them after decades upon decades of opression, then yeah THAT is a joke for sure. Fuck those people. But what i mean is that somewhere in the world there exists a women who is prejudice against men and I am unsure how you can argue against that unless they really don't exist but I am going to have to say that out of the four billion women on this earth, there is at least one who is prejudice against men."	2	False

But now NFL fans are primed to explode with rage if they see a team like the Chiefs even remotely in that realm of success for a period of time longer than like 3 years, because now their frame of reference is ""a team magically finding their way to dominate the league for a decade.""

It doesn't matter that the Chiefs are more like the Seahawks of the early 2010s - with today's NFL media environment where narratives are set *immediately* regardless of how accurate they are, there's no way the narrative of ""league is rigged for the Chiefs"" goes away until the Chiefs window slams shut like it inevitably will (honestly with the way we're playing I think it may have already).

Most that go to the house aren't too dangerous unless they leak for a while and gas builds up in a building. 

When you get up into bigger ones, they can hold enough pressure to get the rocks to spark when the blowing gas moves them.

Then there's transmission lines. If you hit one of those, it can dismember anyone close, utterly destroy backhoes, excavators, bore rigs, etc. They can level buildings and all sort of nasty things. If you hit one of those you likely won't be around to see the damage caused.

The portion you highlighted, referencing *Delaware v Prouse* means to state that there *is* a valid safety aspect to some stops.  

A hypothetical example would be a block placed specifically because analysis showed a marked and demonstrable number of unlicensed drivers in a specific area.  That could feasibly be the appropriate reasonable suspicion to begin investigation.  A bit of a stretch, but at least shows that there's something beyond this.

That said, *Delaware* itself says (in summary) ""*Unless there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed, an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.*""

The checkpoint in the video is specifically a stop to go fishing for unlicensed drivers, which I would surmise is ordinary criminal wrongdoing.  It sure as heck isn't extraordinary.  As I stated elsewhere, the stop in and of itself isn't illegal, the unconstitutional part is the effect of ""you ain't going nowhere"" and ""I'm about to break this window."""	7	False

This makes your comment make much more sense. From the context and comment I had gotten the impression you were a woman in a relationship with a man.

&gt;Regarding reciprocation, to each their own, but IMO sex should be pretty reciprocal. Maybe not act for act, but pretty close.

This is very similar to what I said. Everyone should be happy, but it doesn't have to be act for act. The only difference is the ""pretty close"" part, and I think that only applies in terms of satisfaction, rather than the acts themselves. Satisfaction should be close rather than (hyperbole) an itemized spreadsheet of specific acts.

Hey so I‚Äôve worked out a bit before but I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm pretty new to working out. I have some chronic illnesses which have made me extremely weak(cuz I‚Äôve not been active). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 53kg which I‚Äôm okay with. I want to workout for my health and gain some strength. But I have no strength in my upper body at all, so any upper body/arm workout tips? I am a teenage girl so I‚Äôd love to grow my glutes as well, any tips? 

I don‚Äôt have the energy to work out more then once or twice a week so I‚Äôll realize I won‚Äôt have any crazy gains or change my body completely. But I figure twice a week is still better then nothing.

However the .308 rounds aren't that common and the 2 rounds can hold you back if you're not a good shot. However the lack of bolt-action still makes it a better choice than the winchester, imo.

I think the SVD scope isn't that good and above 400-500 it becomes more difficult to use. SVD is a great all-rounder and the fact that it uses mosin ammo makes it pretty usable too. Keep in mind that the SVD has quite some recoil though.

I've never truly used the VSS, but I know the damage isn't too high and it's really not usable on longer ranges. You'd be better off using the scope on an AK(M), really.

To answer your question OP:
Range: Blaze (Winchester)
Damage: Blaze probably per-shot, but I'd argue the SVD has the superior 'DPS' so to say."	1	False

https://incidecoder.com/decode-inci


https://www.skincarisma.com/ingredient-analyzer


They both have a feature on their sites that allows you to copy an ingredient list and paste it so that the ingredients can be analyzed.  I find incidecoder to be a bit more thorough with their information, but it can help to cross check if there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre unsure about.


Also, http://m.checkcosmetic.net/ can help you look up batch codes to determine a product‚Äôs manufacture date and shelf life.


Also also...this isn‚Äôt directly related to ingredient safety/information, but https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/search/ and https://logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-brand-list/ are both really helpful if you want to check on a brand‚Äôs cruelty free status.


One more - https://www.skindex.ai/ lets you create an account to track the products that you use in your skincare routine and uses your input about how efficient they are to help figure out what specific ingredients you might be sensitive to and what really works for your skin.    
Like if you put in products that you know break you out, it will determine what they might have in common that your skin is reacting to.  And then you can use that information when you‚Äôre looking at products in the future."	14	False

I‚Äôm sorry :(. I think you are definitely on to something that your experience could be different now that you are not drinking. Alcohol use disorder can look like a lot of other disorders and alcohol exacerbates a lot of existing disorders so it‚Äôs hard to treat the mental health issue when addiction is present. If you decide to go back to therapy it might be helpful to find a therapist who specializes in addiction, to find one with a specific framework they use (Dialectical Behavior Therapy-DBT, Acceptance and Commitment therapy-ACT, cognitive behavioral therapy-CBT) and be sure to tell them you are looking for tools and coping skills, that you don‚Äôt just want to talk. You can talk and be validated by a friend, you don‚Äôt need the skill of a therapist for that. In the meantime, as others have suggested, guided meditation and mindfulness can be helpful and have definitely helped me get through some stuff. Also, as many have said here, all of your experiences are temporary, the pleasant and unpleasant, and none of them can actually hurt you. Your reaction to them can (drinking) but the emotions themselves are harmless. Take care of yourself. Lots of love and light your way. Your body, mind, soul, who you are at your core, thanks you for the changes you are making.	2	False

In some countries (Turkey) it still gets a hand chopped off. He didn‚Äôt steal a loaf of bread from a bakery because he was hungry. He stole a purse from a defenseless old lady. He assaulted the lady by stealing the purse. He may not have hit her, but she will have lasting mental anguish and be scared to walk alone in her own city. So she was assaulted. And for that, in my opinion at least, he deserved every punch and kick.	8	False

From my perspective the way you explain it makes it look like you're absolutely terrified of going outside on your own.

I have a very diverse group of friends and people I interact with, and I just can't get a grasp on what your viewpoint actually is.

He had a lot of hair throughout high school and then he started to lose all of it in college. It was devastating for him. I met him through a personal ad (Tinder for an older generation lol!) and he was insecure enough to say that he was bald in the ad, I guess so there wouldn't be any uncomfortable surprises. Suffice to say though that I married the man and his baldness didn't bother me in the least. And it wasn't that I simply overlooked his baldness-- I found it part of his attractiveness overall . He also grew a beard and mustache which I loved, too, though I don't think that would be a requirement (so to speak) for everyone. I guess my point is don't let yourself think that you will be completely unattractive when you lose your hair. You'll just be awesomely good-looking in a different way!	1	False

Unless trump bans automation than manufacturing is done. Especially in America. Even if you put that 35% import tax on goods, it's still far cheaper to produce them outside the US. We're paying people in Asia pennies to work everyday. Meanwhile in the US you'd have to pay laborers minimum wage of 7.25. We're talking hundreds of times more expensive per person. 

People love to look at manufacturing as a golden era. But the reality is that things like child labor laws, working conditions, and minimum wage weren't really things. Those lack of regulations are what allowed things to be made so affordably in country. Removing those regulations would be wrong ethically. So that's the situation were in now. "	7	False

Perhaps you simply could catch the exception and return the max value for the return type.

Yes, indeed. So why do we have doctors stating opinions without evidence? We know asymptomatic spread occurs. We don't know at what level it stops. Why are we pretending we do?

There are many studies that discuss the false negative rate of pcr tests with different ways of determining ground truth. I've never seen one quote less than 10% in a clinical setting, and that's when taken at the ideal time.  Antigen tests are necessarily worse. It's important to understand this when we're making life and death decisions based on the results, and very few people do.

Even if they don't do an actual musical, I'm hoping that some of their Kingdom stages will have a musical feel.

You lease the car. You make the payments. You turn it in. Then you are back at zero. That‚Äôs how leases work, and why they‚Äôre not (in most cases) a wise financial decision. You‚Äôre just paying all the high depreciation costs that are experienced the first 2-3 years."	2	False

I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

Past round 40 the zombies health stops increasing but their speed becomes insain especially on tag since the water bugs out their run speed to outpace the player. A shield helps but they run fast and hit fast so it's likely to break way too quickly. I advise to camp, it is the best way to get to high rounds in bo4. The game is easy in the lower to mid rounds but in the late to high rounds it becomes a pain in the ass. 

Depending on your strat you can pick and choose what perks help you out. Same goes with the specialists"	9	False
