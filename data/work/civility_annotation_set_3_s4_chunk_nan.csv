No means no. The difference between consensual sex and rape is the consent.

&gt;Yeah, she is consenting by not stopping them, but that does not change how she feels after the fact.

Consenting to things and then feeling bad afterward doesn't make it non-consensual.

Your girlfriend is responsible for enforcing her boundaries.  If she's going along with these activities you disagree with, she's responsible for that decision.

&gt;We simply do not act the same when we are in our most passionate moments.

And you think some ink on the page is going to change anything?  Why not just have _her_ sign the agreement then?",1,0
