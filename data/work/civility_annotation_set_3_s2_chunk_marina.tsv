Their not caring comes in the form of zero social support programs, and these many zeroes of programs is why lockdown is so untenable for the richest country in the world despite its massive success and relative ease of accomplishment in ... *checks notes* literally every other country.

This nonsense that lockdown is impossible is only a reality in the late stage capitalist shithole known as America, and it's so baked into the culture that it has produced a most disappointing and sad result -- people like you unironically demanding and claiming that, due to persistent and deliberate institutional failures of your government and a total lack of social and political accountability by both the government and wider society, pushing everyone out of lockdown into a situation where 3-10 *million* people die is not just acceptable, but necessary.	7	0

I built amusement park just to see about visitor numbers and I notice it does fluctuate quite a bit, I saw number from 115 to as low as 24. The price didn't seem to affect the visits at all.  And knowing your overall visits are high I would say your park is it's working normally.	1	0
