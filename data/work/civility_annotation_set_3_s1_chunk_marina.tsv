I'm asking that because leading on from the premise of second hand smoke is a complete ban on smoking. And while I hate smoking, I will defend individuals right to smoke.

Does the average person have the same exposure and take on the same risks from second hand smoke as they do from cleaning products? If so, that's important information.  	0	0

Iâ€™m considering value for money being better for a PS4 on the basis that a PC of the same value as a PS4 will give you much lower performance relative to the amount you spend. A Â£300 PC bought in 2013 when the PS4 released would not be able to play any game released this year on PS4 maybe minus things like base minecraft.	1	0

Putting it very succinctly, they are out of phase from each other by 120 degrees, so all 3 are never positive or negative at the same time. Current from one wire will return through the other two.	1	0

While you're right that it is not a necessary condition that there be a government, there is no effective difference if a group of people take your property by force or if the entity labeled ""the government"" does it.  

There can be a government-free socialism, but there exists no difference.  A governing body can be a body other than the government. 	-7	0

There are very limited studies that show that specific strains of some bacteria can have a limited effect in very specific situations, but that isn't what is being sold here.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056112/
http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/food-matters/2014/04/29/are-probiotics-helping-you/

It is all advertising and marketing, designed to get you to either pay more for a food or choose a specific brand, which is why the commercials don't make any specific health claims.

Here is the ""Health Effects"" section of the article on the probiotic used in Danone products: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium_animalis#Health_effects

Places like the conservative bastion of Oklahoma have the [fourth highest teen pregnancy rate](http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/09/04/oklahoma-school-district-ditches-abstinence-only-program/) in the country and have not even been covering things like STD transmission. 

These flawed lessons are being taught because of the stigma attached to sex by the religious segment of the populous. We cannot properly educate people on responsible sex when we are still shaming people for it and denying sexuality as a whole.	3	0
