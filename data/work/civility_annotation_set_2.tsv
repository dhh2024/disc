Rule 3: No meta posts.

Meta posts refer to posts that discuss the subreddit itself. The subreddit isn't perfect, far from it, and you may have a very valid opinion about moderator actions, rules, management, the users, and how they post and vote on various topics. And you are more than welcome to those views. Unfortunately, virtually everything you might say about the subreddit has been said a thousand times before, and regular users are sick to death of hearing ""the only opinions here are popular"".

Post anything meta in the relevant megathread of the megathread hub, which can be found when sorting the subreddit by ""hot"", sticky'd at the top of the page. Everything within that megathread will be read by multiple moderators, and often contains ideas we implement on the subreddit.

If it really came down to it, the government would make it so that the farmers pay minimum wage, and the government makes up the cost to above minimum wage to incentivize individuals to take the jobs. I would be out there myself for $11 or $12 an hour, but it's not important enough to be worth that amount yet.

I'm sorry you just don't get how huge a disruption it would be.

&gt;Because it's damaging to the people born in the country whose line they decide to cross. They know it's illegal, they know the risk. They have a legal route and refuse to take it. If breaking one non violent law is ok then breaking ALL non violent laws are ok. Hell, if you cross the Mexican border illegally they don't offer the same amnesty, so why should the U.S.?

The economic evidence shows that the economy mostly benefits from migrants. Is there some other way that they're really harming Americans other than the psychic trauma of having _broke the law_?

Also, most of the people do not have any legal means of working in the country. Visas have a hard cap at 600k a year. The waiting list can take over a decade. If you can't see these very poor people are in a sympathetic situation at all, then we probably don't have much more to say to each other.

Non-violent laws are broken all the time without punishment, and the world mostly goes on ok. Cops let people off for speeding tickets or look the other way on a little bit of pot. Such a hardline stance of ""if one law is allowed to be broken, than all are broken"" is extremist and unrealistic.

That being said, in a 15 minute OT that uses field goals as a win condition - if either team gets a field goal and is unanswered the game ends - I don't think there will be too many ties.  Furthermore, in the playoffs there can't be any ties, so both teams would be given a completely fair chance, and we'd get to see them give it their all on both sides of the field.	12	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset	1

First, there is no basis for this philosophy. It makes the *assumption* that truth and love are the highest values possible, yet there is no backing for it. If life is a pre-requisite to truth AND love, shouldn't life be valued first? And should we not value freedom next, to let people pursue their own desires? In terms of truth, it makes sense for us to value that-- it allows us to gain more information about the world, and better develop moral decisions. But what about love? Love-- whether between friends, romantic partners, etc-- is a mutual agreement of sorts, a recognition to act in happiness and respect. Therefore, love comes from our values of 1) happiness (our friendships and relationships giving us more fulfillment, and our recognition that being an asshole to everyone makes us less happy) and 2) respect (our desire, or at least some people's desire, to be nice even when wronged). Love is not a PRIMARY value. 

Second, you give no means of deciding what IS truth and what IS love. Truth may be described as ""that which is with accordance of reality""-- but do we all witness the same reality? Perhaps there is an objective reality, but perhaps there is not. I have no way of knowing if we witness the same reality. It's all the same to me, and it SEEMS as if there is, but there are different truths to different people. A certain idea may speak to you, and improve your life, but not mine-- each person must thus be able to pursue *their own* truths. And perhaps there are some universal truths, but perhaps not-- that's something that has to be proved, not assumed. 

Looking at some of the examples--
&gt;But I must recognize that's true only to me, and I would be wrong to try persuading others of it, without evidence that might apply to them

Would you? Let's say there's religion A, and Jane Smith is a follower. And under the beliefs, if you do not believe in Religion A, you will suffer for eternity after death. Now, if Jane was convinced that religion A was true, even if Jane didn't have solid proof, wouldn't she be an asshole not to try to tell other people? I mean, she honestly believes that those people will suffer for eternity-- wouldn't it be loving to try to save them? You may argue that, of course religion A is wrong, and has no validity-- but in Jane's mind, it has PERFECT validity. 

This is an example of where definitions come into play. Where is the boundary for truth and love? Now, clearly, the answer would be for JANE to value truth more heavily, and pursue knowledge that her beliefs are unfounded-- but suppose *she believes* she has. Truth and love, then are in contradiction. 

Now, looking at the implications;

&gt;If homosexuality doesn't result in decreased love in the world, it's immoral to oppose two same-sex ppl forming a life together.

Why is the standard for immorality love? And why assume something is immoral unless it promotes love? If I go to the store and buy a few tomatoes with the intent to simply throw them away, there's nothing loving in that-- I don't intend to feed anyone. But I would argue that my choice is still moral because of *rights*. Which is another huge flaw in your philosophy- systems of love need systems of rights to gauge the *limit* of love. In my tomato example, it would be immoral, because no love would have been furthered-- but I think it's pretty clear that, since I agreed to buy the tomatoes, and the store agreed to sell them, nobody is being forced to do anything against their will-- both of us can continue happily.

&gt;Rape is wrong because it is an infringment on love

I actually think this is a good counterexample. A significant number of rapes are committed by a person the victim knows. Rapists may even be romantically in love with their victims-- in your world, this would be moral. Yet, because the RIGHTS of the victim are being infringed upon, in a horrible, inhumane, disgusting manner, it is one of the most immoral acts imaginable. 

To take another example-- gay conversion therapy. Say that John is gay, and his loving family, followers of Religion A, believe that he will suffer in eternity for it. Let's say they even have some evidence Religion A is correct. Out of love, they kidnap him, and force him into a gay conversion therapy camp in a third-world country. Such situations as these have been proven CONSISTENTLY to cause great psychological harm and trauma. Clearly, it is wrong to force John against his will to go to this camp-- yet his family, out of ""love"", has done it anyways. Shouldn't there be a recognition of rights? That John should be free to live his life how HE wants? The boundary would be, his family, out of kindness, tries to *persuade* him-- yet, morally, that is the furthest they can go without being immoral.

And last, the problem of war is one I think you cannot handle. Say Country A attacks Country B. Country B, acting purely in a system of love, would refuse to attack back, because violence isn't loving-- but, because self defense is an inherent right, I think Country B is right to stop aggression and defend itself. Under your philosophy, if even one country or person doesn't follow it, the others can be seriously harmed."	3	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset	0

So have team bonding events outside of just practices. I would suggest mixed gender locker rooms, but that never flies. A simple partition down the middle of the locker room can solve this, so both sides can still talk. 

&gt;This is especially prevalent in sports like hockey, where players spend upwards of 45 minutes getting ready.

90% of which doesn't really require separate locker rooms. 

&gt;My second reason is that it is very uncomfortable for boys to tackle, bodycheck, etc... girls, due to being raised not to hit girls in any circumstance. 

""it's the way I was raised"" is a terrible excuse. That's kind of shit that let's certain groups do horrible things to other people. 

&gt;When the boys do play physically against girls, it is rarely ever as hard, which gives the girls an unfair advantage. 

This is your own shit getting in the way. Give no quarter. If they signed up for a contact sport, they knew exactly what they were getting into. If they didn't want to get hit, then they'd be playing in a non contact league. 




Here's another point to consider. So girls have to go play in the girls league right? What if a small guy wants to go play in the girls league because he doesn't want to get stomped? Separate gender sports are a terrible way to deal with the problem. Girls can join boy scouts, but boys can't join brownies. 

Instead we should do for hockey what we do for martial arts, weight class. "	59	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset	0

I should say: Is it more important that applications look consistent and not weird, or that they make esthetic concessions so as to make it easier to use the application and understand how to do what you want?  I wish that when they break the design they would use CSD to primarily make it easier for me to understand what‚Äôs going on, and then worry about how weird or consistent the interface was.  

I get that nobody wants to futz with ugly and inconsistent interfaces, but if you're messing with it all anyway CSD seems like a great way to actually make things easy.

I think that‚Äôs a noble, life long endeavor and I hope you learn something from the thread. 

&gt;I can't see a way for rich people to avoid taxes by loopholes.

The easiest way I could think of would be to make purchases in a different jurisdiction (buy things in country X and move them). Secondly, the fact that people can avoid laws, isn‚Äôt a reason not to have them. 

&gt;I think it is fair, laws are for everybody so why do we discrimate people base on income ?

I think this might be a misconception of how a marginal tax rate works. Person A makes 50,000 person B makes 100,000.

Both A and B pay the same amount of money on the first 50,000 of income (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 10% so that‚Äôs 5,000 each). Then Person B pays on the next 50,000 of income (let‚Äôs say 20%) which means 10,000. So Person A‚Äôs final taxes are 5,000 and Person B is 15,000 (or marginal tax rates of 10% and 15% respectively). Person A and B are treated equally on the money they make. 

&gt;I belive it has some benefit for both the rich and the poor, because you abolish income tax so people's working rate rise to maximum and people have more money.

Generally speaking, poor people don‚Äôt pay as much income tax, because the starting brackets are both low, and don‚Äôt kick in at 0 dollars. You might want to specify what you mean by ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô (do you mean they keep more of their money? Because if you don‚Äôt pay income tax, but do pay a consumption tax, it‚Äôs less of a benefit). You also pointed out in point 1 that you‚Äôd prefer to have no loopholes, so ostensibly the rich person would pay more too. 

&gt;Rich people have to choose between saveing money for the future,invasting or cosum the money and pay taxes. People shouldn't have to pay tax when they are growthing the economy.

Wait, paying people for goods and services is a way of growing the economy. So do you believe in a consumption tax or not? Also saving is basically the same as investing (either you do it, or the bank does). 

edit: to clarify how paying for goods and services: if you buy 10 &lt;item&gt;, that's money the &lt;item&gt; store can now use to buy more of that item to restock it. That money then goes to the item manufacturer. If there's enough demand, they hire more workers.  Same with the store. Maybe they open a new plant (or a new store). That makes the economy bigger. The economy is the sum total of all transactions, so more transactions == larger economy. 

&gt;I do see that it is kind of regressive but i'm still not convinced. My friend said everybody has to buy food, but even here the rich pays more tax cause they are more likely to go and buy expesive stuff to eat. But i do concede that you could have a basic income to keep the poorest atleast alive.( Or you could habe people giveing free food through charity, like how i saw it in Vietnam a communist state.)

Yes, the idea is if you spend 100% of your income on things, then you will pay a greater percentage of your income in taxes, compared to someone who pays only a fraction. This means it has a greater impact on those people who spend all of their paycheck. When you say the rich pay more, do you mean in absolute or relative terms?

&gt;It makes the live for people simpler.

So would having the IRS just tell you how much you owe (since they have copies of most of your forms anyway). Then you could just redo the sections they don‚Äôt know (e.g. return free filing)"	8	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset	0

My wife and I took our kids and a foster kid that is currently in our home to a local playground. The playground is at the elementary school our kids go to and has a fence around it, and posted to the fence are signs that say no pets. When we got there there was another couple there with their dog. 

Our foster kid (that just came to us yesterday) was running around and the dog started chasing him and at one point tried to nip him. The dog was clearly playing but doesn't change the fact that it attempted to bite him. So I called over to the couple and said their dog had tried to nip our kid (they don't need to know he's a foster) and could they please put their dog on a leash. 

She instantly starts shaking her head the moment I started talking and tells me her dog is friendly and wouldn't bite anyone and didn't attempt to nip at him. At this point I was a little taken back because she's calling me a liar and refusing to leash her dog and stop it from chasing the kids. 

So I again call over and tell her that she needs to control her dog and stop it from chasing the kids and she refuses saying she has control over her dog. Then the foster kid is down in a stair well and the dog is standing at the top blocking his path. I ask her to please move her dog and she ignored me and started laughing. Later our kids were running and this time the dog tried to nip them several times. She saw it this time and said it didn't matter because she didn't actually bite them. 

At this point I'm a little angry and we start getting into a back and forth and saying not very nice things to each other. She told me I must be a miserable person and the guy with her told us he took some law classes and a dog attempting to bite someone isn't breaking any laws. I asked them if they were idiots. Which I shouldn't have done in front of the kids and should have just left the playground. 


The city we live in has pretty lax leash laws. A dog can be off the leash if the owner has control over them. While the dog did come when called she was unable or unwilling to keep it from chasing our kids. The reason I mentioned we have a foster kid is because we just got him and have no idea what his past experiences with unknown dogs may be. Also while I may be okay with an unknown dog playing with my kids if it seems friendly; I don't feel comfortable taking that risk with someone else's kid.  

TLDL: Got into a back and forth with a woman at the playground when she refused to leash her dog after it chased my kids and attempted to bite them.

 A couple years ago, I (25f) worked a summer in another state. It was long hours with a group of people (20s-30s) and I saw these people everyday but I wouldn't say I was close to all of them. One girl Mia (23f) was nice enough and we were work friends but like I lived with one of the other girls and dated one of the guys and we weren't on that level.
Later that year, months after not being in touch with Mia the work group planned a trip to Maui to meet and catch up. Mia was invited.
Sadly, Mia was in a car accident and had a really bad head injury. I wasn't sure how bad but from the fb posts it was bad. She got out of the hospital after couple months, posted online that she was getting better, and we all wished her well. But she was still involved in the group fb planning for our trip!
After a couple months, I was thinking how we don't really know how bad this head injury is, and I don't want to be babysitting on our group trip. We are a very active group of people, and we have hiking/diving we want to do.
If she can't do that yet, it will be a huge drag. I brought this up to the group, PRIVATELY, and they agreed. So we made a new group chat, and planned our trip without her.
She assumed everyone just lost interest, so when the group trip finally happened 5 months later, she made a joke in our OG group chat about it. I privately PMed her that we were still going, just that it wasn't a good time for her to travel so we excluded her.
She responded like ""okay, sure I understand.""
Then unfriended all of us! And when I reached out to her in the future, totally ignored me.
I understand she's upset we uninvited her, but like we were never that good of friends and she wasn't the only one on the trip.
So AITA?
