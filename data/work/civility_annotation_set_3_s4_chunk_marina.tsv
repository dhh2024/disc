 Big vulture funds are buying up properties and pricing people out of the market.... today's world is a very different one to the world her parents grew up in	1	0

I actually skipped over an important word at the beginning and only read it as ‚ÄúAnxiety Disorder‚Äù and was rolling my eyes expecting OP to be uptight about any type of mental health. Then I saw the sentence about injunctions and went back and oh... yeah, no. OP is 100% correct in wanting no contact between his SIL and his wife.	40	0

I cannot believe you are about to graduate from high school and don't know to capitalize the first word of a sentence.

NTA for calling out the teacher but you are an ass for the writing style.

Do you really think that such rigid bigoted people were good parents in the 15 years leading up to throwing an underage kid out of the house?

LW doesn't say anything about her apologizing for doing that, only demanding to see her grandchild.	21	0

OP is making it out that it's a 2 hour easy train journey. I know London really well, I reckon I could maybe make the journey in 3 hours if all factors were perfect. But I know these stations/exits/entrances and would run for the connection. I'd hate to have to do that with luggage after a long flight too. Giving yourself a comfortable buffer will make it more like 3.5 hours via trains. 

In fairness, the GF really should have got a connecting flight to further up north in the UK. Best case scenario, she's saving ¬£20 for a further 3.5 hours of travel if she pre-books a cheap train fare and researches the route ahead of time.	79	0

No means no. The difference between consensual sex and rape is the consent.

&gt;Yeah, she is consenting by not stopping them, but that does not change how she feels after the fact.

Consenting to things and then feeling bad afterward doesn't make it non-consensual.

Your girlfriend is responsible for enforcing her boundaries.  If she's going along with these activities you disagree with, she's responsible for that decision.

&gt;We simply do not act the same when we are in our most passionate moments.

And you think some ink on the page is going to change anything?  Why not just have _her_ sign the agreement then?	1	0
