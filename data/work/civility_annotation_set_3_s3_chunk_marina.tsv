The Brazilians for example still have virtual slavery wherein. the dark skinned are kept incredibly poor theough a caste system (mich like india) and forced to work for incredibly low wages serving the Portuguese descended people. Nobody seems to mention this though you'll have to go there to experience it.

The Chinese, the middle easterners, the north east africans are or have been barbaric for, as far as we know, 2000+ years. Warring tribes, slavery, raping pillaging. What do you think the old testament is? It's the stories of how the Jewish people fought with their neighbors and tore them down. There is no glory in that book it's a sick totem for the twisted to blame their madness.

My point is that history is replete with the insane and  cruel civilizations and only in modern times are any major civilizations trying to do anything. The only reason you make claims like ""western society has created a negative impact"" is because in these times you are afforded that luxury. That luxury though comes from the struggles of your ancestors and is a direct product of what they built which is founded upon principles that abandoned those old ways. Inviting cultures en masse that rely on the old ways back into your society isnt fixing the problem or making reparations it's just going to bring you all down. That is to destroy what came from the struggles of the past.

This viewpoint you present is downright frightening: that your rather see the word burn for guilt than work to make it better. Social justice zealotry.	1	0

9 of those countries are in north america

7 of those countries are in south america

2 are in africa

1 is in asia and 1 is in europe

legally, you are correct. the united states cannot be blamed for all the crime outside the country that results from its guns. we just produced the weapons. its not our responsibility, however it is our problem. the guns keep cartels in business, which keeps meth, cocaine, and heroin flowing into the united states.	1	0

The UK government and media stated that the sex ring could not be discussed, for the same reasons you say. To avoid isolation and hurt feelings etc. These sex ring specifically targeting young white girls. The rings themselves had a racial/non-Muslim motivation. You don't care about actual racism and bigotry.

I don't suggest that SA gets a pass. I'm suggesting we hold everyone accountable. If that's to be done diplomatically, rather than picking new countries to bomb, SA is one of our only ins.	3	0

First of all, they're perfectly fine with people using calculators, which is essentially the math equivalent of a Google search. But most importantly, the only places where you won't be allowed to do a Google search are fields like farming where you don't need a college degree (or even a high school diploma) to succeed.	1	0

While factually its true, you can be lean even with thyroid issues etc, it can become incredibly difficult. to the point where making a child deal with it is abuse in itself

For example, a kid with a super slow metabolism and in a wheel chair. Cant do much for cardio (and if he can then use a quadriplegic as example) so the only way to cut down is to eat very very little, which is difficult to do for the kid as well as difficult to obtain enough nutrients as you would have to eat nothing but completely healthy food in perfect portions. That type of stress on a kid would do more damage than being overweight	1	0

So you're going to ignore the book has existed for hundreds of years before Christianity and is sacred to Jews as well? I'm Jewish myself.

&gt;Ecclesiastes is a book of perspective. The narrative (most likely Solomon) of “the Preacher” (KJV), or “the Teacher” (NIV) reveals the depression that inevitably results from seeking happiness in worldly things.

Wrong, in the book Ko'heleth searches for the meaning of life in various ways only to find out that everything is meaningless. If any, the book is about Nihilism...

&gt;In the end, the Preacher comes to accept that faith in God is the only way to find personal meaning. He decides to accept the fact that life is brief and ultimately worthless without God. The Preacher advises the reader to focus on an eternal God instead of temporary pleasure.

That's right, that's the (late addition) ending, which doesn't make the book about ""searching for God"" but rather finding God as a conclusion.	1	0
