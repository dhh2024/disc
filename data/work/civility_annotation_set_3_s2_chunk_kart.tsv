43422314864	11	random_sample_10-19	4595039	france	https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/163n7k0/_/jy4iwkw/	2545701120	43422167542	2023-08-28 18:46:46	25698042822	Hliuon	Je ne saurais pas te convaincre définitivement, parce que je suis incapable de trouver le moindre article faisant un inventaire de collections muséales différenciant les tableaux représentants des nus de ceux dûment vêtus.

Cependant c'est bien la première fois que j'entends qu'on donne, à notre époque, une plus grande importance à la représentation du nu par rapport à l'inverse ; ce fut surtout l'apanage de l'époque humaniste, et de celles qui prenaient les cultures antiques pour modèles. J'ai l'impression qu'on a, de nos jours, moins d'intérêt pour le trait et la représentation du corps parfait que pour la composition et l'impression.

Je ne suis certainement pas convaincu de ce que tu avances quant aux collections, et je ne pense pas que les tableaux inintéressants dont tu fais mention sont en majorité constitués de sujets vêtus ; mais encore une fois, ni toi ni moi sommes en mesure de produire une preuve tangible. Je tiens à réitérer que les sujets mythologiques ou génésiaques sont les sujets d'un nombre astronomique de tableaux, qu'ils contiennent quasi-systématiquement de la nudité, et ceci sans même compter le genre du nu en lui-même.	1	0

Mais c’est sûr que le Véran qui dit « Quand il y aura plus de variants » c’est aussi réaliste que de dire « Quand il y aura plus de fils de putes » au sujet des attentats déjoués. Après, la différence, c’est qu’on peut avoir progressivement des variants de moins en moins dangereux, mais va falloir croiser les doigts et la bite.	1	0

Regarding stance switching I’ve been giving it some practice and damn is it tough, my timing is usually off and because I’m playing lethal+ now (which I’ve realised is pretty damn brutal) any slip up gets capitalised by the enemy quick. But of course muscle memory and practice matters! I’ll get there hopefully by the end of this month lol!

Also thanks for the second tip, I didn’t actually realise that but it makes a lot of sense and I see now why some people switch from two light attacks to a heavy attack combo when they break the enemies guard.

These are very helpful thank you!	2	0

If you write in your journal what has resonated with you from your reading/study and how you want to put that into practice, and how well you went and what you could do better etc etc then you have a measure of how you went in the past

  
I sometimes reread passages, and things that were huge blockages for me, stresses that I didn’t think would ever resolve and things I struggled to come to terms with, they are almost laughable now, non-issues.   That is both the passage of time in itself, and my development as a student of Stoicism

  
As to your last point, I don’t know much about that Dunning-Kruger effect, I’ve just googled it and it seems to suggest that we need a reality check once in a while to make sure we are not over or under estimating our skills?   Absolutely, but that is not about comparison in terms of envy or disappointment, it is simply making sure that we are in touch with the world around us.

For me, Stoicism is immensely helpful, and I find that by meeting with other Stoics (or prokoptons as we are strictly called) in person in a meetup group, that helps me to grow and keep me on the track of living well and making good choices, which are the most important things to me in my life.	2	0

He chased me until he cornered me against the desk and wall, and didn't let me go until I cried from my hand being crushed or said yes. 

It went from jokes to that within 3-5 minutes, in front of an entire class of people. I often forget about it on a day to day basis, however I am aware that I am polite and respond to these people regardless of being in public or not, because it's not worth being hurt over.	27	0

They've made GREAT strides in that they now open up about what bothers them and are able to verbalize and articulate when they get anxious. Their therapist helps them through that. They are not medicated and still see the therapist 1-2 times a month. 
Also, I have anxiety that wasn't diagnosed until adulthood. I am STILL in therapy working through it as now that I am off meds, i want to do the work involved in getting better. 
YTA. Don't take away your child's support system. Whether or not you ""see"" it working, it's not up to you. It's your daughter's choice and you are not listening to her. Listen to your daughter. Maybe if you did, she'd be more likely to open up to you.	2	0
