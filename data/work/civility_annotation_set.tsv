You were saying?  

As for the man having say in whether the woman aborts a pregnancy, you have not answered my question.  If YOU get to determine the medical decisions for the woman, why should the woman not get to determine the medical decisions for you? If she wants you to get castrated afterwards (to prevent you from impregnating and running away from other women) she should be allowed to do so.  

Otherwise, the medical decisions that a woman makes are the decisions she makes alone, for herself.  Your decision to not have children becomes the WOMAN'S decision the moment the sperm leaves your body.  

Don't like it?  Don't let the sperm leave your body.

No one said that, I did not say that. 'The same worth' is exactly that one human life. That's unchangable, the only thing that changes is your perception of it, which just aligns with reality less and less.

&gt;They simply do not deserve any form of mercy

Lifelong imprisonment isn't mercy for some, and death is mercy for others. Are you going to let the worst criminals commit suicide? Would you let them give themselves that mercy? 

The golden rule is pretty faulty by itself, it completely ignores the authentic self and instead treats every person as if they're identical. It works for people who are unable to sympathise or empathise with others, but people with any social capabilities know you treat people how *they* want to be treated, not how *you* want to be treated. This thought is similarly simple to 'just automate the executions'.

Proportionality is great, but you're not going to give a guard a bunch of alcohol and have him beat up someone as 'justice' for that someone getting in a barfight. You don't forfeit your car when you damage someone else's car. It's nonsensical because people aren't homogenous, they don't value the same things equally. How are you going to punish a person in a wheelchair when he cuts off someone else's legs? What would you take from a poor thief? This only makes sense if you don't think about implementing it at all.

&gt;Then what do you suggest to solve this problem

Extremely simple: don't kill people. Don't make people kill people, and don't let people who want to kill people kill people either."	3	0

When looking purely at potential, we have to ignore industry choices like their decision to release many titles as console-only, because those are business decisions on their part.

The simple answer is that everyone has a computer.  Computers are versatile, whereas consoles are specialized for gaming.  Nowadays, the average cost of a laptop for personal use is probably around $500-600.  The average cost of a console is $250-500.  The average cost of a ""decent"" gaming laptop is $800-1000.  (In this case I'm defining ""decent"" as ""well exceeds the current generation of consoles, can play basically all modern games with reasonable settings."")  The price points pretty much say it all.  Even a low-end laptop plus a low-end console price will still run you $750, only slightly short.  A slightly better computer and a high-end console will run you $1100, enough to *easily* purchase a reasonable gaming laptop.

When looking at desktops, the comparison is even worse.  $800-1000 can get you a desktop that will vastly exceed the capabilities of any modern consoles and probably the next generation too.  Even when it becomes obsolete (which can easily be delayed through individual upgrades to obsolescence-prone components) it's still possible to salvage large chunks of the system for use in a new one.

In both cases, you also get significantly improved computing power for all *other* applications rather than just gaming.  Unless you plan on outright not owning a computer at all, gaming systems are simply not cost-effective because you could simply buy a better computer.

Computers are also backwards compatible in a way that no console is.  I bought a PS3 largely because of the PS2 catalog, but found out shortly after that some of my favorite games simply wouldn't run due to the new software emulation.  Backwards compatibility on consoles is usually buggy, and in some cases there simply isn't any.  In comparison, my spare laptop can emulate most last-generation systems reasonably well and the generation before that perfectly, as well as play basically any computer game ever invented.  Even for games so ancient that modern software won't run them, I still have the option of running a virtual machine and if a game is that old I wouldn't likely have any performance issues.

In short, consoles only have two things going for them: they're simpler to use, and they often have exclusive games.  For some people, perhaps, that's enough to push things over the edge.  I personally view the ""console-exclusive games"" issue as a symptom of a broken system (the exclusivity of the console platform allows manufacturers to gouge) and modern computer gaming doesn't exactly take a computer genius.  Really, the only significant difficulty with a modern computer is setting things up for multiplayer, and the rise of internet gaming pretty much solved that.

In all honesty, it just seems to me like most people haven't looked at the question very hard....it's not much of a debate."	2	0

I think I understand your point. You thought I was against prosecuting old crimes in general and used the statutes of limitation to prove that wrong. However, I'm only against it in this case, not for all old crimes, because this is an exceptional situation.

On the point about public opinion, public opinion dictates punishment in a democracy. If we want harsher punishments the government introduces them to keep the public's support. That's immaterial though because my issue is that it is bad for society when the punishment they want is not dished out.

- An action is good if it benefits people (the consequentalist definition, roughly)

- An action is good if Jeff feels that it is good (Jeff's definition)

- An action is good if God says so (Religious person's definition)

These are actual metrics that real-life people use. Do you deny this?

Let me try one more tack here. Considering the consequences of one's actions involves making a prediction about the future, and how the action affects it. Right? The last two definitions of ""good"" that I supplied *don't involve the future at all*. Not explicitly, not implicitly. Therefore they cannot possibly be consequentalist.

Finally, a note on tautologies. If you truly believe that what you are stating is tautological, then you should believe you are wasting time on it.

Nope. I fully accept it's a sliding scale. Another way of writing the title might be ""A just society is inversely proportional to a lucky society"". As I don't think luck can be fully removed, I am aiming toward the most just possible.

&gt; Secondly...

Which is why I emphasis that not all luck can be removed, and why I specify ""... luck plays the *smallest possible role*""

&gt; The other thing is your maximally just society requires people to basically have no free time. IF they do, they can do things to get ahead. For example, if a child reads a nonfiction book in their free time, that counts as private education right? Thatâ€™s them learning something on their own.

I'm not so sure. Public libraries exist. It is possible for children to access books for free, the *opportunity* is there. If societal pressures to not read because ""raeding iz 4 loosers [sic]"" are minimised - i.e. those people are told to get a grip (preferably of a good book) - then the child is free to do so. If instead the kid wants to play sport and ""git gud"" at that, that's also fine. The point is that every child is given equal opportunity, and that no child is given access to benefits unavailable to others. 

&gt; Lastly, youâ€™d also have to standardize parenting because most brain development is before school age. You mention nutrition, but you need to make sure that parents are reading to their children equally (since that effects brain development). Are you ensuring that all families have equal time with their children, etc. 

I've said in another thread that the impact of the socio-economic umbrella of the parent needs to minimised. This could be done by saying who can and can't have children (something I would disagree with), *or*, my suggestion is things like after school clubs, where children can have the chance to read with adults. Or if the parents don't have time to read with their kids because they're having to work second jobs, I would look at the systemic issues there, fixing those, rather than getting invasive in individual's lives (e.g. bring in child benefits, maternity/paternity pay). 

I do think that, ultimately, a lot of the sources of advantage are systemic, and that these are areas where absolutely luck of the draw can be reduced. 

&gt; You mention that connections are not qualifications, but they absolutely are for some positions. The ability to get things done, is in fact an ability. Knowing who to call for a certain task, is a useful piece of knowledge. Why is it discrimination to take this into account?

So I do specify in the OP minimising luck, not removing it. But your comment (with others) is making me wonder if maybe my original statement wasn't decisive enough. Maybe I've made a get out of jail card by saying ""minimise luck"". Maybe that's too vague... Regardless you've certainly got me thinking, so if you keep pushing you may get that D...elta."	1	0

Secondly, ""hookup culture"" has always existed, you just have visibility into it because it can be explicit due to online dating.  In reality, people under 25 are having fewer sexual partners now than they did in the 1980s and 1990s.  

As for ""psychological science"" I think you're just playing on age old ideas that are long since not considered true by ""psychological science"".  In the most recent published studies, of those who have had sex in the last month only 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women say they are not ""committed"" to the person they had sex with.      Women are more likely to initiate divorce then men, men and women who are 18-25 equally want marriage or lifelong committed partnership and both men and women in that age group report the same level of commitments at the same rate (e.g. if you survey people in the age group and ask if they are dating, they rate the level of commitment they have at the same rates).  

I'd suggest you have an interpretative bias that is anchored in an old-fashioned idea.  Obviously this is a common idea, but it's certainly not ""psychological science""."	5	0

Absolutely. The psychological aspect is the big hurdle here, which is why I'm confused as to why OP talks about the ""physical effect"".

&gt; I have to restric myself to ~1250 calories a day and exercise or I will platue

That is... well below what a normal human with a normal daily amount of exercise (i.e. ""daily activities"") would burn.

&gt;the only way to manage the hunger on a daily basis is drinking about 2-3 litters.of diet soda a day, the carbonation helps trick my body into thinking it's full.

That... is a terrible idea, as it will cause your body to release massive amounts of insulin to regulate non-existend blood sugar spikes. I believe drinking water would be significantly better - or eating very low-caloric food with a lot of indigestible cellulose/fiber. That being said, I'm not a dietrician, just speaking from experience.

&gt;when you create all those fat cells (I was 450) they never go away

Are you sure about that? I would assume that, at the very least, they do not get replaced when they die off naturally as the body recycles the material.

&gt;It's ...... really fucking hard to maintain this lifestyle.

I 100% believe that and I'm very impressed that you're managing that. That is what I'm saying, though - it's a lot of psychological pressure, which is what OP doesn't seem to include here... which is what's confusing me."	8	0

Well, it wasn't that obvious, and is not based on DNA alone, as the same would apply for an adopted child. It's about a kid that you were supposedly parenting and the bond that naturaly you would develop. 

&#x200B;

>if you wanna trash the kid **you should once they're an adult**

Did you change your mind? Or you consider that giving up on a 13 years old is not trash the kid, consider that if the kid continious to life with you, then you are the only one who can help that child.

&#x200B;

What is wrong is that if you are giving up on a 13 years old then you are failing to that kid and as a parent, I don't want to blame anyone, because certainly the reason why you fail could be very complex and in some extreme cases maybe it's not your fault. But, later you say for any reason and in most cases how is your child as an adult depends on you."	1	0

You can check out the equation [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_temperature#Surface_temperature_of_a_planet).

As a planet gets farther from the Sun, the temperature decreases, but that isn't the only variable. The lower a planet's albedo (the less white it is) the higher the surface temperature will be.

For more information on this, look up 'Boolean Logic' and ""how to build an adder"".

Logic gates arranged in particular manners can do straightforward things like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two input numbers.

Logic gates can also be arranged in a way to save the last value input to them, forming memory.

Programming at its basical level involves specifying a set of on/off commands for all the switches in a computer to open up specific pathways between values stores in memory, and other memory locations, or groups of logic circuits that perform operations on those numbers.

A very simple processor would have an arithmetic computing unit - something containing logic gate for add, subtract, multiply, and divide - plus a bank of several memory units with pathways from the APU leading to their inputs, and pathways from those memory outputs going to the APU's inputs.  These pathways are all blocked by electrically controlled switches, so by controlling the switches, we can dynamically adjust what paths lead where.

So a basic, fundamental instruction might be to add the values in memory location 7 and 15, and store the result in memory slot 12.  This instruction would involve specifying values 7 and 15 out of however many memory locations you have, which will open the pathway between those two memory locations only and the input of the arithmetic processing unit. Plus sending an instruction to the arithmetic processing unit so that it opens the path between its inputs to the ""addition"" set of logic gates. And finally opening up the pathway between the output of the APU and the input of memory location 12.

The instruction to the computer might look like: 0010 0111 1111 1100

The first four bits are an instruction sent to the APU for ""add"", making it direct its input paths to its ""adder"" block.

The second set of 4 bits is the binary value of ""7"". The third is ""15"" and the last is ""12""

These binary values are *literally* describing that switches 0 through 15 are on or off, which creates the circuit with the specific links we want.

Another instruction could be: ""store number X in memory location Y""

Which might be written in machine code as: 0001 XXXX 0000 YYYY

And this would just take the four bits specified in the 2nd group and store them at memory location Y.

And maybe we have a third kind of instruction that will output a four bit number to humans by lighting up 4 LEDs each corresponding to a bit in a 4-bit memory slot. ""Output Memory YYYY""

Which might be written like: 0011 0000 0000 YYYY

Each of these kinds of instructions would constitute a single line of a program.  So if we wanted our program to, say, add four numbers together, then we would write a program.  Which is just a sequence of these instructions, one executed each clock cycle.  The program for adding the values of 2 3 6 and 9 might be something like:

&gt;0001 0010 0000 0001    
0001 0011 0000 0010  
0001 0110 0000 0011  
0001 1001 0000 0100  
0010 0001 0010 0101  
0010 0011 0101 0101  
0010 0100 0101 0101  
0011 0000 0000 0101  

This code would use our instructions and execute a program that would add and output those four numbers.  But this is really hard to read, isn't it?  How are humans supposed to keep track of what the first 4 bits correspond to in terms of instructions? With only 4 bits - 16 combinations - it's actually doable.  Try interpreting it yourself before moving on!   But what about 8 bit instructions? That's 256 different possible combinations to specify a different action.  What about 16 bit instructions?  God help you.

So humans came up with a good trick.  We make something called a *compiler*.  Instead of writing out binary instructions, we write out our instructions in more human-readable words and numbers, and we have a program read those simple commands and *translate* it to the actual binary values the machine will read.  This is something called an *assembly* language.  Here is the same program from above written in assembly:


&gt;Store val 2 in mem1  
Store val 3 in mem2  
Store val 6 in mem3  
Store val 9 in mem4  
Add mem1 and mem2, store in mem5  
Add mem3 and mem5, store in mem5  
Add mem4 and mem5, store in mem5  
output mem5  

A lot more clear, right?  Store all the numbers we want into memory locations. Then start adding those memory locations together and accumulate the result inside another memory location.  Then output that last memory location.

A real assembly language would be a little more parsimonious.  it'd just look like:

&gt;STR, 2, r1  
STR, 3, r2  
STR, 6, r3  
STR, 9, r4  
ADD, r1, r2, r5  
ADD, r3, r5, r5  
ADD, r4, r5, r5  
OUT, r5  

But the principle is what matters.


So assembly language turns the machine-code that is difficult to understand at a glance, or write without reference tables, and put it in more human-readable terms for easy writing and reading.

The next level up from *assembly* would be a *programming* language.  Remember this rule: Programmers are *lazy*.  That's why they make and program machines to think for them.  The program we wrote above makes sense and is straightforward, but *my God* is it boring to write, keeping track of individual memory locations and adding things only one or two values at a time.

While assembly languages *translate* machine-code into something human-*readable*, a programming language *abstracts* assembly-code into something human-*tolerable*.

In the C programming language, the above line would be written more like:

&gt;main(void){  
int a1;    
a1 = 2+3+6+9;  
fprintf(""Your Number Is: %d."",a1);  
}  

And instead of outputting to some LEDs, it would print out a value on a screen. It would say: 

&gt;""Your number is 20.""

What's this program doing?  The main(void) stuff is basically just saying: ""start program here"".  Don't worry about that too much.

""int a1"" is specifying a variable.  It tells the compiler that when it is writing the assembly code to replace this C code, keep track of what memory slot 'a1' is in so that it's making sure to properly store integer values in it.  Which means that I, as a programmer, no longer have to *care* that my accumulated value is in memory slot 5 and that I then output the value in memory 5.  I just care that my accumulated value is 'a1' and that I output 'a1' and my accumulator chooses a location and keeps track of it for me.

""fprintf(""%d"",a1)"" is a big function that probably gets replaced with tens or hundreds of lines of assembly code.  What it does is it prints the characters between the quotation marks onto the screen of the computer.  But it also checks if the '%' character exists, which tells it to do something special.  it checks the following character 'd' to know *what* special thing it's supposed to do.  In this case it's supposed to replace '%d' with the value specified by the variable in the function, a1.  So this function will print out some text, plus the decimal numerals of the value stored in whatever memory slot corresponds to the provided variable 'a1'.

Newer programming languages like Python and Java are just languages that take the abstracting an extra step further, letting you specify with a few English-like words concepts that would take many lines of code to specify in C, which would themselves take hundreds or thousands of lines to write in Assembly, which need to be translated to thousands of machine instructions for the computer to actually run.

For instance, on your TI-83 (or equivalent) calculator from highschool, you would just type ""2+3+6+9enter"" and it would output a 20.  Your TI calculator was running a scripting language called TI-basic which was doing all of this under the hood, translating what you wrote to computer instructions to be executed, which includes specifically lighting up individual pixels on your screen to display characters.

So programming is telling a computer to do *exactly* what you want it to do.  Computer programmers are lazy, and telling a computer *exactly* what to do is boring, especially if there is a pattern to it.  So computer programming languages are made to make providing instructions to computers more efficient and convenient for the programmer, so they only have to specify the important stuff."	2	0

I wouldnâ€™t worry if you get a taste of it but I wouldnâ€™t make a habit of it since it tastes pretty nasty. I also use it around the house for other smells and it works great	2	0

Antes de hacer nada de esto, ya que dices que es solo para juegos, la GPU es lo que mas rendimiento te va a dar en videojuegos. Cambiar a una mejor mobo o una mejor ram te va a dar un incremento muy pequeÃ±o en comparaciÃ³n. Si quieres mejores graficos, GPU es lo principal.

SSD, 480Gb es poquillo metele el m2 que quieres, esta mejora es casi obligada

GPU, la 1660s esta bien para 1080p, vas a correr todos los juegos con grÃ¡ficos bajados, y con el FSR de amd te va aguantar bien. Aun asÃ­ si quieres mejor rendimiento y no gastarte mucho yo pillarÃ­a alguna de segunda mano baratita como una 6700xt y a tirar. Una mejor grÃ¡fica estarÃ­a limitada por la CPU. Si quieres una GPU mas potente, necesitas nueva CPU si o si. 

Es decir, yo mejoraria la ssd si o si, y como mucho la GPU a una 6700xt. Si todavia quieres jugar con mayor calidad el salto de mejora serÃ­a GPU+CPU+PSU"	2	0
