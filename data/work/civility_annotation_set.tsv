The woman who juat grabbed his neck? This isnt some freaking prank. He has no obligation to help that bitch. If a man deliberately brushes his hand on a womans ass as he walks by gets kicked in the testicles by her as hard as she could, would you expect her to call the police and check on him? Do I have to explain how dangerous a kick to the balla can be regardless of the initial sensation? Nope, because nobody on this website cares. I go in TwoX and I see someone say they did that and its upvoted(sometimes the woman even has a bit of formal martial arts training/athletic).

First you say philosophy should be dismissed because there is too much consensus and everyone toes a party line. Now you at it should be dismissed because there is too much consensus?

I am saying that although the philosophy in our time is largely under consensus, philosophy throughout the ages has come up with arguments and counter-arguments to virtually every question.

&gt;Why do you think philosophers don’t use logic and rhetoric? Logic is one of the first classes any philosophy major takes. Especially philosophers in the analytic tradition (America and England). If you’re applying logic to problems like these you’re already philosopher.

So it is no longer fair to assume that if someone you don't know has a darkened face, they're likely to be intending offense. 

Sure, maybe they just faceplanted in tar and then put on lipstick without noticing it. 

But if they are intentionally doing what they and I would both recognize as """"doing blackface"""", then they know very well what it's message is. 

Maybe they consider it sarcastic, or think they are making a political point, I'm sure that deep within their heart many of them don't feel angry or hateful against black people. 

But then again, many of the peopel watching minstrel shows weren't either, they just wanted to have a fun sunday afternoon watching the jigaboos do a funny little song and dance.

But why actual violence? Why not ritual combat by FPS, for instance?

&gt; And assuming proper handicapping I don't see how it could be used as a threat. At best a challenge.

And how would that work, exactly? I mean, I could say, wear a bunch of weighted clothing. But that weight only really applies downwards, I can overcome it for at least some time, I could use it to my advantage, and if I get somebody in a headlock it's not going to do a whole lot to diminish my muscular strength. It may even augment it.

Say, making me wear a heavy glove is only going to make everything worse, because F=MA. With more mass in my fist I can punch proportionally harder. It'll wear me out sooner of course, but if I manage to land a hit early it's going to hurt a lot.

&gt; As for why somebody would follow along, because clearly too many couple enjoy hitting each other.

On the face of it, this seems like most people would agree that it's trivially true. For example, studies have shown by looking at things like response times for assigning people of different races to """"good"""" or """"bad"""" categories that *nearly everyone* holds some racist biases. 

Is this really the view you're trying to have changed?

It seems to me that when people call someone a """"bigot"""", they aren't saying that they have some number of greater or lesser racist views, but that the person """"is a racist"""" or """"is a misogynist"""" in a more encompassing way that just the trivially true statement that they have a view such views. 

If your view is that someone can have broadly encompassing racist views that color their interactions with members of another race in noticeable and significant ways, without being a """"bigot"""" then I think you're going to have a much hard time arguing that. 

To do so, you'd have to ignore all of the *other* dictionary definitions of bigot that are more of the form """"a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions"""" (oxford dictionaries) and """"One who is strongly partial to one's own group, religion, race, or politics and is intolerant of those who differ."""" (American Heritage Dictionary).

Dominant and recessive traits in DNA occur because of the way our alleles function, not due to some external factor determining their value.

&gt;Superior traits in male adults (physical strength, endurance, intelligence, skin tone, etc...) attract females (they can't help but be attracted, they're CODED this way) because they have a higher chance of survival in that specific part of the earth. The most complete set of desirable traits is the """"alpha male"""". He chooses the equally genetically desirable female.

The problem with this argument that I see is that it assumes there is a universally agreed upon list of traits in order of value. Because every human has different traits that they personally value, there can never be a universally agreed upon list of traits.

&gt;because they have a higher chance of survival in that specific part of the earth. The most complete set of desirable traits is the """"alpha male"""". He chooses the equally genetically desirable female.

While survival plays a big part in mating in the wild, its not the only factor present. Many species such as peacocks possess traits that do not help them survive in the wild at all, but serve as a desirable trait for courtship. There can be no most desirable male or female for everyone, there can only be a most desirable for every individual person. Because of this, there can be no Alpha who is most desirable.

&gt;Regarding aggressive behavior, Adam misrepresents the traits of the dominant male. The meek rule the earth. Listen to the world's most powerful people speak. The last thing they are is aggressive because it displays weakness in their ability to control their own emotions.

First off, I think we have to set some definitions here. What makes a person powerful? Different people are powerful in different ways. A MMA champion is  powerful in a different way than an influential businessman. From the way you phrase your argument, I'm going to assume you mean world leaders. Yet even there there is a variety. Take Kim Jung Un, by being aggressive with threats he gets what he wants. Or Justin Trudeau, who is almost never aggressive with threats, but rather aggressive against trade pressure from the US, a nation much more powerful than Canada, or Saudi Arabia recently. Aggression doesn't always mean losing your cool, aggression can be used as a tool to power, much the same way calm speech can be.

&gt;Being kind also actually takes more balls than being an asshole, simply because we are socially conditioned to think 'asshole = she will let me fuck her',

I believe you're using we incorrectly to account for a large group of people without clarifying who that group is. But I can say for myself that I was not conditioned to believe that, and I hope there are many others who were not conditioned that way either.

&gt;and if you go against the grain to be a man of honor, you will encounter resistance, but reap huge rewards as your character is revealed.

You use the term against the grain, but I don't understand what you argue the social norm is. Neither do you elaborate on the resistance nor the rewards, and this in general seems to be assuming that everyone knows what you do and thinks how you do which we do not.

TL;DR - There is no optimal combination of traits since everyone has different preferences. Aggression is not a bad thing, it is a tool and usually a carefully calculated one.

1.) Big Macs example - it is possible to have unhealthy habits/addictions, so first, I'd argue that John is committing """"unlove"""" against himself by not fixing those habits. Secondly, are his parents justified in correcting the behavior against his will... My framework, in it's current state, mildly addresses this saying that there are universals truths and personal ones. I say that one should not proselytize/force their personal beliefs, maybe they shouldn't enforce universal ones either? But then how could you justify imprisoning a criminal (which I think is justifiable, it maximizes love towards the criminals future victims)?

2.) 1950s homosexuality, most evidence was against gays. This is indeed another difficult situation. The evidence wasn't arrived by through honest scientific/experimental means (I'm assuming). Since the evidence wasn't truthful, it shouldn't hold weight. We have similar problems today in the healthcare industry. Misinformation abounds in pharmaceuticals, alternative medicines, diet, exercise, etc. I would say that just because somethign is published in a journal, or had an experiment done, doesn't make it a truth.

Say, for example, that CMVitis has a value of -0.5  That means 

* Non-existence to having CMVitis is moving from 0 to -0.5.  Total change?  -0.5
* Healthy child to a child with CMVitis moves from somewhere around 0.5 to -0.5.  Total change? -1

It looks to me like that's twice as bad, according to your own math.


---
Further, I'm not certain that your math is valid.  Is non-existence *really* better than having pain?  It's not pain all the time, is it, that it is worse than nothing?

I would argue that the appropriate scale is 0 for non-existence, 1 for perfect health, and every malady adds some (negative) value to the sum.

Using *that* math, then you're right that the *end result* of giving birth to an otherwise healthy child with an incurable disease would have the same *result* as infecting an otherwise healthy child (ie, 0+1+(-0.5)=0.5 == 1+(-0.5)=0.5), there's still the question of *our change.*

* In the case of the fetus live, you're allowing their value to go from 0 to 0.5.  That's a change of +0.5
* In the case of infecting the healthy child, you're *forcing* the value to go from 1 to 0.5.  That's a change of -0.5

So, I'm afraid, using either your math or mine, the result is clear:

In both cases, the infection of a healthy child has a greater negative consequence.

Additionally, there is a *huge* difference in Agency.  Your entire question is attempting to draw an equivalency between harm you have no control over, and harm that you're actively causing.

The only problem i have so far is that """"understandable"""" has nothing at all to do with what is """"deserved""""

I completely understand a man who beats another man bloody for groping his wifes butt.  I FULLY understand why a man would do that, but the man doesn't deserve to be beat half to death for something like that. We live in a society and we have to uphold society with guidelines.  We can't have people dishing out beatings for things that we *ALL* would perfectly understand *why* they did it right?  We as a single person in that society, do not get to dictate what is deserved, thats for society as a whole to do.  Equally, it's also not up to us to dictate what innocent lives die in order to save our own fate either, that's up to a power higher than us as well.

So what is understandable is often times not what is deserved, even if *I* FULLY understand why someone did something.

So if we don't have an actual limiting factor for what is worth killing innocents, to avoid fates, and if we also accept that 'understanding' someones actions does not necessarily *condone* or make them undeserving of consequences, I find it difficult to find any concrete stance I could accept for killing an innocent person, to save your own innocent fate."	1	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

Basically, when you only put down one vote, you can't safely vote for a smaller party, because that means you're not voting for a bigger party that, even if they're not your favourite, could still beat your least favourite party. Over time in this voting system, voters naturally gravitate towards two big parties, because it's the strategic way to fight against your least favourite party. They're no longer voting for who they actually want, because it's a wasted vote.

While our voting system (called alternative or preferential vote) doesn't prevent two major parties - there's other political factors that affect this - it does mean that smaller parties can get more influence and can't be ignored. I'm basically arguing that while a two party system does cause major problems, I don't think it's the main thing to focus on here. The problem is a voting system that heavily incentives this result, and that can't shift away from it."	1	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

I am a contract pilot and I get work in town A and town B, so I am constantly going back and forth, sometimes a few times a week. I also get a few overnights a month, so I get to travel around a bit and see places. Most of my friends these days live in town A, so its nice to have a place there when I want to spend time with them. Since I am not technically employed and its all contract work, I can turn jobs down if I am unable to work it out with my schedule. I also get to see my parents alot, and my dad is a really good cook, so I eat well when I am back in town B.

Rawls explains this with that after certain point of wealth people prefer spiritual ends but apparently it does not go for the rich but they can bargain what ever wages for them. 

Religions usually also require loads of money so they cannot be seen as separate matters.

Plus no Christian person who thinks God created all resources for humans could accept the second principle that has that producersist and reciprocal emphasis that attempts to justify producerism without the calculability of just deseert. So it is all about bargaining wages, not giving each according to his contribution, for example."	1	0	random_sample

It's always been a dictatorship. Army swears allegiance to CCP, not the people. Xi has always been a dictator. China is a nuclear-armed power, and is in the process of upsizing its nuclear arsenal. Nobody's going to bomb them into the Stone Age - not without being bombed back. Remember, Chinese have bombers with missiles that can reach continental USA. They are also in the process of acquiring Pacific island bases closer to USA. Fighting them would not be easy.	2	0	random_sample
