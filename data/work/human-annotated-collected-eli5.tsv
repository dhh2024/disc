By ""reformat"" I assumed the OP meant that they took their OS disk and did a complete re-install via reformat, as reformatting usually means wiping a disk clean.

An updated, larger OS should not degrade computer performance much. (Note: I do not include brand new OS's, ie Win7 v. Win XP, just updates like Service Packs). 

Also, Hard drive performance can degrade. RAM can degrade as well, but usually RAM errors just cause the computer to not boot at all. So for physical degradation, usually it's the CPU, GPU, or other complicated IC, or it's the hard drive. Most other components, degradation = hard failure.

If you have a 10 year old computer, AND you are using the latest software, it's not going to be pretty. Hardware performance down and software demands up... somethings gotta give.

Someone convicted of 125 counts of attempted murder (say, for an arson at an occupied building or something filed under RICO statutes) could quite easily get a much longer sentence than someone convicted of one count of murder.

The way humans measure time (seconds, hours, years, etc.) is arbitrary. Time exists even if there's no one to measure it. Atoms will still decay and gradually fall into disorder. This is called entropy. It's why people age. It's why ice will melt if you leave it out on your counter.  Us measuring or not measuring the duration, doesn't change that the duration exists.

Also what you are referring to as ""space-time"" is not entirely accurate. While it's true that time is often considered a fourth dimension including the 3 spacial dimensions, ""Space-time"" isn't based on our units of measurements. Spacetime is based on relativity where space and time are both part of the same thing. And anything with mass will bend space-time. This is gravity. Time dilation is also from relativity, where something moving close to speed of light will experience time slower relative to something at rest frame. At the speed of light, photons don't experience time at all. Again, all of this holds true regardless of if we measure it or not."	4	0	185	0	False	True
