An updated, larger OS should not degrade computer performance much. (Note: I do not include brand new OS's, ie Win7 v. Win XP, just updates like Service Packs). 

Also, Hard drive performance can degrade. RAM can degrade as well, but usually RAM errors just cause the computer to not boot at all. So for physical degradation, usually it's the CPU, GPU, or other complicated IC, or it's the hard drive. Most other components, degradation = hard failure.

If you have a 10 year old computer, AND you are using the latest software, it's not going to be pretty. Hardware performance down and software demands up... somethings gotta give.

Someone convicted of 125 counts of attempted murder (say, for an arson at an occupied building or something filed under RICO statutes) could quite easily get a much longer sentence than someone convicted of one count of murder. But generally, given *identical* circumstances, someone convicted of attempted murder is going to get a shorter sentence than someone convicted of murder (that being said, there is never going to be a situation with _identical_ circumstances).	3	['was found']	1	1	0.3333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['was found']	1	1	0.3333333333333333	1	17	4697437	explainlikeimfive	28260051123	https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/42uvsq/_/czdaz03/	246664826	28260037222.0	2016-01-27 01:26:56		esk_209	3	0	131	0	False	False	27.53

23	"Time is a thing, regardless of how we measure it. The way humans measure time (seconds, hours, years, etc.) is arbitrary. Time exists even if there's no one to measure it. Atoms will still decay and gradually fall into disorder. This is called entropy. It's why people age. It's why ice will melt if you leave it out on your counter.  Us measuring or not measuring the duration, doesn't change that the duration exists.

Also what you are referring to as ""space-time"" is not entirely accurate. While it's true that time is often considered a fourth dimension including the 3 spacial dimensions, ""Space-time"" isn't based on our units of measurements. Spacetime is based on relativity where space and time are both part of the same thing. And anything with mass will bend space-time. This is gravity. Time dilation is also from relativity, where something moving close to speed of light will experience time slower relative to something at rest frame. At the speed of light, photons don't experience time at all. Again, all of this holds true regardless of if we measure it or not."	16	['is called', 'is often considered']	2	2	0.125	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['is called', 'is often considered']	2	2	0.125	1	23	4697437	explainlikeimfive	41382726585	https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/zmtv5o/_/j0e7g6x/	2154661116	41381718950.0	2022-12-16 00:12:14	65631564.0	Im_using_headphones	4	0	185	0	False	True	76.62

34	"Well, how far it travels is not at all a function of the photon's energy. Photons are massless particles, and consequently always move at the speed of light until they are stopped, whatever energy they have.

The color of light is a consequence of its wavelength/frequency. When you shine a light through, say, a red-tinted film, what's happening is that the pigment (or what have you) in the film absorbs all frequencies of the passing light *except* red. So if a photon's frequency is within that range of reds, it will pass through, otherwise it will be absorbed. By contrast, if you pass that same beam of light through a perfectly translucent prism, it will all pass through."	6	['are stopped', 'will be absorbed']	2	2	0.3333333333333333	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are stopped', 'will be absorbed']	2	2	0.3333333333333333	1	34	4697437	explainlikeimfive	41555594048	https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/104w4jj/_/j394lkw/	2184999679	41555266574.0	2023-01-06 22:00:00	1644906394577.0	Chadmartigan	2	0	118	0	False	True	68.4

36	True.   At the beginning of your career, you don’t leak anything because frankly, it’s so obscure and low profile no one cares.   Eventually, when you do work on something well known, it’s not worth the risk to your career to leak info.   You also may be too busy and jaded to care about impressing internet strangers.   Which isn’t to say that leaks don’t happen.   They do.   However, you might also be surprised how many of them are deliberately put out there by networks or studios for publicity.	7	['are deliberately put']	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	[]	0	0	0.0	0	['are deliberately put']	1	1	0.14285714285714285	1	36	4697437	explainlikeimfive	38614844873	https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/rse0k6/_/hqma4zt/	1680269910	38614511896.0	2021-12-31 00:28:52	55493917.0	purplepinksky	220	0	87	0	False	False	70.73
