Sorry, ""heavier than air machine"".

So, does that mean a glider is not an aircraft?  It's not a plane?

When I look at definition it states "" ... that derives lift from the vehicles forward speed ...""  That seems to include glider.

Oh sorry, have you never made a paper airplane?  If you want to pick holes in common vernacular, I'm sure there are a few hundred thousand references to paper airplanes on the web you can also correct :)

"	"StanzySmith @ 2012-05-22 04:46:30 :

We could argue all day citing quotes for references that either endorse our own opinions, or denounce the others. 

You quote one source, for instance, and here are some I could find, that take a different opinion.  All these are legitimate sources:

“to fly without moving wings” 
“a heavier than air flying machine”

I don’t think anyone could say anything to convince you to change your opinion.

Whether it’s called a “plane” or “airplane” or “aircraft”, are these all the same thing?  Are they canonical forms?

Is a “ship” the same as a “boat”, is “pop” the same as “soda”?

If you care about my thoughts, I think “plane” is a contraction of “airplane”, which is something that “planes” through the air (just you like can aqua-plane through water, or hydroplane).  The verb “plane” again referencing the same sources you quote, and others, is about generating lift from forward motion; with no reference to how the forward motion is generated (powered or not).

An airplane is something that planes through the air, just like something that planes through water is a hydroplane.  It does not need to be powered.  To you, it does, and I’m not going to try and change your mind.  I’m no more able to tell you than to tell you that you should prefer the Beach Boys instead of the Beatles.

Common vernacular, or wisdom of the crowd, defines how we use words.  Show 1,000 people a paper airplane, and I’d wager over 98% would call it a “paper airplane” or ""paper plane"".  Some will call it a “paper dart”, and yes, some might call it a “paper glider”. But most will call it a paper airplane.  Does that make it not a ""airplane""?  (It's might not be a ""dart"" either!)

Neither of is disputing that a glider is a glider.  I think the only issue is that in your region of the world, when people talk about a “plane” it is something different to an “airplane” (do you say “soda” or “pop”?)

For you, I’ll be happy to translate the headline
“TIL: Sir George Cayley’s Coach driver flew in the first heavier-than-air-craft 50 years  before the Wright brothers …”

cheshirelaugh @ 2012-05-22 07:17:55 :

No I compared it to the *time* the Wright brothers flew!

If I mentioned it relative to the time the steam engine was built, would I be calling it a steam engine.  If I mentioned when it flew compared to the First World War, would I be implicitly comparing it to a War !!?!?!

You don't understand the game if you don't think the first 20 minutes of a 40 minute game are entertaining.

hartnell19 @ 2012-09-18 15:32:58 :

That was his point. I'm sure football action would be entertaining in the entire 10 minutes and 43 seconds of 'action.' The first half isn't two sides barely confronting each other to avoid making mistakes in football.

You could call 20 minutes of macro as 'action', but I wouldn't call it entertaining. The ending, however, can be very entertaining, which is why I usually skip through the first half of any starcraft game I watch, assuming its over 5-10 minutes.

He is correct though. Anyway the argument is simple, a 10/20/30/40 minute game of Starcraft is just, that infact it is SO damn rare that we see a moment replayed that it is a big deal in itself. However the statement here is basically you are watching 10 minutes of different things happening where as the rest are just replays of those 10 minutes or commercials or people coming up with a plan. Starcraft players come up with a plan on the fly.

Not that Starcraft is any better than American football, I wouldn't know as I haven't seen it all I take from this thread is that American TV sucks ass just like the whole Olympics posts lead me to believe.

--------------------------------

hartnell19 @ 2012-09-18 20:34:47 :

That is correct, but it doesn't pertain to his nor my argument. He claimed that the initial macro of a game is just as entertaining as the late game. Regardless of whether commercials are playing during the macro period or not doesn't change the fact that that period lacks action.

--------------------------------

Norrisemoe @ 2012-09-19 02:37:12 :

Hmmm sorry I went off on a tangent I guess, sorry about that, assuming there is that macro period which there is in 90% of games you are right :)

As far as I know PETA doesn't run a shelter and only euthanizes animals as a proxy for other organizations who cannot do it humanely or lack the financial means.  Here's a letter that explains some of it: http://faculty.smu.edu/jkazez/animal%20rights/Response%20to%20PETA%20kills%20animals.htm

It's really up to you to decide how you feel about it; but be careful not to see through one side's propaganda only to fully buy into the other side's.

Yeah, everyone loves to circlejerk about how evil PETA is. Thank you for providing actual information about them. I'm not sure why normally skeptical people are so eager to believe this statistic without questioning it. It doesn't make sense for a pro-animal rights group to just put down animals without reason.

--------------------------------

Mantissa128 @ 2012-12-01 18:32:55 :

Well, it doesn't make sense for an anti-cruelty organization to call fish [sea kittens](http://features.peta.org/PETASeaKittens/) either, but that sure doesn't stop them.

PETA is the SRS of the animal social justice world.

--------------------------------

HarryWragg @ 2012-12-01 18:51:39 :

No, it DOES make sense. They are trying to make children feel the same way about fish as they do about kittens. This is logical, whether you agree with it or not.

Mantissa128 @ 2012-12-01 19:06:17 :

&gt;make children feel the same way about fish as they do about kittens

&gt;DOES make sense

&gt;This is logical

I'm not questioning the logic so much as a basic level of sanity here. A paranoiac's arguments are logical. 9/11 and chemtrail conspiracy theorists' arguments are logical. That's not really the point though.

The point is that PETA believes meat is murder, killing and eating fish is murder, and they have some reasonable hope that a PR campaign calling fish 'sea kittens' is going to change society's attitude. These folks suffer from the same cultural issues as SRS, where all they hear is their own arguments over and over, and become convinced by them.

In this context, raising the (false) idea that PETA is wrong for euthanizing animals is easily accepted without scrutiny because it attaches to their well-known loopiness.

EDIT: oh noes, teh karma

--------------------------------

HarryWragg @ 2012-12-01 19:13:50 :

I'd hardly consider the idea that ""eating meat is wrong"" is some crazy, loopy idea. It may not be an idea you agree with, but considering that there are a fair number of vegetarians/vegans, it's obvious that there are plenty of people who do.

Kids are fairly impressionable. A number of children have fish as pets. It's hardly unreasonable to assume that such a campaign would have no success.

Oh, and on SRS: they do miss obvious references/sarcasm sometimes, but they do raise a fair point pretty often: reddit has tons of misogyny, racism and homophobia. (Of course they're tons of really great people here too, who are none of these things.)

--------------------------------

Mantissa128 @ 2012-12-01 19:27:50 :

&gt;I'd hardly consider the idea that ""eating meat is wrong"" is some crazy, loopy idea

Never said it was. I have no trouble separating the idea from the loopy organization that has chosen to rally around it. PETA is a very, very poor advocate for it, because they are so extreme they undermine their own message.

Next you'll be telling me SRS is fine because the social justice movement is legitimate. It is legitmate, but SRS is a poor advocate for it in precisely the same way.

&gt;It's hardly unreasonable to assume that such a campaign would have no success

If you can't perceive how silly sea kittens are as a PR campaign, I'm afraid no one on earth can convince you otherwise, so I'll stop here."	"Mantissa128 @ 2012-12-02 02:46:28 :

I'm sorry, but that is a brash a bold statement. Yes he did murder four people, but his time in jail changed him in ways only seen in movies. His mission was never to create the monster gang we know today. He wrote books urging kids and teens to turn away from that life because of what it had done to him and his. He spoke out avidly against gang mentality. He was deserving of that Peace Prize Nomination, he was deserving of the love he got from those who wanted his execution excused. He was a changed man in the truest sense of the word. Should he have been released, absolutely not, but it was not right for him to be executed.

Instead of fighting it, he decided to do something about it. Second, How dare you insult him without even knowing the man. He made stupid decisions when he was kid, and he paid for it with time in prison. I wasn't trying to make a hero out of him, I was trying to emphasize the fact that he wanted to make a difference in this world, and try to right his wrongs. How dare you insult kids in the hood, Just because they are in the situation they are in doesn't mean they are beneath you asshole. If you are going to assume things about me and Tookie and every kid in the hood, i'll assume shit about you. You are a self centered asshole, who cares little about anyone else in this world. You have no humility at all as well as having no filter about what your should say. I never said he should be released, I said he shouldn't have been executed. He did write books that changed kids and teens life in the hood by making them turn away. So before you make a stupid a ignorant statement such as that you better get it right.

You don't even read what I write. Peak production in northern Europe is much higher than it could ever be in the middle east. I am writing my thesis about that stuff. Stop arguing about fertility without knowing what it means and where it comes from. - Yes, around rivers you can get pretty respectable agricultural output in arid regions. But these are fertile spots in between and of course you could feed societies from 2000 years ago pretty well with this amount of surface because those societies were tiny. In Germany 50% of all the land is used to grow food with an average productivity only the very best spots in the middle east can match. In tropical climates you got other (more complicated) production inhibiting factors. That's the reason why population growth started in our climate zone and none other.

You are just throwing some qualitative historical evidence around without comparing relations in a relative fashion whatsoever. Of course Egypt could ship food to Rome. They were not using all of their land for themselves. Doesn't mean that if you increase production (to feed more people in your land) you won't hit a wall earlier than someone else will.

&gt;Our success is because of the ingenuity of our forefathers, that's an area our society in particular exceeds itself. It though isn't necessary to justify our oppression of others, the simple fact we have the capacity to do such is.

The Nazi party did various things outside of this, including being the first to lead an anti-smoking campaign. Unemployment was very quickly addressed alongside the introduction of welfare programs, they invented the highway in response to their development of the Volkswagen which was to be a car that is affordable by all people.

They were still dicks, but I think people forget that most of the world were dicks as well.

It's strange how people think that the Nazi's were just plainly and blatantly oppressive providing no benefits and yet still had the support they had from the people.

See, the economic growth the NSDAP was suddenly able to foster when the country was crippled was neither the work of some genius, nor a magic miracle. They build an infrastructure and an industry that was entirely aimed towards war. There was no way that this could have been a sustainable development for any period of time without their estimations of what they might have won in the war.

The morality western societies are built upon is one of the value of individual human life because after that's the most important thing every single one of us has in this world. We got to do our best to live by these values as best as we can because openly disregarding these values would endanger our way of life from the inside. We might not be able to live up to these values as much as we'd want to but we are doing so better than anybody else on the planet.

Amorn7125 @ 2013-07-19 18:21:09 :

Not at all, the blind idiocy in what you advocate is utterly clear, the individual is a worthless entity by any standard. You can't look at humanity on an individual level, while providing main value to the individual, and gain anything bar a wholly hedonistic view on life as a whole, it becomes wholly about short term happiness and pleasure which in reality degrades all real meaning from human existence. 

The greater good requires one look beyond themselves; to the collective body and the collective culture it carries on. Our contribution to the body is all that matters and indeed it's all that lives on beyond our deaths, our whole legacy and purpose. If some must die to help millions others then it is a necessary sacrifice and the predispositions of those who must suffer cannot be considered relevant in said decision, we have to be hard (morality is simply weakness to be overcome) and efficient or else we will lose everything. It's not a choice we have, we either abide by life as it is or we fall pray to it.

There is no conscious collective on this planet that has any reason to strive. It's all just humans. It's all just human judgement. You are not speaking for anything bigger than yourself. You are speaking as yourself. Who are you to tell some guy that he has to die so you can witness some progress?

That's an utterly idiotic viewpoint, it removes all purpose and meaning from human existence and renders is wholly empty and hollow. If we have no greater goal of purpose to strive towards the only logical solution is to OD on heroine, to maximize happiness with he least suffering. People aren't equal in their value or their worth, that is decided by the level of their contribution. If some have to suffer for others to prosper it simply is the way of the world, might is right and if you can force others to adhere to such you have earnt the right to commit it. 

The fact that many humans are narrow minded and rather selfish doesn't influence the fact we should still drive for something more and bring them around (by force if necessary) to undertaking a lifestyle more suitable to the greater good. Otherwise all we would have is anarchy and chaos, the simple fact is if people want to prosper (and the evidence suggests they do) one must sacrifice some freedom for said prosperity, it's unfortunate but necessary.

The structure aids that very goal you talk about though, it provides humans with better lives. The fact of the matter is when making collective decisions subjective feelings become irrelevant, all that matters is the objective and that serves to further the goals of the human conscious on a collective level (which is by all means more important.) The fact is it's simply a necessity, for the alternative simply opens you up for having your capacity to prosperity removed by another.

Let's be completely honest here; the Far East, Middle East and otherwise had lots of potential to prosperity (in terms of land value) as much as the West has. Western superiority is by all means cultural, the way our societies are organized is simply better at bringing about results (thus why Eastern nations can only modernize when they embrace Western ideals.) A lot of people had the same potential but some squandered it and they have only themselves to blame.

Then why did Middle Eastern states exceed in development terms the West until the Mongol Conquests? Then why the Chinese until the dawn of the modern age? These things wern't rooted wholly in soil quality...

player1337 @ 2013-07-22 17:20:36 :

The main point here is climate. Until the discovery of fossil fuels living in the Middle East was simply easier than living in northern Europe (everything above the alps). People really underestimate what half a metre of snow does to a society that heats with wood and has no access to engines to keep the streets free. Another point is that a certain level of technology is required to really use a soils potential. A human with an ochs and a plow is only going to make so much of a difference.

Of course it's always a political thing as well. The reformation of Christianity and the age of enlightenment were incremental to making things better and had they come earlier we would surely have had our progress earlier. But nonetheless the explosive growth our society experienced would not have been possible in different climates because those couldn't provide the food necessary to foster such growth from the ground up. The middle east definitely couldn't. I am not an expert on China at all but when looking at the maps I see a country that is way more heterogenous than northern Europe and I doubt that had the steam engine been invented there it would have made the same kind of difference if the circumstances necessary to allow for such an invention had even been there.

The point here is that you are being an arrogant asshole to the rest of the world because you give yourself the right to rule over the lesser people because you think that our own success has only been build on the ingenuity of our forefathers when in fact they had extremely favourable starting positions in the modern ages.

Amorn7125 @ 2013-07-22 18:42:09 :

Vast parts of Turkey, Iran, the Levent, Egypt, etc, etc are all vastly fertile and these places dominated the world culturally for hundreds of years, yet in the end Western society triumphed and that triumph should not be underplayed in the slightest. Western values and ideas proved themselves again and again to be superior, China was defeated because of her own arrogance and reluctance to modernize (not because of issues relating to her geography) while on the flip side Japan prospered and succeeded because she embraced western values and ideals, implementing them universally. 

This whole theory you seem to be championing is factually wrong, the west ""had it good"" but so did so many other places yet they utterly failed to form social systems which best facilitated success they have for that only themselves to blame. Let us remember Ancient Rome shipped in its food FROM EGYPT not TO EGYPT and the hugely fertile and capable soil of that region gave those who inhabited it everything they needed, they just failed to utilize it.

Our success is because of the ingenuity of our forefathers, that's an area our society in particular exceeds itself. It though isn't necessary to justify our oppression of others, the simple fact we have the capacity to do such is. "	"Amorn7125 @ 2013-07-22 21:39:05 :

I'm not a bloody yank you fool...

Well then you're thesis sounds a bit crap in all honesty, you've based an entire argument on incorrect rational. Throughout history China seems to support as many people, with as much civilization as say Europe as a whole (about 60 million each in the 1300s, they seem to throughout history stay very close as figures to one another). It's only in the period sort of post the 1600s that everything seems to swing wholly in the Wests favor and that's entirely from cultural framework that allows faster adaptation and pushes more successful qualities in the individual. Having more growing land didn't make that happen, society and the people within it made that happen. If our climate made the situation so special why did the population in India or China expand at similar rates if not faster with no signs of stalling? The Middle East as well had many hugely productive areas, given their lower population (and the fact numbers don't mean everything) they had as good of a shot as we did. 

Europe has it good but so did endless other places in the world in terms of farmland and I don't believe for one second population levels reached such in most of these places, prior to western domination of the world, that they where insufficient in the slightest for those utilizing them. India, China, Japan and even such places as the Americas, South Africa and New Zealand had all the farmland availability that existed in Europe yet they all failed to reach the same level of capacity as the Western World, it's a trend you can't ignore just because it suits your sensibilities. 

--------------------------------

player1337 @ 2013-07-23 09:05:56 :

&gt;I'm not a bloody yank you fool...

You are doing your best to give the impression.

There are primarily two things needed for progress: Ressources and a social structure that fosters it. Those two are intertwined at every step of the way. It's much more complicated than: ""In 1600 reformation happened and then people were suddenly awesome."" The way people think and the way societies are (and espcecially were structured in pre industrial times) is very dependend on the land and the climate around them and the possibilities they have. Historical analysis like you do is always very one dimensional. I don't claim to be able to giving you a complete rundown of all the important factors but it is important to know that everything we do is linked to the usage of ressources with some kinds of ressources being more beneficial in certain stages of development than others and these ressources aren't equally distributed around the planet. It's for a fact that western Europe, the east of the US and the northeast of China are the places where you got large amounts of the most fertile land on the planet. Explosive industrial growth has happened in the only place where the entire population of a continent had access to such soil (China has a whole lot of shit land as well). Of course that's not the only determining factor but you can believe that it's just a coincidence because it suits your sensibilities.

It's not just about having a lot of people. Having a lot of people is a necessity for progress but it's also a necessity to have as few as possible work on farms and for them to not have to deal with their own poverty on a daily basis. And there you are making it way too easy for yourself by saying: ""So, why didn't you invent the steam engine instead? Because your society sucks!""

--------------------------------

Amorn7125 @ 2013-07-23 10:16:36 :

The point I'm making is other societies had similar access and seemingly didn't have enough issues with farming to provoke a lack of a ""thinking class"" developing (the Islamic Academic classes where large and very forward thinking prior to the Mongol Invasions). I accept Western Europe had a comfortable position but at the same time that's not by any means an exclusive status (if you look at nations today by their proportion of arable land to non-arable, lots of non-European nations, even African ones, exceed 50%). What made the difference was the manner in which Western society was organized and maintained, a manner which by all means seems to provide a more efficient usage of the resources and people which are available to any given society. Having a strong starting position made this possible of course but it's not to say if China had the same cultural revolution they couldn't have done the same thing. 


--------------------------------

player1337 @ 2013-07-23 11:13:07 :

&gt;The point I'm making is other societies had similar access and seemingly didn't have enough issues with farming to provoke a lack of a ""thinking class""

I did explain this in a lot of detail already and I will do so again: Islamic societies had a competetive advantage in the middle ages because they didn't have to deal with harsh winters and their soil in combination with the amount of water they had is perfectly fine to feed a civilization in the middle ages.

That doesn't mean there was the same potential for growth there. Do you even have any idea what kind of difference it makes when you got 800 litres of rain per m² per year compared to 400 litres in the mediterranian and less than 100 litres in the arid reagions that make up most of the lands in the middle east.

&gt;if you look at nations today by their proportion of arable land to non-arable, lots of non-European nations, even African ones, exceed 50%

Arable land is not the same everywhere just because it is arable. There are huge differences there. What counts as arable land in the centre of Africa is not anywhere near as productive and easy to use as what we have here.

&gt;if China had the same cultural revolution they couldn't have done the same thing. 

You are talking as if the cultural revolution came out of thin air. People are shaped by everything around them. Social ideas are formed within a context and a lot of that context is factores that are not determined by humans.

--------------------------------

Amorn7125 @ 2013-07-23 11:57:21 :

On my phone but quick point

Their is a fundamental issue with what your saying, the ideals which drove western superiority emerged in the classical age in Ancient Rome and Greece. That's long, long prior to when maintaining population levels would have been such a problem as you describe. 

--------------------------------

player1337 @ 2013-07-23 12:40:31 :

Rome and Greece are right between the Middle East and Northern Europe and there would certainly have been enough time for other people to pick up these ideals if they had been suitable for them in the time we spent bashing each others hads in and sitting in small castles.

It's not about maintaining population levels either. It's about creating a certain population density (more people on less space means more efficiency) and allowing a certain amount of people to not work in agriculture (not only thinkers but production, administration and service workers as well)

--------------------------------

Amorn7125 @ 2013-07-23 13:25:09 :

But Northern Europe did embrace those ideas... Russia didn't see itself as the new Rome for nothing and Sweden/Norway/Finland all fell into the ""Western mindset"" by the beginning of the modern age. Remember Sweden's growth as a power was mainly blocked by the rise of others then any real failings on their own part. 

The reason Europe embraced these ideals over others is probably in large part to do with Catholicism but also because Europe saw itself in vast parts as the successor to Rome and the ideals it embodied. That's why you've got a Holy Roman Empire (which is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor really an Empire) as a legacy of Rome lived on in the people and nobility which they strived towards recreating. 

Elsewhere in the world that was non-existent (even in Rome's Middle Eastern territories) and that's particularly evident in the Chinese fixation on restricting themselves from expansion or otherwise, indeed the whole mindset of China (the Confucian model) proved to be far inferior to that used by the West when it came to acquiring power. It was that which threw them under the bus, not the need for a few more fields. 

The argument your trying to make doesn't stand up because your trying to advocate this as the primary reason for social development, it's quite a stretch to even suggest. If you're writing a thesis on this I advise you don't continue to overstretch the importance of your chosen area of study, it was important yes but only in a similar vein to countless other circumstances. The influence of great men, social dynamics, etc, etc. Indeed I'd say that arguably Western superiority is rooted primary in its superior war making ability which came about as a result of the ""many nations of Europe"" and their constant fighting of one another. 

--------------------------------

player1337 @ 2013-07-24 08:13:26 :

To summarize what you are saying: Ressource distribution around the planet is not a significant factor for human development because 2000 years ago people around the nile could feed themselves pretty well. Instead the only real reason for western societies to strive is because they embraced Roman/Greek ideals and people in western societies had their ""ingenuity"".

At no point in your argument do you even think that it is a worthy question to ask what kind of influences made people adopt certain policies and ideals in the first place. Your story begins when they just happen to do the right thing. - And yet you call my argument wishful thinking.

And let's not forget where this discussion started: You use that to justify warmongering, imperialism and slavery because you think that the individual (whom all this progress from originated from in your argument) was irrelevant and should only serve some objective that you in your mind deem important."

I understand 100% that some people, including myself, think that the ""under god"" part of the pledge is unnecessary, but then just skip that part.

But, seriously, what has America provided for you that you should provide your unquestioning, unexplained and relentless loyalty and allegiance to, on a daily basis? You're talking about kids in primary school: are we expecting them to understand the concept of the pledge?

What has America done for the hundreds of thousands of children under the age of ten that attend it's primary schools that allows them to demand their loyalty and allegiance on a daily basis?

And no one is demanding their allegiance or loyalty. As I said in the other reply, it's been deemed unconstitutional to require anyone to say the pledge. Regarding the kids not understanding it, I'm not exactly sure what a good alternative would be, maybe don't have a time for the pledge until high school?

Yup, pretty much.

Remove it until they're at least 12, introduce a compulsory lesson explaining the possible meanings and intentions behind the pledge, and then invite them to join in standing and saying it each morning if they agree with what it says and how it says it, whilst also offering them the opportunity to express their thoughts personally and privately with no stigma attached.

I have pretty much the same attitude towards religion: I feel that a lot of things become so ingrained as ""tradition"" and ""expected"" that they're never given proper thought by those taking part in them.

Demanding to know *why* things should be done is a crucial part of developing a life philosophy that makes sense and holds up under scrutiny.

So long as there is understanding and knowledge behind the pledge, I have no real objection.

It's the people who reply along the lines of, ""I don't know."" or, ""Because everyone else does?"" when asked, ""Why do you say the Pledge"" that are the problem.

And as far as I've ever been told by anyone, there don't seem to be that many groups of people within schools that take the time to ensure a thorough knowledge of just what this kind of pledge is *supposed* to mean."	"mediaboy @ 2013-10-25 02:17:35 :

Completely the opposite, actually.

Your lack of knowledge about the American education system is astoundingly awful. It makes sense though, since you're a Brit who's never lived in America and has obviously never studied anything about American culture. 

We're taught about the Pledge of Allegiance from day 1. We all know why we stand up but some anti-American nutbars think they're so edgy for hating American culture and hating the country that's provided them the fucking schools they're studying under. 

What you're suggesting is to lay back on teaching parts of American culture. You want to delay teaching everything, let kids get told by their Church that gays deserve to die, and then in school say that it's totally okay if you think gays deserve to die, but it's cool if you support faggots as well. Go move to Russia. The Pledge should continue to be taught like any other part of American culture. "

Estimates for the median lethal dose (LD50) of LSD range from 200 µg/kg to more than 1 mg/kg of human body mass, though most sources report that there are no known human cases of such an overdose. Other sources note one report of a suspected fatal overdose of LSD occurring in November 1975 in Kentucky in which there were indications that ~1/3 of a gram (320 mg or 320,000 µg) had been injected intravenously. 

Because its obvious that you know nothing about drugs 200 ug/kg - 1mg/kg is a ridiculous amount of LSD, especially considering no one takes it intravenously. Also the LD-50 is the median lethal dose, meaning you would need to take 2x that to experience a toxic effect. You should really stop arguing with people who know more than you, especially when all you have to back up you bullshit are your own preconceived notions. Also, lol at you not knowing what Onus means. Why is it always the stupid and totally uniformed who are the loudest about how bad psychedelic drugs are?

&gt;__Lysergic acid diethylamide__, abbreviated __LSD__ or __LSD-25__, also known as __lysergide__ ([INN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name)) and colloquially as __acid__, is a [semisynthetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisynthetic) [psychedelic drug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug) of the [ergoline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergoline) family, well known for its psychological effects which can include altered thinking processes, closed- and open-eye visuals, [synesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), an altered [sense of time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_time) and [spiritual experiences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_experience), as well as for its key role in [1960s counterculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s). It is used mainly as an [entheogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen), [recreational drug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use), and as an agent in [psychedelic therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy). LSD is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low [toxicity relative to dose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window).  However, acute adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, and delusions are possible.

If you can't overdose doesn't mean it isn't dangerous. 50-60% more chance of psychoses says Knack. Imagine the consequences of the inevitable misuse, alcohol is only a mild 'hallucogenic' and drunk driving kills tens of thousands yearly. Maybe lsd isn't a drug merely for its reputation.

At least an Eastern European could live a semi-decent and normal life under Soviet rule, unlike Nazi rule.

It wasn't too crazy, you know all those scare stories about how close we came to WW3... minutes from disaster. Now if any ONE of those actually happened Churchill would have seemed like a genius to those who survived. To attack the Soviet Union while we had the nuke on our side. What we saw in Berlin was far too scary and the war too costly already for it. We saw IS-3's next to Shermans, the most advanced tanks at the time next to well... a vastly inferior one. They had more troops to, and we saw their production. France wanted to rebuild, Germany had no more fighting will, Britain was starved and America was worrying about the cost.

USA would come very quickly from ""freedom fighter"" to ""literally worse than Hitler"" position by unilaterally attacking former ally in such manner. I don't think this would be a winning strategy for USA.

mrlowe98 @ 2014-06-10 16:15:19 :

If the Russians attacked first, I'm not so sure. Smaller nukes were no worse than fire bombings at the time, and the British and other allies did plenty of those, so they wouldn't exactly have a moral high ground to stand on. 

--------------------------------

Volesco @ 2014-06-10 16:41:24 :

Well, sure, but Operation Unthinkable would be an Allied attack on the Soviet Union. The Allies would be essentially launching a (mostly) unprovoked attack on their ally which had just done nearly all the heavy lifting in defeating the most brutal, destructive and plain evil regime in history. Furthermore, they'd be very unlikely to win the war unless they used nuclear weapons - in other words, slaughtered tens of millions of innocent civilians. By the end of it they may very well literally have more deaths to their name than Hitler. /u/nqd26 is right. This is not a winning strategy. There's a reason it was unthinkable.

--------------------------------

mrlowe98 @ 2014-06-10 16:47:00 :

Unprovoked? The USSR was almost as bad as Nazi Germany, the only difference is they allied with the right side. There were a million reasons we could have used to attack the USSR, but there were also a million reasons not to.

I'm not so sure about it being likely we'd lose a war with them either. The US got out of WW2 with barely a scratch on them and, as you said, the USSR took the vast bulk of allied casualties during ww2. Even without nukes, I think the allies would've stood a decent chance against the Russians. Add nukes to that equation, and I'd say it's pretty likely we would've won, at least until the USSR developed nukes of their own. 

--------------------------------

Volesco @ 2014-06-10 17:25:06 :

No, it was nowhere near as bad as Nazi Germany. Seriously. A post-war Nazi Europe would see [some 50 million Slavs exterminated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost). Those who weren't killed would be deported to Siberia or kept as slaves. Post-war Soviet Europe wasn't fantastic, and it was certainly full of oppression and general shittiness ... but that kind of oppression doesn't really compare to literal slavery, and that general shittiness didn't come with anywhere near a comparable death toll.

Keep in mind that Allied morale would be extremely low, being forced to turn on their allies after they thought they were finally victorious in Europe. In the eyes of the Soviet soldiers, the Allies have basically back-stabbed them for no good reason, much like Hitler had 4 years earlier; they would be very willing to fight. The Soviets also enjoyed massive numerical superiority. Though the Allies could certainly win if they were willing to put forth the time, effort and sheer manpower, the war would be incredibly unpopular at home. If the Allies didn't secure a quick military victory, which they wouldn't, considering the A-bomb was still a while off, political pressure may very well force them to concede defeat.

And then, if the A-bombs do start dropping on Soviet cities, the Allies have the minor issue of now being literally Hitler. The war was NOT going to go well, no matter what. Sure, the Cold War could be avoided ... but at what cost?

--------------------------------

Shark_Porn @ 2014-06-10 17:47:58 :

&gt;doesn't really compare to literal slavery

Yes, yes it did. Ever heard of the Gulag or forced resettlement? In addition, Stalin killed more than 25 million of his own citizens directly, not counting deaths from artificial famines in the Ukraine and elsewhere. 

As far as how a war would go, all the US would  have to do would be to withdraw completely from continental Europe, and saturation bomb the continent from Britain. The Soviets had essentially zero navy or air force, and Europe was completely devastated. The US had barely a scratch, while the USSR had already lost tens of millions of lives and the remaining civilian population was starving. Once the Soviets in continental Europe had starved out, been riddled by guerrilla attacks, and bombed into the stone-age with conventional weapons, the US and Britain could then land their ~16 million strong army in France. Nukes would only help, by knocking out key Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg.   "	"[deleted] @ 2014-06-10 18:12:44 :

Volesco @ 2014-06-10 18:35:22 :

Well, most of my points were arguing against your claim that ""The USSR was almost as bad as Nazi Germany"", so it seems much of our argument may have been a misunderstanding. Sorry about that.

Life in the Soviet Union was bad in many ways, but what I've gathered from reading a *lot* of articles and stories from people who lived there is that it wasn't as bad as it's often portrayed as in the West, especially during the period from Stalin's death to the mid-80s. During this period crime was low, starvation was all but unheard of, everyone had guaranteed and free education, work and healthcare, albeit of dubious quality. I'll agree that the political repression was quite horrible, though 'slavery' is pushing it ... but for most people, political freedom isn't quite as important as having food on the table, education and a place to work - and the fact that they had all of those was a first in Russian history. And some places in the Warsaw Pact were actually better off than the Soviet Union too, such as East Germany.

Now, whether the USSR's continued existence would have been better than this continued WWII scenario, I'm not sure. Eastern Europe outside Russia would probably be better off, though I'm not sure about Russia itself. As for the rest of the world, well, that's anyone's guess. There are far too many uncertainties and domino effects to really say for sure. Still, I think given the information they had at the time, the Allies made the right choice not to invade.

I'm sorry but you are completely wrong here. First of all cannibalism is not good thing and it's not right in any moral society.That is why anyone who did this got prosecuted/terminated in the Soviet era and in modern Russia too. Second on the topic of killing your own troops I could go on for another 10 pages (watch my comments before) I am going to just say. That at the time it was perhaps the most humane thing to do. However I saw before and watched the interview of soviet veterans before.(Can find you a video on youtube, should you ask)They say that the stories of gunning their own guys were a myth... and if it was true then it wasn't on a mass scale because in his brigade it never happen and It didn't happen to any of his friends. And I am sorry but no Nazi Germany was not a better option as again I could  go on for another 10 pages ,it was a much, much worse option ,and not comparable to Stalin.

TheAC997 @ 2014-08-17 20:25:07 :

People purposefully avoid saying ""I could figuratively..."" and sarcastically say ""I could literally..."" therefore, it doesn't make sense to say that literally means figuratively.

Since when were dictionaries supposed to have sarcastic definitions for words?  It's not like you look up ""big"" and the last definition is ""small.""

I agree with that entirely. That's not the discussion we are having, though.

This is your post. That is what I am replying to. It is wrong, so I'm pointing that out. Lots of people use ""literally"" as if it means ""figuratively"".

Perhaps you meant to say ""literally shouldn't carry the definition of figuratively"", which I agree with, but instead you have said ""People don't do this"", when they do.

No, actually it is. I can almost guarantee that you are not from the southern U.S. It is quite literally a hobby to own guns and shoot at shit harmlessly. If you've ever shot a firearm, you'll notice how powerful it feels, like an adrenaline high, and people legitimately love to shoot guns recreationally, and not to harm others. 

--------------------------------

sumwut @ 2014-08-31 08:49:05 :

I'm not saying it's not a hobby. I totally understand the fun in it. It doesn't change the purpose of the gun though. It's a weapon, not a toy. 

--------------------------------

sabin357 @ 2014-08-31 13:04:24 :

You realize that things can have multiple uses right? Afterall, a knife can be used to kill a person, open a box, carve wood, or process meat. The aggression only comes when the person wielding it chooses it.

By the same toke, a gun can be used to kill a person, to protect your home, to hunt with, to target shoot for fun.

--------------------------------

sumwut @ 2014-08-31 13:35:09 :

To protect your home and hunt with both fall under the category of killing/damaging. That's what weapons do.

--------------------------------

sabin357 @ 2014-08-31 13:40:27 :

I can protect my home without firing a weapon. You'd be surprised how often a burglar is willing to sit quietly &amp; wait for the police while a shotgun is in your hands.

You can also collect firearms without ever firing them. You can fire them at targets, which kills nothing also.

The definition of a weapon is a ""tool"" that is currently or has being used to kill/harm. The only time a gun is a weapon, is when I am shooting it at someone. Same with a kitchen knife; legally it is only labelled a weapon when I attack someone with it.

--------------------------------

sumwut @ 2014-08-31 13:53:07 :

In that case you protect through fear of using it for its purpose. Not sure how many people would take those chances with a burglar in their house, you don't know if their carrying. I'm not going to continue to argue whether a gun is a weapon or not. 

--------------------------------

sabin357 @ 2014-08-31 16:01:21 :

Even if they are carrying, having the drop on them is likely to deescalate that situation.

It's probably best that you stop arguing that point.

BTW, since cops carry firearms, are they not for protection? Are they just there to constantly put us all in fear that they may be used to kill us?"

Bell, telus, and Rogers are all EXACTLY THE SAME pricing, starting at $80 per month. They get you a premium phone (for example an iPhone 5s is $100 on one of these plans) 

Virgin, koodo, and Fido, are guess what! EXACTLY the same pricing. They work on a three tier system for pricing.   
Low: $35 - $95 
Medium: $40 - $99
High: $80 and upwards. (identical to Bell, telus, and Rogers pricing btw) 

Now the difference between these three tiers is a lot simpler and less sinister than most people think: Subsidies. That's it folks, the higher plan you choose gets you a better price on your device. So be leery when someone scoffs at you for your $85 plan with Bell saying they get the same thing for $60 from koodo, because all it really means is that they either opted for a lower quality (more realistically a lower *priced*) phone, or paid more up front.  

I'll use the iPhone 5s as an example. 

High tier contract: $99 up front. 

Mid tier contract: $380 up front. 

Low tier contract: $570 up front. 


Okay! So stop arguing ""oh go to koodo, they're soooo much better""  no, no they're not. They're the exact same as all the other companies and they're fucking you just as hard as the rest. 

Which leads me to my favourite expression when choosing a Canadian phone provider:    it's not about who you like, it's about who you hate the least. 


Edit:   also to address people in this thread saying they have plans cheaper than this, that's because you have an old plan and haven't upgraded yet.  Good luck keeping your beloved plan when you come back for a new subsidized phone. Of course there are the lucky few who know how to argue with call centre reps and manage to pull a half decent retention plan out of their ass, so there's that. "	3	0	stop arguing comment

No one is saying that, so stop arguing it. We know the hardware is pretty much identical to other competitors.

What makes Apple products generally better or more highly valued is the *overall* product, not the individual parts. Apple laptops and phones simply look and feel better than the vast majority of their competition. They are designed to look more valuable and more universally appealing. And the build quality of their products is generally better as well. They don't feel cheap and 'plasticy'. They feel solid. They feel like something you take care of, not something you neglect and misuse. On top of that, Apple products have great resale value *because* they are such highly valued and reliable products.

You need to step back and see the forest for the trees. Don't pay so much attention to the individual parts, but the product as a whole.

Open up an iphone what do you find inside? the same parts manufactured by the same companies as samsung phones.

And when you open up all of those devices you will notice that the overall design and configuration of the parts is much better.

Let me tell you IT technicians HATE working on apple products because the configuration of their devices make any repairs significantly more difficult.

Furthermore the design of the parts aren't any better, they are literally identical. They use intel processors for example that is literally identical to ones used in non apple devices.

That's not incorrect. I did philosophy in University for fuck's sake. Strawman is like the funamental fallacy you learn about.

&gt;Leave it here. Just stop it. Just stop digging deeper. Instead of being to adamant to defending your own beliefs, no matter how wrong they are, 

Hm. I hope you don't think I'm just taking this position because I'm muslim. I'm not muslim. I'm actually pretty fucking far from muslim. 

&gt;maybe you should instead be adamant to learn so that you can finally get the truth you want. That's enlightenment. Not this bullshit. Stop arguing just to argue. So what if it's not ""constructive"" or ""enlightening""? Look at every fucking post on TIL and tell me if it's the spiritual and intellectual wisdom you needed.

You're still freaking out about my choice of words. I'm sorry I said ""enlightened"", I didn't expect you to run off with such a strange and specific interpretation of it.

Yeah, there isn't a high standard of quality for TIL posts. That's not my concern. This post is unique for reasons that you seem to be trying to obscure. It doesn't owe it's success to being interesting, constructive, or positive in any way. It owes it's success to piggybacking on a toxic circlejerk in the wake of a recent controversy. 

People (like you, I suspect) with upvote anything that carries the faintest whiff of anti-Islamic sentiment. That's what I take issue with. Islam doesn't hold some special place in my heart, rationality does. Islamophobia isn't rational and it's thriving a bit too much on Reddit for my tastes - as any other form of toxic ignorance would.

&gt;It's not a shitty post - and your criteria sucks. Just admit it. If you can't admit that, then there's a huge ego problem. Because it's not that big of a deal. Trivial, even. Beneath trivial. What you're arguing is fucking pointless and I've just explained a bunch of times why it's not a shitty post. If it was such a shitty post, then why is it so successful in gaining interest, and yet still within TIL standards?!

I don't have an ego problem. You have an anger problem.

Nobody said you were a Muslim. Just because you have a belief doesn't mean it's Religious. You know what, I was just fucking around. But now you're saying I'm anti-Muslim and some hivemind piece of shit because I think that this was an interesting post? Excuse me, but the man was Muslim.

I'm going to disprove this the best my 1AM mind can, so bare with me.

I'd just like to point out this is completely wrong. First of all, political theory is more than a single axis, iv's seen arguments for up to three before, Governmental power, how controlled the economy is, and religious fundamentalism.


But for the sake of argument, lets say this is right. The right side signifies most power based in a government, and the left denotes a form of government with the least government power.


On the right side, we have totalitarianism. This is when you have all power vested in one or a few individuals. The people generally have no say in the operation of the government.

On the left side, we have anarchism. Contrary to popular belief, anarchy is not ""chaos,"" and the modern connotation has it, but it is a society in which all forms of social hierarchy has been abolished. In this system, the individual has every say about what they want to do with their lives.


One has total governmental control, the other has none at all. How are these the same in any way?

So, there you go. The horseshoe theory is bullshit.

I should also point out, those of you saying Communism is on the right side of this, or is like Fascism, are completely wrong. You are mistaking Bolshevism, the USSR's terrible bastardization of Communism, as the universal definition for all leftist politics. You couldn't be more wrong. I suggest you take a peek at /r/socialism. 


If you blankly downvote this because you don't agree with it, you are exactly like the Christians who aim to suppress actual knowledge for their own gain. I'm trying to teach you something. 


Please, if you don't agree with me, and I don't expect most of you to, get into politics and learn about it. It's really, truly important.

Using nuclear weapons, or any new weapon for that matter, is not cheating.  Someone complaining ""that's not fair in war""??  No.  All belligerents will use any mean available to them to achieve their objectives.  There is no fairness in war, therefore nothing is considered ""cheating"" in war.

Nuclear weapons use fusion while atomic bombs use fission. They're very different and result in very different levels of energy. The atomic bombs dropped in WW2 were not nuclear weapons.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2015-04-03 18:51:48 :

This is simply not true.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon

&gt;A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion 

&gt;As of 2015, two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of nuclear warfare, both times by the United States near the end of World War II. On 6 August 1945, a uranium gun-type fission bomb code-named ""Little Boy"" was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2015-04-03 18:53:13 :

In common vernacular, they're interchangeable but strictly speaking atomic bombs are not nuclear weapons. There is a distinct difference. This is just a result of people like you who don't know the difference and incorrectly use them interchangeably.

If we had dropped nukes on Japan there would be no Japan.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2015-04-03 18:59:23 :

No, you don't understand. You are patently wrong: mixing up bullshit semantics to reach a false conclusion. 

A nuclear weapon is ""explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions"". There are two different classifications-

1. A bomb **exclusively** using fission is commonly referring to as an *Atomic Bomb*

2. A bomb using a mix of fission and fusion iscommonly referred to as a *Hydrogen Bomb*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon#Fission_weapons

Both are nuclear weapons. I understand it can be hard to admit you were wrong on the internet, but you have been fully and concretely disproven here.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2015-04-03 19:08:47 :

No, you are relying on popular misnomers to substantiate your incorrect assumption.

An atomic bomb is mutually exclusive from a nuclear bomb being that they operate in wildly different ways.

brickmack @ 2015-05-31 21:16:43 :

Seems like a smaller claim than that objective morality exists. But theres still plenty of evidence for its subjectivity. For every ""absolute"" moral standard any culture holds, theres going to be dozens of cultures without that standard. As mentioned above, tons of cultures have no problem fucking and/or marrying little kids. Theres also plenty that approve of rape (much of the middle east again), murder and cannibalism (various indigenous tribes), slavery (Horn of Africa), and just about anything else that would be considered opposite the core moral standards of most western societies. When theres that much disagreement over something as basic as not murdering your fellow humans, how can there be any sort of moral objectivity?

RELTIH88 @ 2015-05-31 21:18:18 :

You can't jump to the conclusion because of people's supposedly different morals. Absolute morality to exist doesn't require everyone to follow it or agree to it.

The baseball diamond is basically a square, with each of the bases on a corner. the 'basepaths' are the edges of the square, and in general you have to run the basepaths to advance around the diamond.

Stealing first to third would be cutting a diagonal line through the center of the square, and incidentally, the pitchers' mound is in the center. From what I understand, the mound used to be closer to home (EDIT: it's 60 feet roughly), but I still think it would take enormous balls to steal first to third. Base to base is 90 feet, which means first to third is about 120.

You know rounders and baseball are pretty much the same game, right? There are minor differences in scoring and structure but the fundamentals are nigh-identical. Rounders isn't the 'forefather' of baseball in the sense that rugby is the forefather of American football, they're two variants of the same sport. 

More like rugby union vs rugby league, or American football vs Canadian football.

via [History of Baseball in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_baseball_in_the_United_States)
&gt;In 1903, the British sportswriter Henry Chadwick published an article speculating that baseball derived from a British game called rounders, which Chadwick had played as a boy in England. But baseball executive Albert Spalding disagreed. Baseball, said Spalding, was fundamentally an American sport and began on American soil. To settle the matter, the two men appointed a commission, headed by Abraham Mills, the fourth president of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. The commission, which also included six other sports executives, labored for three years, after which it declared that Abner Doubleday invented the national pastime.

Although the attribution to Doubleday was a myth (he is a folk icon of the Civil War era), the point stands that the American form of the game is significantly different from Rounders that it is in fact a whole new game.

&gt;The first team to play baseball under modern rules were the New York Knickerbockers. The club was founded on September 23, 1845, as a social club for the upper middle classes of New York City

That's all kinds of dumb especially seeing how hard it can be on a farmer to have certain tools stolen from them (I don't know if farming is as heavily subsidized in Canada as it is in the US so it could be either).

Edit 2: People keep responding about how equipment isn't worth people's lives. Sure it isn't, but the further ramifications are. If it makes it harder for me to put food on my table for my family, I will do whatever I can to protect it. The individual commuting the crime should understand that they are putting someone else at risk and be ready to suffer the consequences. Yes an ATV is dumb, but at the same time I wouldn't let my family be taken advantage of especially if the bastard only ended up getting a month in jail (I'm not saying I'd kill the guy, I'd just make him regret trying to steal from me).

Eugenics was pretty universally accepted science in his day. 

--------------------------------

TheUnknownPenis @ 2015-12-01 16:52:59 :

It's still accepted science today... the difficulty being that while we now understand genetics well enough to actually apply the eugenic principles to some effect (recognizing many 'undesireable' traits are either unimportant or a product of nurture, not nature), we no longer have the will to do so.

Humans are not special, we can be bred just like any domesticated animal.

--------------------------------

GingerBiologist @ 2015-12-01 17:21:34 :

As a geneticist I can tell you that it is not accepted science at all. There are a relatively small number of genetic disorders we understand well enough to know the risk of having an affected child. We can do genetic testing and consoling to advise people on the risk that their child would have say Cystic Fibrosis. But that is quite different than forcing sterilization. We aren't anywhere close to being able to understand the genetic basis of criminal behavior and even if we could I don't want to live in the world where the government is making those decisions.

You start by saying eugenics doesn't work, then follow up by saying it does in some cases but we don't want to do it  (contradicting yourself and agreeing with me), then add there are lots of cases where it wouldn't work (which is irrelevant).

Kirbyoto @ 2016-02-08 15:43:00 :

&gt;a war for survival

If it was a war for survival, then there shouldn't be any South Vietnamese people left to view us favorably, since they *lost*. Definitely not 78% of the country.

Also, considering that the country was split in half *because* the United States propped up a corrupt dictator, maybe that's not as helpful as you think it is.

--------------------------------

Arzt_Rassistisch @ 2016-02-08 15:45:32 :

South Vietnam was fighting for its survival.  No need to get into word games, as if you need those, you have no points.

Vietnam was split in half long before the USA came in.  South Vietnam was actually created out of a different historical kingdom's territory than North Vietnam.   The north actually had very little claim to the territory.

And besides, the North was also a corrupt dictatorship as well.

--------------------------------

Kirbyoto @ 2016-02-08 16:28:30 :

&gt;South Vietnam was fighting for its survival.

The government of South Vietnam was fighting for its survival. The people of South Vietnam were not, and the fact that they weren't directly undermines your point. We were propping up a dictatorship, we were not *preventing a genocide*. Those are two very different things, with very different moral standards.

In any case, the gratitude of the South Vietnamese would not translate into modern approval for America, because if it was a ""war for survival"", the South Vietnamese lost, and thus would not be alive today to affect those ratings.

&gt;And besides, the North was also a corrupt dictatorship as well.

If the best point you can make is ""well, they were also bad"", you have no points. Your argument is that the United States saved ""good Vietnam"" from ""bad Vietnam"", but now the best you can do is that both were equally bad, which means that there's no real difference between them.

We were propping up a dictatorship, we were not *preventing a genocide*. Those are two very different things, with very different moral standards.

We were supporting a sovereign nation in its fight for survival, with many citizens of South Vietnam supporting their government, because it was better for them than the one in the North.  Remember, South Vietnam was attacked by the North, and many citizens of the South didn't want to become part of the North.

*preventing a genocide*
We actually were slowing down a genocide.  The actions of the NVA against many of the tribes in the Vietnamese mountains is considered genocidal.  Accounts vary wildly, but between 100,000 to 1,000,000 civilians were killed by the NVA in South Vietnam alone, more than the USA and South Vietnam killed.

I like how you're dropping this amateurish, barely-researched Propaganda History on me and you have the gall to use a word like ""remember"". You know what I remember? I remember Ngo Dinh Diem. You apparently don't remember a single thing about him or his regime since you're working with this cartoonish black-and-white ""South Good, North Bad"" outlook.

&gt;South Vietnam was attacked by the North, and many citizens of the South didn't want to become part of the North

You keep focusing on this ""South versus North"" thing, and you said earlier that the South was ""legally"" not the same as the North and shouldn't have been treated as the same state. If that's the case, *why the fuck* did the Republic of Vietnam lay claim to the North as well as the South? Man, it's almost like they actually were one state until the South broke off, supported by Western powers.

And guess who canceled the elections that would decide whether the country would reunify?

NGO DINH DIEM. The man who, also, by the way, *if we're keeping track*, was elected to the leadership of the Republic of Vietnam in overtly corrupt circumstances. Yes, that man, the man who we chose to champion democracy, cheated to get his power and then canceled elections regarding reunification. This is what you're championing. You don't know a goddamn thing about Vietnam.

The United States bolstered a nation that was vehemently anti-democratic and we did so because it was more important that they *weren't communists*. That's what happened.

TrekkieGod @ 2016-06-09 20:21:24 :

&gt;Except Voyager for the most part was vastly better than Enterprise. Voyager was at least watchable if totally inferior to previous shows.

Taste is subjective, and I respect your opinion.  Mine differs greatly, though:

As a huge Trekkie, it always annoyed me that Voyager was the only show I had not seen in its entirety.  I tried to watch it when it was airing it on TV.  Then I proceeded to start watching it again (from the last point I stopped, not starting over from the beginning) once a year since.  I finally actually finished the show last year, meaning that it took me 14 years to do so.

It was not worth it, just for the sake of saying that I've seen all of Star Trek.  And I say that as someone who had no problems watching the freaking Animated Series.  I suppose it's watchable in the sense that you can force yourself to get through if you have great determination and feel that you can't really call yourself ""TrekkieGod"" if any Star Trek exists which you haven't seen, but...that's not saying much.

Enterprise isn't really good Star Trek, except for the fourth season, which was actually pretty good.  They hired writers like Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens for that season, who had great success writing some fantastic Star Trek books since the 80's (and episodes of Batman Animated Series, so awesome writers).  That said, even the terrible Season 3 is vastly superior to Voyager at its best.

--------------------------------

QuantumInteger @ 2016-06-09 20:32:41 :

I don't understand why Trekkies dislike Voyager. It was the best Star Trek for me by far. Setting the Voyager in the Delta quadrant and making the entire series about a long trip home makes it the Odyssey of the Star Trek universe. It heightens the tension and allows for absolutely amazing character building and emotional payoffs. The Voyager itself was like a ship of Theseus, undergoing its own evolution alongside the crew who had to adapt in order to survive 75,000 lightyears from home. The characters and the ship evolved during their 7 year voyage home. There were some terrible episodes, some really slow ones, but the best parts of Voyagers were nicely spread out and plentiful. Plus, Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway. Badass Janeway.

It was certainly a lot better than DS9. "	"QuantumInteger @ 2016-06-09 20:57:56 :

Star Trek: DS9 was about a giant war and centered almost entirely on a space station. Last time I checked, Star Trek wasn't about a war but about starship adventure. It's literally in the name, Star **Trek**. 

And in Voyager, there were consequences. When the Kazon took Voyager, many crewmen died when they were stranded. Kes, herself, was left behind when she ""ascended"". The Doctor went from being a cynical and snarky automaton to being almost akin to a human being. 

&gt; How many photon torpedoes are fired vs how many Janeway claims at the end of the pilot, how many shuttle craft are lost, 

Because they made more? They harvested raw materials from planets to make more torpedoes. Voyager was also capable of building the Delta Flyer so it makes sense that they were able to build more shuttles. 

&gt; how own is the ship messed up and canard only to be repaired off screen?

Uhh, that's literally every Star Trek? TNG had plenty of those moments. 

--------------------------------

BigRedRobyn @ 2016-06-09 21:09:25 :

TNG had proximity to starbases for repairs....Voyager obviously didn't.
And as much as Enterprise had flaws the ship was pretty banged up, especially in season 3.

Revvy @ 2016-06-09 21:57:12 :

I recently started rewatching DS9 after watching Deadwood and its crazy how similar the two shows are. The same cast of important characters, multiple stories that play out exactly the same way. DS9 is a Western frontier gold town in space with very little window dressing. 

--------------------------------

Red_Tannins @ 2016-06-09 22:19:23 :

In Enterprise, they could usually hobble back to Earth if they sustained damage. Although there was that one time they ran into an automated repair dock.

Lieutenant Hogan got eaten by a cave monster, and Lon Suder died retaking the ship.

They lost two people after being boarded, captured and stranded on a random ass alien planet covered in volcanos. If I was the Captain, I'd call that some damned good luck.

--------------------------------

hoot1991 @ 2016-06-10 03:39:20 :

When the run into the repair dock, it's after they've sustained damage that limits their speed to something like Warp 1.2 though. Earth was a two year trip away at that speed.

--------------------------------

nmathew @ 2016-06-10 04:51:47 :

Janeway literally says they have no means of manufacturing more torpedoes. TNG wasn't  about a ship stranded in mostly hostile territory.  I figured damage was dealt with at the nearest star base. I'll happily grant that DS9 was a weird idea for something with trek in the name,  and I don't think it really took off until they were really exploring the concepts of the gamma quadrant.

Voyager suffered from multiple writers with different visions for the show, and I think the overall product greatly suffered for it. Janeway's take on the Prime Directive was almost like picking from a randomized table. What I mean by no consequences is that few things had a truly laying impact on the crew.  Yes,  they managed to  let the Doctor have an arc but they dropped so many other opportunities. They crew integration sorry should have been season 1, nor a few episodes.  Who died when they were left behind by the Kazon and how did it impact the crew?  I recently rewatched Voyager(bar Star Trek isn't THAT bad after all),  and I have no clue. Janeway'so isolation and clinical depression storyline. ... did they ever resolve or even revisit it? 

There was an epaulets where Janeway and Chakotay were stranded together for months,  became close, but upon rescue just 100% reset their relationship to status quo. Even TNG had Picard's character undergo some permanent changes after the episode where an alien device had him ""live"" a life as one of them. I guess I found to many of those missed opportunities. "

ulkord @ 2016-08-09 11:06:01 :

Sounds like bullshit. Spent fuel rods usually mostly contain various isotopes of uranium. Uranium emits alpha particles, and so does plutonium. Alpha particles are easily blocked by even something like paper, your skin, air. For you to receive a guaranteed fatal dose of radiation you would need to receive about 8-10 Gray or 640-800 joules of radiation energy (given that you weighed 80kg). If we also take into account that you would be in a car and only exposed for a very short amount of time, I'd say the chance of you receiving a fatal dose is 0%.

--------------------------------

psjoe96 @ 2016-08-09 23:05:37 :

Not sure why you're so focused on the alpha particle aspect, as they're shielded by paper (like you said). I'd be much more concerned with gamma and neutron radiation.

--------------------------------

ulkord @ 2016-08-09 23:37:09 :

Because spent fuel rods mostly emit alpha particles not gamma rays or neutron radiation. I looked up some isotopes which could be present in spent fuel rods and they all undergo beta decay or low energy gamma decay.  My point is that you're most definitely not going to die if you drive by a spent fuel rod in your car.

KaayLemc @ 2016-09-30 01:59:01 :

I always see this down voted when people bring up the subject of tipping out the bartender/kitchen. It's such a huge letdown to work your butt off for 3 hours to make someone happy and then have them stiff you on the tip because they don't feel like it. 

At my work the tip out is 6% of ALL sales, regardless of what it is. So if someone comes in and orders a $300 bottle of wine and decides they don't have to tip, then I'm suddenly out $18 from my own pocket and effectively paid to serve them (when at the very least I hope to get 10% which comes to $12 after the tip out). I don't know, people on Reddit always seem to hate on servers

groove_la_chord @ 2016-09-30 03:00:10 :

If you think anyone should be responsible to tip $20-$40 on a $200 bottle of wine because of the way your restaurant has its tip out system set up, you're mistaken.  That's a discussion that you and the other servers need to have with management.  If your internal system for tipping is broken like you're describing, fix it, don't drag the customers into the problem.  

--------------------------------

Dr_Poz @ 2016-09-30 07:15:44 :

Lol, you have no idea what you're talking about. You're not entitled to anything. You don't wanna tip? Don't tip. But don't pretend that you're *not* an entitled bastard for taking advantage of a poor waiter. Fuck you.

--------------------------------

groove_la_chord @ 2016-09-30 12:29:06 :

I see that you like telling people to fuck off, and ""fuck you"" in your comments. That explains why you're having such a hard time pulling in tips. And I don't think you understand what the word 'entitled' means. I'll explain it to you: it's when someone like yourself brings a $200 bottle of wine to a table and *expects* to be given $40 for doing so versus bringing a $40 dollar bottle of wine and *expecting* $8 for doing so. The price of the bottle doesn't change what you do, but you expect to be given $32 more. For the perhaps 5 minutes it takes you to open the wine and pour it, you expect to be given $40 - for 5 minutes of ""work"". It doesn't get more entitled than that. I can't get over the irony of you telling me that I'm the one who's not entitled to anything. "	"groove_la_chord @ 2016-09-30 16:44:43 :

I don't give a fuck what the restaurant's rules are.  It isn't a law.  It's internal policy.  You put emphasis on HAS like it's a felony in the criminal code if you don't tip out.  This is obviously not the case in every restaurant.  Explain to me why I should be on the hook for an extra $40 if I choose to enjoy a special bottle of wine because of your restaurant's shitty internal tip rules.  Talk to your fucking manager, dipshit.  NOT MY PROBLEM.  

&gt;Your waiter HAS to tip out on your wine, you're making your waiter pay for your wine. Stop arguing with that, that's a FACT.


If it's your restaurant's policy to have you tip out on booze, how does that make it the customer's problem?  That means it's the owner of the restaurant making you pay for the wine, NOT the customer.  You can yell, scream and call it a FACT all you want, but it is absolutely not a fact.  God, you're fucking dense. So dense you don't even understand what the word entitled means.  When you call it a FACT that people owe you money for doing sweet fuck all, that's entitlement, dickhead.  You're shedding tears because I don't agree that I should have to pay you $40, above and beyond a regular tip mind you, for doing something my dog is trained to do for a pat on the head.

And the gall you have to call others entitled because they don't know about, agree with, or care bout your restaurant's internal policy about tipping out.  You apparently wouldn't know what an entitled person looks like if you saw one staring back at you in the mirror each morning.  You sound like most smug and useless server there could possibly be.

Like it's anyone's fault but your own you wound up working in a shitty restaurant that has a shit policy on tipping.  Fuck do you ever suck as a waiter, as a person in general, and as someone who is trying but failing in the most miserable way at eliciting sympathy by calling OTHERS entitled.  There is literally no way you could sound more entitled.  None.

&gt; I don't give a fuck what the restaurant's rules are. It isn't a law. It's internal policy. 

It's an industry standard, genius. Practically every restaurant works like this. Stop attacking me for trying to educate you. Don't attack the messenger. The industry sucks, I know, but you're now blaming the waiter who is simply a victim of capitalism. Yes, it sucks that restaurants are allowed to exploit their workers like this...but, nonetheless, YOU chose to go out to eat....YOU chose to buy a bottle of wine...and YOU'RE choosing to not tip. YOU are the asshole. 

Is capitalism a form of wage slavery? Yes. Do restaurants make a profit by exploiting their lowest paid workers? Yes. Are you an asshole for choosing to go to a restaurant and not tipping? Yes!

&gt; If it's your restaurant's policy to have you tip out on booze, how does that make it the customer's problem? 

YOU CHOOSE TO GO OUT TO EAT IN AMERICA! you choose to order a bottle of wine, and you choose to not tip. Stop blaming other people for YOUR decisions. Jesus. Man up, tip your fucking waiter.

&gt; Except Japan had already put out peace feelers to surrender 

Except Japan wanted to surrender with terms favorable to them, including holding onto possessions they gained in the war.

The Allies wanted *unconditional* surrender so that Japan would not be able to determine its own destiny, and repeat the failure of the Treaty of Versailles which led to WW2.

&gt;and the Russians were opening up a whole new front with Japanese forces,

The Russian declaration of war didn't happen until after the atomic bombs were dropped

&gt; and regular fire bombings were killing 100,000 Japanese people a night.

No, these weren't regular raids. The Tokyo firebombings did kill that many, but they weren't a regular occurrence - yet.

&gt;The US felt it had to drop nuclear weapons on Japan in order to scare the Russians to set a favorable post-war balance of power. And it had to do it fast before Japan surrendered.

That's all post-war revisionist history.

Emperor Hirohito's own surrender speech [gives you the clear answer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_Voice_Broadcast):

&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

Given that I graduated from high school over a decade ago, and have had multiple degrees since then, that's cute.

You have no argument, so you resort to such childish calls? What the fuck? Are you that gutless that you can't admit you're wrong?

&gt;So you think it's okay to become the only nation to drop atomic bombs on another country if it meets the war objective of preventing a nation from ""determining it's own destiny."" Sounds to me like you're bent on repeating the error of the Treaty of Versailles, not preventing it. That's not a reasonable justification for mass murder.

Holy fuck. Mass murder?

The US didn't set out to be the only country to drop atomic bombs. In fact, you can say that *because* the US dropped it, every other nation - including ourselves - knows how horrible it is, and won't make that decision lightly.

The US did NOT want them to determine their own destiny because - in case you didn't notice - WW2, a even more horrific war than WW1, happened. They wanted to make sure that Japan could never rise up again without the approval of the US and Allied nations - who by the way, created the United Nations to make that a reality.

&gt;Do you honestly think that our ally Russia didn't tell the US that they were about to declare war on Russia? 

Where did I say that? And of course the US knew Russia *promised* - but the Russian's didn't say exactly when. Just a date range.

&gt;You're arguing that it was a complete surprise to the US and they couldn't possibly have known before dropping the atomic bomb? Please.

Hey mister or miss historian - have you looked at the archives and timetables the US had? The invasion of Japan was planned long before Potsdam. The schedules for moving atomic bombs and dropping them were planned long before the Russian invasion dates.

The US didn't fly a B-29 from the mainland to do it the day before. The logistics of WW2 meant this shit took a lot longer to plan and do - the Enola Gay itself started training for this mission, the specifics unknown to the crew, months prior.

&gt;Again, there would have been no ground invasion. I have a degree in history focusing on this topic and working with a foremost expert in the field.

Cool. And? 

If you have a degree in history, then you sure as fuck know that history has its own biases (look at your own bias, calling it mass murder? Context much?) and revisionism is a thing.

The very fact that you can't even look at the Emperor's own speech - where he distinctly highlights the effects of the bomb - is hilarious.

Credentials or not, you argument is shit.

&gt;Bombing of Japan weren't regular? Are you fucking kidding me. Here's a visual for you, kid - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceLAhPOS9Q

Where did I say it wasn't regular? I said fire bombings ON THE SCALE of Tokyo weren't regular.

Nuance much?

I assume you mean Japan. Who the fuck are youYou're arguing that it was a complete surprise to the US and they couldn't possibly have known before dropping the atomic bomb? Please.

&gt;You can only believe that Japan wouldn't have surrendered if you buy the propaganda that they're all sub-humans who want to die. Kind'be how the right talks about Muslims now.

What the fuck kind of tangent is this? 

Go watch some footage of Japanese citizens throwing themselves and their kids off cliffs rather than surrender to US forces and tell me about how many more would have been willing to die had US troops actually landed.

that was enough, finally, to convince them to stop arguing with the state and check the boxes.  i.e.  get an apartment of their own, 4 walls and a roof and rooms for the kids.  They had been trying to convince the court that a boarding house was okay.

Completely unrelated to the article but just want to ask since you seem to know about the US foster system, its totally different to the Irish one so I'm just curious, what sort of payments are we talking?

Union_of_Onion @ 2018-03-21 15:34:16 :

There's an cash incentive to adopt children out from foster care. It was meant to get children in to homes who would be harder to get a family to adopt them, like the disabled and minority children. As it came to be (and how my children became victims of this) the children that could be adopted quickly, considered ""desirable,"" and to be frank (but I'm not trying to sound as though i agree with this or that i feel that I'm superior in some way) healthy, cute, white children who happen to find themselves in state custody were taken and rights are terminated quickly and it's easier to get them adopted. I personally fought my state for nearly three years for my three children. I was blocked every step of the way and they dragged my case out long enough that they based the termination of my rights on the fact that it had ""been so long that [I] seemed unwilling to change my circumstances"" to get my kids back. Regardless of the fact that they were removed from their father's house and i had never failed a drug test or missed a court date or visitation. It just felt like a big conspiracy to get my children away from me. I was indeed told in the first month that my kids were ""cute enough that they'd get adopted quickly."" 

There's no doubt in my mind that this was entirely a way to earn federal funding for Kansas by getting my children adopted out from under me. I had no money for a private attorney so i had to deal with a state appointed one who had interest in helping the ones who are paying her checks. 

As of today it has been over three years since I've had any contact with my children after they got the termination to go through. I don't tell too many people about all this because it's hard for some people to reconcile the fact that their government would legally kidnap it's own citizens for profit. 

But they do. And I'm not the only one they've done this to.

This. People undoubtedly will make his story one of those ""motivational soundbites"" so as to say ""if he can start from zero you can too"". Unfortunately, there can be huge gap between graduates/leavers of quality education to average education. 

Anecdote: I'm not a straight A student from where I was educated, but boy when I compared my NZ colleagues (and me) to my SEA colleagues, the difference in coding ability, problem solving, and intellectual curiosity are really stark. 

EDIT: So just so we are clear, I am saying that schools do make a difference in terms of teaching you responsibility and curiosity. From my anecdotal experience working in NZ and in SEA, I can tell, even though my NZ university is not the best of the world, because the difference to any school in SEA bar Nanyang is very huge, the human quality is also very different. I am not shitting on NZ quality, in fact I am complimenting them. It's not the best in the world, but compared to the region, it's top class. And that's my point, quality schools impart on you intellectual curiosity and ability to solve problems. That's what I didn't see from these SEA graduates. In a way this anecdote corresponds to the story above. Branson might have ""failed"" according to his expensive preppy standard, but because the standard was already high, he came out much better than he would have if he didn't go in. 

Bottom line, always read the fine line of the story. A mere ""survivor"" from a highly achieving school is probably already more prepared compared to people with normal background. This is not to say that if you come from lesser background you won't necessarily have these qualities, just that some schools intensively prepare you for that.

--------------------------------

tim370 @ 2018-08-20 09:28:48 :

Regardless of who’s name was on what documents, it’s misleading to say his Dad gave him Virgin Records. It implies that he was handed an already operating or established business. He started student magazine whilst at school and eventually Virgin years later as mail order record business (including naming it Virgin with his team). Then opened the first Virgin store after a postal strike to mitigate the risk of being dependant on the postal system. 

Not sure how any of that translates to his Dad giving him the business.

Haha he was a 16 year old student and started the magazine from scratch. Getting access to a workspace doesn’t constitute being given the company. That’s like saying Steve Jobs was given Apple by Steve’s Dad because they were allowed to use the garage.

I have done okay, but I'd never pretend that the accident of my birth did not make that possible. A good education, sufficient food, familial support and the occasional loan. They are nothing compared to my eventual success, but workout them I'd never have had the opportunity to take the risks I did.

Its absolutely not. To say that someone was “given a company” because they had a roof, food and education is completely inaccurate. They were given a platform to be able to do something, but they weren’t given the company. Their work ethic &amp; tenacity created their respective companies.

You are genuinely too dense to debate with. He didn’t buy a company. He built it. There was no Student Magazine or Virgin records before he put his blood sweat &amp; tears into creating them. Your analogy is completely flawed. If I gave you £4 million to buy a company that doesn’t exist yet, you wouldn’t be able to do it. Because it doesn’t exist. The £4m would be starting capital to create something new. But what are you going to create? What are you going to sell? What’s your idea? His Dad may have loaned him money but he didn’t give him a company because there was not company to give!

--------------------------------

Pedantichrist @ 2018-08-20 12:56:35 :

He wanted to start a company and his father funded it. That is not starting from scratch. 

I merry Stelios once, and one of my staff told him they thought he was a great self made man. 

He said that was ridiculous, he inherited a small fortune from his father, and did well with it, but he was not self made. 

That is truth.

Teachers are in a Position of Trust, and thus can never engage in sexual conduct. [https://www.uow.edu.au/\~bmartin/pubs/91aust.html](https://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/pubs/91aust.html)

Mate, that article was just explaining what the Position of Trust was, it wasn't talking about it in context of teachers. I posted it because it was very obvious you didn't know what it was. If you had clicked on the second link, you would have read how teachers are in a position of power, and thus cannot engage in those acts. 

--------------------------------

4LokoButtHash @ 2018-10-19 08:37:22 :

Yes. I skimmed through the second article.  The article states they cannot engage in those acts. But that doesn't mean it is rape imo.

--------------------------------

hey_thats_my_box @ 2018-10-19 08:49:12 :

""teachers hold positions of trust.""

\-It is illegal for people in the position of trust to perform sexual acts with people who cannot consent, their students, that's what the first article stated.

""As well as an abuse of trust, sexual relationships between teachers and students represent a serious conflict of interest.""

&amp;#x200B;

You can think whatever you want. In a court of law, the argument ""it is consensual or the boy could simply just not plow the teacher. it isn't like the teacher grabbed the teenage boys pecker and shoved it into her pussy."" wouldn't stand a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only that, but your opinion is extremely harmful. You act like all boys want to have sex with their teachers. This is the reason why reporting sexual harassment is so low amongst boys, the stereotype that they are all just horny and thus it is justified.

4LokoButtHash @ 2018-10-19 08:51:23 :

But since you seem genuinely concerned about this, and made a point of remaining calm and composed in your replies, I'll give it a last shot:

You need to stop arguing with a strawman, man, or whoever you are. None of this is about you. I could ask you to read it again, again, but I never said that the colour of your skin determines whether or not your opinion on racism is valid. In fact, a lot of black people argue that black people in general are in fact not better equipped to discuss racism, and funnily enough, their opinion on racism is invalid, because it is completely detached from the reality of racism in America. 

This is actually why /r/asablackman started out in the first place: the point was to make fun of black people who pretend that racism wasn't still alive and well because they didn't experience it as strongly, or pretended not to, or just to seek validation from the white community which argued in the same way. People ITT tend to think that the point is to make fun of anyone mentioning their skin colour in a discussion about racism. Not at all the case. 

Now, can any white person experience prejudice? Yes, absolutely. Does being white prevent you from having a valid opinion on racism? Absolutely not. Does being white prevent you from being discriminated against? Not a chance. Do white people generally experience the same consistent, ubiquitous, personal, social, professional, legal, life defining level of prejudice and persecution as black people in America? Do you honestly want to even attempt to argue about this? And how can your opinion on racism even have the slightest relevance if you believe that to be the case? That's what I mean by invalidate your opinion. It's not that anyone should be silenced based on anything they have no control over, it's that anyone with zero understanding of racism has no business in this discussion.

So, when someone answers ""nobody gives a shit if you're black"" in a thread where a black person discusses a movie whose wide reception is deeply rooted in the current cultural state of growing awareness on racial issues, I'm like, really? How does being black, with all that entails culturally, not give anyone a deeper connection to Black Panther? Are we for real here?

I don't visit echo chambers. I listen and I watch, all over the spectrum. And I haven't met as much cognitive dissonance as I have from people trying to defend themselves when nobody attacked them in the first place.

But everyone experiences prejudice to some extent. Being a woman exposes you to sexism. Being black exposes you to racism. But you can be a white man and still have people be racist or sexist toward you. Anyone who thinks white men can’t experience racism or sexism are probably racist or sexist themselves. They’d never admit it, of course.

RegencyAndCo @ 2018-12-04 17:22:25 :

Should I rephrase it as ""racism against black people"" and ""sexism against women"" so you dense fuckers get the point? The hype around Black Panther is 100% about racism against black people, and being black gives you a much better understanding of what that entails.

And regardless, black people were dealt the short end of the stick when it comes to racism in today's society, by a wide, wide margin. They know better, period. Arguing against this automatically discredits your opinion on racism.

You have no idea who I am or what experiences I’ve had in my life. Prejudice exists outside of the black community, and outside of the United States.

I would never say your opinion is invalid. Especially not due to your race or your experiences. This is, in itself, a racist remark.

People say, “Don’t let gay people get married, because God says marriage is between a man and a woman,” and then those same people turn around and say helping the needy through social programs is too expensive.

I disagree.  Legislating charity through taxation is lazy and doesn't count as being charitable.  Selflessness is a challenge presented to the Christian through Christ.  Thus, you can be against the government overseeing welfare of others, but you cannot be against doing it yourself.

--------------------------------

BarbusTheSlain @ 2018-12-13 23:31:39 :

So charity isn’t charitable, not sure on that but I like how 100% of people in your opinion who need help are lazy.  You need to rethink a few things here. Lots of emotions non of the facts.

the_purple_owl @ 2018-12-13 23:40:36 :

If order for it to actually be charity it has to be a choice. 

--------------------------------

BarbusTheSlain @ 2018-12-13 23:49:25 :

So charity through taxation would only be charity for half of the people. I see the dilemma. People are still inherently greedy.

Edit: I’m also talking about helping less fortunate not about charity. Or the context around it.

--------------------------------

the_purple_owl @ 2018-12-13 23:53:48 :

The Bible tells you to be charitable. Charity that comes without a choice isn't really charitable. Therefore it's not hypocritical to be against government welfare programs and be Christian. It *is* hypocritical to not support any form of charity."	"the_purple_owl @ 2018-12-14 00:01:21 :

Funny thing is it was probably a well written troll post, half this sub is filled with troll posts it seems and we probably fell victim to it. We are sad, people like us need to be better, do better.

Let me tell you something, when I go to the corner store to pick up smokes, or gas and watnot, I see homeless people, tweakers, people who are considered ""disgusting"". I see these people and it kinda makes me mad, not because they're ""disgusting"", no because they can be so much better than what they've become.

Here are some reasons why interracial dating/marriage is a bad idea, and why it should be discouraged and possibly even banned: 

- The divorce rate of interracial couples is extremely high

41% of all interracial marriages end in divorce, according to the Center of Disease Control. 

- Mental health problems

According to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448064/) study, mixed-race adolescents are...

&gt;50%, 94%, 45%, and 46% more likely to be depressed compared to their White, Black, Native American, and Asian counterparts, respectively.
&gt;34%, 50%, 10%, and 84% more likely to have considered suicide compared to their White, Black, Native American, and Asian counterparts, respectively.
&gt;94%, 6%, 8%, and 258% more likely to have been suspended from school compared to their White, Black, Native American, and Asian counterparts, respectively.

[Mixed-race teens prone to depression](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/10/31/mixed-race-teens-prone-to-depression/ff04745b-be4a-473d-ac59-58abdda8845d/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9ff68b6a97ed)

[Biracial Self-Identification: Impact on Trait Anxiety, Social Anxiety, and Depression](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232860893_Biracial_Self-Identification_Impact_on_Trait_Anxiety_Social_Anxiety_and_Depression)

[Biracial Identity and Its Relation to Self-Esteem and Depression in Mixed Black/White Biracial Individuals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15313201003771783?journalCode=wecd20)

As a mixed-race person, none of these studies are surprising at all. The politically incorrect, but true, reality is that being mixed-race is simply unfortunate. You do not feel a sense of belonging to an ethnic group like other people do. You aren't treated as well as single-race people are treated. You don't have as many dating prospects as single-race people do. 

- Interracial dating/marriage leads to a lot of lonely non-White men

Especially Asian men. Why? Because interracial couples mainly involve non-White women pairing up with White men. Don't believe me? [Here's](https://beautyandrace2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/reply-by-race-male.png) an OkCupid survey that measured how women respond to men based on ethnicity. (Hint: Women desire White men way more than non-White men). 

You really just have to walk outside for 2 seconds in order to notice this trend. How many White-male-Asian-female couples do you see, compared to Asian-male-White-female couples? How many White-male-Hispanic-female couples do you see, compared to Hispanic-male-White-female couples? It's just painfully obvious that there's a gender disparity here, and that minority men get the short end of the stick. **Because of the acceptance of interracial dating, a lot of minority men struggle to find love.**

----------------------

So in short, interracial dating/marriage is bad for individuals and bad for society."	"pynky96 @ 2019-01-24 07:41:05 :

I'm white, mainly, but my cousin is half white half black, she doesn't know who her dad is because he's in prison, when she was younger she always got really confused with her skin color and always asked why she didn't look like the rest of her family, hell people have even accused my aunt of that not being her daughter because of how pastey my aunt is, and my cousin shows more black than white. She always felt like she didn't belong as if she were a black sheep in the family. My best friend is half Mexican half white with 3 siblings all half white and Mexican, his parents  divorced a while back, so yeah it does seem in one way or another they are affected differently than others, I'd never really given any of this much thought. It's funny too my science teacher in 6thbgrade would encourage the class to marry and have kids with another race or our babies will get disease or be deformed, now that I'm out of school and know what I know, that's a pretty fucked thing to tell kids. 

In short I agree

You resorted to attacks when you referred to religion as “bullshit.” Also: the asshole kind of atheist. I’ve no qualms resorting to such attacks after you do. I lower my bar to my opponents when I’m the internet. I don’t care.

And you may want to try to actually have a conversation with a religious person before referring to them as scientifically illiterate. You’re assuming that all religious people are ignorant and scientifically illiterate. Meanwhile, some of us believe in both religion and the Big Bang, and climate change, and vaccines, and evolution, contrary to popular belief. You might find that you are the ignorant one. 

--------------------------------

SamK7265 @ 2019-02-20 00:03:51 :

Faith requires a combination of ignorance and scientific illiteracy. It is also the foundation of religion.

Also, I’m a theoretical physicist. I am one of the least ignorant people on the planet.

Faith does not require ignorance or scientific illiteracy.

I have no way to verify this claim. Also, I’m an M.D.

--------------------------------

SamK7265 @ 2019-02-20 00:57:12 :

Faith, by definition, is the belief in something without evidence to support it.

To have faith, therefore, means to be in stark contradiction with the scientific method.

Ben Carson is an M.D. too. He is also pretty stupid with regards to anything outside of medicine. (To be clear, I am *not* calling you stupid. Just saying that medicine has very little to do with the laws of nature, and therefore knowledge of medicine does not translate to knowledge of the universe).

--------------------------------

Vilhelm16 @ 2019-02-20 01:57:13 :

I’m not an MD. That was sarcasm. Should probably have /s’d that. My bad.

That is correct: faith is, by definition, to believe something without physical evidence to support it. The reason why religious people use faith instead of the scientific method is because the scientific method can neither prove nor disprove the existence of a god. It’s not in contradiction: it simply fills in for where religious people feel science haven’t answered questions that religion claims it can.

As a theoretical physicist, answer this: could the Big Bang have been orchestrated by a god? 

Stephen Hawking (Rest in Peace) said that “Since events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are not simply defined, because there’s no way one could have measured what happened at them.”

(This was off of hawking.org.uk)

Using Hawking’s explanation, I believe the answer is yes, that could be the case. There is no empirical evidence in favor or against such an occurrence. 

Now hawking was an atheist, as well. He said “One can’t prove that God doesn’t exist. But science makes god unnecessary...the laws of physics can explain the universe without the need for a creator.” 

I believe that the laws of physics explaining the universe does not mean there is no god to fear.

He also said that “I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no god.” And suggests that there is no heaven and no afterlife. I boil this down to an occam’s razor fallacy: just because this is the simplest explanation does not make it correct.

(These last two quotes were from a Washington post article)

Due to these statements, I believe religion and science have the potential to be perfectly compatible. I believe it is compatible with theoretical physics, with biology and evolution, and all other fields of science.

SamK7265 @ 2019-02-20 04:08:44 :

You’re right, it is, technically speaking, possible for a god to have created the universe. But it is also very much possible for it to exist without a god. And considering there is no actual evidence that god exists, the rationale decision is that the alternative is true.

Is it *possible* that the Flying Spaghetti Monster creates the universe? Yes. Does that make it reasonable to believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster? No, it does not.

Think of all of the reasons why it would be irrational to believe in the FSM, and you have a list of reasons why all other gods are irrational as well.

--------------------------------

Vilhelm16 @ 2019-02-20 04:46:39 :

It’s not rational to reject or accept the existence of a god using this chain of logic. In fact, if that’s what you believe, you’re probably more of an agnostic than an atheist.

Literally *everything* is technically possible.

It is not a high bar. Hell, it’s not even a bar at all.

Vilhelm16 @ 2019-02-20 17:25:39 :

And you seem to not understand what an agnostic is. Agnostics lack faith in any specific god, while claiming nothing can be known of god because of lack of physical phenomena. There could be no such thing as an agnostic Cthulhuist; the idea itself is self-contradictory.

And let me re-iterate my earlier point because I don’t think I made it across well enough: you’re a random person on the internet who calls themself a theoretical physicist. There’s a 90% chance you watched the Big Bang theory once and decided you know enough to pass yourself as one. It doesn’t matter if you actually are one when you’re on the internet.

First, I was referring to your hypocrisy with the “Cthulhu vs. god” agnostic thing, not my credentials.

Second, “so thick I could cut it with a knife” is a common expression where I live. Perhaps I shouldn’t have used a regional phrase, but it does not discredit my point.

Finally, to make it abundantly clear what I meant regarding your hypocrisy, you claim that “agnostic cthulhuism” is a stupid concept, considering that Cthulhu obviously isn’t real. But all of the sudden, when I replace “Cthulhu” with “god,” it becomes a legitimate (and universally applicable) term?

To an atheist, god is just as crazy of a concept as cthulhu (perhaps more so). So if you insist that atheists are really agnostics, then you must also believe that you are an agnostic cthulhuist, agnostic leprechaunist, ad infinium.

I hope I was able to make that clear to you.

You obviously don’t understand what atheism, agnosticism, or hypocrisy are, and quite frankly you don’t seem to absorb any new information, so I am done wasting my time with you.

Vilhelm16 @ 2019-02-20 20:37:01 :

You said that last time, and then you replied, so I invite you to reply again to see if you have any resolve.

The idea that one would be an agnostic (insert specific deity here) is ridiculous. An agnostic recognizes no specific deity, which is what makes it ridiculous. An agnostic recognizing a Christian god is as ridiculous as recognizing any god other than a general one. 

You’re no less stubborn than I am. Don’t for a minute pretend otherwise. You have no moral high ground.

I’m not suggesting atheists are agnostics. I’m suggesting that by the reasoning you have laid out, you are technically an agnostic rather than an atheist. You do not speak for all atheists, therefore I do not say that all atheists are actually agnostics.

I understand exactly what atheism, agnosticism, and hypocrisy are. I have the definitions out with me. I’ve read the definitions on r/atheism. 

I’m...not agnostic. I’m suggesting that you are, based on your technical understanding of the universe. Whatever.

I’m getting bored, because this has reached an impasse. How did this conversation start again?"

This made sense to people at the time.  Apes walk on their knuckles, so the ape-man had to be halfway between.  They weren't really thinking through how a half-ape half- human would move and function, and they didn't really understand biomechanics at that level. 

As it turns out, the Neanderthals were fully human, or very far along the way to it, and that first skeleton proved it.  They kept a disabled elder alive, they cared about him.  They probably valued his experience, which he would have shared through language, and they had enough mastery of their environment to secure food for years for a man who couldn't hunt- during a harsh ice age climate.

--------------------------------

NorthEasternNomad @ 2019-03-01 20:44:34 :

I read somewhere that ancient hunter/gatherer tribes mostly didn't struggle to feed themselves. Resources were fairly abundant. 

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-01 20:58:17 :

This seems very unlikely even though I haven't looked into that particular case. When resources are abundant a species population will grow until it hits a bottleneck; food or territory being the most common for mammals. Since change like this is usually (not always) gradual on both fronts it means you're more or less in constant competition for scarcity over at least one critical resource - and in most cases your primary competitor will be other members of your own species. 

--------------------------------

TheOneTonWanton @ 2019-03-01 21:07:39 :

I would think that their nomadic lifestyle helped keep the populations in check, along with being a hunter/gatherer society in which there must have been plenty of deaths on the hunt and things of that nature. Also infant mortality in general. Just because food was abundant doesn't mean there weren't other things keeping them from exploding.

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-01 21:24:39 :

As I said they had at the very least one resource scarcity as bottleneck, I didn't say it had to be food specifically. 

That said we know food was part of the equation; seeing as populations exploded after agriculture became a thing. If food weren't a limited factor for the hunter gatherers then there wouldn't be such a difference between them and those who used early agriculture in terms of population growth; nor would we expect agriculture to take off to the extent that it did if it wasn't advantagus in terms of nessecity for more food. 

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-01 21:49:10 :

It may not be the abundance of food in agriculture that produced the population explosion, but rather the ease and safety in gathering food. Piggybacking off of the other guy's comment, if infant mortality and the danger of the hunt were the main factors keeping populations low, the switch to agriculture would mean less people dying in the hunt, allowing for more births. It could also mean that, as populations are no longer constantly on the move, more people can devote time to caring for newborns and pregnant mothers, lowering the infant mortality rate. In this scenario, the stability of agricultural lifestyle leads to an explosion in population, not necessarily access to more food

--------------------------------

Jewnadian @ 2019-03-01 22:56:50 :

The danger of the hunt **is** controlling access to food though. If hunting is so dangerous it's a primary population control mechanism that means that getting food is literally a death defying struggle.  

The infant mortality thing is just pulled purely out of your ass. There is a perfectly logical connection between growing food and having food. There's no reasonable mechanism for infant mortality being so much higher for hunter gathers that it formed the primary population limit. 

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-01 23:04:51 :

Wow your comment reeks of ignorance.

You cannot claim that the dangers of the hunt feeds into the abundance of food being the reason behind the population boom. They are two distinct factors. Dying from hunting has nothing to do with a food abundance/shortage. Youre pulling shit out of your ass.

Infant mortality is still high in this day and age. Its perfectly reasonable to believe it would be much higher in an age without modern medicne. Its even more reasonable to believe it would be even higher in a society of hunter gatherers with nomadic lifestyles. The lack of stability coupled with the lack of additional personnel to stay with infants and pregant mothers. Agriculture would add stability to the society, would mean less people have to leave the village, meaning more people can stay behind to care for the vulnerable, meaning more babies make it to adulthood.

--------------------------------

Dying from hunting is absolutely a food abundance/shortage issue.

This is like saying that the danger of getting caught isn't a factor for criminals money abundance/shortage. It absolutely is. The heists you could do if getting caught wasn't an issue would increase a criminals access to money astronomically. "	"GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 00:14:47 :

You seem to have trouble grasping fundamental concepts. The question isn't whether or not the food is somewhere out there; the question is to which extent it is accessible to hunter gatherers.

If mortality during hunts were high, as you claim and as might very well be the case, then that puts an additional cost and determent to that accessibility. This is a huge factor that can absolutely not be ignored when discussing food availability for hunter gatherers. 

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 00:20:05 :

Again you're way of metric. Yes there would be more food to go around *from that particular mammoth* - which would last you a few weeks or whatever. But after that you would have less hunters than you did before; but not less children and elderly to feed - which equates to more people to feed per available hunter from now on and forward. Again; mortality during hunts are a critical factor when evaluating food scarcity.

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 00:28:12 :

No. You have trouble coming to terms with the concept that two factors are seperate of each other. Deaths from hunting does NOT play into food abundance/shortage. They are two seperate factors. Just because one may affect the other doesnt mean they are one factor. Stop twisting science just because you dont want to be wrong

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 00:30:55 :

My example was simply to prove that deaths from hunting are a seperate factor from food supply. Not to mention, that there is no proof that you wouldnt have more hunters. Children were brought on hunts so long as they were trained to hunt. Not to mention, of one particular game was seen as too dangerous, there was other game to hunt. You are way off metric because you dont want to accept that youre wrong. Youre combining factors so that you can claim youre right when someone brings something up proving you wrong

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 00:44:30 :

&gt; My example was simply to prove that deaths from hunting are a seperate factor from food supply.

Which I'm still laughing about since hunters are the ones that provide the supply (or contribute at least). 

&gt;Not to mention, that there is no proof that you wouldnt have more hunters. Children were brought on hunts so long as they were trained to hunt.

Hilarious. Are you saying that a tribe that has 10 hunters and 10 children where none of the hunters die would have *less* hunters than a tribe that had 10 hunters and 10 children but some of their hunters had died? This just keeps getting better. 

&gt;Not to mention, of one particular game was seen as too dangerous, there was other game to hunt. 

Absolutely. They would only take the risk of hunting dangerous game if they absolutely had to due to scarcity. 

&gt;You are way off metric because you dont want to accept that youre wrong. Youre combining factors so that you can claim youre right when someone brings something up proving you wrong

I'm still waiting for the proof. 

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 00:46:13 :

Stop talking about science when you have absolutely no idea how to engage with it. And BTW I have never said they were one factor or the same or whatever - that is something your have made up: I have said hunter mortality during hunts are **a** factor in food accessibility. 

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 00:58:20 :

Dude, just admit youre trying to twist facts so you cant be proven wrong. You claim that agriculture led to a population boom because of food. Someone mentions other factors that agriculture affected and mentioned how there was never really a lack of food in hunter-gatherer societies, and you try to claim that those other factors are part of food supply. You're arguing bad science because you cant accept that you're wrong

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 00:59:29 :

Dumbass, you literally said that the danger of hunting is a part of food shortage/abundance. Now you contradict yourself in this comment. But im the one who doesnt know how to engage with science? 


Thanks for proving that you dont have a legitmate argument here.

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 02:52:27 :

Exactly, and saying the danger of hunting is part of the food shortage/abundance equation is **not** the same as saying they are one and the same. How are you this dense?

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 03:02:13 :

What other factors am I claiming is a part of food supply? I don't even know what you think I mean. 

I am saying agriculture gave people better access to food. *One* of the reasons (a minor one mind you) they got better access to food this way was because they died less while getting it. 

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 03:20:20 :

Youre the one saying that it plays into your argument of food abundance/shortage when it doesnt. There was such a variety of game and plants that they were seperate factors. Agriculture allowed for tribes to settle down and allow for a more stable lifestyle. Tools were already being invented before agriculture, agriculture meant that instead of building mostly small tools and abandoning them shen moving, they could develop more tools and culture. 

I mean really, what makes more sense, that ancient humans were starving and figured out how to grow plants instead of moving on to more food, or that tribes started observing how plants grow and figured out that if they grow plants, they dont have to move around anymore?

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 03:23:09 :

Youre the one claiming that dying from a hunt is a food supply issue, when it isnt. Its an ease of access issue. Agriculture led to a population boom because of the ease of access, not an abundance of food

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 03:33:11 :

I did not say early humans were starving, I said populations always grow to reach a bottleneck and that this bottleneck was food scarcity. ""Scarcity"" **does not** mean starvation; scarcity means you must work/compete to get your share - which was definitely true for early humans and is even true for us today (though less so for food specifically in industrialized countries).

Food scarcity meant human populations could not grow to become much bigger until new technology for food productions was invented. This new technology was agriculture; agriculture **did not** solve food scarcity, but what it did was to lift the roof of the bottleneck so that a massively bigger population could exist in the world at any given time. To be very clear here so you stop misunderstanding me: there is *still* scarcity, there is *still* a bottleneck, but the roof of the bottleneck is higher after agriculture than before - due to increased food potential per km^2.    

--------------------------------

GepardenK @ 2019-03-02 03:44:07 :

Hahahahahahahah

My man, the hoops you jump through. *Ease of access* is the **definition** of a supply issue. For any given population getting easier access to food *is the same* as getting more food. 

--------------------------------

zzwugz @ 2019-03-02 04:12:41 :

Ease of access applies to much more than food. If they can grow certain plants with medicinal purposes, they can have basic care. Agriculture means they can grow that plant rather than lose it when they have to move. If they find a resource that can allow for better tools, they can use agriculture to stay there, rather than give up that resource when they have to move. If they can plant trees, they can build sturdier structures and still have resources later down the road. Settling down means more people are born because of the lack of constant migration and the fact that more people can care for young. Your argument was that it was an abundance of food that led to the population boom. My point was that, since there was already an abundance of food in hunter gatherer lifestyles, it was a host of other factors that agriculture brought that les to more people being born."

I was sexually abused by my teacher in kindergarten. He told me if I told anyone he'd kill me. He was too much of a coward to go through with that threat I guess. My dad walked out when I was 3 so he didn't pummel the guy.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people literally think a 50 year old man sleeping with a 25 year old consenting woman is pedophilia which is just dumb. Even if she was only 16 or even 13 there are different words other than pedophile that classify him better. Is he an immoral fuck bag in those cases? Sure. But he isn't a pedophile. And calling him a pedophile is putting him the same category as people who literally fuck toddlers which is absolutely disgusting. The teenager can at least think, and protest, and possibly give consent since they understand what's going on. Fucking a toddler is always rape because a kid that age can't even comprehend sex let alone consent to it. A 16 year old can for sure. A 13 year old, it's debatable. That's why there are varying levels. Pedophilia is attraction to prepubescant kids. Hebephilia is 11-14. Ephebophilia is 15 and up until they're no longer a minor. And these three things are not even a little bit comparable. Diddling a 5 year old is a lot worse than having sex with a 17 year old with consent. Hell, 16+ is the age of consent in Canada and the UK. It's even lower in some countries. So calling those people pedophiles detracts from more serious cases involving really disgusting men.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Pedophile just means you're attracted to young kids. It doesn't necessarily mean you watch kiddy porn or abuse children. We don't throw people in prison unless they actually commit a crime. The same goes for Hebephiles and Ephebophiles. If they aren't commiting crimes, then they don't deserve to be hated or jailed. They're born liking what they like, similar to gay people. And they're only immoral and worthy of having their asses kicked if they actually abuse kids or endorse abuse of children by owning or watching child porn.

&amp;#x200B;

People should always be judged on their conduct, not their likes and dislikes. The overwhelming majority of pedophiles know their line of thinking is sick and wrong and stay away from kids and behave themselves when they are around kids. I myself am a non-acting Ephebophile admittedly. I think it's just that I used to be that age pretty recently, and my taste in women hasn't caught up to my age yet. I'm a man child. Immature. Slow to develop. I just got my license last year. Roast or make fun of me it's fine. Young 20s is my maturity level and the women there are beautiful. I like them when they look 16-25ish. But in my case, 16 and 17 year olds aren't actually my target. They just happen to look the same as the 22-23 year olds. I don't actually want anything to do with a girl who is a minor, but I'm not gonna lie and say they're not attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

Hentai also isn't immoral because it doesn't objectify or degrade any living person. Legal teen porn is worse than hentai because it objectifies young impressionable women who look the same as they did when they were 16 and 17."	"MechaJerkzilla @ 2019-03-22 04:54:04 :

I’ve given up on correcting people misusing that word.  They just turn it into a reason to make you look like a pedophile.  “Oh you’re interested in people using the correct words for things?  You must want to fuck children too”.  Just getting into it with people who misuse it is a suckers game."

Other then that the only other change to my person is I have a nice memory and I know what it feels like. My personality hasn’t changed at all, I don’t understand what is supposed to change.

It's a dumb term that shouldn't even exist. Nobody talks about naziphobia and I could argue that both ideologies are just as vile.

Islam views non-muslims as Kafirs,calls them [""friends of Satan""](https://al-quran.info/#4:76_) and aims to fight jihad till all non-muslims are converted, killed or enslaved.

I was talking purely about ideologies, not people and when it comes to ideologies, both islam and nazism are just as hateful and dangerous when taken to the extreme. Most nazis aren't going to go out and murder non-whites,but some will. Most muslims aren't going to go out and murder non-muslims,but some will. There is a genuine reason to be afraid of both ideologies. The Quran even has verses about beheading non-believers, it's right there in the book.

I am sure this person has a very tough life. But whoever escorted him should have thought about the other movie goers and opted to enjoy a movie in a private space.

No where did I state that those enjoying the movie should also enjoy interruptions to the movie.  It's natural to be annoyed by interruptions, of course.  But some compassion is required I think on our part, as well as appreciation for the fact that we do not have those life challenges.  If all we have to worry about is the possible annoyance from someone else interrupting our movie, we have it pretty good.  Anytime we step outside of our homes we run the risk of being annoyed and exposed to other people living their lives in other ways from our own.  Maybe stay at home and watch Netflix if this is truly a deal-breaker for you.  This guy's just trying to live his life.

Correct - his disability does not give him privilege of ruining a movie for anyone else, nor does our lack of a disability give us the privileged to insist that he go home.  No one is more valid in this situation than anyone else.  I am not suggesting that his needs or abilities supersede anyone else's.  I am stating that everyone's life has different challenges, and we all have to tolerate them in different capacities.  
Like if someone is incessantly screaming and yelling - sure, they should probably try to watch a movie in a more isolated area than a public forum. But at the end of the day, no one owns public space.  It's for everyone, and as long as someone's actions are not harming themselves or others directly, we as adults in a polite free society must tolerate and accept those behaviors."

All you have to do is look around you and realize that no man circumcised at birth has been affected negatively because of it. It's only these keyboard activists who are freaked out about it and spreading this ridiculous notion that other people are missing something significant, everyone else in the world is enjoying their penis and couldn't give any less of a shit humanly imaginable.

--------------------------------

TheNotepadPlus @ 2019-07-05 15:55:00 :

From Wikipedia:

&gt;Significant acute complications happen rarely,[3][18] occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States.

The rate of circumcision in the US has dropped drastically over the last decade or so. In 2009, roughly 30% of newborn males were circumcised.

There were just over 2 million boys born in the US in 2009. That means that an unnecessary cosmetic surgical procedure caused *significant acute complications* in 1200 infants.

If we look at these numbers since 2000, when the rate was closer to 60%, we get a total of 21.000 infants that have had *significant acute complications* from the procedure over a ten year span (from 2000-2009).

Do you think that is acceptable for an unnecessary procedure performed on infants?

There is a reason people are against circumcision, in both genders. There is a reason circumcision rates are falling drastically. It's unnecessary and cruel. Why allow it?

--------------------------------

Sad_Sheepherder @ 2019-07-05 16:19:36 :

Circumcision against women is unnecessary and cruel. Done to women, it is demonstrably, clearly, and obviously much more different than the procedure done to men, with whom anyone with eyeballs and an age over twelve can tell you that it has affected them approximately none. 

There is no need for stats. There is no need for research. If I could go back in time and stop my parents from having it done, would I? I suppose. Maybe? It doesn't matter. In a perfect world I guess, but it DOES. NOT. MATTER.

Look around you. Look at porn. Consider all the men in all the world's breadth, and tell me if circumcision at birth has stopped any of them from having sex. Tell me if sex doesn't feel good to them. Tell me if they think their penis ""needs"" to be more sensitive, if that's even a thing. Tell me they don't masturbate without lubricant anyway. 

It's not like cutting the clitoris. It's not. It is not comparable at all, and if you've ever touched a vagina much less had sex with someone who has one, you'd know that. And if you ask me, the mere concept of having to clean something off my penis *for any reason whatsoever*, even if it's my own lack of hygiene, is enough to make me feel grateful.

And if you think that making decisions on your child's behalf for what you think is their benefit is cruel, you are unfit to have children.

TheNotepadPlus @ 2019-07-05 16:41:22 :

Wow, did I hit a nerve or something?

&gt;Consider all the men in all the world's breadth, and tell me if circumcision at birth has stopped any of them from having sex. 

Ok, I will consider ALL the men. That must include the ones that have died due to circumcision (it's rare but happens, esp. in less developed countries). Do you think they are enjoying sex?

I did not compare male and female circumcision at all. My post was about the 21.000 infants that had serious surgical complications from an unnecessary procedure in the US.

But since you brought up FGM, let's talk FGM. There are many different versions of FGM, including one that only cuts off the clitoral hood (the skin over the clitoris). If done in a medical setting it's a very safe procedure. Would you be fine with that procedure being performed on a million girls each year in the US?

You even admit that you would have preferred if your parents had not done the procedure:

&gt;If I could go back in time and stop my parents from having it done, would I? I suppose. Maybe? It doesn't matter. In a perfect world I guess...

I'm not looking for a perfect world, just a world that does not perform unnecessary genital surgeries on infants.

Oh, and like the poster below, check out /r/CircumcisionGrief. There you will find the men you claim do not exist.

I'm not here to argue or try to compare which genital surgery is worse; I want them all gone.

--------------------------------

Sad_Sheepherder @ 2019-07-05 17:52:06 :

&gt; Wow, did I hit a nerve or something?

No, I just am super weary of seeing people on the internet act as though I had four arms at birth and lost two of them for no reason. The difference is not that intense, I refuse to believe that.

&gt; Do you think they are enjoying sex?

You're just insulting my intelligence with that question. Please.

&gt; If done in a medical setting it's a very safe procedure. Would you be fine with that procedure being performed on a million girls each year in the US?

FGM is completely different, and I do not support it. I have experience with vaginas, lots of it. I know as much about vaginas as women do, probably more because most women (from what I'm told) aren't as intimately familiar with their genitals as men are. When I look at my girlfriend's vagina, I would not change anything. Her clitoris is very, very important. 

The female vagina is completely different than the male penis. I do not see the point in comparing them. Anything that affects my girlfriend's clitoris would be bad, and if her clitoral stimulation is reduced, that would be terrible for her. I on the other hand have been circumcised, and my sexual pleasure is not weak in the slightest. I get all the stimulation I imagine I'd ever need. As a matter of fact, men not lasting long in bed is one of the all-time running gags of history, so having my penis be more sensitive than it already is sounds like a serious handicap. No thanks.

&gt; You even admit that you would have preferred if your parents had not done the procedure

You're right, I did say that. But that's mostly because I have an irrational fear of missing out. I got into PC gaming exclusively because I heard the graphics were better, it drove me nuts; accessibility and additional features were not even at the top of my list. My fear of missing out exists whether I truly miss out on anything or not, it's a character flaw of mine.

&gt; There you will find the men you claim do not exist.

Circumcision Grief is a hilariously small community. I started a subreddit for an up and coming YouTube channel and got more subscribers than that sub, and I barely promoted it at all. It's dead basically now and it still has more subscribers. I've been to CircGrief, and I think it's pathetic. I think those men need someone in their life who cared enough to teach them some perspective on things, or perhaps they suffer from mental illness. I think someone put the idea in their head that they are missing out on something, and it's all in their head. So no, the three hundred some odd randoms on that sub do not exist to me. I sympathize with their hurt but I think their hurt is a shadow cast by hysteria. 

There are infinite things in life which you could argue are unnecessary. Automobiles aren't necessary, technically, and yet they kill people every day. The fact will always remain that my penis is perfect in every way, and yet I am circumcised. I reap all the benefits of an uncircumcised penis regardless, and that's the best evidence I have, and I'm not letting go of it for a handful of source links that bespeak nothing of what I've observed in real life.

Sad_Sheepherder @ 2019-07-06 19:32:51 :

You (and other people) seem to be under the impression that the child is an adult with autonomy and the wisdom to take care of themselves. They aren't. Children do not get free reign over the ability of choice in their lives. That's called ""bad parenting"". 

I'm being totally serious about this. You should not regard your children like they're grownups. If your child grows up and eventually says, ""Mom/Dad, I want to try out for (insert school team here)"". That is a choice they can make. They have grown a few years and they develop interests. Similarly, if you take them to a game store, and they have the ability to scan the games and determine what they want to play. You judge their choice to make sure it's child appropriate (if you abide by ratings and such, some parents do), and then they have made a choice.

But when the child is an infant and the doctor offers to perform a procedure  that is beneficial to the child (assume that it is, let's not get back to that part of the argument), you as the parent have the ability, no, the right, to make that decision for them. Many doctors agree that the procedure is beneficial, and obviously many still do because it's still being done. If it were merely cosmetic, like a haircut, I doubt doctors would still do it because doctors are not usually in the business of killing patients. And personally, since I'm circumcised, I think it's great and I kinda agree with them. I don't believe this hogwash about being uncut being so much better.

You are the parent. You make decisions for child. That's being a parent. A child's consent and ability to make decisions only goes so far. This obsession with ""choice"" people have these days is completely skewed towards a child's mindset, I swear to God. Of course the child wants to watch or play whatever they want, they're a kid, they don't understand that you as the parent make decisions for them.

Sad_Sheepherder @ 2019-07-06 23:09:53 :

It's only mutilation and life-altering if you're living under the false belief that the surgery causes such a dramatic difference in stimulation. 

Circumcised men do not have cobblestone penises incapable of stimulation. The notion that some men in the world have lost a great deal due to circumcision is a minuscule issue that has been blown up by a scale of a million times, and you have been misled by passionate activists that have been given a free platform and lots of exposure courtesy of the internet. 

The sooner you learn to accept the fact that there are infinite amounts of men out there with circumcised penises still reaping all the benefits you think they're losing by not having a foreskin, the sooner this will matter a great deal less to you. You need to let your obsession with it go, because it's weird and unhealthy. You need to stop arguing about it with random strangers on the internet. You need to realize that doctors take an oath to do no harm, and it would not continue to be done if it were so harmful. It's not like cancer where you're killing most of the body to rid it and the procedure is highly dangerous.

I can do this for as long as we need to. I'm sick of stepping down and letting weirdo geeks who get a high off of arguing with people have the last word. I will make as many new accounts as I need to in order to continue arguing with you about it."	"Sad_Sheepherder @ 2019-07-06 23:48:45 :

I think the bigger concern with banning on platforms like this is that then people go to custom platforms where they never engage with the other side and are Ina bubble of assuming that most people are on their side.  That separation further divides us. It may sound weird to say but, just like a family, we are closer to each other after a few good arguments.  If you stop arguing or treat disagreements like a problem and avoid them then you are only making the situation worse.  

I agree with what a lot of people are saying about universities but it is not only there where the issue exists.  We have a commander in chief who held a free speech event only for explicitly conservative outlets...that in itself on top of numerous other examples shows an unwillingness to even listen to the other side and have a dialogue or argument.  Not a shouting match but a real discussion.  

The other side isn't the enemy, they are your neighbors, family and colleagues.  It's okay to argue but you can't close your mind to what the other person is trying to convey. Sometimes word choice is poor but there is almost always an underlying point and if we can grasp that point then we have a chance at meaningful dialogue and compromise that we can all live with. 

Our leaders should be better than us at making these points in a way that isn't diluted but is still phrased in a way that the other side can grasp and respect the underlying point."	0	1	stop arguing comment					[deleted]

I'm not arguing otherwise. I don't think I've been clear about what I'm advocating, so that's probably my fault.

I'm not advocating that. I'm saying mothers who receive child support should be held accountable for how they spend it, one way or another. In other words, spend it on the kid and nothing else that you should be providing yourself. Regardless of the previous family dynamic (ie: who was working, who had a career, etc.).

Life can change quick. You need plans A, B and C in the event of a major lifestyle change like a divorce. You can't just say ""well, fuck. I've never had a career so I guess I'll just take these child support payments and live off those"". That's a disservice to yourself and your child. You better get your shit together quick and find a reliable income source. Do what you have to do in tough situations like everyone else. Life's hard.

&gt;Unless you think finances should be the main concern when deciding custody, your way will result in homeless children.

Jesus man, it's not like we have CPS and a fucking entire foster and adoption system. They wouldn't be living on the streets, they'd be living in another person's home.

&gt;Custody normally goes to the primary caregiver, for what should be obvious reasons

No. It goes to the parent best suited to raise the child. Emotionally, financially and responsibly.   


A massive part of that? Providing shelter. That's the most basic, fundamental and critical aspect to raising a family unit. After divorce, if you can't provide shelter without taking child support payments, you should lose your kids.

&gt;Literally the point of your argument but ok  
&gt;  
&gt;I thought you said finances aren’t the main concern, now you change your mind in the same post?

No, it's not. Not at all. I'm saying financial health is one of the many things taken into consideration by the courts in their comprehensive evaluation.

&gt;Literally *my* argument for why *you* aren’t worth talking to but ok

I'm not advocating for children to live with parents that can't afford to take care of them without spousal support after assets are split. You kind of are.

&gt; No, it's not. Not at all. I'm saying financial health is one of the many things taken into consideration by the courts in their comprehensive evaluation.

So why do you keep arguing otherwise then, you can’t have it both ways, pick a side or stop arguing

&gt;I'm not advocating for children to live with parents that can't afford to take care of them without spousal support after assets are split. You kind of are.

You are advocating against child support to the custodial parent. I am not. Unless you think finances should be the main concern when deciding custody, your way will result in homeless children."	"MelisandreStokes @ 2019-08-02 15:45:30 :

&gt; I'm saying mothers who receive child support should be held accountable for how they spend it, one way or another. 

Literally the first I’ve heard of this from you. How would this work? And why do you keep saying things that indicate child support shouldn’t be a thing and the kids should go to whoever can afford a house with their own job?

&gt;In other words, spend it on the kid and nothing else that you should be providing yourself.

Do you think starving yourself to death is going to help your children? Isn’t this the conversation that started with someone saying child support should not be used to pay for housing? And yet you aren’t advocating for homeless children?

&gt;Regardless of the previous family dynamic (ie: who was working, who had a career, etc.).

Uhhh why the fuck?

&gt;Life can change quick. You need plans A, B and C in the event of a major lifestyle change like a divorce. You can't just say ""well, fuck. I've never had a career so I guess I'll just take these child support payments and live off those"". 

Big ol strawman, no one does that

&gt;That's a disservice to yourself and your child. You better get your shit together quick and find a reliable income source. Do what you have to do in tough situations like everyone else. Life's hard.

Yeah, one of those things is filing for child support bruh 

&gt;Jesus man, it's not like we have CPS and a fucking entire foster and adoption system. They wouldn't be living on the streets, they'd be living in another person's home.

I’m sorry, what kind of evil piece of shit thinks foster care is better than a known loving home? Have you ever heard of foster care? You think kids should be adopted away from their parents because their parents had the audacity to get divorced? Have you ever actually *thought* about any of this, let alone *looked into it?* There are very good fucking reasons why we don’t do things your way

&gt;It's not a perfect system, but it's better than your hyperbolic ""being on the streets"", which is the only option you presented, completely ignoring the foster system.

I didn’t think you’d rather take a child away from a loving home and deny parental rights to people who have done nothing wrong than just advocate for child support

That's up to legislators and government to figure out if it's plausible. I don't think I've said anything that indicates child support shouldn't be a thing, once. All I've said is mother's should have accountability in how they spend it.   


&gt; Do you think starving yourself to death is going to help your children? 

Really dude? We've already been through this. If you don't have the resources or ability to feed, cloth and house your children on your **own income (excluding child support payments)**, you're unfit to raise them. The law holds a similar standard. Try and look at what's best for a child objectively, and put aside the feelings and emotions of the parents, as difficult as it is.   


&gt; Uhhh why the fuck? 

Because you're life has changed and you're unable to adapt. Therefore, you're unfit to raise children.   


&gt; Yeah, one of those things is filing for child support bruh 

That's fine, depending on how you're using the funds. If I ""*keep saying things that indicate child support shouldn’t be a thing*"" I wouldn't hold this position. I've been consistent throughout, maybe not clear enough. Child support is important, the funds just need to be used responsibly.   


&gt; I’m sorry, what kind of evil piece of shit thinks foster care is better than a known loving home? 

Have you forgot what we're discussing? A ""known loving home"" can be worse for a child than a foster family if their biological family cannot take care of them sufficiently, under any of the circumstances we've previously discussed.   


Because it's in the child's best interest to have a family who can provide sufficiently. That's the whole idea behind a foster and adoption system.  


&gt;Have you ever heard of foster care? You think kids should be adopted away from their parents because their parents had the audacity to get divorced? 

I've heard of Foster Care, my guy. I'm the one who brought it up as an alternative to your ""they'll be on the streets"". And no, not because they ""have the audacity to get divorced"" (really?), but because they don't have the resources and abilities required to raise a child.   


&gt;I didn’t think you’d rather take a child away from a loving home and deny parental rights to people who have done nothing wrong than just advocate for child support 

Denying parental rights to people who don't have the resources and abilities to raise children is perfectly reasonable and is already being practiced in today's legal system.  


You have mis-characterized and twisted almost everything I've said.

You don’t even have any idea if it’s plausible, nor any intention of finding out, yet it’s the thing you are arguing for? Wow

&gt; If you don't have the resources or ability to feed, cloth and house your children on your own income (excluding child support payments), you're unfit to raise them.

We’ve been through the part where you said *finances shouldn’t be the main factor*, too! I can’t have a discussion with you if you keep contradicting yourself. Ffs this contradicts “I don't think I've said anything that indicates child support shouldn't be a thing, once. All I've said is mother's should have accountability in how they spend it.”, as well. 

Make your beliefs consistent with one another, please, damn

&gt;The law holds a similar standard.

Then what are we even talking about???

&gt;Try and look at what's best for a child objectively, and put aside the feelings and emotions of the parents, as difficult as it is.

Yeah no shit, that’s why *your way is bad*

&gt;Because you're life has changed and you're unable to adapt. Therefore, you're unfit to raise children.

I think you must have misunderstood my original what the fuck, because what the fuck?

&gt;That's fine, depending on how you're using the funds. If I ""keep saying things that indicate child support shouldn’t be a thing"" I wouldn't hold this position.

Who the fuck knows what position you hold at this point, you haven’t thought this through enough

&gt;I've been consistent throughout

You have been consistently self-contradictory, yes

&gt;Child support is important, the funds just need to be used responsibly.

How do we as a society determine that? Are you gonna change your mind about who is responsible for deciding whether that is plausible now?

&gt;Have you forgot what we're discussing? A ""known loving home"" can be worse for a child than a foster family if their biological family cannot take care of them sufficiently, under any of the circumstances we've previously discussed.

Which you have previously claimed, I have argued against by pointing out what that will imply, and you’ve replied with “I don’t believe in any of the obvious implications of x, I only believe in x” 

Oh, and the biological family *can* provide for the child, because the non-custodial child-support paying parent is a member of their biological fucking family, you goddamn genius. *You* are the one arguing that child support should not be allowed to help pay for a roof over the child’s head, not me.

&gt;I've heard of Foster Care, my guy. I'm the one who brought it up as an alternative to your ""they'll be on the streets"".

Yeah foster care is sooooo much better than using child support to pay rent or mortgage or whatever. 

&gt;And no, not because they ""have the audacity to get divorced"" (really?), but because they don't have the resources and abilities required to raise a child.

Except the whole point is they *do* but for *your* restrictions

&gt;Denying parental rights to people who don't have the resources and abilities to raise children is perfectly reasonable and is already being practiced in today's legal system.

Then what the fuck are you arguing about?

&gt;You have mis-characterized and twisted almost everything I've said.

bananarama1991 @ 2019-08-02 18:23:28 :

Sorry to drag this out, I just want to clarify my position.   


What I'd propose, after the divorce is finalized and the assets split, and after the courts take consideration of all aspects and factors of the relationship; the father will take care of his own expenses, the mother take care of her own expenses, and the parent with custody receiving the child support payments use those payments for child specific costs (excluding mortgage and rent).   


Assume the system used to hold child support payments accountable is already determined, finalized and enforced.   


That's pretty much my position. Sorry for the confusion earlier.

--------------------------------

MelisandreStokes @ 2019-08-02 18:32:43 :

So why isn’t it that way now? Do you know?

--------------------------------

bananarama1991 @ 2019-08-02 18:36:49 :

Probably a mix of the logistical challenges of applying an accountability system and people reluctant to stop exploiting the current child support payment system, but nah I'm not exactly sure.   


Can you enlighten me?

--------------------------------

MelisandreStokes @ 2019-08-02 18:39:26 :

So you agree the logistics of an accountability system are a problem?

Also, you still are making finances the main factor, is that a mistake or have you now decided that they should be the main factor?

--------------------------------

bananarama1991 @ 2019-08-02 18:47:09 :

&gt;So you agree the logistics of an accountability system are a problem? 

They certainly could be, but it's not up to me to find holes in the system. If we can figure out how to put a Rover that looks like a toaster on Mars, we should be able to figure out a fair system for Child Support.   


&gt;Also, you still are making finances the main factor, is that a mistake or have you now decided that they should be the main factor? 

Man, I still don't think I explicitly said finances are the main factor.  If I did, please reference the explicit statement.

&gt;Man, I still don't think I explicitly said finances are the main factor. If I did, please reference the explicit statement.

Is that the source of all this confusion? You don’t think you’re responsible for thinking about the implications of your statements?

If not having enough money to pay for a roof is disqualifying, then finances *are* the main concern. Not the welfare of the child.

You're not wrong.   


Taylor Swift's story is the most egregious though, IMO.

What is her story? Im old so know nothing about her.

--------------------------------

DustinLyle @ 2019-08-10 04:10:00 :

To keep it short and sweet... 

Her dad (who started as a stock broker) was an executive level banker with JP Morgan when he transferred himself to Nashville to also launch his daughter's career...

They shopped her to all the labels around town, and it wasn't working out..

So daddy reached out to one of JP Morgan's wealth clients, Toby Keith, who was wanting to start his own label (Big Machine). 

Daddy bought into Big Machine, essentially financing it's start-up costs in it's entirety, on the condition that Taylor be signed immediately. 

It gets really grimy when you look more into it, but this is the TLDR.

--------------------------------

malvoliosf @ 2019-08-10 04:26:17 :

&gt; It gets really grimy when you look more into it, but this is the TLDR.

How is this grimy?  Keith and Scott Swift believed, **correctly**, that Taylor would be a money-making act.  They bet their own money on it and they were rewarded for being right.  How is this different than any other business?

its crazy that people are mad about this and not fa worse things businesses do. like taylor swifts music is alright lol i guess its unfair shes so famous or something... meanwhile JP Morgan has been involved in scandals that have cost billions of dollars, ruined lives, killed people, etc... but I'm supposed to be mad her dad who works at JP Morgan paid some of his blood money to Toby Keith to put his daughter on the radio lol

I agree with the majority of this thread that we don't owe anything to our parents. Am I grateful? Yes. Do I do chores? Yes. My parents both work long hours so I babysit and keep our house clean. I do it because I want to, not out of obligation.

And from my take, nobody is ""crying"" about having to do chores. Most kids don't mind it. I certainly don't. My parents like coming home to a clean house after being out for 12 hours.

But by not feeling an obligation or to not think I owe my parents something, is that being spoiled?

My parents chose to have me.  And that my friend is the reality of adult life. Choices. You don't have to have kids. You made the argument about how much kids cost, the intensive pain a mother has to go through, etc. But you know that going in.

If you have kids, and you feel as if they owe you something. You didn't have them for the right reasons.

Maybe unpopular opinion here but your parents *are* the ones paying/payed for the house... It only seems natural that kids should have a lot of chores to contribute to maintenance. I'd rather be doing chores than being homeless.

On the disappointment side of things, yea if she says that stuff to you idk what to say. Sucks. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, but parents nowadays just want academic strengths.

Edit: Seems like it was an unpopular opinion after all. Guys, it's chores. They're not asking you to pay rent or work part time while you're a kid. It's dish washing and vacuuming for maybe 30 mins max a day. Pick yourselves up.

Bronium2 @ 2019-09-24 12:51:02 :

I mean, kids are not adults though. Its not like we expect them to actually contribute ""their keep"", to make up not paying rent. Imo, a child should be in charge of their own mess, not more, not less.

_STRONK @ 2019-09-24 12:59:36 :

I'm gonna disagree on that. Your parents worked hella hard to raise you and provide for you. It really only seems natural that you pay that forward in the limited ways you can. Life is hard as a parent, children should do their best to make that a little easier. The reason you see kids grumbling about chores is simply lack of maturity. When you're off on your own you appreciate everything your parents did for you a lot more.

--------------------------------

Kazuma-San @ 2019-09-24 13:30:44 :

Dude the kids lack  maturity because their are kids, their job is to enjoy while their kids, grown, learn, yeah you can ask them to do chores is only natural parents need some help and it teaches the kid responsability, but expect them to do a lot of chores, it's very unfair their job is to slowly become an adult, and enjoy childhood while they can, their aren't you roommate, that if doesn't do chores it gets kick away. 

when you have a child you know that will he is a kid, even a teenager it would be hard on you, you need  to look after him, you brought him to this world where ""life is hard"" on a whim, perhaps even by accident, the kids and teenager literally need more free time, it's simply that they are growing, it's not fair to cut part of that childhood, just because you think ""he/she should do a lot more in house, he/she own me""  they need to do less because their arent adult their are growing, and doesn't need the stress of running a house, they can manage a lot of stuff together.

I repeat its OK for you to ask them to do chores it helps in their way to adulthood, but never forget that actually while he is a kid, their are your responsibility, not his, and if you go hand over him a lot, you will make him mature a lot more faster and that not necessarily something good.

This was by far the worst analogy to slavery. Working in a Mc Donalds is nowhere near-slavery. Are you suffering physical harm? No. This is why you have a union. Are you being forced to work there against your will? Do they not pay you to work there? No. You made a choice to work at that McD's.

And age doesn't define wisdom or knowledge.  The fact that adults ""put kids/teens in their place"" is absolutely disgusting to me, and the fact we have to wait until we're adults to be taken seriously is appalling. We shouldn't have to have wrinkles to have an opinion.

Okey, so if gender studies and social studies have no basis in reality you would have to ignore the fact that social and psychological gender exists. The fact that these things exist, and that there is a word for the study of those things is a self-explanatory destruction of your entire argument.

Are you sure this is the claim you want to make?

There is nothing that indicates psychiatric disorders if you dont follow socially constructed gender roles you absolute idiot, lol. 

Do you shave your beard? Uh oh, men are genetically predisposed towards having beards so if you shave you have to be mentally ill then. 
You would also be mentally ill if you wore clothes, we are not biologically geared towards wearing clothes. Guess you just have to live in a part of the world where you comfortably can run around naked all year around. 

Do you realize how fucking stupid you sound when you disregard everything except biology?

--------------------------------

tschekitschan @ 2019-11-11 14:07:59 :

There certainly are gender roles that don't have much to do with biological gender. You should know pretty clearly what your gender is though of your a healthy being.

Strypsex @ 2019-11-11 21:07:36 :

Your original statement was that psychological gender didn't exist ""only psychiatric disorders"". So you concede and admit you were talking out of your ass then?   
But i guess you fully support trans youth and non-binary people then? Since you're now saying that ""we"" (as in you) don't have a problem as long as everyone knows what their gender is.

--------------------------------

tschekitschan @ 2019-11-12 12:52:18 :

I also don't have a problem when everyone doesn't know what there gender is. If they think they are a potato, I couldn't care less. I fully support trans people, I don't have anything against them and feel lots of sympathy for them. I also believe that they have a psychiatric disorder, their brains are different from normal people so it could be an organic thing. I don't think it's a psychological issue but that's debatable. 

I don't think gender roles have anything to do with trans people if there were no gender roles they would still Be trans.

--------------------------------

Strypsex @ 2019-11-12 14:08:52 :

Do you know of a lot of people who identify themselves as a potato? Do you think they are representative of people who doesn't identify with their biological sex? You're just repeating the one joke the right has, the one about attack helicopters you know?

According to the ICD-11 transgenderism is no longer a mental disorder. You can very well be transgender and not have any psychiatric disorders. 
50 years ago people thought homosexuality was a mental disorder as well. Do you still subscribe to that idea? 

Sure, if we look at peer-reviewed studies on the subject its true that transgender peoples brains differentiate from those who identify with their biological sex. But it also shows that their brains are structurally similar to their desired gender. 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030645301500030X
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17352-8

I agree with you about gender roles though, but its kind of hard to back that up seeing as gender roles exist and there is no society on earth that doesn't have gender roles. However gender roles differ from society to society and even in places where the gender roles are different from our western values, transgender people exist. See the Hijra in India and Kathoey in Thailand for instance. If you want an even more extreme, very biologically anchored example see the Guevedoces of the Dominican Republic. 

Just like homosexuality, transgenderism is a biologically naturally occuring phenomenon and it in no way indicates mental illness. 
Also this whole discussion is proof of why gender studies is a valid study that has basis in reality. 

Btw its nice to see you backpedal and do a 180 from your first statement. Maybe you can let facts carry more weight than you feelings after all?

--------------------------------

tschekitschan @ 2019-11-12 16:40:59 :

Lol, you're even getting political. Politics have nothing to do with the topic besides ICD chosing what is a disorder and what not based on feelings, it's pathetic, had nothing to do with science. People should face the reality, somebody who needs surgeries for 300k surely isn't healthy. Having a brain that doesn't fit to your body isn't healthy.

How do people like you actually come to these ridiculous conclusions? BuzzFeed or something?

--------------------------------

Strypsex @ 2019-11-12 16:57:50 :

You just made the case that the reclassifcation of gender dysphoria not being a mental illness was political and desperately cling to opinions from the 1950's regarding the classification of homosexuality. 

You're also trying to go against the facts that are established in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, an international standard diagnostic tool.
So i mean, who's letting their political beliefs cloud the facts here? Really?

But yeah i seem to be forgetting that science as a whole is a far left conspiracy according to you guys, just look at the scientific consensus regarding climate change.

Stop self-critting and log off.

""The diagnostic label gender identity disorder (GID) was used by the DSM until it was renamed gender dysphoria in 2013 with the release of the DSM-5. The diagnosis was renamed to remove the stigma associated with the term disorder."" Wikipedia

It seems like you don't really understand what I'm telling you here. I'm not right wing politically, quite far from it, don't know why you even think so. You seem to be actually influenced by radical left media to make statements and assumption like you do.

I'm talking about science not feelings.

--------------------------------

Strypsex @ 2019-11-12 17:14:50 :

Yes, do you know that humanity makes advances when it comes to understanding things? That is why the ICD and DSM are updated regularly. Just like how homosexuality isn't seen as a mental disorder, neither is gender dysphoria anymore.   


I know it might seem political to you since you're mentally cucked and worried about your taxes being used in a progressive manner. Facts don't care about your feelings buddy.

--------------------------------

tschekitschan @ 2019-11-12 17:27:38 :

That reply makes no sense if you actually read what I quoted from Wikipedia.

--------------------------------

Strypsex @ 2019-11-12 19:37:50 :

Nice, wikipedia quotes.   


""The conceptualisation of transgender identity as a mental disorder has contributed to precarious legal status, human rights violations, and barriers to appropriate health care among transgender people. The proposed reconceptualisation of categories related to transgender identity in WHO's forthcoming International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 removes categories related to transgender identity from the classification of mental disorders, in part based on the idea that ***these conditions do not satisfy the definitional requirements of mental disorders****.* We aimed to determine whether distress and impairment, considered essential characteristics of mental disorders, could be explained by experiences of social rejection and violence rather than being inherent features of transgender identity, and to examine the applicability of other elements of the proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines.   
\[...\]  
Multivariate logistic regression models indicated that distress and all types of dysfunction were strongly predicted by experiences of social rejection (odds ratios \[ORs\] 2·29-8·15) and violence (1·99-3·99).    


[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27474250](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27474250)  


So one of the strongest indicators for mental illness among transgender individuals is social issues such as violence, discrimination and rejection **AND** the fact that gender dysphoria doesn't fit the definitional requirements of mental disorders. 

Tell me, what is your argument for keeping the classification of gender dysphoria as a mental illness?   
Just to clarify ""iTs nOt NoRmAL"" is not an argument."	"Strypsex @ 2019-11-12 23:49:02 :

--------------------------------

DerekClives @ 2019-12-06 15:58:47 :

Please point out the an phrase ""completely organically"" in the OP.  An sperm whale’s an “click” is not even an close to the an loudest sound produced by any an animal.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2019-12-06 17:44:59 :

You're being pedantic.  Sure.  Humans are able to use tools to make very loud noises.  But that's obviously not what the post title or the article in question are referencing, and you know that.  It's clear that this is referencing noises made naturally by animals.  In that regard, sperm whales win out, taking into account sounds that we have actually measured, that we can actually hear.

""Loudness"" is subjective, and depends on how you measure the sound, the medium it travels through, and how close you are to the source.  Many animals issue calls that are very loud, in terms of decibels, but whose frequencies place them outside the range of human hearing.  Despite their high ""volume,"" they're completely inaudible to us.

Based on decibels alone, the sperm whale comes in somewhere around 230dB, which is the highest recorded volume of any animal on Earth.  It is possible that some other animals (specific species of cicadas being a notable example) may be louder, but their sounds have not been measured reliably.

This article may clarify a bit:  [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160331-the-worlds-loudest-animal-might-surprise-you](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160331-the-worlds-loudest-animal-might-surprise-you)

--------------------------------

DerekClives @ 2019-12-06 17:53:35 :

&gt; Sure. Humans are able to use tools to make very loud noises.

Thank you, you make my point.

&gt;Many animals issue calls that are very loud, in terms of decibels, but whose frequencies place them outside the range of human hearing. Despite their high ""volume,"" they're completely inaudible to us.

And none of them are capable of producing sounds within an order of magnitude as loud as humans. When you prattle on about loudness being subjective you are talking about apparent loudness, not loudness, they are two different things, the OP made no mention of apparent loudness.

A sperm whale’s “click” is not the loudest sound produced by any animal, it isn't even close.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2019-12-06 18:32:12 :

If I take a hammer and smash it against a bell, where does the sound come from?  If I fire a gun, where does the sound come from?  If I detonate a bomb, where does the sound come from?  If I fire up a jet engine, where does the sound come from?

In each of these cases, I may have been the one who set in motion the chain of events, but in none of these cases am I, the animal in question, producing the sound.

Ergo, humans cannot produce sounds as loud as those made by a sperm whale.

I'm sorry you don't like being wrong -- no one does.  But in this case you quiet clearly are wrong, and you sticking to this point isn't a good look.

--------------------------------

spuhb90 @ 2019-12-06 18:55:41 :

You're completely wrong. The loudest sound a human can produce is the sound of a wooden stick hitting DerekClives' cranium. The completely hollow, almost vacuum-like, space inside has the perfect acoustic properties to create the loudest sound known to be produced by ANY living organism. This is *particularly* louder than hitting a water jet with an x-ray laser which you CLEARLY have never heard before because you're not as cool as DerekClives. He even goes to rock concerts. Very cool.

It most certainly is not used for both, nor does it work that way for a lot of English. Neither the definition for misogyny or the definition for misandry have changed

trolloc1 @ 2019-12-30 21:21:47 :

It is very commonly used that way and sure but as I've stated a lot of words are used incorrectly but just because they're so popular they become the norm. biggest example: guys

--------------------------------

careofKnives @ 2019-12-30 21:30:48 :

Misandry is a very popular well established word. This is nothing like the slang of simply referring to girls as guys. This is an attack on language that will never succeed and is easily called out, as I just have.

overshadowed: yes. Forgotten: no

I guarantee you OP did not think misogyny means both misogyny and misandry. I’ve never once seen anyone use misogyny in place of misandry. It never happens, and if it does it’s an extreme anomaly. Because it’s not an overshadowed word. You know how a lot of public men’s rooms became all gender bathrooms while women’s rooms were unaffected? The word misandry will never be the equivalent of all gender bathrooms, thank god.

trolloc1 @ 2019-12-30 22:10:51 :

You're still managing to miss the point. People know that a group of girls is not guys but still will be like ""hey guys"" or ""let's go guys"". Is girls not still a common word? Yes, but not the point.

I don't get the second part. Just some weird turn into right wing bullshit.

careofKnives @ 2019-12-30 22:13:28 :

You’re saying the word misogyny also means misandry now and is overshadowing the word, that’s left wing bullshit. They would LOVE for the word misandry to just disappear. When i start to type in misandry in my iPhone it autocorrects, and not because I told it to, tyvm. Popularity of the word misogyny in no way detracts from the popularity of the word misandry. I don’t get why you originally replied to me with that lie to begin with anyway.

I see where you are coming from but I truly believe that even in the first few weeks of pregnancy a child is alive. I think this way because the child in the first weeks the child starts developing blood and blood with separate DNA then the parent. Also the child is able to think after the first few weeks as it grows a brain after just 6 weeks. For your argument about the family not being able to care for it, there are better options that dont involve murder such as adoption.

Just like women our peers constantly reinforce this by talking crap about anyone not aligning to that physical ideal. Just like women, all of our media, our magazines, our movies.... all have that ideal. And just like with women, there is tremendous pressure and judgment from the opposite gender to fit that ideal.

What do we do about it? For one thing, we stop arguing about who has it worse or trying the deny anyone else is negatively affected by this element of society. For another, we stop indulging the efforts of those with genuinely physically unhealthy lifestyles to coopt a societal solution to shield them from the consequences of their choices... No the doctor is not ""shaming"" anyone when they tell them ""You need to change your lifestyle NOW or you are going to die.""

A solution would be an societal level effort to return our ideals to achievable and HEALTHY states. We should have something to look up to and strive for. It should involve being physically healthy.

Height, weight etc. It also seems to be accepted by society a lot more than when men start demanding women to look and act a certain way.  Another irritating thing, is that women tend to stick to the same topics, it’s like they’re so brainwashed with their priorities, the narrative that your worth is based on your appearance seems to be growing with the age of Instagram, which tends to be dominated by half naked women constantly seeking validation by how many likes they get.

* eating disorders to be skinny
* avoiding sex you want to not be called a ""slut""
* not asking for a raise or a promotion to not be called ""bitchy"", ""bossy""
* avoiding high paying ""dirty"" jobs

No, I'm saying that women and low-empathy men tend to underestimate what men go through because they're trained out of having sympathy for men. 

&gt;Most of arguments here have been ""women find muscular men more attractive"". And that's true. But that's pretty much the end of it for men.

Nope. Not white enough, not tan enough, receding hairline, height, penis size, circumcision... are you even a man? Where the fuck do you live that you don't see women being as judgmental and shitty as men?

&gt;How attractive a woman is can have major impacts on their career opportunities.

Actually, how attractive a man is has *more* impact on his career opportunities, which surprised the fuck out of me when I learned it. The reason for this seems to be that women make most hiring decisions, and that the very tippy-top of female attractiveness actually has problems outside of specific industries (modeling, acting, etc) because women view them as competition and men don't take them as seriously. 

&gt;You can close your eyes are ignore the truth if you want but it's still out there. And name calling won't change the facts

No, name-calling won't change the facts, which is why I'm cool doing it. It doesn't undermine the fact that I'm right.

To contract AIDS you needed to fuck Magic Johnson without a condom. You don’t get it by playing basketball.

WinstonsVictoryGin @ 2020-05-25 17:44:08 :

Better safe than getting AIDS though, which is something we can all agree on. We should severely discriminate against those with fatal diseases that we have a minimum understanding of. Better to be safe and discriminate, then to be inclusive regarding something we don’t understand.

--------------------------------

CryptoNoob-BRLN @ 2020-05-25 17:51:03 :

Oh you are such an uninformed idiot I am not even going to try and change your mind. If you ask me we should discriminate against backwards idiots from the mountains like you who keep the mankind stuck to second gear. Even if you don’t believe you are a true idiot please check your own comment; the last 2 parts are the same with similar words.

--------------------------------

WinstonsVictoryGin @ 2020-05-25 17:56:56 :

Dude and you’re ignorant is fuck if you think they should’ve had a more inclusive approach in regards to aids, man. We didn’t know then what we know now. Exclusion is paramount when it comes to the other 400 NBA players safety. You can’t fuck with fatal diseases without a good understanding of them. That would be ignorant as fuck and reckless, especially considering the public fear of aids at that time.

One less common form of transmission as well can happen during a basketball game:

Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.

Can you please shut your mouth? Is Magic Johnson dead? These guys were OBVIOUSLY on the wrong side of history. Be their guest.

You don’t know how medicine works if your interpretation is that they’re on the wrong side of history. Medical professionals know they did the right thing. Some teenager in Portland is just triggered and thinks an injustice took place when it didn’t.

CryptoNoob-BRLN @ 2020-05-25 19:05:17 :

Yada yada yada. For your information fucking Princess Diana was close to AIDS patients (a bit later after Freddie Mercury’s) showing that it’s not something you can get from sweat or contact, almost a decade before Magic Johnson. What they did was not science, it was the lack of science, it was ignorance and bigotry some words you are very familiar with."	"CryptoNoob-BRLN @ 2020-05-25 19:26:20 :

I stop commenting only because you are a bigot idiot, you are boring as fuck and you waste my time. We were well informed about the disease by the point Magic Johnson tested positive. Keep your 20th century views for you and the ones you love.

It takes money to continue production. Not every company can work on a game indefinitely for the chance at a game that might sell better. Sometimes you just don't have the budget to continue on.

--------------------------------

DouggieMohamJones @ 2020-05-27 16:44:17 :

The problem is that the heads of companies and production are the ones dictating the budget and the ones profiting enormously off of other people’s hard work. They have more than enough money to make sure games are well made and people aren’t overworked in the process, but they’d rather buy a 2nd yacht.

OP was talking very clearly about AAA publishers and developers, so adding the caveat of “not every” one is fucking worthless. At least tell me why I’m wrong instead of lazily brushing what I said under the rug.

Amablue @ 2020-05-27 16:54:14 :

You're right, the ""not every"" is worthless. I should have said ""No company can work on a game indefinitely...""

Money is finite. Returns are not guaranteed. Continued investment in a game that's not going developing well is usually not a good use of money."	"Amablue @ 2020-05-27 17:13:54 :

&gt; Nobody is asking companies to work on games “indefinitely”. 

He's asking them to work on the game for an unspecified amount of time with and pour an unspecified amount of extra money into it. That's indefinite. How much money time and money do you pour into a project before you decide it's not working out or improving the way you hoped it would, and just release it as is to recoup your money?

&gt; They should be good at scheduling and not advertising a game sooner than they can finish it.

Games are never finished. There is always more you can do to tweak a game. The realities of how production timelines go require that you forecast ahead of launch when you're going to be ready to launch, because lining up all the things the happen prior to a games launch need to be set up ahead of time.

Both ends of the equation need to work together to make reasonable time estimates that allow for slippage. The development team needs to have realistic expectations about what can be completed in the time allotted, and communicate that with others within the company. If they cannot meet timelines and milestones they agreed to it's hard to argue giving them more time and money is a good idea. If they think additional time and money will be worth it, they need to demonstrate that they are competent enough to use that money effectively to make the game worth it.

&gt;  A large part of the reason crunch exists in the first place is so that filthy rich shitheads can continue to line their pockets at the expense of other people.

No, it's because people are willing to crunch. They should stop be willing to crunch.

&gt;  It’s been a recent development to hold these people more accountable, but every point you’re making here is short-sighted because you’re not acknowledging A) who controls scheduling, B) who profits the most, and C) how rushed products lead to backlash and resentment which only hurts companies in the end.

csgymgirl @ 2020-05-30 00:27:25 :

heterophobia is NOT a thing. it’s never been illegal for you to be straight, you’ve never had to protest for your right to be straight, you’ve never had heterophobic slurs used against you. it’s like you want to be a victim.

--------------------------------

Anonymmmous @ 2020-05-30 00:45:46 :

Do you know what homophobia means? It means “having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people.” All those other things are an offset of it and have tie ins with religion. Heterophobia is a thing and I answered your question below this one, the explanation is long and hard. 

By the same token, do you justify racism against white peoples because of their mistreatment to people of color?

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-05-30 01:51:23 :

Homophobia: being denied civil rights, killed, jailed, castration.

Heterophobia: eww straight people have no fashion sense *cries*

Being straight must be so hard, if that counts as phobia lol.

You’re proving my point. That’s all I need to say.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-05-30 01:54:17 :

Homophobia is not simply a personal feeling of dislike. 

Dislike by itself is not homophobia. 

It’s a collective experience of discrimination and systemic oppression.

Be teachable dear. I didn’t say dislike is not homophobia, but that by itself it’s not. dislike is only a small part of homophobia, it’s the prerequisite. To understand this, think of homophobia of not just emotion, it’s a whole process. 

If that counts as homophobia them dharun ravi should be in jail now for hate crime. But he’s not. 

Homophobia is an established academic term that encapsulates systemic and institutionalised oppression. 

Yes as a layman who uses google you can use it to capture emotion but you’re not doing justice to it. 

So yes you can  call heterophobia, but it will only mean dislike - that’s all it will ever mean. Heterophobia in the sense of systemic and institutionalised oppression of the heterosexual population that denies them human and civil rights - is and will never be  a thing.

--------------------------------

Anonymmmous @ 2020-05-30 02:34:29 :

No, those are offsets of it. If I call someone homophobic then all those terms don’t exactly come off it if you get what I mean. A homophobic person doesn’t like gay people. It’s very simple. It’s a word definition and media shouldn’t be emotional. That’s persuasion not teaching, no matter the topic, good or bad. Heterophobia means people who dislike straight people. Homophobia means people who dislike gay people. It’s very simple. You think that it should be changed to include your point and bias against heterophobia, yes? That’s not how it works.

You’re literally proving my point again and depicting being straight as almost a bad thing.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-05-30 02:45:08 :

If you insist you can go this way then but then you’re just watering down the word. People can be biased or prejudiced against straight people it’s just that it will never be systemic nor institutionalised. 

Secondly i have never said that being straight is bad, you’re projecting and i’m taking this accusation seriously.

--------------------------------

Anonymmmous @ 2020-05-30 03:09:26 :

No but you do imply that straights have not suffered the same as gays, which have suffered much worse, which is true, but leads to the implication that being straight is inferior.

Saying that straights don’t suffer for being straight or as much as the gays, is no measure of superiority or inferiority, nor have i ever implied that.

Finch343 @ 2020-07-14 10:10:15 :

Doesn't it make sense to lower all potential risks? The mask are also to lower the risk of infecting others. And sending people away that have no reason to be in the US also lowers the risk of them spreading the disease in the US.

Finch343 @ 2020-07-14 10:12:52 :

Because then you would need to know who has it, which requires regular testing, since you can't just test the people that are obviously sick, since there are asymptomatic cases.

But if all we care about is lowering risk, then why don't we get rid of any risk possibility whatsoever?

And if we set a rule that we dont deport citizens, what if the data shows that the average international student is less likely to have the virus than the average citizen, what sense does it make to deport international students then

the_alive_ghost @ 2020-07-14 10:42:43 :

Because we have immigration laws. And citizens come before illegal immigrants. That's the way it works.

So therefore, citizens are more important than risk-reduction.

No, I'm arguing with logic, if kicking out international students provides next to zero benefit in our covid results, what logic is there in kicking them out? It sounds like you don't actually care about minimizing risk, and you just want to kick out immigrants.

And also, how do you determine what is necessary and unnecessary? What about the economic benefit that immigrant students provide? What if their economic contribution to our country exceeds the risk that they pose?

To that end, it might be helpful to note that each vegan saves roughly 400 animals per year, reduces more greenhouse emissions than non-vegans and uses a fraction of the fresh water resources. 

Moreover, each vegan chooses not to participate in the market for animal suffering, which makes that market just a little bit smaller and the lives of animals just a little bit better.

You ignored my question though, why not go vegan when it’s objectively better than a diet that includes meat?

That’s one less car driving around and that’s a few thousand less animals being killed to sustain his or her diet.

Racists are racists regardless of whether they say anything or not, whatcha freedom of speech does give you is the right to criticize the government, the lack of which is one of the first steps to tyranny. Also, the second amendment means you can protect your right to life in the event of a home-intruder and walk safely at night in sketchy areas, as well as prevent the aforementioned government tyranny. You also have school shooters in countries without the right to bear arms, the difference is that those shootings tend to be much more deadly since fewer people have the means to stop the perpetrator."

I dont know about the other two. I guess its different games you would care about. I'm also a hard-core gamer but I play Warframe, RDR2, R6, Warzone, Rogue Company, Fall Guys, and a bunch more but I would only care about a couple if they got taken away.

Lord-Fishquaad @ 2020-09-19 02:29:13 :

Thats not how it works. Cis people can get dysphoria too if forced to dress as the opposite gender if they dont want to. Its not about appeasing the dysphoria its about making you happy. Also, youre saying if you woke up tomorrow as the opposite sex but with the same brain you'd identify as that?

--------------------------------

Da_Zman10 @ 2020-09-19 02:35:52 :

Trans people become happy by appeasing dysphoria. Not sure what you're talking about.

&gt;Also, youre saying if you woke up tomorrow as the opposite sex but with the same brain you'd identify as that?

Identity as what? I legit don't understand the question.

--------------------------------

Lord-Fishquaad @ 2020-09-19 02:37:13 :

Assuming youre male and you woke up in a female body with the same mind, youd start identifying as a woman? And if appeasing the dysphoria is what makes them happy who cares? Since when has happiness been a bad thing?

Edit: hold up, i just checked your post history, and saw that youre trans, yet youre transphobic? Or did you realize you arent trans?

&gt;Assuming youre male and you woke up in a female body with the same mind, youd start identifying as a woman?

Oh, I understand now. Thank you for clarifying! As for the question, I guess I'd have to start identifying as a woman if that happened.

&gt;And if appeasing the dysphoria is what makes them happy who cares? Since when has happiness been a bad thing?

Happiness can be a bad thing if murder makes someone happy. Other than that, I'm very lost about what we're talking about.

--------------------------------

Lord-Fishquaad @ 2020-09-19 02:44:56 :

Well yea but being trans harms nobody and it makes them happy to use whatever pronouns and name they want so why do you care? They arent pretending, dysphoria is just an emotion that cis people are also capable of getting. Are cis people pretending to be cis?

Da_Zman10 @ 2020-09-19 02:49:19 :

I feel like you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you thought I said ""trans people are pretending to be trans"". However, what I meant to say is ""trans people are pretending to be their preferred gender"". On that note though, I do believe that there are some people who pretend to be trans for internet clout. Screw those guys in particular.

Lord-Fishquaad @ 2020-09-19 02:50:26 :

Theyre just doing what makes them happy they arent dealing with anything except their own body that they dont want. They arent identifying as male or female to appease the dysphoria theyre doing it because they want to and its what makes them happiest. You dont even always have to have dysphoria to be trans, but you usually do.

&gt;Dysphoria is a negative feeling when dressing as the gender you dont identify as

Wouldn't wanting to dress as the other gender mean you have a negative feeling from presenting as your biological gender?

&gt;euphoria is a positive feeling which is when you present or dress as whatever gender you identify as.

That's literally just the absence of gender dysphoria.

&gt;If you dont even know the definition of dysphoria then stop arguing about trans topics

I'm trans myself. So, I can talk about trans topics all I want.

--------------------------------

Lord-Fishquaad @ 2020-09-19 03:14:29 :

You arent female youre just pretending because thats what the dysphoria wants

How does that make sense?

You can like one thing more than another thing without disliking the other thing

And does that mean happiness is just the absence of sadness? No. Its its own emotion.

Da_Zman10 @ 2020-09-19 03:25:04 :

Because dysphoria is a medical condition, and transitioning is just a means of dealing with it. Like autism.

&gt;You can like one thing more than another thing without disliking the other thing

Yes, but wanting to be the one gender more than the other is still dysphoria.

&gt;And does that mean happiness is just the absence of sadness? No. Its its own emotion.

Didn't some psychologist say the opposite though? Something about how happiness and sadness can't exist without each other, and how happiness is the absence of sadness and vice versa. I remember something like that anyway. I might be wrong though."

It isn’t too old by any means. If you can have a healthy sleep schedule I’d hope you do what you can to maintain it. speaking from experience, a screwed up sleep schedule plus other external factors seems like it amplifies what those other things may be. whether that be stress, major depression, addiction, or just not wanting to live, sleep loss amplifies it nine times out of ten. have the mercy on yourself I was stripped of and hold on to it for dear life, because it can vanish in the blink of an eye

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-12-26 07:10:36 :

let me simply it for you. if you ignore what your parents say about getting good sleep, it’ll have a strong mental toll on you later if you’re already suffering from anxiety, depression or other mental illness since it amplifies it.

--------------------------------

Omg_itz_Chaseee @ 2020-12-26 07:16:28 :

let me *put it* simply for you, i’ve created all of my artwork, started a merchandise website and done all of my schoolwork past 1:00 AM. speaking of schoolwork, in the university i’m in, i’m on the Dean’s list, which means i have high honors because my scores are very good. i’m incredibly good at stress management, with no sign of mental instability, fatigue, or anything along those lines. i’ve been doing this every weekend and summer vacation since i was 14, and have been doing it continuously since march when quarantine started. i’m happier and more alert than i’ve ever been, because i learn and develop all of my skills when my brain is most active, which is, of course, late at night.

would you like to revise your comment?

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-12-26 07:24:22 :

I said what I said because people don’t realize how important sleep is and how it affects other factors in life, and mental health was mentioned because I don’t know anything about your situation without you saying anything about it. As for the typo, I did say I’m speaking from experience didn’t I? As someone with your intelligence you should be able to put one and one together. 

Stop asking for advice just so you can wait for that one person who’s in a rough situation to help, just so you can flex stuff not many people care about and bring up a typo they missed because the combination of sleep deprivation, major depression, addiction and stress all make the others worse until it gets to the point one little fuckup gets my mind thinking about harming myself because I fuck up every little thing I do.

edited because, like I said, I manage to fuck up everything I do and made another typo. may as well fuck up my liver

--------------------------------

Omg_itz_Chaseee @ 2020-12-26 07:40:23 :

the only reason i “flexed” was because you started talking down to me, and your main topic was that your mental health can get all wonky from a bad sleep schedule. not for me, so are there any other reasons? because if not, it just sounds like you’re unloading your own troubles.

[deleted] @ 2020-12-26 07:46:41 :

If you thought I was trying to weigh you down with my shit I’m just giving you a taste of what life can be like. Since you say you’re not affected by sleep deprivation why don’t you just go ahead and ignore everything I said since you don’t like it when people try to give you a dose of reality and ignore what your parents say about sleep since you really seem to not care. If anything people would think you’re trying to bring down someone who’s already mentally unstable by telling them all about how you get good grades and how you’re not stressed. congrats on being lucky enough to have caring parents and a mind that’s not telling you to end your own life every hour of every day, you’re real special bud. go take another test

woah didn’t know someone could get so upset over this post. “little dose of reality” bro calm down, you’re acting like someone’s dad. you’re 14 wait until you have 10x the shit to worry about lmao. if you didn’t want to hear a counterpoint, or if you were too sensitive to hear any sort of rebuttal, you shouldn’t have commented in the first place. you broke down after i said anything positive about myself despite when all i was doing was stating why the mental aspect didn’t apply to me when you started talking down to me, and now you’re raging. please calm down, that reaction to my comment isn’t normal.

it’s small stuff that builds up over time, like the shit that happened that got me to the point of attempting suicide. Since I manage to fuck everything up and piss people off with everything I do I may as well just stop replying at this point. but since that doesn’t only happen online I may as well go for round two. I’m just tired of living, metaphorically and literally, it’s too draining to get out of bed and when I do I fuck up everything. I’ll just end it all so I don’t fuck up more people’s days, weeks, months, or lives like I did with my now divorced parents. I know you don’t care, or even want me to do it, and I don’t blame you. everyone I meet wants me to, may as well make people happy for once

Omg_itz_Chaseee @ 2020-12-26 08:11:38 :

bro, please just calm down and think rationally. are you really gonna let a bedtime post on reddit be what brings you down? you’re 14, at least get into your real life before deciding you hate it. i understand that you’re going through a lot, but it does get better. not magically, but with help and by talking, it does get better. i’d imagine that you don’t really talk about this much, but the only way for you to get better is to talk about it to people.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-12-26 08:20:43 :

You want me to “get into my life”? All I know is shot gets rough and if I attempted suicide at the age of 14 because I couldn’t handle it and things only get worse, where do you think I’ll end up? And don’t you fucking dare tell me this shit’s “just a phase” when I’ve had major depression for over four years. I can’t take this shit no more, but know this isn’t your fault. you’re just the one who tapped the nearly shattered window and it finally decided to shatter beyond what damage is already done. if you say you’re not affected by stress and all that why would you care about some random asshole’s life? exactly, you don’t. don’t act like you care either, I’m tired of people who put up poor acts of caring, admit it, move on, let me die, accept it isn’t your fault. don’t look back on this moment, it’s already too latr

Omg_itz_Chaseee @ 2020-12-26 08:25:07 :

you need help man, this clearly isn’t healthy, and you’re never going to get better by sitting around and waiting for it to happen.

by ending your life, you’re being selfish and taking the easy way out instead of working to better yourself by getting help. you cannot tell me you’ve been getting help, because anyone who is getting help and talking to someone would not be talking like this. please get help.

I’m never enough to please people, from personal experience things only get worse and I’ve made two attempts so far, third try’s a charm, right? choosing not to suffer isn’t being selfish, it’s being smart. I’ve been in therapy for years and taking strong ass antidepressants for a year longer. it obviously didn’t help because I’m talkin mg to you you now as a depressed alcoholic instead of sane. I can’t take this shit anynore, stop looking back at the past. it isn’t healthy

Omg_itz_Chaseee @ 2020-12-26 08:33:19 :

no, you’re being selfish because you may “escape your pain” but that creates hell for all of the people in your life, i’m sure you’ll say “oh they don’t care” but you’re delusional now, you’re thinking negatively. if you want to put everyone you care about, everyone in your life through absolute hell just because you want to quit early, you’re not in any mental state to make huge decisions like whether or not you want to die. please talk to people, you’re not alone. although, what’s also selfish is saying i’m one of the causes for you wanting to die.

and with that second sentence you confirmed my past points, almost everyone I meet hates me. if you met every single person I know you’d see first hand how none of them care. sure, they do try but it’s easy to tell when they lie. I’ve been doing it for so long I know the don’t of lying to someone’s face and they check every single one of those boxes. even online I can hear when they drop the act to get their head together, even for just a second. you can relax a bit as well now, my head hurts too much for me to tie a single knot, let alone a noose, as if I had anything to hang it on. I’m just sitting in front of a toilet away from the rope because I may as well have just drank rat poison because that shot didn’t get me very drunk and I’m think I’m doing to puke after 4 shots. for a reference I could go 10 and keep it all down

I push people away after I learn they act like they want to help but just waste my time, insult me and make me want to make a third attempt. I’ve been trying to get help but the only person who hasn’t been an ass to me is a therapist I was only able to talk to after things got bad enough for me to make attempt one, so unless you know someone who can and probably will help stop wasting my time by telling me to get the help I’m trying to get. call me selfish and tell me to grip up all you want, you’re just fueling the flame

Omg_itz_Chaseee @ 2020-12-26 09:02:25 :

then stop responding, shithead. if you were really planning on killing yourself you wouldn’t be so stuck up about people wasting your time. this is just a sad cry for help, look at yourself. is this really what you want to be doing?

[deleted] @ 2020-12-26 09:08:10 :

at least I’m looking for help and am resisting the urges to take my own life. how about you take a look at yourself, intentionally degrading someone in a crisis who’s just trying to get help from someone who’s capable, not someone who’s only talking to call me a selfish shithead. if you wanted me to stop responding you would be doing the same so I would have nothing to respond to, but you keep pushing the urges towards me. admit you want me to kill myself and I’ll stop.

Kalle_79 @ 2021-04-01 07:41:04 :

Do you understand how removing the laugh track completely screws the acting/delivery and gives an ""unfinished"" and wrong product?

It's like removing the backing guitar from a song and then go ""ohhh listen how weird it sounds! Such a crappy song!"".

Had Friends been a non-laugh track sitcom, it'd have been acted and edited in a different way. You might still hate it, but judging it by a silly edit job is kinda lame. Much more than the show itself.

Also, can you all let it go? It's a show that debuted 27 years ago, clearly its humour is a product of its times and many tropes and situations that NOW look cliché and dated, back then were fresh and even groundbreaking. Ditto for the whole ""sexism"" part. 

Just go watch whatever edgy and cool shows are hip nowadays... and wait for your kids to shit all over them because of silly reasons in 25 years, if cultural presentism will still be the bane it currently is.

--------------------------------

FBI_Agent_82 @ 2021-04-01 14:09:46 :

&gt;Also, can you all let it go?

You do realize Friends fans are basically TV show vegans. If you would've read my comment you would see I was talking about a friend that was obsessed with Friends who wouldn't take no for an answer. 

&gt;Do you understand how removing the laugh track completely screws the acting/delivery and gives an ""unfinished"" and wrong product?

Do you realize the laugh track was added post production? It has nothing to do with the actors comedic timing, if the joke is funny with the laugh track it should be funny without it. The laugh track is to tell the mindless fans something funny was just said and you should laugh about it. 

&gt;It's a show that debuted 27 years ago, clearly its humour is a product of its times

The Golden Girls began 9 years before Friends, 36 years ago, it had a laugh track but the jokes were actually funny, and the jokes/scenarios still stand up today.

Proof Friends Fans are the Vegans of TV show fans. This is an unpopular opinion, most people are on your side but you feel compelled to argue with people for not liking your favorite show. Maybe just let the people who don't like the show continue not liking the show? Come up with all the points you want for ~~why I should go vegan~~ why I should be nice to the show Friends. It was a garbage TV show with weird brainwashing power. Fucking hate the show but I'm still compelled to clap during that fucking song.

It STILL has a lot to do with the comedic timing if the actor is pausing to wait for the reaction, be it canned or live. Also it was definitely filmed ""before a live audience"". You can clearly see scenes where actors stall because the crowd is laughing, clapping etc.

And, plot twist, I never watched Friends when it was hot and even after having binge watched it recently, I still maintain  it's a pretty average show. It ranges from 5 to 8, but it's mostly just very acceptable ""background noise"" to have on while doing other stuff.

Still, denying it had its moments and a great impact on other sitcoms and on some social tropes would be disingenuous.

It's not about convincing you to go ""vegan"", but about accepting that you might be wrong about some aspects of that diet. You're still 100% entitled to despise it, but at least do it for some valid reasons and not just prejudice or ""mUh tAsTe!"""	"Kalle_79 @ 2021-04-01 16:00:00 :

The reasons you gave are ""without a laugh track it's awkward"" (which I explained to you why it's a shitty reason).

And ""my friends love it and don't shut up about it"". Which is annoying for sure but doesn't say much on the actual merit of the show.

Last, but not least, you're the one attacking me for disagreeing about an unpopular opinion, so maybe it's also you who is unfit to be online if you can't take a bit of debate without resorting to personal attacks.

We’re doomed either way. Most species only last about a million years, and humans will be no exception. We still have a few hundred thousand years but I don’t suspect we’ll be around in another million.

Most species also don’t build computers and journey into space and a million other things that make humans a unique case. That doesn’t mean we won’t go extinct, but to say “most species last 1 million years, therefore we will as well” ignores the major differences between us and all other known species. For another example, we’re aware of the possibility of our own extinction and discuss it with each other. And some of us are trying to prevent it. I don’t think the average lifespan of other species on Earth has the predictive power you think for humans."

I dont think there's any driving offense where you should lose driving privileges ""permanently""

Imagine being 17 and causing an accident. And then not being able to drive to work as a 34 year old parent.

That's ridiculous; even Felony DWI offenders get their driving privileges reinstated at some point.

PBR_Sheetz @ 2021-06-02 16:03:53 :

I am in auto insurance and our underwriters consider texting and driving to be worse than DUI.  ""Drunks are at least looking at the road!"" they say. 

But I agree, permanent revoking is steep.  I would agree with treating it like a DUI, temporary suspension, hefty fines, and legit counseling.

--------------------------------

Jake_FromStateFarm27 @ 2021-06-02 16:17:56 :

Why don't cellphone carriers make it so certain phones don't activate or you cannot activate the car if your cellphone is unlocked? We do that we DUI offenders, they have to have a breathalyzer installed in order to start the car. Or make it so your phone is locked in a position and other non essential apps are unlocked so for instance maps or emergency contacts can be called at least. If we can make people's breath either start or not start a car surely there is something we can do about phones and accessing certain apps when in the vehicle after an offense.


Edit 2: I need to be explicit about this because it's caused a dumpster fire in the thread and my dms... THIS COMMENT IS IN REGARDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BROKEN THE KAW AND BEEN CONVICTED OF AN AUTOMOBILE CRIME RELATED TO TEXTING WHILE DRIVING
NOT AND I REPEAT THIS DOES NOT ENCOMPASS OR AFFECT NORMAL DRIVERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED! The whole point of this idea is to punish those that ARE ARRESTED FOR TEXTING WHILE DRIVING.... NOT EVERYDAY PEOPLE 


Edit: you all being way too literal/serious and quick to critique obvious flaws that ik are present in my SUGGESTION. However suggesting and offering an idea at least is better than not contributing to a better future where there are less accidents and deaths that result from something as stupid as texting while driving. So stop trying to big brain me and flaunt your big dicks, think fo the children!

1. Get one phone that's used to start the car.
2. Get second phone that's registered as ""passanger"".

4. ""Profit""?

While a good idea in theory, it's just extremely difficult to implement properly.

--------------------------------

Jake_FromStateFarm27 @ 2021-06-02 16:38:22 :

So you have to develop ways of programing around it then? I mean cars are getting really smart, audi and hyundai have voice assistants that can automatically recognize what position in the car you are so it seems feasible to develop a program fit for criminals that text and drive. If you willfully assist someone break probation you are an accessory to a crime as well and can face equally serious charges, which is the point of implementing something rather than nothing. How many people do you think beat the engine breathalyzer with the same trick police don't want you to know.

--------------------------------

FaeryLynne @ 2021-06-02 17:27:12 :

The simple answer is, that right now there are just waaaaaaay too many obstacles. With the way technology is going, I won't be surprised if a feature like this is implemented sometime in the future, but right now it's pretty impossible.  Everyone is even telling you what those obstacles are right now but you're just not understanding it fully. It's going to take a few decades at least before we'd be able to implement something to fully prevent (almost) everyone from doing it.

--------------------------------

theevvitch @ 2021-06-02 20:04:11 :

So stick on cameras help your argument in which way? It just further proves there isn’t a way to “beat the system” I think you are arguing for people to not be distracted to drive, which we all agree, but there is no way to physically stop someone from using a phone while driving … they will get a cheap disposable phone to use. And a camera in the car means one person has to be watching you because a disposable phone won’t be attached to some “server” 

You’re young and you’ve grown up in a world where technology has solved all your problems - so far 

Stop arguing and accept you have a good idea but it’s not plausible to execute

Jake_FromStateFarm27 @ 2021-06-02 21:00:04 :

Cameras have nothing to do with texting while driving I was providing a foreign example of how car insurance claims are handled and dealt with efficiently in another country, I was not suggesting to put cameras in cars to thwart texting and driving. There are also plenty of alcoholics on probationary licenses that have used idiot friends or strangers to pass their breathalyzer tests in cars as well, I don't see your point. Ya technology can useful in some situations I never suggested a panacea for this social issue our society deals with I was suggesting it as a means for those already convicted of texting while driving NOT AVERAGE DRIVERS"

Pansexual is biphobic &lt;3 also, you're just describing being bisexual. Btw pansexual supports bestiality and pedophilia

I will tell you why too.

Well let's start, the modern definition of pansexual is the definition of bisexual from about 10-20 years ago. Ask any bisexual person from that time they will tell you the definition was something like attraction without the concern of gender. This is called bisexual erasure and the erasure of our history and struggles. It's ignoring our past and what our definition actually is. Next, the ""new"" definition of bisexual (which was forced upon us by pansexuals) is an attraction to 2 or more genders which is practically what the modern definition of pansexual is. Not to mention they stole many parts of bi culture such as our saying ""hearts before parts"". Now the history of pansexual, the history of pansexual is disgusting and all the varying definitions are too. Sigmund Freud came up with pansexual, the definition was ""attraction to all ages and species"". Gross right? (Personally I wouldn't want to be near anyone would supported a word that use to mean that.) Now one of the more modern definitons is ""attraction to everyone and trans people"" this definition is problematic because it makes trans people out to be a different gender, which we aren't a new gender category it's just a way to decribe our experience of gender dysphoria. The people who used this definition also say that bisexual, straight, and lesbian cannot include trans people and only pansexual can. Which again is not only transphobic but biphobic. It also implys that we aren't our actual gender. I could go on for days on the history and problematic shit about pansexual. It's not valid and not ok.

Ah now the transphobia! Now im not going to argue with you on this but there are male female, nonbinary, and bigender. Those are all valid and have a medical basis or theory behind. Anything else is a transphobic rhetoric used against actual trans people.

Oh my fucking god. It's not bi-phobia. It's a a post about a person calling you cute. And just because they mention that they are pansexual you go on an entire rant about how ""being pansexual is bi-phobic.""

I need you to grow a conscience and act your age. 

It's bad enough I've had to deal with multiple people you can't accept than the world is moving forward. Let alone have to defend OP because you can't accept the fact that people are pansexual without causing an argument. 

If I didn't bring it up somebody else would.

I commented on a post asking to trade.


His first words were immediate insults.

I asked him to explain why my build is useless.


He then explains that he uses a build using splendid armor and cursed axe/fighters bindings with radiance which is the best rn. 


I say he's a meta player, and I call him out because in my experience meta players are only good at meta and nothing else.


We then argue and I'm an asshole on purpose cuz I just am for a long while. 

I get fed up and I stop arguing about him being a meta player 


He dms me and we reconcile, at least I thought he did and he gave me useful tips and never messaged again. 


He then messaged asking me how is he a meta player and I ask him to drop it because I was in a fowl mood and I didn't want to argue.


He then makes this entire fucking post, messages me, trying to argue again and I was already extremely pissed off before he messaged so I took my anger out on him. Blocked him. Came to the post to give my side of the story.


But of course he won't even mention that jis first words ever was basically calling my best build that I have trash. So I think we're both the asshole here"	1	0	stop arguing comment					"I had a discussion the other day about if using meta items in a game even if you don't even know about the meta makes you a meta player.

I still don't think it does because you don't even know it's as good as people think it is, I mean like if you were to randomly get lucky and find a good item should you just avoid using that item then since it would make you a meta player??"	"StayStrong888 @ 2021-06-21 19:32:28 :

What's a meta item

--------------------------------

HydroBlast008 @ 2021-06-21 19:39:43 :

A meta item is the Most Effective Tactic Available.
For example, you could argue the Double Axe family is the best or Fighters Bindings.

I just think using either one not knowing it's meta doesn't make you a meta player.

--------------------------------

StayStrong888 @ 2021-06-21 19:41:10 :

Why wouldn't you want to use the most effective item? Isn't the point of a game to win?

--------------------------------

HydroBlast008 @ 2021-06-21 19:44:23 :

Yes, but this guy was making a huge deal about it and how he hates those type of players and how it's not original and stuff even though he litterally uses meta items himself, so I was like ""Bruuuuuuuuuuuuh"".

--------------------------------

HydroBlast008 @ 2021-06-21 19:45:31 :

Yes according to that person, yes you should.
Otherwise you're not original and he will hate you for that.

Original? Anything the programmer put in the game is original... he's smoking some bad stuff.

--------------------------------

HydroBlast008 @ 2021-06-21 19:54:26 :

Yeah but in a game like Minecraft Dungeons you have a lot of choices for your loadout.
And apparently I was using a meta build not even knowing I was.
I apparently can't use what I think is fun without being told I'm a meta user and I'm disgusting and unoriginal.

It doesn't but when someone's very first words to you are insults while you're already pissed off due to personal reasons you're gonna be a bit of a dick. At least that's how I am. I wouldn't of been so confrontational if he didn't insult me. And I wouldn't of been so conformational if he didn't dm me multiple times just to argue, and make a whole post about me trying to be a victim of an argument he started.

--------------------------------

BindUpToy @ 2021-07-24 16:31:13 :

Do you realize that you *just* pointed out a gender based inequality and injustice? My point was that countries other than the US have more women's rights issues and are in more need of feminism, and thus looking at feminism from a purely American point of view is problematic. Feminism is a thing in more than America, and should be a thing in even more countries. Simply, my point was *literally* that women have it worse in places other than the US.

(That's not to say things are equal in the US tho)

--------------------------------

SlimShadyOfficial_ @ 2021-07-24 16:39:27 :

Yes correct that is something we agree on, but I really don’t think that people in other countries give a fuck about feminism in America, so saying that feminism should be in countries that women have less then men is a statement I think everyone can agree on, but in America, men and women are equal.

Oh, I see why you're confused. You don't kill babies in an abortion, you just remove a fetus (if I recall that correctly) that would harm the woman if she was forced to give birth.

They don't force the woman to give birth to a baby and then kill it.

No it isn't since a fetus isn't yet a baby.

--------------------------------

starlight-Iris @ 2021-10-19 16:56:27 :

No it isn't, it's a clump of cells that have the potential to become a human being, so when you force a woman to give birth, instead of saving a baby you are just forcing a potential, not even guaranteed life into this world whilst a majority ruining the life of the woman.

And by banning abortions you would just skyrocket the amount of unsafe abortions which would just kill even more women and even babies since there would be no time limit on when the woman could have an abortion.

[deleted] @ 2021-10-19 17:12:28 :

the world isn’t even close to overpopulation. there’s way more families looking to adopt then there is children up for adoption, so the child won’t be unwanted

Yes, taking away the right to have control over your own body is oppression, abortion is not murder since removing a part of your own body that is harming you isn't murder.

And that still leaves us with you supporting the removal of human rights, womens rights, the destruction of womens lives and the killing of women."	"starlight-Iris @ 2021-10-19 17:20:35 :

Yet it still has the possibility of life, and it is just cells from a human, we have witnessed cancerous cells living outside of the human body for over a decade.

starlight-Iris @ 2021-10-19 17:31:19 :

So it's a woman's fault for getting an unsafe abortion when giving birth would kill her? That's like saying that it's a rape victims fault that they were raped because they were ""wearing too revealing clothes"". Speaking of rape, that's another reason for women to be forced to get abortions or if abortions are banned, unsafe ones.

Worst case scenario they think certain groups of people deserve to be above/below others

But capitalism is good tho.

--------------------------------

BichsAndHoesDntExist @ 2021-12-25 09:51:09 :

Eh, it was good for rapid progress following the industrial revolution, but now that technology and society have advanced to the point where people, resources and money are abundant, its an inferior system to socialism, since the system is inherently biased in favour of the rich.

--------------------------------

QuantumCactus11 @ 2021-12-25 09:52:23 :

No capitalism is good if you regulate it. Also socialism can progress technology just as well.

--------------------------------

BichsAndHoesDntExist @ 2021-12-25 09:55:13 :

The *best* case scenario for capitalism with regulation is still an unequal society, with mega rich and the poor - the only compliment I can give it is that it’s possible to not have the poor struggling to survive (although in our current world, that happens anyway) 

Socialism is better adapted to the modern day, it would speed up progress of society in every way and get rid of the large wealth gap between the poor and the rich

--------------------------------

QuantumCactus11 @ 2021-12-25 09:58:09 :

No a lot capitalist countries have very low wealth gaps too. Just look at all the places in Scandinavia. As in like socialism  has some good aspects and yiu can just incorporate those stuff into a capitalist place. Like healthcare, education, housing and stuff.

--------------------------------

BichsAndHoesDntExist @ 2021-12-25 09:59:32 :

Ethical capitalism is okay but still inferior to socialism when it comes to equality.

QuantumCactus11 @ 2021-12-25 10:01:27 :

And ethical capitalism is a lot more feasible.

BichsAndHoesDntExist @ 2021-12-25 10:02:48 :

Easier to achieve? Sure.

It took doing philosophy in college for me to actually learn about reasoning and argument

It’s all about tactics; being able to analyse what someone is saying and break it down to it’s core points and actively ensure you are responding to everything that has been said, even if it’s down to it’s basically logical form (point 1, point 2, conclusion). It’s funny to throw someone’s argument back at them and hear them say they didn’t say it lmao

Always make sure you are answering the question or responding to the argument and make sure you articulate your point as much as you can. Get word perfect so they have nothing to grasp on to you and can’t misrepresent your words and if they do, actively call them out on it and reiterate your previous point. If they make a point that isn’t relevant, call it out and state why it isn’t so the topic isn’t changed so they will answer *your* question and respond to *your* points. Be the mediator of the conversation. And of course, do not engage with or retaliate petty or aggressive behaviour. Always be the bigger person and show good faith in your argument

Any argument or debate I have had since has always resulted in the opponent conceding or a stalemate of ‘agree to disagree’, usually with an emotional element attached. And you can’t really argue against emotions because they’re not rational. Always argue rationally, even if you have an emotional investment - never include it in your argument. Most importantly, know when to stop arguing with someone and when you will be wasting your energy. Some things just are not worth your time"	1	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]

Yes.

Yes he's been found guilty of crimes, he was a sex offender and not innocent in general. 

He was innocent of specific crimes. 

Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of almost all her charges, but not guilty of at least one. 

So she is guilty in general, and innocent of a specific crime.

I am basing it on both, which is that I don't like the design of Tesla cars and that **many** sources say the build quality is poor.

I don't accept everything as dogma, but I consider a range of opinions and make my decision based on that.

And yes it is a good idea to test drive a car you're thinking of buying, I agree 100% with you on that. However, test driving a car you don't want for a number of reasons is futile.

The idea behind the simulation thought-experiment is to explore the fact that we can never be completely certain about the accuracy of our own experience. We don't perceive reality as is, we perceive reality by filtering it twice, once through our limited senses and another time through our brains interpretation of the sensory input. The idea of a simulation owes up to the fact that we already have no direct access to reality, but are instead two layers removed from it. How could we tell the difference? What's one more layer? 

This would then lead you to further interesting questions, such as ""what is reality in the first place"", and ""does it really matter whether or not what we perceive is real? What difference does it make?"" 

Of course you'd miss that point completely and dismiss the whole thing as stupid over practical concerns that don't even matter to the thought experiment. I get it though. Things that you don't understand tend to look stupid to you, that's only natural.

This is called idealism, and Kant, Schopenhauer, Berkeley, and Hume are all great places to start, to dig into all of these concepts more. If you prefer fiction, over philosophy, I'd suggest Jorge Luis Borges. Any of his short stories will do.

""Goethe reformulates the topic of color in an entirely new way. Newton had viewed color as a physical problem, involving light striking objects and entering our eyes. Goethe realizes that the sensations of color reaching our brain are also shaped by our perception — by the mechanics of human vision and by the way our brains process information. Therefore, according to Goethe, what we see of an object depends upon the object, the lighting and our perception."" more on wine-dark sea

kneeltothesun @ 2022-02-24 19:12:31 :

I'm sorry, but it is. The most basic tenet of idealism is the thought that we can never truly know the world around us, or reality, as we gather information through our senses, and our senses lie to us, and are subject to the mind, to filling in the blanks, to narrative, and to memory. etc. It's the foundations of what led to the thought experiments that you've just mentioned, and is well known in the field. Subjective idealism (immaterialism) specifically relates to simulation theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality

One of my own examples might be musical ear syndrome, but color theories serve too.

When people say that diet is more important than exercise it is with in the context of weight loss. I even said this it the end of  my first comment: ""If your goal is to lose weight, you do it in the kitchen not in the gym.""

You keep changing the point of your arguments instead of acknowledging the counter arguments I have stated. If you want to have a discussion on general health then okay. But it's completely different than a discussion on weight loss.

And no, exercise is not more important than diet in general health, nor is diet more important than exercise. They play equal parts in overall health. Doesn't matter what profession you are in this is just the facts.

If you want to continue to have a discussion, you need to stop arguing in bad faith."	1	0	stop arguing comment					While technically, restricting calories is a more effective way to lower overall daily intake than just exercise. The human mind is weak and will within a week for most “cheat” on their diet regimen. Then say, it’s ok I’ll just have 2 cheat days it’s the weekend I deserve it. If you are daily going to the gym or making an effort for the minimum 15 minutes a day, your mental state is so much stronger and more resistant to “cheat” on your diet because there is more invested effort you do not want to waste.

I don't think this counts as an unpopular opinion, it's just wrong, and your making completely unreasonable assumptions that are based on just conjecture.

You can't make the statement that people are more like to cheat on their diet than cheat on their exercise. It comes down to the individual and what they are capable of. It's extremely easy to lose motivation for exercise. It's also one of the first things to be sacrificed when people get busy. This concept of 15 minutes a day isn't going to do anything.

If your goal is to lose weight, you do it in the kitchen not in the gym.

15 minutes a day develops accountability for oneself. A HIIT can easily be only 15 minutes, a jog or a walk for newcomers is even better than no thing. Losing motivation is absolutely horrible and forcing yourself to exercise even for a few minutes starts the learning process to not give and a stronger mindset. Calorie counting does not teach people self responsibility. If it did personal trainers wouldn’t be the fastest growing profession. People will happily pay someone to make them move instead of doing it themself and learning discipline.

--------------------------------

PM__tits_and_dicks @ 2022-07-11 03:14:15 :

I used to be a personal trainer, Non of this is true. 

Calorie counting and the fact that personal trainers are a profession has literally nothing to do with each other. By that logic, I could say that people don't stick too exercise routines because nutritionist is a fast growing profession. It is a completely irrational statement.

15 minutes a day of exercise doesn't improve anything. Doesn't matter if it's HIIT training or not. 

And forcing yourself to exercise when unmotivated takes the exact same discipline to force your self to stay on your diet when you feel like cheating.

Like honestly, none of what you said is grounded in rational thought. Like at all.

--------------------------------

megastuffff @ 2022-07-11 15:11:36 :

Everything personal trainers used to go by 15 years is no longer true. Low fat diets were taught as the mainstream diet then, guess what now it’s all about Keto. Do you think it’ll be the same in 15 years? 

Forcing yourself to exercise takes a completely different discipline than forcing yourself to stay on a diet. If you were actually a personal trainer you would know that nuance and agree with me.

--------------------------------

PM__tits_and_dicks @ 2022-07-11 18:04:35 :

Buddy, my group of friends Are gymnastics coaches, diving coaches, crossfit coaches, body builders and other trainers like me ( I used to be). Absolutely none of them agree with what you are saying. You're wrong, full stop.

It wasn't trainers or even dietitians that were championing low fat years ago, nor are they championing Keto now. It's all pop science that companies use for marketing purposes of their food products. Both trainers and dietitians will build a person diet to the individual, depending on where they are starting from and what their goals are. There's not a one diet to rule them all, their never has been. They've been doing this for ever and it only changes as dietary science advances .

Literally all diets designed to lose weight work the same ( more or less, with some nuance ). Calories in vs Calories out. It is significantly easier to  restrict the amount of calories you intake than it is to increase the amount that you burn. That's why everyone who knows what they are talking about says that weight loss is done in the kitchen. 

Also the self discipline it takes to eat healthy is the EXACT same self discipline it takes to exercise. It's called Will Power. The only nuance about it comes done to the individual, and their own  lifestyle and capabilities. Some will find it easier to stick to a diet, while others will find it easier to stick to an exercise routine. There is no Generalization that can rationally be made like you have done. 

You're wrong in every possible way. It's Okay to admit it.

megastuffff @ 2022-07-11 18:09:00 :

The only thing you’ve argued is that CICO is good for weight loss. I acknowledged that in my OP. No Diet plan will ever be a replacement for an Exercise program. I can tell you for a fact in my profession everyone does literally agree with me. This Is more of a litmus test to see how poorly educated the masses are before and deep dug into false beliefs before we hand write OP-Ed’s disproving how bad the mindset of “diet is more important than exercise”. If that’s also the case, go ahead and do just the bare minimum of looking thru Google scholar and see that exercise is far more beneficial to human health than any diet will ever be, the science is out there already but the majority of people are stuck under bad influence."	"megastuffff @ 2022-07-11 21:23:24 :

I acknowledged CICO several times. I never debated that once, you continue pounding the same nothing burger statements. Exercise routines will develop better mindset and better total overall health than any diet plan ever will.

--------------------------------

PM__tits_and_dicks @ 2022-07-11 22:26:18 :

I'm not beating a ""nothing burger"", I literally mentioned CICO once, and only  after you started talking about specialized diets. You got us on that topic.

You're not even acknowledging any point that has been made and you've even abandoned your initial talking points.

At this point your not even here for a constructive debate. You are arguing just for the sake of arguing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Exercise routines will develop better mindset and better total overall health than any diet plan ever will.

Neither part of this statement is true. I'll say it again since you refuse to acknowledge it, both diet and exercise play equal parts in overall general health. And neither one produces a mind set, like I don't even know what you are trying to say by that. It's an individual's will power that will determine if they follow through with a diet plan or exercise routine. Not the other way around.

megastuffff @ 2022-07-11 22:31:48 :

Diet is not an equal part to exercise. Exercise is far more important.

PM__tits_and_dicks @ 2022-07-11 22:41:07 :

No it isn't

and actually depending on what your definition of exercise is, it's not even needed to be healthy.

If you think exercise is not living a sedentary life and being relatively active. then yes it's needed and yes it's equal in importance to a healthy well balanced diet.

But if your definition of Exercise is going to the gym and building as much muscle as you can. Or running 5ks daily until you gain the stamina to run a marathon. Then no exercise is not needed, and can actually be detrimental to your overall health."

Sturmgewehr448mmKurz @ 2022-07-13 13:08:58 :

Well yes, compare a modern tank to a World War II tanks, that’s obvious but compare a more modern German tank my friend, now we’re talking. So lets compare the Leopard II and the Russian T-80, that’s the tank correct? So now let’s get down to tank specs. So the T-80 Russian MBT was developed in the the mid 70s, but based off prior tanks obviously. The t80 has a better armament by around 5.2 millimeters (it has around a 125 Millimeter cannon, smooth bore mind you) and I believe the Leopards armor is better, but the t80 has more reactive armor. So now let’s talk about loaders, the leopard II has a manual loader with a 4 person crew, but the ammo is stationed away from the crew, the t-80 has a autoloader, that has been rumored to chop arms off if you stray too close... ouch. But the larger problem with a autoloader is the ammunition depot is that one shot, your entire crew is dead, the tank is best as scrap, anyone who was surviving is now burning. So now let’s look at experience in past wars. From what I found, only 8 Leopard IIs have been destroyed, and note that not all were Germany’s, and that’s counting all variations. But this number may be off by a couple, either way it’s proven reliable and sturdy with a punch. Now the T-80 on the other hand... well *only* over 160 tanks have been lost in just Ukraine. But there are many more loses throughout other wars, but while more were built and I’ll admit Ukraine has some of the best ATGMs, that’s still astonishingly more. Now this may be because the tank looks better and I like it more, it seems a little better...

Seeing as Jennette Mccurdy was offered $300,000 by Nickelodeon executives so she wouldn’t talk about her time working with him, there is definitely more to the story. He was verbally abusive, exploitive and wrote story lines into his shows in hopes to trigger his child actors. At the very least he was creepy and mean too children, at the most? Who’s to know… Why are you defending a grown man when there are so many child stars he worked with that turned out horribly? A man who possibly hurt children? I just don’t understand what’s there to defend.

--------------------------------

drum-monkey @ 2022-08-20 19:20:29 :

You want it to be true so bad. Josh Peck, Miranda Cosgrove and so many more who worked under him turned out fine, more than fine actually. You could argue that this mean scary creepy man actually launched every single one of these kids careers who went on to have one.

Literally the whole crux of your comment is that he “possibly” did some really bad stuff, because after all, “who’s to know?”. 

This is the same logic that topples any 9/11 conspiracies. If the US government was involved, certainly hundreds or thousands of people participated in getting this thing to work, but to this day no one has talked? Same logic with Dan Schneider. All of the child actors from the OG shows are adults now. Why have none spoken? And by spoken I mean actually accused him of something more than being mean and creepy. Being mean and creepy is not against the law. Defamation is.

--------------------------------

Natural-Ad8042 @ 2022-08-20 19:45:29 :

Once again, you don’t think it’s strange that Jennette Mccurdy and probably many more were offended hundreds of thousands of dollars at the promise of not speaking about their time on Nickelodeon? Jeannette in her new book is quoted many times saying Dan encouraging her eating disorder and possibly mocked the abuse her mother put her through. The actress from Zoey 101 Alexa Nikolas has said publicly that Dan isn’t a good guy and people should stop watching his shows. 

Blaming victims for not coming forward will always be deplorable, maybe they didn’t come forward for a multitude of reasons, none that you get to know. People don’t come forward because people like you make posts like this, debating about if asking young fans for pictures of their feet is strange, debating if these children are liars, and debating that a police report or public statement is the only indicator of abuse. These people don’t owe the public anything, if they don’t wanna tell millions of people about their trauma then they don’t have too. 

You’re defending an alleged child assaulter and pedophile very strongly. I’d maybe think about where your priorities are, in the possible hurt children or a grown man that was knows to privately text with young fans every day.
