Also, a fridge isn't all that cold. Nowhere near the subzero temperatures that shorten the life of car batteries.	4	0

Yes, that's right, you can't decide to NOT have kids until you already have them.	2	0

Right now nurses are in very high demand so a lot of the requirements have been lowered to accept ADN. In the past ADN nurses had to have more clinical hours than BSN students but I have no idea if this still holds true.	3	0

Like the blooming onion, super easy concept to recreate, but the special onions they use are difficult to get. Or even KFC, they use a pressurized deep fryer that likely is difficult to find.	1	0

Once as the debt had a surplus, he gave the money back to the states. The problem with this was that the states started printing money like crazy and a real estate bubble formed for the land in the West as a result. To try and slow the spending, Jackson made it so all governmental land sales had to be done in gold or silver. But instead of slowing the spending, it stopped it dead. The new rule caused the bubble to implode, since the value of the dollar was propped up by the potential value of the land it could buy, and the United States entered a depression that lasted for over 6 years.	28	0

Because you mix red and green light in equal parts to make yellow. Add more red and you get orange.	8	0

I am sure some compatibility issues would exist between IOS Safari and OS X Safari, but it would be less annoying.

Google and Apple work so hard at perfecting the browsing user experience on handheld devices and it is messed up with mobile site versions or ""Download the App Instead"".
