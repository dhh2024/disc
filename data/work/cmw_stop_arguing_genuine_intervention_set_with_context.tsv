&gt; With overpopulation issues, 

Where?  You can still fit everyone on the planet in a city the size of Texas.  Also spellcheck doesnt' catch ciry.  Weird.

I mean, there's overcrowding... but you could just move away...

&gt; people starving around the world

Recently, more people are dying from eating too much (heart disease, obesity, yadda yadda) than people who are starving to death.

&gt;  environmental impacts of human lifestyles

Eh... the impact was felt during the industrial revolution, when the population was a fraction of what it is today.

&gt; and a growing number of orphans

I'm not sure what this has to do with overpopulation.  There were always (see: definitive statement) orphans and there always will be.  Whether there are a million, billion, or ten billion people.

&gt; an obligation to consider their decision to have biological children thoroughly

Eh... [about half of babies are unplanned](http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2012/07/26/study-nearly-40-percent-of-babies-born-come-from-unplanned-pregnancies/).  So it's not like irresponsible people are just reproducing willy nilly (They **are** reproducing, but not willy nilly).

&gt; and (maybe) wrong.

Eh.  What's wrong about following one of the [biological imperatives](http://www.ask.com/wiki/Biological_imperative).  It's our JOB as living creatures to make as many of ourselves as the ecosystem can support, make more than that, die off and do it all over agian.

I would really like a source on your absolutely nonsense implication that more people are dying from ""eating too much"" than are starving to death. 

Because it's absolute nonsense. 

And the whole Texas thing is a pretty common missing-the-point point to make. It isn't about space, it's about resources. 

What industrial revolution? The US's? There are lots of countries in the world going through their own industrial revolutions right now. 

Orphans have something to do with the decision to bear children. You can adopt if you need to be a parent. Remember, that's what we're talking about here. 

We, as humans, no longer need to be slaves to our ""biological imperatives."" That's my whole point. We're not deer. We can make these choices.

http://factcheck.org/2013/03/bloombergs-obesity-claim/

Your face is nonsense.

&gt;  It isn't about space, it's about resources.

And we have plenty of those too.  It's just that we're mismanaging and wasting them.  For example: Hydrogen powered cars.  You can apply that motor to do basically anything from heating your home to powering your lights.  We don't do it yet because we don't ""have to"".  

But we're edging toward that slowly.

&gt; What industrial revolution?

No, the one England had about 200 years ago.  When coal power went bananas and impacted the ecosystem there doing all kinds of crazy shit from changing the color of moths to contributing to the ""foggy London"" misconception.  That's the beginning of global warming.  ...ish.

&gt; Orphans have something to do with the decision to bear children. You can adopt if you need to be a parent. 

Nope.  Nope nope nope.  Tell that to gay couples on years-long waiting lists.  Or single women (I'm not even going to indulge the myth of the single man who successfully adopted a child).

My ex was adopted from India.  Between airfare and paperwork and all that, it ended up being about $80,000.  There is no financial help given for that.  And adopting babies here is no thrift store either, it's about 40-60k.

&gt; We, as humans, no longer need to be slaves to our ""biological imperatives.""

Stop eating for a month.

Stop drinking anything for a week.

Stop breating for 10 minutes.

Choose to not defend yourself against an attacker.

Then tell me about how above biological imperatives we are.  Also, there's no need for quotes.  It's a thing.  I linked it to you.

Okay, sure. Your claim is supported. 
Though, I don't know if you read that, but it talks about how UNICEF has wildly different data and that it isn't necessarily about overeating - it's about the type of food people are eating. Sure, for example there's a ton of corn in the world. It's not healthy, but it's food. 

Yes, we are mismanaging and wasting resources. And people die every day because of it. The fact that we could do something about it doesn't change the fact that it's the world we currently live in. And bringing more people into the part of the world that consumes the majority of the resources isn't selfish why?

I'm not sure what England has anything to do with this. ""China's coal consumption in 2010 was 3.2 billion metric tonnes per annum."" Pretty sure that blows England out of the water. 

Yes, I fully agree with you that adoption is not easy. My sister's boyfriend is a single male who adopted a child, but anecdotes are pretty worthless. The adoption system needs reformed, but you're optimistic about ending world hunger and poverty and all the rest of it.. why not that?

Of course I can't do things that will kill me. Choosing not to have a child wont kill me and you're actually getting into some weird territory here where you're trying to tell me that there's something wrong with me for choosing not to reproduce?

&gt; The fact that we could do something about it doesn't change the fact that it's the world we currently live in.

To quote the universally acclaimed Doctor Phil:  People do what works.  We don't *need* hydrogen motors so we don't use them.  But we will have them when we need them.

&gt;  but you're optimistic about ending world hunger and poverty and all the rest of it.. why not that?

I'm not optimistic, I'm realistic.  The starving areas aren't starving because of a global lack of food.  It's usually dick-warlords hoarding it or Kim Jung Fatty eating it all.

&gt; Pretty sure that blows England out of the water.

Yeah, it does.  Nobody is saying it doesn't.  I'm saying the global impact was seen hundreds of years ago, when we were about an eighth the size we are.

&gt; Of course I can't do things that will kill me. Choosing not to have a child wont kill me and you're actually getting into some weird territory here where you're trying to tell me that there's something wrong with me for choosing not to reproduce?

Well

A:  It was a response to you brushing off the whole biological imperative thing.

B:  Even if I was (which I'm not, as I don't plan to have kids either) fair's fair because your post says ""reproducing is the most selfish thing you can do"".

Haha, Dr. Phil. Okay, right, but at what point do we ""need"" them? When the ultra rich can't afford oil anymore? Right now it seems to me we need a lot of things, globally, that we're not getting. 

Are you suggesting that humans' environmental impact isn't getting progressively worse with time? I'm really unclear on this whole industrial revolution argument. I totally agree with you, that point in history was important for the effects it continues to have on the world.. but isn't that supporting my point? Increasing the population is only increasing demand for things that contribute to environmental problems. "

I'm going to attempt to tackle this view from a governmental standpoint (U.S. government). So you're suggesting that people with these diseases ought to be sterilized to prevent passing on their harmful genes. My question is would this be a federally run service? I'd assume it'd have to be to make it a mandatory. The problem with that is the government becomes involved in the personal lives of the people. The government chooses how those certain individuals would lead their lives and that has huge consequences. Think about how intrusive that'd be if the government made personal decisions on behalf of yourself. The consequences of forcing sterilization would literally be anti-freedom and the entirety of that idea would delegitimize our government.

Actually, they are. They are in that very position. Their job is to look out for the public good, and if that means prohibition, it's gonna be prohibition, and if that means sterilization of the dangerous, then that's what it means.

I never claimed it was the official name. Skip your pathetic tangent.

&gt;The second statement is taken from a previous comment. My point is that if you consider the supply side in conjunction with the demand side it is perfectly possible for something that is highly ""valued"" (say teaching) to receive low pay. Willingess to pay is not the sole determinant of pay because the supply of teachers is important too. So, as I said before, it is perfectly possible for teachers to be more valued than CEOs yet for teachers to be paid far less.

No, just no. Society is completely unwilling to pay teachers the rate of CEOs. Yes their supply depresses their wages somewhat, but their lower amount of individual value is their primary reason for lower wages.

&gt;This relates to the diamonds/water question. ""Why are diamonds so expensive when water is so cheap, even though one does nothing and the other is essential for life?"" Although a persons valuation or willingness to pay for water may be very high, it is in such abundance that the price is very low. Conversely, diamonds, although they're quite pretty, sell for much more because of the constrained supply.

Yawn...do I really need to bother to answer this. The individual water unit is worth less than the individual diamond unit. The total amount of water is worth more than the total amount of diamonds. Please stop arguing past my point.

My point is this. I'm willing to pay more for a CEO than for an individual teacher. That by definition means that I value his services more than the teachers. If teachers are, as individuals, worth more then people should pay them there fair wage.  But don't bitch to me about my evaluations of my CEO. If John Smith can convince Starbucks that he is worth a million a year to them then good for him. If he can only convince a school to pay him 40 grand then I say tough luck.

Teachers make less because they generate less value.  This is primarily because a teacher only works with some 30ish kids.  A CEO works with thousands of employees.  Teachers would make more money if they taught more kids but as the education workload of a country is done by a lot of people, then they are going to make less individual.

Also, there comes into the issue of talent.  Not to disrespect teachers, but the talent pool for CEOs is significantly higher than most teaching positions (assuming we aren't talking about college professors).

Salaries are neither how much work is valued, nor a reflection of the effort put in. They are a consequence of supply and demand (both).

There are very few people that make really good CEOs. There is a certain demand for CEOs. Therefore there is competition between companies to hire the best CEOs, resulting in high wages. 

Teachers are actually highly valued by most members of society (and as it's a largely a government job, if they were paid based on how much they are valued, they'd be paid a lot). The difference is that there are a *lot* of people that can be teachers, at least at the levels needed by most schools. There is, therefore, a lot of competition for the relatively few positions available for teachers, resulting in low salaries. 

In both cases, people can put in a lot of work, or a little work, and it doesn't much affect their salary (compared to the other effect).

&gt;There are very few people that make really good CEOs. There is a certain demand for CEOs. Therefore there is competition between companies to hire the best CEOs, resulting in high wages. 

Yes, hence their labor is more valuable. A company is willing to part with that much money in exchange for their services.

Really? They're actions speak louder than words. If people valued teacher's work more than their current wage, then they'd pay more for that service.

&gt;In both cases, people can put in a lot of work, or a little work, and it doesn't much affect their salary (compared to the other effect). 

I agree. I'm not arguing for a Marxist labor theory of value here but a Capitalist theory of value that something is as valuable as whatever the market will bear for it.

BritOli @ 2013-06-10 17:50:16 :

Economics as a discipline does not and cannot discuss the idea of value. Value here, I define as the ""innate goodness"" of something. What Economics does do is it describe how prices come about. The mistake you are making is that you assume that something's price reflects its value. It need not. Consider now that the ""price"" of work is effectively a salary.

Teachers may do an enormous amount of social ""good"" and so many people may think that they are valuable (perhaps more so than a CEO - but that's probably because it's harder to see what a CEO does). But in terms of supply, there is an awful lot of supply for teachers - far more so than for good CEOs. Willingness to pay is certainly an important factor on the demand side, but your analysis ignores the supply side, which /u/hacksoncode explained. People may well value teachers highly, but they do not have to pay them lots of money because there are lots of teachers out there. So teacher's salaries are low but this does not neccesarily reflect the personal valuation of the individual. Again, I stress, prices do not reflect valuations, but rather prices reflect the interaction of supply and demand.

tl;dr Willingness to pay is a demand side factor, but you must consider the supply side too. Value does not equal price.

Well I disagree with your definition of value. My definition of value is the capitalist one. A product of service is as valuable to me as the amount of effort or resources I'm willing to spend acquiring it.  Please explain why your value definition should be the one used in this discussion.

But yes I agree, and we are actually using the same definition of value. As you correctly say, valuations are reflected in a willingness to pay.

Now, Economics as a discipline does not attempt to define where or how that value arises. It simply accepts that people have different valuations. In short, if you start to theorise about where valuations come from you open a big can of worms. 

What Economists instead talk about are prices. Prices are the result of interactions of demand (driven by valuations) and supply. That is why talking about values rather than prices is confusing - because valuations are linked to the demand side whereas prices are a result of demand AND supply. That is why it is better to talk about prices, rather than valuations.

It's good to learn. Messy definitions make for messy thinking.

&gt;Society is completely unwilling to pay teachers the rate of CEOs.

I agree. Demand is much higher for CEOs, but let me put it this way: if there were as many good potential CEOs as there are teachers, would CEOs be paid as much? No. Clearly no. If anyone could be a good CEO the pay would fall as people undercut other people. This is why supply matters as well as demand. 

&gt;Yawn...do I really need to bother to answer this. The individual water unit is worth less than the individual diamond unit. The total amount of water is worth more than the total amount of diamonds. Please stop arguing past my point.

This is not the answer. Nor does it make sense. If you are starving in a desert, do you value the individual drop water or the individual diamond? Evidently the water - even though diamonds are more expensive. This is the paradox. It isn't arguing past your point because it is an analogy of the CEO/teacher question. Feel free to read up on [marginalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value) which is THE accepted theory of value in the study of Economics. 

&gt;I hope you will read people's arguments and address them. Not listening, arguing past someone, then trying to pretend like the person is an idiot and give them an economics lecture doesn't help your argument.

I have read what you've put and I have also tried to be polite, honestly. However when someone is wrong, as I assure you that you are, I think it is ok to correct them. Especially as you are trying to give someone else a lecture. In short, you are very much in need of an economics lecture.

&gt;My point is this. I'm willing to pay more for a CEO than for an individual teacher. That by definition means that I value his services more than the teachers. If teachers are, as individuals, worth more then people should pay them there fair wage. But don't bitch to me about my evaluations of my CEO.

But if you feel he is more valuable, then feel free to pay him more to teach.

As I have said again and again, your willingness to pay reflects your valuation. Society can value CEOs and teachers however they like. However we should not expect for valuations to SOLELY determine prices or wages. This is because valuation or willingness to pay focuses only on demand. If we value water very highly and diamonds very lowly, why do diamonds cost so much more than water? It is because supply also has a role to play. If willingness to pay were all that mattered, diamonds would be very cheap, and water would cost loads! Clearly, supply has a huge role to play, which your analysis ignores. Yes, willingness to pay matters, but so does supply.

So why are CEOs paid more than Teachers? Well, as you say, there is certainly more demand (higher willingness to pay) for them because they can generate much larger profits, but it is also because there is far less of a supply of CEOs because CEOs need to be extremely skilled, educated, experienced, and dedicated.

Well, when you make a claim that he is an innocent sweet little child, be prepared for that claim to be put to the test. 

&gt; knowing damn well if some pretty white boy got killed by ""the violent"" black man (because I've had people on here actually claim that black people are genetically more violent)

Well, you're running out of excuses as to how/why the black community has devolved into such a state of decay. Asians and many other minorities were oppressed throughout american history, and these various races are no where near poverty stricken as the black community is today. 

Besides, if you believe in evolution, then this notion is not outlandish at all. You have taken a common ancestor and scattered them across the globe to different environments, and you want to believe that *only* skin color came about differently? Zero cognitive, physical, dietary, or psychological differences over tens of thousands of years?

&gt;some pretty white boy got killed by ""the violent"" black man 

Well, black men make up 6% of the population but cover almost half of all crimes in the U.S. Why this is I don't know, whether it be genetic, socioeconomic (what I vote for) or just a giant whitey b opressin conspiracy.

You asked for a time Asians were controlled by other people.  I'm not saying that the two are equal.

The point is that all of non-white people in the US have been, and are, still being oppressed by white people.  It may not equal the disgusting treatment of native Americans or blacks, but it's still something that needs to be acknowledged.  Lesser treatment shouldn't be considered acceptable just because it's not as bad as being forced onto a reservation or slavery.

I certainly don't think it was, or is, acceptable.  But if you read what I quoted--I simply gave a reason for the extreme poverty and high crime in the black community and pointed out the difference in that and the Asian community.  I also pointed to the reasons for the high crime and extreme poverty amongst the native population.  It isn't a coincidence that the most oppressed people are still the lowest class."

My original post was in response to someone claiming blacks are inherently more violent and poor simply because they were black.  You are the one who is digressing from the conversation.  I'm not exactly sure what you are trying to argue with me about.  I was correcting an incredibly racist statement.  You've decided to believe I am minimizing the problems faced by other minorities.  I am not minimizing what the Asian, Irish, Muslim or Hispanic communities have been through.  The treatment of all minorities has been abominable.

However, that has nothing to do with the original discussion.

Imprisoning people /=enslaving them.

They paid the Chinese rail workers.  They paid them poorly and treated them brutally--but that was par for the course during the Industrial Revolution.  Were they worse off than the Irish?  Yeah, they were, but not by a whole lot.

There were also a very small amount of Asian slaves as we traditionally think of them but they were fewer and farther between than the Southern US. Chinese Triads are also involved in human trafficking or slave trading into the US today.

The modern day slaves are from all races.  That is not a uniquely Asian thing.  The Mexican Cartels import Hispanic women to use as prostitutes and sex slaves.  The Russian and other Eastern European Mafias import their people as sex slaves.  This is a worldwide epidemic and not limited to a race--so to use those in the conversation is meaningless.  It isn't because they are Chinese--because organized crime uses all races.  It is just where the Chinese Triad can get people from--just like the Russians and Mexicans."

You clearly think atheists believe there is no god. This is known as antitheism. Stop arguing that you didn't say this. Atheism is lack of belief, like asexual is lack of sexuality.

You're an agnostic atheist."	1	0	stop arguing comment					"My view sits on a foundation of logic like this:

1. Atheism: The way science goes about disproving something is by finding evidence to the contrary. Many religions can be put down through evidence pointing otherwise but some cannot as of yet. Since all religious claims cannot be refuted it's respectful to the scientific method to not completely denounce religions plausibility.

2.Religion: There is no definitive proof of a God or supernatural force acting on the universe anywhere (no, m-theory doesn't count). That being said, faith is what allows people to hold religious beliefs. I think these people aren't being responsible to themselves because faith simply is a delusion.

Those points being stated I think holding a position of admitted ignorance is both respectful to the possibility that faith is necessary in life and the notion that delusions are not a great thing to incorporate all over your life. CMV."	"Amablue @ 2013-07-27 16:57:17 :

A very, *very* tiny minority of atheists actually think that god is disprovable. 

Agnosticism is not typically considered as a position on the same axis as athism/theism. In fact, there is no spectrum there, it's a binary choice. A theist is someone who believes in at least one god. If that statement does not apply to you, you are without theism, or an atheist. That's literally what atheist means, the prefix a- means 'without'. 

Gnosticism/agnosticism is a statement about whether or not you believe the existence of god is provable. There are people out there who believe in god, and furthermore believe that his existence can be proven true. They would be gnostic theists. Then there are people who belief in god, but acknowledge that they can not prove this belief, they are agnostic theists. Most atheists are agnostic atheists, who don't believe in god, and who believe that proving his non-existence is impossible.

An agnostic (someone who believes theres no evidence for both god and no god) would share the ""No"" answer to the top question ""Do you believe in a god?"" with an atheist (someone who believes there's no evidence for a god). There's no way for you to be theist, so you must be atheist, just not a gnostic atheist but an agnostic one.

&gt;Atheism means ""no belief in god"" and agnostic means ""no knowledge"".

[This](http://i.imgur.com/7jQLFVT.png) to you means agnostics are a seperate category because it makes a false dichotomy that  atheists have to disprove gods for the question ""Do you believe no gods exist?"". The god concept was an idea given to man without evidence, therefore no evidence is needed to disprove it. However the diagram puts agnostics in the ""No"" box as though they have to disprove unfalsifiable gods to be atheists. 
&gt;Atheism means ""no belief in god"" and agnostic means ""no knowledge"".

If you take a stance on whether you ""believe"" god exists and whether you ""know"" it exists, because there's no evidence you can't know for sure so you'd be agnostic, but at the same time atheist from not believing in any current god proposals.

Wrong. Gnosticism is about knowing, which is based on that person's quota for evidence. Mine is evidence that can be scientifically reproduced in a controlled environment. Religious people know that they know that they know, which answers how there can be gnostic theists and gnostic atheists. Usually though, when someone identifies as atheist they're an agnostic atheist because were the evidence to present itself, their knowledge would affect their belief.

&gt;I don't know where you keep getting that I'm putting a burden of proof on you.

You expected that mainstream atheists believe there are no gods but since gods can't be disproven, labeled yourself agnostic.

Then you say 

&gt;I was talking how how you drawn the lines between ""atheist"" and ""agnostic"", not whether or not a god exists.

Yeah, but you assumed atheists fit the definition of antitheists that go out of their way to disprove god. Granted many atheists dislike the workings of religion so they disprove miracles. But they can't disprove the existential bits about god where the concept's reduced to existing impossibly in a vacuum or before time.

--------------------------------

I get that you believe this.  But that's not how most people use atheist and agnostic.  It's a redrawing of the line so that all agnostics (like myself) are now ""atheists"" under your definition.  What you describe as ""antitheist"" would be what most people call an atheist.

And ""antitheist"" sounds more like somebody who is opposed to theism, or specifically goes out of their way to argue with theists.

If you don't believe there is a god and you don't believe that there is no god, that would make you an agnostic.

&gt;The term atheism originated from the Greek ἄθεος (atheos), meaning ""without god(s)"", used as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshipped by the larger society.

As you can see it's a ""lack of belief"" or ""rejection of a belief"", not ""the belief in the disproving of a god"".

You're thinking of appeal to popularity, not appeal to authority.  But when it comes to definitions of words, it's not really a fallacy.  Or, if you prefer, we could look at how Lawtey is laying out the debate and it's very clear that he or she meant atheism to mean a belief in no god, not simply the lack of belief in a god.

I'm not accusing you of believing atheists are Satanists, I'm saying that's how you evaluate words, through the use of what's in widespread culture. Now please define asexual and explain why it means what it means, and give me another word that has the 'a' prefix and which means something other than ""lacking"" the word it's attached to. Just as an experiment. 

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-29 02:52:16 :

You were, however, telling me that atheism isn't ""the belief in the disproving of a god,"" as though that was something I ever claimed.

Asexual gets used in a lot of different ways.  It could mean someone who is celibate, someone who is interested in people in a romantic way but not a sexual way, someone who isn't interested in other people in a romantic or sexual way, or a lifeform which reproduces without having sex. 

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-29 03:35:46 :

""The belief in the disproving of a god"" was another way for me to say your view that atheists believe there is no god and don't simply have a lack of belief in god.

I'm going to take the definition ""someone who isn't interested in other people in a romantic or sexual way"" AKA lacking a sex drive (all your definitions imply this). How come atheism isn't the same? Someone who isn't interested in the belief of a god or gods or lacks a god drive. You didn't give a definition that the person is out to disprove sexuality. Secondly, you were unable to tell me a word that has the 'a' prefix which doesn't mean ""lacking of"". Might have something to do with the fact that [it's a real prefix, that's defined in the list of prefixes of the English language to mean not or without.](http://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/prefixes.htm) It's not a word that appeals to popularity can change.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-29 04:02:26 :

""Belief in the disproving of God"" makes it sound like it requires the belief in proof of the non-existence of a god, rather than just belief in the non-existence of a god.

If you like, you can split up the word ""atheism"" into three parts.  There's the ""a-"" prefix which as you correctly noted means ""lacking of"".   There's the middle part, coming from the Greek Θεός or ""Theós"" meaning meaning god.  And then there's the final ""-ism"" which is a suffix generally used to describe philosophies, beliefs or ideas.  

Now you can think of it, in meaning, as being an ""a-"" added to the front of ""theism"", or ""Lacking in (a god, belief in)"".   Or, you could think of it as an ""-ism"" added to the end of ""atheos"", or ""(Lacking in a god), belief in"".  Both of these interpretations are valid ways to read the components of this word, but the latter is more commonly what people mean when they say atheist.  Especially when contrasting it from agnosticism, as Lawtey is doing.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-29 04:35:56 :

As far as I can tell, I agree with you that Lawtey is saying what you're saying, that atheism is more like the belief in the non existence of god and holding the view of atheism is like denouncing religion entirely through probability and isn't scientific enough. 
&gt;Since all religious claims cannot be refuted it's respectful to the scientific method to not completely denounce religions plausibility.

Now that I've noticed that I'll continue the argument. Asexual can therefore mean Asex(without the act of sex) -ual (type of person), a type of person that never has sex, and you could do that for literally any similar word. However I would argue, since we read left to right we interpret the A first and then attribute it to the rest of the word, much like non-theism, where you can't read it the wrong way (compared to wikipedia). Since Asex sounds much less plausible than Athe because it's only 1 syllable, that's another reason why it shouldn't be read that way - it conforms to the prefix sounding like it starts the word. You also can't think of an example of another word we read backwards, can you? You should call into the atheist experience with this trick, actually never heard it before.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-29 06:02:54 :

It's not that you're reading it backwards; it's that the suffix modifies the prefix, rather than the other way around.  

Asexual is actually a perfect example of another word that does that.  The ""-ual"" prefix actually doesn't mean ""kind of person""; it's a suffix that turns it into an adjective meaning ""characterized by"" (for example, adding ""-ual"" to ""fact"" to make ""factual"" does not mean ""fact-type person"" but means ""characterized by facts"").

If you read ""asexual"" with the prefix modifying the suffix, then it would  mean ""a lack of characterized by being sexual""; pretty much the same thing as ""non-sexual.""  It would apply to pretty much all objects.

On the other hand, since we read it with the suffix modifying the prefix, we get a word which means ""characterized by a lack of sex,"" which is more true to how we use the word asexual.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-29 07:49:07 :

&gt;It's not that you're reading it backwards; the suffix modifies the prefix

Modifies? More like prioritizes itself over the prefix, which is equivalent to the order which you read a word's components.

&gt;The ""-ual"" prefix actually doesn't mean ""kind of person"" but characterized by

False. [The suffix 'al' can be part of a noun, verb or adjective.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/13935224/Suffix-List) It can be ""That guy is an asexual"" for the noun option, ""he asexualized that cactus"" for the verb option, or ""look at that asexual cactus"" for the adjective. We are using the noun option.

Therefore, if read with the suffix taking priority and used as a noun, an asexual can only be construed as ""a type of person that never has sex"". You could get away with ""characterized by a lack of sex"" only if it was being used as an adjective. This equally doesn't work for atheist because you get ""a type of person who believes in a lack of god"", whereas the real definition is ""a person who lacks the belief for god"". It doesn't work for an asexual, an afactual or an abnormal (if you were considering them types of people) and it neither works for an atheist.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-29 08:05:43 :

&gt;Modifies? More like prioritizes itself over the prefix, which is equivalent to the order which you read a word's components.

No, it doesn't work like this. 

&gt;""That guy is an asexual""

There's an implied ""person"" after the word asexual in that case.  Much like after ""Homosexual"" or ""Asian"".  Even if you don't agree, it should be clear to you that the -ual suffix does not inherently mean describing a type of person, as you asserted earlier.  The point that it's an adjective is really immaterial to the argument anyways.  The point is that (as confirmed in the page you posted) it means related to or characterized by, not ""type of person.""  And asexual is an example of a word where the suffix modifies the prefix, not the other way around.


&gt;""he asexualized that cactus""

This has another suffix ""-ize"" added to the end, making it a verb.

If you're really hung up on this one example, there are others, too.  ""Deformable,"" for instance.  The -able on the end modifies everything before it.

Or ""asexualize""   It does not mean ""lack of sexualize;"" it means ""to render asexual"".  The final suffix in this case is what modifies everything else.



--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-29 08:46:37 :

We aren't talking about how suffixes modify the meaning of nouns to verbs, we're talking about which parts of the words to read first. I honestly don't understand how you think suffixes change the order we read parts of words but I'm trying to disprove that if it was true. Atheist can be read starting from the prefix or the suffix first and they have different meanings, the meaning starting from the suffix is as false as the asexual meaning ""one that never has sex"".

&gt;asexual is an example of a word where the suffix modifies the prefix, not the other way around.

Just so you know ""asexual"" doesn't modify the prefix 'a'. The 'a' means ""lack of"" whether it be asexist, asexual, asexualize. Rendering asexual still implies a lack of sexuality that it is rendering it to.

&gt;""asexualize"" It does not mean ""lack of sexualize;"" it means ""to render asexual""

We're not using asexual as a verb ending with ize. In the context of trying to prove atheism can only be defined that starts reading from the prefix, it's just ""asexual"".

&gt;There's an implied ""person"" after the word asexual

Is there an implied person at the end of atheist? No, because an atheist is a noun. As shown on the [suffix page](http://www.scribd.com/doc/13935224/Suffix-List) the al suffix's usage is acceptable in usage of verbs, adjectives and nouns. Asexual can be a noun.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-29 09:15:23 :

&gt;We aren't talking about how suffixes modify the meaning of nouns to verbs, we're talking about which parts of the words to read first.

Well obviously, you read from left-to-right.  But that fact doesn't really contradict my initial point about the word atheism.

&gt;We're not using asexual as a verb ending with ize. In the context of trying to prove atheism can only be defined that starts reading from the prefix, it's just ""asexual"".

Actually, -ize is a verb ending.  Asexual is not a verb, and adding the suffix ""ize"" to the end makes it a verb.  I feel like you're missing what I'm saying.  **If** the prefix always modified everything after it, including suffixes (which you seem to be arguing), and the prefix ""a-"" means lacking in (which we both agree it does), then ""asexualize"" would mean ""lacking in sexualize,"" which it doesn't.  Because the **suffix** ""-ize"" is modifying everything before it, rather than the **prefix** ""a-"" modifying everything after it.

&gt;Is there an implied person at the end of atheist? No, because an atheist is a noun.

Well, yes, but you'll notice that ""atheist"" is a different word than ""asexual"" and that ""-ist"" is a different suffix than ""-al"".  I never said that ""atheist"" had an implied ""person"" after it; I said that ""asexual"" had an implied ""person"" after it when being used as a noun.

And none of what you're saying really supports the idea that a prefix always modifies the suffix and never the other way around.


&gt;As shown on the suffix page[1] the al suffix's usage is acceptable in usage of verbs, adjectives and nouns. Asexual can be a noun.

I would ask you to name one verb that ends with the suffix ""al"" and point out that this list has no citations and is just something somebody pasted on a website, but we are getting way too far from the topic at hand.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-29 20:51:29 :

&gt;""-ist"" is a different suffix than ""-al"". I never said that ""atheist"" had an implied ""person"" after it; I said that ""asexual"" had an implied ""person"" after it when being used as a noun.

Where are your sources? The al and ist simply differ in the fact that one has to do with belief. Now are you going to claim that ending a word with an, as in American, implies there's a person and American is only an adjective?

Because the suffix ""-ize"" is modifying everything before it, rather than the prefix ""a-"" modifying everything after it.

Again, no sources. Non-theist. Now explain how ist modified everything before it and now we read it as ""believer in the lack of god"". It. Doesn't. Work. That. Way! Not Asex-ual, not Athe-ism. Go read wikipedia where it clearly says Atheism is a LACK of belief in gods.

&gt;I would ask you to name one verb that ends with the suffix ""al""

As you said before, there can be multiple suffixes on words. A word doesn't need to end with a suffix for that to be the only suffix in that word. Asexualize still has the al in it.

&gt;but we are getting way too far from the topic at hand.

No, I think you aren't backing anything you say up with facts. There's no harm in changing your opinion you know, you're not a politician who'd be accused of ""flip flopping"", in fact this subreddit is against people not changing their views.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-29 21:11:47 :

&gt; Because the suffix ""-ize"" is modifying everything before it, rather than the prefix ""a-"" modifying everything after it.

&gt;Again, no sources.

No sources?  Just look at the meaning of the word.  ""-ize"" is a suffix that's added to an adjective (or sometimes noun) \_\_\_\_\_\_, and changes it into a verb which means ""to render _______""  In the case of ""asexualize"", it means ""to render asexual.""  If it was the prefix modifying everything else, then it would mean ""lacking to sexualize"" or more along the lines of ""to not sexualize.""  It doesn't mean this.  Therefore, it is not the prefix modifying the rest of the word.

&gt;Now explain how ist modified everything before it and now we read it as ""believer in the lack of god.""

I did already.  Would you like me to quote myself?

&gt;Go read wikipedia where it clearly says Atheism is a LACK of belief in gods.

Wikipedia is a webpage that anybody can edit.  It's not an authority on anything.

&gt;As you said before, there can be multiple suffixes on words. A word doesn't need to end with a suffix for that to be the only suffix in that word. Asexualize still has the al in it.

Yeah, but it's the ""ize"" that makes it a verb, not the ""al"".  Because the final suffix modifies everything before it.  Like I've been telling you.


&gt;No, I think you aren't backing anything you say up with facts.

You seem to have built your understanding of the word ""atheism"" on the belief that it's always the prefix which modifies everything after it, and never the suffix which modifies everything before it.  You asserted this idea without any backup.  I'm providing you counter-examples to show it's not true.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-30 01:55:24 :

&gt;""asexualize"", it means ""to render asexual."" If it was the prefix modifying everything else, then it would mean ""lacking to sexualize""

You only say that because it's an uncommonly used word. It simply means the action done has disappeared the sexuality of something. Like neutering.

&gt;Wikipedia is a webpage that anybody can edit. It's not an authority on anything.

Fine [Robert collins dictionary for atheism](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/atheism) Synonyms: nonbelief, disbelief, scepticism, infidelity, paganism, unbelief, freethinking, godlessness, irreligion, heathenism. Notice antitheism isn't there.

&gt;Because the final suffix modifies everything before it. Like I've been telling you.

Fine I don't care whether it makes it a verb, adjective or whatever. It still has the suffix al in it. But the context isn't whether it's asexualize, asexual, or asexualist. The context is to prove what order the word should be read a-sexual or asexu-al. Athe-ist or a-theist.

Show me a dictionary that has atheist as ""believing in the nonexistance of all gods"". Until then call into the atheist experience all you want but don't bring the unfounded ""Everyone doesn't mean it the way you do"" to the table. Who do you think writes the dictionary? Ok you're not buying that so let's go to Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation is that because we read from left to right, the prefix 'a' is ""first come first served"" and prioritized to be the operating term to '-theist'. 


You ignored my point about the term American. Are theist and American now the only terms which don't have a ""person"" implied? Because it seems like you only believe words aren't adjectives when it suits your argument. Oh and asexual is a noun according to [wikipedia.](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asexual)

Try to keep it straightforward so the discussion can continue smoothly in the spirit of this forum.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-30 02:19:54 :

Which is exactly what I said.

Probably because nobody ever uses the word ""anti-theism"" and just uses ""atheism"" to mean belief in the lack of a god.  [Cambridge dictionary definition](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/american-english/atheism?q=atheism).

&gt;Fine then the A prefix modifies everything after it. Zero evidence required to discount a zero evidence claim.

You just made a zero-evidence claim.

&gt;Show me a dictionary that has atheist as ""believing in the nonexistance of all gods"". 

The Cambridge dictionary listed above.  Also, the second definition on Merriam-Webster.


&gt;Ok you're not buying that so let's go to Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation is that because we read from left to right, the prefix 'a' is ""first come first served"" and prioritized to be the operating term to '-theist'. 

Actually, being read first would mean that it can't act on the ""ist"" suffix because it hasn't been read yet.  If you want to go by the ""things go into effect from left-to-right"" philosophy (which isn't a real grammatical rule, but something you seem to have made up), then the a- wouldn't affect the -ist, but the -ist would affect the -a.

&gt;You ignored my point about the term American. Are theist and American now the only terms which don't have a ""person"" implied?

Mostly because it was getting way off-topic to the discussion at hand.

&gt; Oh and asexual is a noun according to wikipedia.

Reminder: wikipedia is not an authority on anything; it's a webpage that anyone can edit.  Also, I never said it wasn't a noun.  I said that is has an implied ""person"" on the end when used as a noun.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-30 02:32:41 :

&gt;I said that is has an implied ""person"" on the end when used as a noun.

Gotcha. Give me an example of another noun where it requires a noun after it. Then asexual read with the ""al"" as the operating term means ""someone who never has sex"", and the point no longer applies to atheism.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-30 03:13:43 :

This is really getting far removed from the topic of this post.  Does it really matter to your point or mine, in any way, whether the word ""asexual"" has an implied ""person"" after it when used as a noun?

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-30 05:33:07 :

The topic of the overall post: Your assertion that agnostic atheists aren't science backed because they believe they can disprove every last unevidenced, unfalsifiable god. This is antitheism, and is used solely to argue with theists, not build evidence for atheism (which requires nothing other than no evidence of theism). 

Here's the rundown of how our debate has theoretically, as of this post, concluded.

1. First you asserted that an atheist is one that believes in no gods.
1. I then stated an atheist is like an asexual in that one lacks a sexuality and one lacks a belief in god.
I successfully proved that reading asexual like you were reading atheist (believer, lacking gods) wouldn't make sense for the undisputed definition of asexual, which would be read as ""pertains to/characterizes a noun, no sex"" or ""someone who never has sex"".
1. You said that the two were incomparable because one has an ""ist"" and the other an ""al"" suffix. You said the al suffix doesn't mean ""kind of person"" but characterized by, turning all words ending with al into adjectives.
1. I refuted saying asexual is a noun on wikipedia and various sources
1. You stated that you never said asexual wasn't a noun but that if it were used as one, it implies the word ""person"" after it, making it either an adjective or a noun that requires another noun.
1. I then said that you should find me another noun that requires a noun after it or admit it could be a noun on its own.
1. Because there is no noun like that, I went back to comparing atheist with asexual, resurfacing that asexu-al ""someone who never has sex"" would clash with the mass-accepted definition of an a-sexual ""someone who lacks sexuality"".
1. Therefore, because the noun asexual is a person who lacks sexuality, an atheist lacks belief in god.


--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-30 05:52:54 :

&gt;Your assertion that agnostic atheists aren't science backed because they believe they can disprove every last unevidenced, unfalsifiable god

I never asserted that.  I told you to stop ascribing points of view to me that I've never said.

&gt;First you asserted that an atheist is one that believes in no gods.

Generally, that's how people use it, yeah.  Especially when they're contrasting it with agnostic, which is what's going on with this post.

&gt;I then stated an atheist is like an asexual in that one lacks a sexuality and one lacks a belief in god. **I successfully proved** that reading asexual like you were reading atheist (believer, lacking gods) wouldn't make sense for the undisputed definition of asexual, which would be read as ""pertains to/characterizes a noun, no sex"" or ""someone who never has sex"".

No, you didn't.

&gt;You said that the two were incomparable because one has an ""ist"" and the other an ""al"" suffix. You said the al suffix doesn't mean ""kind of person"" but characterized by, turning all words ending with al into adjectives.


&gt;I refuted saying asexual is a noun on wikipedia and various sources

You didn't refute anything.  ""al"" or ""ual"" does not inherently mean ""type of person.""  Does ""factual"" mean ""fact-type person""?  Does ""residual"" mean ""residing-type person""?  Does ""visual"" mean ""vision-type person""?  No, no, and no.

&gt;I then said that you should find me another noun that requires a noun after it or admit it could be a noun on its own.
Because there is no noun like that

There actually are; I just felt we were getting far off-topic.  But since you insist, ""Chinese"" is another example.  It's an adjective, but can be used as a noun with an implied ""person"" after it.  

&gt;Therefore, because the noun asexual is a person who lacks sexuality, an atheist lacks belief in god.

There is absolutely no logical connection between your premise and your conclusion.  

Do you just not believe that words can have the suffix modifying the prefix? Have you forgotten how much I've gone over the word ""asexualize"" with you and shown what it would mean if the prefix was modifying everything after it, instead of the suffix modifying everything before it?  Would you like some other examples.


Actually, just answer this for me: do you believe that, in every instance, putting the prefix ""a-"" before a {word} results in something that means ""lack of {word}"" or ""lacking in {word}""?


--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-30 07:03:12 :

Sorry for the beginning, I thought your view was Lautey's.

&gt;You didn't refute anything. ""al"" or ""ual"" does not inherently mean ""type of person.

It is when referring to the noun asexual. I'm not talking about when it refers to the adjective asexual where it can mean ""description of the subject of a sentence"".

&gt;""Chinese"" is another example

No, when using Chinese as in Chinese man, chinese is an adjective, not a noun. If you used Chinese as in a noun meaning person, it would sound like That is a Chinese: man. The man part would be as though it was the describing the Chinese person. If you used Chinese by itself it would work, like using American by itself.

&gt;There is absolutely no logical connection between your premise and your conclusion.

This is based entirely on you saying that the suffix ""modifies"" the prefix. Um, no. It in no way reconfigures the order that the word's components are read. The suffix is ""al"" which for an asexual, pertains to the word being used as a noun that describes a person's sexuality as lacking one.

Just so you know, you yourself said
&gt;the ""a-"" prefix which as you correctly noted means ""lacking of""

And to elaborate, a prefix can only be attached to a root word like sexuality, theism or normality. Not acorn.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-30 07:09:24 :

&gt;It in no way reconfigures the order that the word's components are read. 

The way they're read has absolutely nothing to do with what modifies what.  Take, for example,the word ""edible""  the ""ible"" is read last but it modifies the part before it.

&gt;And to elaborate, a prefix can only be attached to a root word like sexuality, theism or normality. Not acorn.

So are you answering yes to my question?

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-30 07:20:57 :

Modifies as in changes the ""eat"" to ""able to be eaten""? For asexual it was originally asexuality, which got changed to the character trait asexual. Where's the change in the ""lack of"" part which makes the words atheism and asexuality different because of the 'al'?

And yes adding 'a' to words makes them lack themselves so reveal the trap card please.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-30 07:50:41 :

&gt;Modifies as in changes the ""eat"" to ""able to be eaten""? 

Yes.  The suffix modifies the preceding part of the word.

&gt;For asexual it was originally asexuality, which got changed to the character trait asexual. Where's the change in the ""lack of"" part which makes the words atheism and asexuality different because of the 'al'?

Again, asexual does not mean ""non-sexual.""  If your hypothesis were true, it would.

&gt;And yes adding 'a' to words makes them lack themselves so reveal the trap card please.

Asexualize.  It doesn't mean ""lack of make sexual"" or ""a lack of sexualize.""

Or ascrotal.  Scrotal means ""having to do with the scrotum.""  Ascrotal doesn't mean ""a lack of having to do with the scrotum,"" it means ""having *no* scrotum.""




--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-31 00:55:49 :

&gt;Yes. The suffix modifies the preceding part of the word.

By changing ""eat"" to ""ed"" all it does is make it easier to pronounce. eatable is hard to pronounce, thus it keeps the same meaning but changes spelling. Big deal.

&gt;asexual does not mean ""non-sexual

It depends whether you use it as an adjective. If you did, then it would. Words having multiple contextual meanings.. spooky!

Ascrotal is the same sort of adjective as asexual, it means lack of having a scrotum in the same way asexual means lacking having a sexuality. Asexualize is in the verb form, so of course it doesn't mean ""a lack of sexualize"". It means ""to cause something to have a lack of sexuality"", which I'm sure you'd agree with. The ""lack"" word is still in there and means the same thing, so it was not ""modified"".

Therefore, because the noun asexual is a person who lacks sexuality, an atheist lacks belief in god.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-31 02:54:52 :

&gt; By changing ""eat"" to ""ed"" all it does is make it easier to pronounce. eatable is hard to pronounce, thus it keeps the same meaning but changes spelling. Big deal.

I was talking about the meaning, not the pronunciation.

&gt;It depends whether you use it as an adjective. If you did, then it would. Words having multiple contextual meanings.. spooky!

No, asexual still means asexual, different from non-sexual.  Even as an adjective.

And I was talking about the word asexuali**ize**.  Asexual**ize** does not mean ""lack of sexualize"" or ""a lack of having been sexualized"" or ""a lack of sexualizing"" or anything like that.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-31 03:46:30 :

Does asexual have a verb form and a noun form? If so, what form does it have in the sentence: ""Look at that group of asexuals!"". It is a noun.

&gt;I was talking about the meaning, not the pronunciation.

Tell me the difference between the meaning of the prefix ""in"" and it's meaning in the word ""in""edible. The ""in"" means ""not"" in both cases. It's not modified.

&gt;I was talking about the word asexualiize.

The ""a"" means ""lack of"" in the case of the prefix ""a"" and in the word ""a""sexualize. I sincerely hope that wasn't your point.

&gt;Asexualize does not mean ""lack of sexualize"" or ""a lack of having been sexualized"" or ""a lack of sexualizing"" or anything like that.

↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
(the post that you just replied to)↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
&gt;Asexualize is in the verb form, so of course it doesn't mean ""a lack of sexualize"". It means ""to cause something to have a lack of sexuality"", which I'm sure you'd agree with.

Oh look, you agreed with me on that, asexualize. Because it's a verb it means ""to cause something"".

Therefore, because the **noun** asexual is a person who lacks sexuality, an atheist lacks belief in god.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-31 03:58:39 :

&gt;Tell me the difference between the meaning of the prefix ""in"" and it's meaning in the word ""in""edible. The ""in"" means ""not"" in both cases. It's not modified.

Yes, but you'll notice that inedible is a different word from edible.  I was using edible of an example of a word showing that a suffix can modify everything before it.  Which it does.

&gt;Oh look, you agreed with me on that, asexualize. Because it's a verb it means ""to cause something"".

This is exactly my point.  That the suffix ""ize"" meaning ""to cause to be"" is **modifying everything before it, making it ""to cause to be asexual.""  **If**, as you asserted without any proof, it was *always* that the prefix modified eveything after it, then ""asexualize"" would mean ""a lack of sexualize.""  **It doesn't mean that**.  Therefore, your assertion was wrong.

To put it another way.  Asexualize has the components ""a-"" meaning ""lack of"", ""sexual"", and ""-ize"" meaning ""to render,"" or ""to cause to be.  Putting the components together, you get "" lack of sexual, to cause to be.""  The the ""to cause to be"" part modifies everything before it, making the meaning ""(lack of sexual) to cause to be,"" not ""lack of (sexual, to cause to be),' which it would mean *if your assertion was correct*.


Same thing with the word atheist.  It's components mean ""lack of god, belief in.""  And they can mean ""(lack of god), belief in""  [which would involve the word components coming into effect in the exact same order as they do in the word ""asexualize""], not just ""lack of (god, belief in)"".



--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-31 05:21:31 :

&gt;Putting the components together, you get "" lack of sexual, to cause to be.""

The ize in atheistize (or asexualize) doesn't modify the noun that ""a"" affects, nor is it affected by the prefix. It is simply a suffix which turns that noun into a verb that causes another noun to gain the characteristics of that noun. The ""ist"" or ""al"" make it first a noun, and the ""ize"" applies the properties of that noun to another noun. Without ""ist"" atheist wouldn't be a noun that ""ize"" could be suffixed onto. For example, when reading atheistize, all that happens is the reader saying this.

""*Hm, so I know what atheist means, lack of a god believer! and oh look! ""ize"". That must mean it's causing spongebob to become an atheist!""*

Apparently, the reader was able to read the components of the word atheistize in order of ""first come first served"" and produce the right definition. Now lets read asexualize.

""*Hm, so I know what asexual means, lack of a sex type-person! and oh look! ""ize"". That must mean it's causing spongebob to become an asexual!""*

Your definition of ""modifying it to be"" is therefore warped because ize doesn't change the meaning of the word it attaches to by changing the order that it's read.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-07-31 06:06:32 :

&gt;  It is simply a suffix which turns that noun into a verb that causes another noun to gain the characteristics of that noun. 

It turns the whole word, including the ""a-"" into a verb.  Thus, modifies it.

&gt;atheistize

Again, this is an instance of it modifying everything before it, making it all into a verb.

&gt;""Hm, so I know what asexual means, lack of a sex type-person! and oh look! ""ize"". That must mean it's causing spongebob to become an asexual!""

This is completely agreeing with what I initially said about the word atheism.  You start with ""a-theos"" (meaning lack of god), then you add the ""ism"" (meaning belief or philosophy), and you get the philosophy of or belief in a lack of a god.



--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-07-31 23:43:26 :

&gt;making it all into a verb.

It turns it into a verb, but doesn't change the meaning of the root, atheist. It turns atheist into an action, but doesn't change atheist to mean something else. You are extremely off the radar in your use of the word ""modifying"". You mean something like the word ""amending"" or ""adding on"".

&gt;You start with ""a-theos"" (meaning lack of god)

Wrong, a theos doesn't mean anything on it's own. It's simply ""a"".

&gt;, then you add the ""ism"" (meaning belief or philosophy)

You split up the word wrong.

&gt;, and you get the philosophy of or belief in a lack of a god.

Wrong. You get the lack of a god-belief.

The ""a"" modifies the noun after it to mean ""lack of that noun"", the ""ist"" modifies the type of noun it is. ""ize"" Does not modify the noun at all.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-01 01:47:47 :

&gt;You split up the word wrong.

&gt;You split up the word wrong.

I get that these are your conclusion, but where's your reasoning?  If you split up the word atheism in the *Exact same way* you split up the word asexualize, you get one which means ""belief in the lack of a god.""

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-01 03:32:38 :

Quoting me twice now? Don't want to go on? Haha.

I already told you my reasoning in the last line of my previous comment. Your proposal of ""ize"" is pointless because [it adds onto the word, doesn't modify it or change the noun's meaning like ""a"" does.](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/-ize) Note how it says it's added on to nouns.


&gt;If you split up the word atheis[t] in the Exact same way you split up the word asexual, you get one which means ""belie[ver] in the lack of a god."" (Sorry for editing it to make it have comparable words. asexualize and atheism aren't comparable.)

Ok, here's me spltting up those words in the exact same way. If I split up asexual I'd get ""lack of a sex-type person"", not ""a person who has no sex"". The ""al"" does not get to be the noun ""a person"" and then the adjective of ""sex"" at the same time, hence it's not ""a person who has no sexuality"" (which would make sense). Atheist works the same way if it worked like that ""a believer who has no theism"". Funny that it sounds like an extremely strange message because belief is usually associated with god, but this time the believer has no concept of god. Not a ""believer in lack of god"".

Aside from my rambling here is what I wrote 2 posts ago where I split up the words in the same way and got the correct definition of asexual, implying my definition of atheist is correct.

Atheist means, lack of a god believer!
Asexual means, lack of a sex type-person!

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-01 06:59:26 :

&gt;  Your proposal of ""ize"" is pointless because it adds onto the word, doesn't modify it or change the noun's meaning like ""a"" does.

""Ize"" is the parallel of ""ism"".  It changes the word by making it into a verb, just like ""ism"" changes the word by making it into a belief.

&gt; (Sorry for editing it to make it have comparable words. asexualize and atheism aren't comparable.)

They're completely comparable.   I showed you the parallel between them.

&gt;Atheist means, lack of a god believer!

I agree.  It means ""(lack of god) believer.""

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-01 19:38:48 :

&gt;""Ize"" is the parallel of ""ism"". It changes the word by making it into a verb

Changes what word, exactly? Athe into Atheize? Ize is an addition, ism is needed for Athe to exist in an english word.

&gt;I agree. It means ""(lack of god) believer.""

According to you asexual means (lack of sex) person (Note: It can't mean lack of sexual person because the al was used in the ""person"" part. Atheist can be defined as lack of theism believer and I would accept that as a definition, but there you'd be using the ist as both belief ideology and believer at the same time)

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-01 20:41:57 :

&gt;Changes what word, exactly? Athe into Atheize? Ize is an addition, ism is needed for Athe to exist in an english word.

Yes, it's a specific kind of addition called a suffix.  It changes asexual to asexualize.  

&gt;According to you asexual means (lack of sex) person (Note: It can't mean lack of sexual person because the al was used in the ""person"" part. Atheist can be defined as lack of theism believer and I would accept that as a definition, but there you'd be using the ist as both belief ideology and believer at the same time)

First of all, the ""-al"" suffix does not mean ""person.""  It is not used exclusively on words that describe people.  Even the word ""asexual"" isn't only used to describe people.

But *if it did* mean person, then just ""sexual"" would mean ""sex-type person,"" yes?

Atheist means ""lack of god believer.""  Like you just said in your last comment.  And the only way to parse that meaning that makes sense is ""(lack of god) believer"".

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-02 06:36:06 :

&gt;Yes, it's a specific kind of addition called a suffix. It changes asexual to asexualize.

You say all suffixes are equal so why can't ize turn athe into atheize?  Or asex into asexize? It's a specific kind of suffix that is added onto ist and al and doesn't modify the noun. It applies the noun's characteristic onto another noun.

&gt;But if *it did mean person,*

No need for snideness, you already admitted asexual can be a noun

&gt;then just ""sexual"" would mean ""sex-type person,"" yes?

Yes

&gt;Atheist means ""lack of god believer."" Like you just said in your last comment.

Wrong, I said 

&gt;Atheist can be defined as lack of theism believer

Try reading the context too or I won't feel like I'm having a rational debate.

Changing it to a different kind of word, or a different kind of noun, *is* modifying it.

&gt;you already admitted asexual can be a noun

You say that as though I ever claimed it couldn't be.

&gt;Yes (sexual just means sex-type person)

So animals can't have sexual reproduction?  Or you can't have a sexual movie?  Or sexual metaphors?

&gt;Wrong, I said...

Adding ize onto a noun to make it into a verb doesn't change the meaning of the noun. It doesn't have anything to do with changing how the noun itself is interpreted.

&gt;You say that as though I ever claimed it couldn't be.

You said it has an ""implied person"" which makes it an adjective

&gt;So animals can't have sexual reproduction? Or you can't have a sexual movie? Or sexual metaphors?

The al applies the root word into the characterization of a living thing capable of taking on the characteristic. You could call a horse a homosexual.

&gt;This comment, last line.

Note how I said ""lack of a god believer""
The ""a"" separates it so that it isn't (lack of god) but (lack of a) (god believer). I said (lack of theism) believer because then there wouldn't be a need to disprove gods, just an ideology which is possible.  However it breaks the word since 

1. it uses ist as both belief ideology and believer at the same time. 
1. It's read with the a combining with the god

Forget I said that, it's not helping you.

Changing it into a verb is changing it.  It's changing what kind of thing it is from a noun to a verb.

&gt;You said it has an ""implied person"" which makes it an adjective

It has an implied ""person"" at the end when used as a noun.  I never said that it can't be used as a noun.

&gt;The al applies the root word into the characterization of a living thing capable of taking on the characteristic. You could call a horse a homosexual.

Because -al does not mean ""person.""

&gt;Note how I said ""lack of a god believer"" The ""a"" separates it so that it isn't (lack of god) but (lack of a) (god believer). 

That doesn't make any sense.  ""Lack of a (god believer)"" would apply to anyone or anything that doesn't have any god believers to it.  An empty mosque doesn't have any god believers in it.  It has a lack of god believers.  That doesn't make it an atheist building.

It's like the difference between the words ""asexual"" and ""asexuals"". The s makes it plural, but does it change the meaning?

Al means person in the way that you wouldn't call a cactus an ""atheist cactus"". Generally, characteristics apply to people.

So a theist building is a building with theists in it? You're losing me. The reason I put ""a"" in there was to put more distance between lack of and theist, so you'd see how the prefix works. You can't say (lack god) (of a believer).

That's not true.  You can an asexual plant.  You can have homosexual penguins.  Characteristics apply to lots of non-human things.

&gt;So a theist building is a building with theists in it? You're losing me. 

If ""atheist"" mean ""a lack of theists"", then yes it would.  But it doesn't.  Therefore, atheist does not mean ""a lack of theists.""

&gt;You can't say (lack god) (of a believer).

""Of a believer""?  Do you mean ""(lack of god), a believer of""?



--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-03 08:14:18 :

&gt;Yes, slightly

So you think the ""suffix modifies the prefix"", and that the word can be read thinking (the plural of) (asexual).

Is this the same as taking the ""al"" suffix and reading the word thinking (the plural of) (a person) (who lacks sex). Because that's what you've done with atheist.

&gt;(lack of god), a believer of""

That sounds equally bad as (lack god) (of a believer) when compared to (lack of a) god believer.

&gt;Characteristics apply to lots of non-human things.

You could apply sexist to a chicken too. Note the ist. Generally, characterizations apply to humans but its not set in stone. However it is implied enough that we made ""al"" words into nouns to call people.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-03 09:01:18 :

&gt; So you think the ""suffix modifies the prefix"", and that the word can be read thinking (the plural of) (asexual).

You're referring to the word ""asexuals,"" yes?  Yeah, that would be how you read it.

&gt;Is this the same as taking the ""al"" suffix and reading the word thinking (the plural of) (a person) (who lacks sex). Because that's what you've done with atheist.

Not really, because the ""-al"" suffix does not mean ""person"".

&gt;That sounds equally bad as (lack god) (of a believer) when compared to (lack of a) god believer.

No, it really doesn't.  Especially since no part of the word means (of a believer).  You could make an argument for ""believer of,"" but where do you get ""of a believer""?  And again, ""lack of a (god believer)"" would be a meaning used to describe an empty church.

&gt;However it is implied enough that we made ""al"" words into nouns to call people.

Not as a rule, no.  Some words ending in ""al"" (for example, ""residual"") are never used to refer to people when used as a noun.


--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-03 10:22:13 :

&gt;""-al"" suffix does not mean ""person""

Now we're down to ""is asexual a noun that means a type of person?""

You agreed it was a noun.

Now I'm arguing it's generally applied to a person in its usage as a noun. It has the same applicability to a person as the ""ist"" suffix, because a chicken can be a sexist and discriminate based on sex of other chickens. A church shouldnt be characterized and called an al or ist because it doesn't pertain to any characteristic capable of belonging to a church.

&gt;where do you get ""of a believer""

I just found it funny that you think a lack of a belief can belong to a believer.

&gt;Some words ending in ""al"" (for example, ""residual"") are never used to refer to people when used as a noun.

Yes there's no rule saying the nouns with ""al"" are only people. However the al word has to pertain to a characteristic. I can only guess it was sarcasm when creating the word residual, because it implies the inanimate object ""stayed when it was supposed to leave"" which is actually suited more towards people. People (aboriginals, cardinals, corporals) could be called residuals.

Sometimes used as a noun.

Yeah, as a noun, asexual is probably most often used to refer to people.  Though I imagine that might change amongst biologists.  That's not all -al words, though.

I've never heard of anyone calling a chicken sexist (let alone ""a sexist"").  -ist can sometimes be used for non-human things, though.  Like, you could say a law is racist, for example.

&gt; I just found it funny that you think a lack of a belief can belong to a believer.

When did I say that? I meant grammatically.  What part of any word do you think means ""of a believer""?

&gt;Yes there's no rule saying the nouns with ""al"" are only people. However the al word has to pertain to a characteristic.

Yeah, I know.  That's what I was saying from the beginning when you kept insisting that -ual meant a type of person.

&gt;I can only guess it was sarcasm when creating the word residual, because it implies the inanimate object ""stayed when it was supposed to leave"" which is actually suited more towards people. People (aboriginals, cardinals, corporals) could be called residuals.

You're conflating the use of al in adjectives and nouns. You can't say that law is a racist or an asexual. The law was created racist, but doesn't have a characteristic of being racist as an abstract concept not a person.

&gt;What part of any word do you think means ""of a believer""?

The way you split it up was (lack of god) believer, so it's only expected that the believer has chosen to believe in the view (lack of god). In other words, he has it. To me, no one believes in the lack of a view or else children wouldn't be considered atheists because they'd have to adopt a belief about god, which they don't even know about yet, and then decide there isn't one. The default should be ""no belief until supporting evidence has been given"", not ""agnostic until the end of time and god hasn't come about as evidence"". In that way you're likening agnostics to babies who are ignorant of all facts, who are just as agnostic about sheep not eating wolves as a teapot orbiting the sun/believing in god.

&gt;The way you split it up was (lack of god) believer, so it's only expected that the believer has chosen to believe in the view (lack of god). 

I split it up that way because it's three components; ""a-"" means ""lack of"", ""theos"" means ""god,"" and ""-ist"" means ""believer"" (it can also mean other things, like in the word pianist, or specialist, but I don't feel like typing out all its meanings every time, so for our sake we're using the meaning that means adherent or believer).  When put together, they make ""lack of god believer.""  And the only way to parse that that really makes sense is ""(lack of god) believer"", that it to say; believer in the lack of a god.

&gt;In other words, he has it. To me, no one believes in the lack of a view or else children wouldn't be considered atheists because they'd have to adopt a belief about god, which they don't even know about yet, and then decide there isn't one.

Well, not having conceived of a god and specifically believing that no gods exist are two different things.  You certainly can believe in the lack of a thing.  You could believe in the lack of a moon landing for instance; that is a belief.  

&gt;The default should be ""no belief until supporting evidence has been given"", not ""agnostic until the end of time and god hasn't come about as evidence"".

I agree with the first part.  That is the nature of agnosticism.  There is no evidence of the existence of any kind of god, and no evidence of the lack of existence of any kind of god.

&gt;In that way you're likening agnostics to babies who are ignorant of all facts, who are just as agnostic about sheep not eating wolves as a teapot orbiting the sun/believing in god.

I've already asked you to stop ascribing views to me.  Don't say that I'm likening x to y, when it's your opinion; not mine.

rctdbl @ 2013-08-04 01:48:01 :

&gt;the only way to parse that that really makes sense is ""(lack of god) believer"", that it to say; believer in the lack of a god.

This is your opinion, vastly outnumbered by the people who say it is (lack of) (god believer). Ask yourself this. Does Athe exist without us having to add ist onto? No. Does Theist exist without us having to add A onto? Yes. It makes basic sense to have (lack of) as being separate.


&gt;That is the nature of agnosticism [no belief until supporting evidence has been given]

Belief isn't gnosticism. All it requires is at least some supporting evidence. Gnosticism requires absolute knowledge and the supporting evidence to the point of science. That's why I would call myself an agnostic atheist. I disbelieve in god because of there not being the smallest piece of evidence. I don't know for sure though, because I can't disprove it.


&gt;your opinion; not mine.

Babies by default have no knowledge whatsoever. They may see a sheep and wolf but not know the wolf eats the sheep. They change their knowledge which heavily impacts their belief when they see evidence of the wolf eating the sheep. However because they don't know for sure that sheep don't eat wolves, they can't be an ""A-sheepdon'teatwolves-ist"", because then they'd have to disprove that in 100% of cases, sheep won't eat wolves. Even though they have no evidence for a sheep eating a wolf, the baby realizes there's no reason to act like they are completely evidence-less and agnostic, and addresses their lack of belief that a sheep will eat a wolf. However you won't let me say that because though there's no evidence of a god existing, I can't disbelieve in god.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-04 02:09:01 :

&gt;This is your opinion, vastly outnumbered by the people who say it is (lack of) (god believer).

Again, empty church.

And no, I'm not ""vastly outnumbered"".  Didn't you say something earlier about statements made without any evidence?

&gt;Ask yourself this. Does Athe exist without us having to add ist onto? No. Does Theist exist without us having to add A onto? Yes. It makes basic sense to have (lack of) as being separate.

First of all, without the -ist, it would be [atheos](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atheos].  The ""os"" from theos is dropped when you add ""ist"" or ""ism"" to the end.  

Second, the basic premise of this argument is wrong.  There are lots of words where you can drop part of them and remainder doesn't make a common word.  Like, if you drop the -ual, from pansexual, you get pansex, which isn't a word.  But it's components' meanings (""all sexes"") are still part of the word pansexual.

&gt;Belief isn't gnosticism. All it requires is at least some supporting evidence. Gnosticism requires absolute knowledge and the supporting evidence to the point of science. That's why I would call myself an agnostic atheist. I disbelieve in god because of there not being the smallest piece of evidence. I don't know for sure though, because I can't disprove it.

By that definition, every single person on Earth would be agnostic, since nobody really has evidence and knows either way.

&gt;Babies by default have no knowledge whatsoever. They may see a sheep and wolf but not know the wolf eats the sheep. They change their knowledge which heavily impacts their belief when they see evidence of the wolf eating the sheep. However because they don't know for sure that sheep don't eat wolves, they can't be an ""A-sheepdon'teatwolves-ist"", because then they'd have to disprove that in 100% of cases, sheep won't eat wolves. Even though they have no evidence for a sheep eating a wolf, the baby realizes there's no reason to act like they are completely agnostic, without addressing their lack of belief that a sheep will eat a wolf. 

See?  Was it so hard to present your own opinion as your own opinion, instead of ascribing it to me?

First of all, you don't have to have complete, incontrovertible evidence against X to be an a-X-ist; you just need to believe in the lack of X.  

Second, you use the examples of wolf eating sheep (I'm not sure why you think a baby would be watching that), because we know quite well that the opposite doesn't happen.  You could just have easily made the same argument with sharks and humans.  

You might see a shark eating a human and assume that humans never eat sharks.  Even though the latter happens millions of times more often than the former.

Everyone is on topics that don't have irrefutable evidence backing it up. That's why I said I'm an agnostic-type atheist. And why agnostic by itself (without being an adjective) means you don't believe anything even outside of the god debate.

&gt;you don't have to have complete, incontrovertible evidence against X to be an a-X-ist; you just need to believe in the lack of X.

Pretty sure you said ""Atheists believe no gods exist"", therefore you imply an atheist needs at least some evidence to disprove god. As an atheist, all I have is disproving how god affects me in everyday life or in historical events from the bible. A ""universe starter"" god is one I lack belief in but can't prove.

Generally, it doesn't mean that.  It means someone who doesn't believe in god and doesn't believe that no gods exist either.  And that's *clearly* how Lawtey meant it in this post.

As an atheist, all I have is disproving how god affects me in everyday life or in historical events from the bible. A ""universe starter"" god is one I lack belief in but can't prove. 

There are lots of different concepts for what a god (or goddess or gods and goddesses) could be.  By restricting it to a god that would be interested in and capable of affecting your life in perceptible ways, you're putting unnecessary restrictions on the concept. 

Yes, that is what I said atheists believe.  But that's not really related to proof; it's related to belief.

&gt;In the context of a shark and a drowning human in the sea, who gets eaten? Also, before you ridiculously switched the hypothetical, sheep don't order wolf meat to eat in restaurants. 

No, sheep don't.  The point I was making is that in your one specific example of sheep and wolves, you can assume that if you see  eating Y then you can assume that Y doesn't eat X (because it happens to be true for those two animals).  But in general, it's not a safe assumption to make.

rctdbl @ 2013-08-04 03:27:08 :

Atheos is a latin word. It doesn't exist in english except meaning atheist. It makes basic sense saying atheist means (lack of) (god believer). I'm not cutting off the suffix, you were the one to say Athe is word when moving the ist to mean (believer) (lack of god).

&gt;you're putting unnecessary restrictions on the concept.

The concept of theism means ""God is the creator and sustainer of the universe"". I disbelieve that ""god"" must be a single entity and that this entity sustains the universe, although it may have created it somehow. Thus I don't fit with the most basic definition of theism. Deism is the concept that god is the creator and lives invisible to us.

In general, it is a safe assumption to make that refuting the likelihood of something being able to exist, with the masses of scholars over the ages not producing a single piece of evidence, means it doesn't. Like Russell's teapot.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-04 04:03:28 :

Atheos means ""lack of god"", not atheist.

I never said ""athe"" is a word.  Stop attributing things to me that I never said.  I said ""atheos"" is a word, which it is.  And I said it means ""(lack of god), believer"", not ""(believer) (lack of god)"".  I don't understand why you're having so much trouble accurately describing my position.

&gt;The concept of theism means ""God is the creator and sustainer of the universe"". 

No, it means belief in god.  Nowhere does ""creator and sustainer of the universe"" appear in any part of the world.

&gt;Thus I don't fit with the most basic definition of theism. Deism is the concept that god is the creator and lives invisible to us.

Yes, I recall this concept.  I believe it's often referred to as the ""clock-maker"" belief in god.

&gt;In general, it is a safe assumption to make that refuting the likelihood of something being able to exist, with the masses of scholars over the ages not producing a single piece of evidence, means it doesn't. Like Russell's teapot.

I'm glad you brought up Russell's teapot (not just because all this grammar stuff is getting super tedious and off-topic).

It's an interesting example, that I've been thinking about lately.  I mean obviously it would be ridiculous to assume that there is a teapot floating somewhere between Earth and Mars.  Usually, it's accompanied with the conclusion ""If you can't prove something exists, you should just assume that it doesn't,"" or something along those lines.

But the thing about the teapot example is that it's an example of something in a category (man-made objects in space) which we happen to know a great deal about.  We know that there are only a handful of man-made objects have left Earth's orbit.  We also know that launching objects into space is incredibly expensive and that no documented space-launch included a teapot as cargo.  Now, none of these prove 100% beyond-a-doubt that the teapot doesn't exist, but we have information suggesting that it doesn't.

On the opposite of that, consider this conjecture: there exists at least one bit of rock in Uranus' rings that is smaller than a basketball and concave in shape.  Much like Russell's teapot, it makes a proposition about something that we don't know for sure, and about something that we have some knowledge about; rock formation and Uranus' rings.  We know that the rings are generally made of macroscopic dust and rock bits.  And we know that rocks (especially in the absence of flowing water) tend to form in irregular shapes, often concave.  Based on the information we know, we can conclude that it's probable that the statement probably is true, even though we don't have any direct proof of it.

The moral of the story: you shouldn't just assume that something doesn't exist, just because you don't have proof; you should go off of what information we do have and make the best guess you can.

So how does this apply to the existence of god?  Does our information mostly suggest that a god exists?  Or does it mostly suggest that no gods exist.  The answer is neither.  We have no evidence to look at with this matter.  The idea is so far outside human understanding that we can't provide any evidence one way or another.  We can come up with evidence about the claims of specific religions (like Christianity and Evolution, the age of the Earth, etc.) but not about the concept of a god existing at all.

In this sense, the idea of a god is more like parallel universes; something theorized but not directly or indirectly observable or measurable.

Enough information to make us not believe the teapot exists. However because no one disproved that some billionaire bought a spaceship and did it secretly, I will remain agnostic about it. The teapot analogy was about belief, not knowing for sure.

&gt;Uranus concave rock

Believing in the existence of a kind of rock that we've never seen personally but have evidence for ones similar to it isn't as far fetched as Russell's Teapot because it's actually more probable than not. I'm pretty sure I'm going to keep breathing the next hour, and one time the exhale will last 3 seconds. That doesn't relate to the Teapot analogy.

&gt;No, it means belief in god. Nowhere does ""creator and sustainer of the universe"" appear in any part of the world.

[I got that quote from here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)

&gt;Does our information mostly suggest that a god exists? Or does it mostly suggest that no gods exist. The answer is neither

Russell's Teapot says otherwise, there are no ""similar rock formations"" or probable cause of some sort. 

&gt;the idea of a god is more like parallel universes

Right, deism not theism. Theism is the human interaction god. But even in the most basic sense of god belief, it's questionable whether there's evidence of [nothing existing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing#Physics), so god might not have created the world but just set off the big bang.

This page seems to be way off.  First of all, it's not even Latin; it's Greek.  The Latin word for god is ""Deus"", the Greek is Theos.  And ""a-"" meaning ""without"" is also of Greek origins.


&gt;Enough information to make us not believe the teapot exists. However because no one disproved that some billionaire bought a spaceship and did it secretly, I will remain agnostic about it. The teapot analogy was about belief, not knowing for sure.

Do you honestly believe that or are you just making another Strawman?

&gt;Believing in the existence of a kind of rock that we've never seen personally but have evidence for ones similar to it isn't as far fetched as Russell's Teapot because it's actually more probable than not. 

Yes, that's exactly the point I was making.

&gt;I got that quote from here. [Wikipedia for ""god""]

Notice how there's no citation for it.

&gt;Russell's Teapot says otherwise

Russell's Teapot is an analogy about burden of proof.  And I've just spent the last comment explaining how it doesn't really tell us anything about the existence of non-existence of a god.

&gt;there's no evidence of nothing existing[3] , so god couldn't have created the world from nothing.

The conclusion does not follow from the premise.

&gt;Thus there are no ""similar rock formations"".

I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  I never said the phrase ""similar rock formations.""  Are you quoting from something else?

&gt;Right, deism not theism. When you say theism people assume you mean a human interactive god.

Interactive, like how?  Omnipresent in everyone's life in a noticeable and measurable way?  Or just doing some stuff in the universe after its creation?

rctdbl @ 2013-08-04 07:34:55 :

The very page you linked said it was derived from Greek and exists in Latin. Atheos doesn't mean lack of god, it means lack of god believer. Athe doesn't exist in English, therefore the A is separate. Stop disputing this until you give me a definition of Athe in an english dictionary.

&gt;Notice how there's no citation for it.

You quoted wikipedia for your definition of atheos, why can't I? Besides, deism perfectly describes god belief in the unfalsifiable sense you want. Just your whole argument that ""atheism means you can't believe in something that has no information"" falls apart.

&gt;Strawman

Nope I'm actually agnostic about many things. It actually takes more effort to have a gnostic view for me.

&gt;And I've just spent the last comment explaining how it doesn't really tell us anything about the existence of non-existence of a god.

You said we shouldn't believe the teapot can't exist. Until I see some evidence it does, I'm disbelieving. However I will remain agnostic since I dont know for sure. It's not rocket science.

&gt;Similar rock formations

We have no evidence of gods existing that could point to ""the actual god"" existing. Same concept as rock formations leading to the possibility of a concave rock on Jupiter in your example.

kabukistar @ 2013-08-04 07:46:02 :

&gt;Atheos doesn't mean lack of god, it means lack of god believer. 

No part of the word means ""believer"".  A- means lack of, and theos means god.  And that's the whole word.

Why do you keep quoting things that I've never said?

&gt;You said we shouldn't believe the teapot can't exist. Until I see some evidence it does, I'm disbelieving. 

Seriously?  Is that what you think I said?   Did you literally read my last comment and see me say that anywhere?  Or did you just imagine me saying that?

I said that we should believe that the teapot doesn't exist **because we have evidence against it**.  Where-as with the small rocks in Uranus' rings we should believe they do exist **because we have evidence for it.**  

&gt;We have no evidence of gods existing that could point to ""the actual god"" existing. Same concept as rock formations leading to the possibility of a concave rock on Jupiter in your example.

Jupiter?  Who's talking about Jupiter?

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-04 16:58:43 :

You're going to avoid my point because I forgot it was not Uranus but Jupiter? Ridiculous strawman.

Since you identify theism as deism, we're done here.

Since you see athe as somehow a word existing in the English language on it's own, we're done here. Good luck trying to convert agnostic atheists to agnostics in the future. It's been fun.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-04 19:15:09 :

Jupiter doesn't have rings.  Uranus does.  The proposition is a lot less plausible if it's about Jupiter. 

I'm also getting really tired of having to tell you ""don't attribute opinions to me"" when you make up some opinion for me that I never expressed, which has been incessantly.

Now that I've explained that having a belief doesn't need 100% proof of evidence but probability, I'm actually done now.

Because you couldn't find a definition of Athe, you're the one incessantly claiming Atheist can split up into Athe and ist. I don't see how I attributed any of my own opinions here and you never say ""which opinion I've attributed to you"", making you the incessant, tedious one. Learn how to carry a debate please.

The difference between these two is that there is evidence pointing *against* there being a teapot between Mars' and Earth's orbits.  

&gt;Now that I've explained that having a belief doesn't need 100% proof of evidence but probability, I'm actually done now.

Belief doesn't technically need either.  There's no probable evidence supporting the Christian narrative of world creation, but Christians still believe it.

&gt;I don't see how I attributed any of my own opinions here and you never say ""which opinion I've attributed to you"", making you the incessant, tedious one. Learn how to carry a debate please.

Well here's the newest example.  You same I'm ""incessantly"" claiming that Atheist can be split up into ""athe"" and ""ist,""  but I never said ""athe"" was a word.  I've said from the beginning that if you take off the ""ist"", you get ""atheos,"" meaning lack of a god.

--------------------------------

rctdbl @ 2013-08-04 21:46:26 :

There's evidence pointing against the human interactive god as described in theism. For deism, there's no evidence pointing against it but that still doesn't make it probable enough to hold belief in my opinion. Being an agnostic atheist over an adeist is even more logical, considering you accept atheism as ""lack of belief for a currently existing god"".

&gt;I've said from the beginning that if you take off the ""ist"", you get ""atheos,"" meaning lack of a god.

I'm afraid ""lack of god"" still isn't an English root word, noun, adjective, verb, prefix or suffix. It does not constitute something that you can group together when taking apart a word, rather it's the combination of a prefix and a root. The prefix detaches from the root word, the suffix ist attaches onto the root word forming a word that the prefix can ""modify"", theist. Ist can't modify the meaning of Athe, because athe isn't a root word. 

If you find this too tedious let's agree to disagree.

--------------------------------

kabukistar @ 2013-08-04 22:04:55 :

&gt;There's evidence pointing against the human interactive god as described in theism. 

What evidence would that be?

&gt;considering you accept atheism as ""lack of belief for a currently existing god"".

How many times are you going to accuse me of agreeing to, saying, or believing something which I don't?

&gt;I'm afraid ""lack of god"" still isn't an English root word, noun, adjective, verb, prefix or suffix.

No, it's two roots.  ""Theos"" meaning god, with ""a-"" meaning lack of make ""atheos,"" lack of a god.

&gt; Ist can't modify the meaning of Athe, because athe isn't a root word. 

Atheos, not athe.  And it's two roots put together.  That doesn't make it unusable as a grammatical building block.

&gt;If you find this too tedious let's agree to disagree.

It would be far less tedious if I didn't have to keep telling you to stop mis-attributing points of view to me.  I realize you can't go back and change that now, but keep it in mind for the next time you're in one of these situations.

--------------------------------

I mean this in the hypothetical that we were discussing atheism from a view that it means (lack of) (theism). 

&gt;That doesn't make it unusable as a grammatical building block.

Give me an example of another word. Oh wait we already went over asexual and how it doesn't mean a person who has a lack of sex. Applying ist to a ""two roots put together"" type word just doesn't work. I personally think that it's because the ""a"" is read before the theist.

Gotcha.  From your wording, I interpreted it as you saying that I believed that.

Homosexual also works.  As you probably know, homo- means same (as in homogenous or homo sapiens).  Sex is the root word, and it has a suffix and a prefix (much like the word atheist).  If you take off the the suffix, you get the non-word homosex (which would mean ""same sex"" based on its components).  In parallel, if you take the suffix off of atheist, you get atheos (which would mean ""lack of god,"" based on its components).  
""Same sex"" is part of the meaning of the whole word ""homosexual"" and ""lack of god"" is part of the meaning pf the whole word ""atheist""."

First of all there hasnt been enough to time to create huge disparities like you claim exist.

Iq is not a test on ""smartness"". It tries to be but fails. It also favors western academics.

Most experts will agree intelligence is environmental.  All humans have is our brain and dumb people would not survive.

Black people here were ENSLAVED and abuses for literally over 400 years.  This has lasting effects. Do you think you would be so smart and wise if you were born to a 15 y/o crackhead? No? Well stop arguing. 

Western societies werent all prosperous all the time. It wasnt as simple as you make it. As others have said, agriculture doesnt require you to be super smart. Its just remembering facts. There are so many problems witb your argument Im going to stop myself before I develop carpel tunnel.

The reason whites people run the world is because of gun powder and horses (luck). Not some special genes that make them smarter.

"	0	0	stop arguing comment					"Who am I: a high IQ (over 130, tested when I was a kid) African American in a technical field, posting this on reddit because I need to get this off my chest and there is NOBODY I would dare discuss this with in person.

Why do I hold this view: I try to make an honest effort to know what I am talking about. I previously held the opposite belief, and I had read up on the subject wanting to be better able to defend my views. I came away with the opposite conclusion. Here is why:

1) IQ is a reasonable quantification of, if not your preferred definition of ""intelligence"", then certainly what most people would call being smart. A person's IQ score is correlated with the type of life outcomes we would expect smartness to be correlated with, such as success in certain pursuits, lower likelihood of prison, and so on.

2) The relative average performance of the various racial and ethnic groups is in line with what your average klan member would have predicted, and has been extensively documented. 

3) The differences have not been mitigated by attempts to control for environmental variables such as, controling for household income, twin adoption studies, trans racial adoption studies. 

4) Serious academics risk their reputations by discussing racial differences, are especially reluctant to discuss differences in intelligence, and often have ideological reasons not to draw certain conclusions. 

5) The hypothesis described in [""Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence#.22Natural_History_of_Ashkenazi_Intelligence.22)  seems plausible, and an adapted version could be proposed to apply universally: that in a civilized society, there are opportunities for the intelligent to be more socially and reproductively successful than they might have been in a hunter-gatherer society, placing a selective pressure on intelligence. 

I don't feel that we can know what the relative intelligence of the races were prior to the advent of civilization, when they were all hunter gatherers. 

But, with respect to current populations, those that score the lowest are from groups that were late adopters of civilized society, such as Sub-Saharan Africans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.

In conclusion, I believe that when it comes to stereotypes about intelligence, where there is smoke there is fire (perhaps making an exception for the Polish). 

I would prefer that the facts not support this view, but I currently believe that they do. CMV.

UPDATE: Many contributors have discussed the IQ disparity between American Blacks and Whites, and the existence of socioeconomic factors that may explain the disparity. 

I acknowledge that this is an excellent point, but would like to point out that IQ disparities exist between groups without the unique set of circumstances that exists between American Blacks and Whites. If other ethnic/racial groups can be acknowledged in the discussion I would appreciate it.

UPDATE: I have been convinced that the jury is still out. May be true, may not be, but too early to be firm.

&amp;#8710; to /u/problygonnaregrethis

&gt; The best form of evidence would likely be precise genome mapping, in which we can both identify the direct genes that correspond to intelligence, determine that these genes are substantially more impactful than environmental, neonatal, or cultural factors, and prove that these genes fall heavily on racial and ethnic lines.
More importantly though, keep in mind that with the scientific method, the burden of proof falls on the claim. If it were theoretically impossible to ever have the evidence to make these conclusions, that doesn't mean we just default to ""Well, close enough"", it means we say ""The evidence is not there to make these conclusions, and the evidence may well be impossible because these conclusions are too broad, complex, and sweeping to ever fully prove; as such, we default to ""unproven""."	"Amarkov @ 2013-08-19 22:29:42 :

Sub-Saharan Africans and Native Americans were not late adopters of civilized society. They both had many advanced civilizations. They just didn't have guns, so white people with guns came and destroyed their civilizations.

Thanks for responding, I appreciate your voice. However, I disagree with your statement. If you have the time, I think you might also disagree after looking up the following:

Around what year was agriculture practiced in:
1. The Middle East

2. Western Europe

3. China

4. Sub Saharan Africa

5. Central America

6. North America

--------------------------------

Amarkov @ 2013-08-19 22:44:03 :

The Middle East, China, and Central America developed agriculture around 8000 BCE. I don't know about sub-Saharan Africa or North America, but Western Europe didn't start agriculture until about 5000 BCE. So I'm not sure how you think this would make me agree with you.

It's not like this is surprising. Until the Industrial Revolution, most of western Europe was an undeveloped backwater. People would have laughed in your face if you told them that England was going to be some sort of major power.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2013-08-19 23:11:51 :

I just looked up agriculture in the Americas, and I see that with potatoes it may have started as early 10,000 years ago. I had been specifically thinking of maize, which had a greater social impact, and started later.

In any event, the point was that complex agricultural society was not nearly as widespread in the Americas as it was in, say Europe or East Asia. I think you would agree on that.

--------------------------------

MonkeyButlers @ 2013-08-19 23:16:30 :

Are you trying to say that agriculture was a result of higher intelligence or that higher intelligence is a result of agriculture?  This first is false for a lot of reasons that I'd like to talk about, but if you're saying the second, I don't want to waste your time.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2013-08-19 23:19:45 :

The second. 

Just speculation that agriculture --&gt; complex society with opportunities for success in intellectual pursuits --&gt; reproductive success for the more intelligent

--------------------------------

MonkeyButlers @ 2013-08-19 23:45:16 :

Ok, well I only have a couple arguments against that.  First, the time differences mentioned are basically nil on an evolutionary scale.  A couple thousand years is basically nothing when talking about the evolutionary process of our species.  Second, early agriculturalists were actually worse off, health-wise than hunter-gatherers.  They worked longer hours, were less well-fed and as a result, were likely stupider than their hunter-gatherer contemporaries.  Intelligence is heritable to a certain extent, but poor conditions, especially at early ages, can destroy any advantage of genetics.

Third, finally, and most importantly, the evolutionary pressure on agriculturalists to be intelligent is probably less than you imagine.  Being intelligent isn't a great indicator of reproductive success.  We still find attractive the same traits that our early ancestors did, height, strength, symmetrical faces.  Our brains might allow us to see that an smart person is actually a better choice for a mate than a strong, stupid guy, but this certainly isn't always the case.  Intelligence is also highly correlated to mental disorders such as depression, which reduces your chance for reproductive success.  

Even if the intelligent were guaranteed to reproduce, its not like everyone else stopped reproducing as well.  Even if the intelligent were considered ideal mates, the fact that humans are basically monogamous and intelligent people are rare means that everyone else is still going to get to reproduce, and they're going to have to reproduce with less intelligent people.  Without an event to kill off the stupid people, you're back to my first point.  The process of increasing the intelligence of a large population takes too long, if it happens at all.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2013-08-19 23:50:36 :

EDIT: Addressing your points

1) Not enough time for evolutionary effects.

Lactose tolerance in adults and blond hair are two examples of now widespread traits that evolved relatively recently. The spread of lactose tolerance in particular was related to agriculture.

2) Members of early agricultural societies were worse off than hunter gatherers.

True for those at the bottom. Not true for all.

3) Intelligence was not strongly correlated with reproductive success.

In modern society, IQ is highly correlated with professional success. I don't think it's a stretch to think that the professionally successful can more easily attract a mate and support a family than the unsuccessful.

&gt; You are choosing to believe as true something for which there is no evidence (an afterlife and whatever other religious claims) . A skeptical person would not ever deliberately do such a thing. This is a very different mindset from your own.

There's no evidence to support a view that there's a racial discrepancy in intelligence.  You claim to have studies that control for every other environmental factor, but when /u/scienceagain asked you to elaborate on them, you shifted the burden of proof to him again.

On the other hand, it's *prima facie* and well supported by facts that race does contribute to modern environmental factors that do contribute to intelligence.  If you want to argue that there's a genetic component to it, the onus is on you to bring some evidence to the table-- otherwise you're just speaking from faith.

[deleted] @ 2013-08-20 00:20:19 :

Sorry if I edited away what you replied to.

&gt; There's no evidence to support a view that there's a racial discrepancy in intelligence.

Yes. There is. IQ tests, SAT tests, ACT test, LSATs. Numerous exams that in some way or another measure a person's ""smartness"" have been administered, and demographic info about the participant recorded. Ethnic disparities exist. This has been EXTENSIVELY documented. The evidence that a disparity exists, is that a disparity exists.

&gt; On the other hand, it's prima facie and well supported by facts that race does contribute to modern environmental factors that do contribute to intelligence.

I won't disagree that the disparity may be multifactorial. However, I am not aware of attempts to control for non-genetic factors that have shown a reductions that would account for the disparities. This includes, to my knowledge, controlling for household income, and twin adoption studies.

&gt; If you want to argue that there's a genetic component to it, the onus is on you to bring some evidence to the table-- otherwise you're just speaking from faith.

IQ scores have a heritable component, this is not in dispute. From wiki, estimates range from .5 to .9 out of a possible 1.0.  I believe that satisfies my onus.

If you can't find meaning in that which is average and boring, then you aren't going to find it anywhere, because even the most exceptional of people are average and boring. They put their pants on one leg at a time just like everybody else does.

Yeh you're right that these exceptional people do the same routines as everyone else such as eating breakfast and dressing up. However, they have additional features as well just as exuberant generosity or an ability to empathize well with everyone they met. 
Furthermore, I think that trying to make something grand out of what is average and boring is just delusional. "

I feel obliged to ask, though, how do you know relate those feelings to one specific animal and not another? It seems to me rather arbitrary to say ""I feel like a wolf"" instead of ""I feel like a dog"" or ""[...] a fox"". Those animals are very similar in most aspects, so relating to one or another seems weird to me.

Either way, most people's point here is that, as long as those feelings don't stop you from living and you can be just fine with them, thus not constituting a mental disorder. I have a few problems with that, as I don't know how much I agree about that definition of mental disorder and how much that simple feeling of inadequacy and not belonging could be considered bad enough of an impact to say you would be better off without them. Either way, I don't think this opinion of mine could be debated very well, and even if it could, would be a whole different CMV, so I think I'll stop arguing here.

For those who aren't familiar with the term, here is [the Wikipedia article on otherkin.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin)

I believe this identification comes from one of two possibilities.

First, it might come from the person actually believing themselves to be non-human, which would be the case of having some kind of mental disorder as, differently from trans* people, identification as human or not doesn't involve any kind of sexual hormones. If the person really believes they share their body with a non-human entity, it would be the case of having a multiple personality disorder.

The second possibility would be that of the person pretending to have that other personality. This would be similar to a child having an imaginary friend and, although mostly harmless, it is nonetheless childish. If the person is faking it, though, it would be similar to a kid who lies about having something that doesn't even exist (""my cousin from japan already got me a PS5!1!!"") in order to try and make themselves special in a group."	"DanielTaylor @ 2013-10-02 10:52:48 :

Hello! I'm the moderator of /r/Therian and would love to answer any questions you have on this subject. So please ask away. 

There's a blurry line between therianthropy and otherkins and one could say that it's basically the same. The only difference is that therians identify exclusively with non-human animals and never with fantasy creatures. Therians are also called ""animal people"". 

Unfortunately I cannot speak for otherkin. I don't know the otherkin community too much and as a Therian I feel a bit confused by the fantasy creatures. It makes little sense to me... although I guess therianthropy makes little sense to other people as well. 

**The big question: Is it real?**

You'd be surprised to know that many therians doubt their experience has a spiritual explanation or something to do with past lives. A growing number of people reason that it could have an unknown psychological or even social origin. 

At this moment it is not known what exactly it is or where it exactly it comes from, but when talking about Therian (or otherkins I guess) one must always keep in mind that these feelings are real. People do really feel that, at least to some degree, they are / identify as non-human. 

To some people certain aspects of human life feel wrong, unnatural, as if it shouldn't be that way. For example walking on two legs. Many therians feel much more comfortable with the idea of quadrupedalism (walking on four legs) and feel it should have been that way. They feel drawn towards it. 

*Therians are basically people who feel drawn to the identity of a non human animal. Not because they fancy that animal or they think it's cool, but because that identity makes them feel comfortable, as if that's the place where they belong.*

**The feelings a Therian experiences are real. It is not known why or where it comes from, but many Therians do really feel this way. So it's not just pretend (except for some teenagers who always happen to stumble upon therian forums after seeing the lastest twilight movies).**

**Second question: What should we do about it?**

To be honest it's probably better if nothing is done about it, and that's where I'll try to change your mind about the ""mental disorder"" solution you proposed. 

First of all, unless he or she tells you, you'll usually never identify a regular Therian in the wild. We lead normal and functional lives, have hopes, dreams, a family, a job, and everything else. It might even be possible that you personally know a therian or an otherkin, but it's very unlikely that they'll tell you unless you have a very close relationship with them. It is also possible that a larger amount of people have experienced, at some point of their lives, something similar and just don't know it has a name or that there's people who talk about these feelings in online forums. 

Fact is, that being a therian doesn't stop you from having a fully functional life. I know therians (including myself) who have been sad, feeling down or even depressed because of this difference between their human bodies and their animal identity. But I'd argue that in 99% of the cases everything turns out fine and we learn to live with it, because we all know that it's impossible to be the way we feel comfortable with.

So, Therianthropy doesn't cause people to have dysfunctional life and I would doubt it being called a disease. *There's nothing wrong with it.* 

If you have any questions about this subject feel free to ask them. I'll try my best to answer and explain anything you might be curious about. 

Thank you!

Otherkin here (fae), part of the Vampire Subculture, and obviously, a throwaway account. 
The way I look at it, identifying with one species and not another is kind of the same way somebody knows if they're gay or straight. You either know you are, or you aren't, but sometimes it takes a bit of introspection. 

On another note, I feel a lot of fear and shame regarding my otherkin identity. The Vampire subculture is out in the open. You can explain that to people. Sure, they might look at you weird, but no one is going to really ostracize you for it. Being otherkin is different. I feel as though if I tell anybody about my identity, I will lose everything. It's not a game to me. Other than being ashamed, because most people hold your view, it doesn't affect my life in any pathological way. I may seem a little quirky or odd, but you wouldn't know I was otherkin unless I told you. If it disabled my life and I insisted you refer to me as a fae (my spiritual identity) while I am clearly physically human, then yes. I would be fine with you considering me mentally ill. But I don't do that. And I don't know any otherkin who do. 

Because all of us, to some level, are afraid of extreme judgement and hatred. We are pretty ashamed of who we are. Or at least I am. I wish I could be normal, but I'm not. I didn't choose this. "

The US flag flew over a nation that accepted slavery as law far longer than the Confederate flag. The US flag was flown by a nation that came close to genocide on the American Indians. 

The Confederate flag was usurped by the KKK and neo Nazi's thusly casting it in a bad light. Were it not for those factors it would, and should, just a display of heritage.

isladelsol @ 2013-10-16 21:04:02 :

&gt;The US flag was flown by a nation that came close to genocide on the American Indians. 

I always see this, and it always pisses me off. First of all, American Indians are not an ethnicity. There were many, many different tribes and nations. Secondly, 92% of Indians died from disease brought over by Europeans, and *not* from American expansion. Thirdly, many of the actual Indian deaths caused by the US were in legitimate, if lopsided war. Finally, there *were* a lot of atrocities committed by US forces (massacres, mostly, in the Northern Great Planes) and even something like genocide in California which was committed by a small number of settlers (supported by government) on a relatively small population of people. 

What I'm getting at is that this is a loaded statement which you've entirely oversimplified. 

&gt;Were it not for those factors it would, and should, just a display of heritage. 

It was a flag used by a breakaway state which existed *specifically* to continue the practice of slavery. Let me say this loud and clear--**the Civil War was about slavery**. Not states' rights (except the right to own slaves), not culture, not pride, not nothing. Slavery. 

&gt;Do you have a problem when a Brit wants to fly the Union Jack in America when we had to fight a war to establish our nation? 

The American Revolution was a just war if there ever was one, and was fought for some significant philosophical reasons. The Civil War was fought mostly to preserve slavery. You cannot draw a comparison between those.

i completely agree... which is why i'm in this thread and kind of trying to break down the arguments.  i'm trying to give the perspective of ""who gives a fucK"" ~ transphobia is a terrible word choice. but this is the word people are using... and since they are using it... you shouldn't care that people call you it because it only gives the name calling people fuel for their fire.  

i want to give the perspective that it doesn't matter if someone calls you transphobic, its a dumb buzz word... just because people are name calling, doesn't mean you have to defend yourself.  and because of this, i think its easier to fight the arguments with the opposite consciousness. 

someone says that JUST not liking someone for being trans is transphobic?  who cares... you know in your mind that you just simply don't want to date a trans person, that you just aren't attracted to them.  so what?  i don't care, you be you.

many of the arguments on this page are about the DEFINITION of the word and nothing else.  two different people talking about two completely different things because they are using the same word.  its childish.  we should grow up and stop arguing about it.  if someone calls you transphobic?  who cares, you know you're not a hateful person... why give the name caller the time of day?

this is what i'm trying to say... don't add fuel to the fire"	1	0	stop arguing comment					"I want to preface by saying that there are many reasons why a person wouldn't want to date a trans that probably don't stem from transphobia:

-They have sexual characteristics you aren't attracted to (eg MtF has a penis, FtM has a vagina)

-They can't have kids (Though its worth noting that MtFs can save sperm)

-You don't find an individual trans person attractive (If you don't find someone attractive, then you're not prejudice for not dating them, however I do think that if you say you won't date trans people because you don't find trans people attractive then there is prejudice there, as you're judging the appearances of all trans people)

-They have a personality or characteristics that you don't like

There are a few more I'm sure but those are the main ones.

I've encountered many people who both would and would not date a transgender person. Take this situation. Lets say there is a beautiful, absolutely gorgeous post-op (meaning shes had operations and hormones to change her physical appearance to that of her preferred gender) girl. Its entirely possible that a trans girl can be absolutely gorgeous, and on top of that look 100% female with her clothes on or off. Now I've met many men who would never date this girl. I could show them a picture of said girl and they would say ""wow nice she is absolutely sexy, 10/10 would tap"". As soon as I say she is transgender, they would say that there is no way they would date or hook up with her. This is the part that I find to be transphobic, and this is no way an unusual response. 

So of course I follow up by asking why they would not date her. They say, because she used to be a guy before. I'll ask why that makes a difference and one common response is that they're not attracted to guys. But she isn't a guy. She is about as much a guy as a piece of paper is a tree. Would you not date a women who used to be utterly unattractive and unappealing? No that probably wouldn't bother you at all as long as she is attractive now and here forward. For all intents and purposes, unless you're giving her surgery you would never even figure out she was ever physically a guy on your own. It's simply completely irrelevant that she is trans. I'd say that the person's discomfort with trans people is  the actual main reason why they would dismiss her completely. Thats not enitrely unexpected though as society is very transphobic and people often make fun of those who date transgender people.

Now one thing that many people argue against me is that ""How could I be transphobic for not wanting to be with someone, I mean, I'm simply not attracted to her because I found out she is trans.If I'm not attracted to her then how is that transphobia, didn't you just say that attraction isn't representative of prejudice?"" But the reality of the situation is that they are attracted to her, they are just uncomfortable with her. That discomfort is transphobia. If that person was fully comfortable with trans people as some people are, I bet they would be perfectly fine with dating them. I've never met a person who I've felt to be open and understanding about transgender people who would also have a problem with dating a post-op transgender person for reasons other than the ones I listed at the beginning.

I've also met people who view this situation as a matter of sexual orientation. i.e. A straight guy may say that his sexual orientation is just cis girls, or a bi person might say that they are only attracted to cis people and so they wouldn't date a trans person. I think the biggest flaw with this is that sexual orientation isn't representative of who you would date. Sexual orientation is representative of who you're attracted to. If you can completely within reason fall in love with a transgender person and spend your whole life with them and never know they're trans, then how can you say that you aren't attracted to them? Even in a situation where you're dating someone for a year and then find out they're trans, its not like your sexual orientation just magically kicked in and made you unattracted to them at that point. If you were in love with them for a year and then suddenly stopped based on a fact about their past, then it's not a matter of sexual orientation.  And I'd bet that if this person was completely not transphobic, he would recognize that it changes absolutely nothing about the relationship and his only beef would be that she kept something so significant about herself from him for so long. (that being said, I'd like to point out that transgender people have a lot of reason to keep the fact that they're trans from people, even people they're dating. Thats a very tricky situation in and of itself though that I'm not going to delve into though)

And one final thing I'd like to make clear, I don't think a person is transphobic for not wanting to date transgender people. I'm saying that in many cases the reason a person wouldn't date a transgender person is transphobic. 
"	"Sharou @ 2013-11-15 15:41:56 :

I think the crux of the matter is that most people don't consider sex change to be really possible. A man will always be a man, just a man with other hormones and a surgically created pussy.

Plus whenever you look at a trans-person, if you know they are a trans-person, you can't avoid seeing who they used to be in the back of your mind. No matter how gorgeous they look now it will be disturbing to have in your mind the idea that this person used to be a man whom you would find it extremely gross to have sex with and in that pretty female face you can kind of make out the face of a man through a small amount of imagination.

I have no problem with this viewpoint. If in your mind you're a woman, fine - enjoy your life as a woman.

What I **do** have a problem with is the narcissistic point of view echoed by the OP (and several other commenters in here) that are accusing me of being a ""transphobe"" for refusing to date a trans person *under any circumstances*.

That's the same as calling me a ""homophobe"" for refusing to date men.

&gt; to you, i'm ugly, to me i'm beautiful...

This has nothing to do with being trans. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

&gt; hmmm to you i'm fat, to me... i'm in shape... i like how i look

This one is a little grey.

If you're fat, you're fat. Just because you ""like how you look"" doesn't make you ""in shape""

&gt; why should i consider your opinion at all?

That's not the issue at hand here. 

OP is accusing people who will never date trans people to be ""transphobic."" I find that comment narcissistic and inflammatory.

princess_ozma @ 2013-11-15 18:54:51 :

ok, whats wrong with being transphobic then?  what OP is trying to describe is that situation when a guy finds a girl attractive, and then after hearing she used to be a guy... is all of a sudden not attracted to her.  that simply the ""thought' of her used to being a boy is enough to make him unattracted to her.  now i will agree that transphobic is a bit strong and carries a lot of baggage... but this is simply OPs argument.  that this situation, in which someone switching there attraction based on this knowledge is transphobic.

now i want to just say there isn't anything wrong with it.  you be you, ill be me.  i think its a bad word to describe the feeling, but if you can come up with a better one, i would love to hear it.  i mean if we can come up with a word that isn't so seemingly *hateful* then it would save a lot of arguments and we could just agree that this is the way the world is instead of pointing fingers and saying ""you're hateful"" for no reason

--------------------------------

boazdm @ 2013-11-15 19:40:52 :

&gt; ok, whats wrong with being transphobic then?

I see transphobia as a parallel to homophobia. It carries connotations of hatred, animosity, and prejudice. It's a negative word.

&gt; someone switching there attraction based on this knowledge is transphobic.

No it's not. 

If I found out that my partner is a convicted felon, that would also change my attraction level. Like I said, I'm attracted to naturally born women - if I find out my partner was not born a woman, my attraction goes away.

Plus there's the whole issue of breach of trust.

&gt; if you can come up with a better one, i would love to hear it

I'm not in the business of inventing words. Maybe a word exists, maybe it doesn't.

Either way, using ""transphobia"" to describe behavior that isn't transphobic does a great disservice to the trans community. It's gotten to a point where I automatically assume ""transphobia"" means ""you have a different viewpoint than I do."""

You're confusing determinism and predeterminism.  The former allows for free will and the latter doesn't.

Thsee brains are shaped according to a person's genotype and how they are raised. A person has no control over either of these. Furthermore, the brains are subject to the Newtonian laws and quantum laws. Neither of these allow free will. Newtonian laws make the mind a deterministic system. The brain uses input to reach decisions in set, chemical ways and translates this to output. Quantum laws merely add chance. But does a dice roll in electrons give a person free will? I say no.	"Amablue @ 2013-11-17 20:08:40 :

What you are saying is that people do what they will, but their will is predetermined, so it's not 'free will'. For it to be free will they would need to 'will what they will', but in a deterministic or probabilistic universe this is impossible. I would say your definitions need adjustment. 

If you believe that people must 'will what they will' for it to be considered free, then I could just use your initial objection to the deterministic universe, and apply it here. That is, if you 'will what you will', where is that initial will coming from? It needs to be willed into being as well. We have an infinite regression here - the definition of free will isn't even really coherent.

Rather, I think free will is a process that we go though. This process in fact: ""The brain uses input to reach decisions in set, chemical ways and translates this to output.""

That process *is* your free will. It's what makes your choices different from, say, a rock rolling down the hill. Both processes are deterministic. But the rock just rolls. Your brain does some sort of computations and runs a decision making process. Now defining exactly what makes your brain different from that rock is a little more tricky.

At some point there is a process that is either deterministic or probabilistic, and that process is the only thing that makes sense to classify as free will. You don't control that process, you *are* that process. 

&gt; Theoretically with enough information your choices can be known before you even make them

I don't think that negates the idea of free will though. Why does free will need to be at odds with predetermination?

If I'm understanding your argument then you're essentially negating the idea of free will to begin with.  But instead of arguing that the *process* is free will, why not just keep them separate and say there's no free will?

&gt; Why does free will need to be at odds with predetermination?

Because you cannot have self-determination when the Self is not involved.  If your thoughts and actions and choices can be determined before you are even consciously aware of making them, then you're merely a witness, not an agent.

&gt; If I'm understanding your argument then you're essentially negating the idea of free will to begin with

I'm not, I'm saying that the the OP's formulation of free will is self contradicting, and that there are alternate definitions that are meaningful that are not internally inconsistent. 

&gt;  But instead of arguing that the process is free will, why not just keep them separate and say there's no free will?

Because the actions I take are different from the actions a rock rolling down the hill takes in important ways, and we can distinguish between the types of actions I take and the types of actions a rock takes.

&gt; Because you cannot have self-determination when the Self is not involved. 

The self is involved: it's part of the universe.

&gt;  If your thoughts and actions and choices can be determined before you are even consciously aware of making them, then you're merely a witness, not an agent.

A choice I made is a choice I made whether or not someone knows I was going to make it. If I watch baby videos of myself even in a universe where we imagine free will existing, I can know what choice that baby in the video is going to make before he makes it. If I go back in time with my time machine, I can watch myself play out the events and I can know what past-me is going to do before I/he does it."	"Amablue @ 2013-11-19 05:54:58 :

Yeah.  My home church always had outreach programs going on year round.  We helped refurbish an assisted living community center.  We maintained public landscaping.  We gathered gifts for our troops.  We collected food and necessary items for the homeless to survive the winter.  We sent untold amounts money to victims of natural disasters and always had one or two people sent to do volunteer work on site at those locales.  We provided after school tutoring. Hosted local AA, NA and GA meetings.  Purchased school supplies for those who couldn't afford it and on and on.  And that was just *one* church with a congregation of only 1,000 or so members.

There's so much more going on behind the scenes regarding what good a church does for it's community.  This is also why it's baffling to me why some people are so adamant about revoking their tax-relief status.  All of that money that would go to the government and be wasted repairing a road that's already been redone twice in the last five years, is instead meticulously spent on projects to benefit the local community by people who have no other reason to improve it other than they genuinely care to do so.

Seriously, I think you have a very incorrect view of history, or just are just making this up whole cloth.

Don't just say ""look at the history"" and then pull whatever conclusion you want out of your hat.  Give me a specific example or two.

&gt; 2) assault rifles kill almost no one compared to pools. most pool deaths are kids taken there by parents.

Yes, but I assumed from the beginning that your view extended to all guns have been arguing against firearms in general this entire time.  This includes handguns and shotguns. 

So unless you are against banning assault rifles but are for banning handguns, it is a moot point.

Also, I mentioned how pools only kill those who choose to use them, while guns kill those who don't choose to engage in gun ownership.  You still haven't addressed that difference.

&gt; 3) lethal guns have been around for almost a millenia and have typically been restricted to elites. Elites in history almost always were much better armed than the populace. 

First, ""millenia"" is plural, ""millenium"" is singular.

Second, the one shot, low accuracy hand cannons don't really count, and you know it.  A bow or melee weapon would likely have been a more effective weapon.  Only with the more advanced muskets of the 17th century do we see anything really comparable to modern day weapons that are effective for defense.

As for only the elites owning guns, what is your point?  Guns were expensive so the poor couldn't generally afford them.  The same is true of books, but that doesn't mean that the elite actively kept people illiterate.

Regardless, I am advocating that both poor *and* elites in the country give up their weapons, so again it is a moot point.

&gt; Examples are endless, but let's use the one people are most familiar with - Weimar Germany. 

This is the worst possible example you could give.  Guns were heavily restricted in Germany in 1920.  However, those restrictions were *relaxed* in 1928 and later in 1938.

**In other words, getting rid of strong gun control corresponded with the rise of Nazi Germany.**

&gt; Besides the US, you will have trouble finding large developed countries who are armed roughly as well as criminals and the police.

So you are admitting that there is little historical evidence to back your claims, after repeatedly telling me that I just needed to ""look at the history""?

&gt; And its a coincidence that their have been not despots in the US since 1789, but despots have been rampant almost everywhere else until Pax Americana.

There is no shortage of despots today, many of them due to (or at least supported by) us.  I also find it funny that you seem to think that the lack of global war in the past 6 decades is somehow due to civilians having guns and not a decimated Europe after WWII and a nuclear stalemate between the major powers.

&gt; Pax American is not something I am defending and the wars mentioned were an attempt to extend western civilization's front linmes against ""Communism.""

Some of them were, but some of them (Iran-Iraq War, Nigerian Civil War, and Sudanese Civil War) weren't.

&gt; Almost anyone but Lincoln would have let the South go. 

Do you seriously believe this?  Was this something you were honestly taught?  

While certainly there were *some* Northerners who were alright with succession, most were not.  Furthermore, there were also Southerners who were against it as well.

&gt; Today, people wouldn't have the fortitude to go shoot their cousins and brothers. Personal manhood and honor are much diluted since that time making armed citizens more of a deterrence than ever.

Once again, you seem to agree with my point that preventing civilians from having guns wouldn't really change anything from a ""protect us from government despots"" point of view.

&gt; Remember, the main threat history shows in rep demos are demagogues and their criminal thugs, not state military organs.

Again, you state things like this but they just aren't true.  The main threats to representative democracies have been external conflicts, economic collapse, or internal corruption.

There is also a reason they call violent overthrows of peaceful governments a ""military coup"", because they are generally done either by the military, with the help of the military, or with a revolutionary army.  They then physically overpower the current government and take control.

Anyways, I think I am going to stop arguing here.  There is no chance that I am going to change your view because you seem to prefer to just make up facts that support your view rather than take the time to actually look into them and make a decision.

Before arguing, let me ask this.  

If I had clear evidence showing that banning assault rifles *did* cause a significant reduction of crime with no apparent increase in governmental abuse, would you change your view?

--------------------------------

z940912 @ 2014-01-14 23:16:42 :

Sure, but you would need a massive longitudinal study going back through generations that contradicts the lessons of history. For instance: The US has been a democratic republic continuously since 1789 - compare that to everyone else and the resultant bloodshed and families destroyed in Europe, Russia, and China.

Also, what government has successfully abused a very well-armed populace with a history of strong civil rights?

--------------------------------

Omega037 @ 2014-01-14 23:43:40 :

&gt; The US has been a democratic republic continuously since 1789 - compare that to everyone else and the resultant bloodshed and families destroyed in Europe, Russia, and China.

Well, much of those issues were due to external conflicts, which aren't really relevant.  Not to mention, this seems to ignore the Civil War and Indian Wars, but I digress.

If you actually look at a list of countries who have banned guns versus those that haven't there really isn't a correlation between removing guns and ""bloodshed and families destroyed.""  Nor between having guns and preventing it.  

Russian citizens had guns during the pogroms and purges, German citizens had guns during the Nazi regime, and Chinese citizens had guns during the Communist revolution.

Alternatively, most countries that have banned guns in the past 50 years have been relatively peaceful and stable.

Beyond this, the whole line of reasoning is flawed.  Governments generally don't just turn on all the people.  The ugly truth is that it is usually the government working with a large amount of the populace who do these things.  Hitler, Stalin, and Mao would have had little power without the support of many people under them, especially those with guns.

Regardless, for this to be an effective argument, you would also need to show that the populace having guns would be a deterrent to the military.

Thus, your view requires two assumptions:

1. If the whole US military suddenly decided to take over the country, that attempt would be successfully deterred by civilians with assault rifles.

2. The removing guns from the populace would have no impact on the number of homicides in the US.

Do you believe these facts are true?

--------------------------------

z940912 @ 2014-01-14 23:58:58 :

First, all the points made before your 1 &amp; 2 have issues.

Russians, Chinese, and Germans commoners had far fewer guns than US citizens have had during their history.  The US has enforced peace along with the Soviets for the last 50 years.

Hitler, Stalin, and Mao all created cadres of thugs far better armed than the populace and intimidated or killed resisters.

1) The US military soldiers would not follow orders to attack US civilians. 
2) We don't know, but we do know that removing cars, alcohol, and swimming pools would save 1,000's every day so why not take them? We also know that a disarmed populace has made easy pickings through  out history and it isn't likely a coincidence that we have the world's record for holding on to a democratic republic free of aristocracy and despots.


--------------------------------

Omega037 @ 2014-01-15 00:39:33 :

&gt;  1) The US military soldiers would not follow orders to attack US civilians. 

This is conceding my point.  If it is the case that the military would choose to protect us rather than attack us, then certainly we *don't* have a need for average civilians to have weapons, just the military.

&gt; 2) We don't know, but we do know that removing cars, alcohol, and swimming pools would save 1,000's every day so why not take them?

First, we do know.  We have several cases in recent history of similar societies getting rid of guns.  It doesn't really decrease crime itself, but it *does* greatly decrease the lethality of the crimes.

&gt; We also know that a disarmed populace has made easy pickings through out history 

There is no evidence of this.  Many armed populaces have been easy pickings, and many unarmed populaces are standing strong now for decades.

&gt; and it isn't likely a coincidence that we have the world's record for holding on to a democratic republic free of aristocracy and despots.

No, it really isn't.  Of course we hold the world record, since we were the first to begin with.  In other words, even if all the others lasted perfectly, we would *still* be the longest running.  That has nothing to do with guns, just the fact that we formed our country earlier.

That said, you seem to ignore a whole lot of history here.  You forget a massive civil war with huge causalities, including civil casualties in the 1860s.  

The very fact that the well-armed South was unsuccessful during the war basically disproves your entire point here.  Did civilian guns prevent Sheman's men from waging total war and cutting a swath of destruction during his ""March to the Sea""?

Your argument also ignores the fact that most of these republics failed for reasons completely unrelated to guns.  The fact that a country didn't last as a republic due to internal corruption, economic collapse, or an external conflict is not evidence of anything.  Especially since countries that did have a well-armed populace often failed for the same reasons.

z940912 @ 2014-01-15 01:24:42 :

1) refusing to attack civilians, and spontaneously attacking the government are two very different things. we don't want to have to depend on the government to protect us from the government. its the entire point of the 2nd amendment.

2) we are talking about assault rifles. that conclusion was refuted. but even if we are talking guns, we should eliminate pools too since they are nice, but they kill people so should be eliminated.

3) decades? we have millenia of history showing how easily despots rise amongst the unarmed. the last few decades are Pax Americana.

4) the civil war was caused by the major flaw in the Constitution, the 5/8 compromise, not anything to do with guns, although the North won faster, and abolished slavery, because of the massive amount of gun manufacturing (amongst others) that they were doing.

No the South makes the opposite point: that well-armed citizenry can't be intimidated into submission.

Guns aren't a failsafe to everything, but they are essential to a long lived republic along with our other freedoms. speech and other rights have unpleasant reports in the media as well, but we shouldn't ban rights because they make us uncomfortable or make us think across centuries rather than years or decades.

&gt; 1) refusing to attack civilians, and spontaneously attacking the government are two very different things. we don't want to have to depend on the government to protect us from the government. its the entire point of the 2nd amendment.

Your reasoning seems to have become convoluted.  Either the government would refuse to attack its people or not.  

If they don't refuse, the army, navy, and air force would make quick work of civilians regardless of how they were armed.  

If they do refuse, then it means the government can't actually enforce its desire to attack the people, so it's a moot point.

&gt; 2) we are talking about assault rifles. that conclusion was refuted. but even if we are talking guns, we should eliminate pools too since they are nice, but they kill people so should be eliminated.

First, pools kill hundreds a year while guns kill tens of thousands.

Second, pools only kill people who actively decide to go to a pool and put themselves at risk.  Most victims of gun crimes did not choose to put themselves at risk.  This is an important distinction.

Furthermore, for something like cars, we do require licenses, insurance (in case you hurt someone else), regularly enforce rules on speeding, recklessness, and drunk driving, and have strict regulations on car design for safety reasons.

If anything, the way we handle car usage only shows that guns *should* be far more regulated.

&gt; 3) decades? we have millenia of history showing how easily despots rise amongst the unarmed. the last few decades are Pax Americana.

Effective guns haven't been around for more than 2 centuries, nor has a governmental system strong enough to actually enforce removal of weapons (be they guns or swords).  So saying a millennium is incorrect.

Also, you again keep bringing up this idea of history showing us that being unarmed causes you to be taken over.  This just isn't in any way true, and stating it again and again doesn't make it true.  

The fact is that most societies to be taken over *were* armed, but it didn't matter.  When they were unarmed, they usually also lacked a strong military force to defend the people against outside attack.  

I challenge you to provide a single example of an unarmed civilian population with a strong military that was somehow taken oven in this fashion.  If you can't, then drop this claim.

As for ""Pax Americana"", while we have avoided a World War sized conflict in the past 60 years, there have been many regional conflicts with large death tolls during this time.  The Korean War, Vietnam War, Iran-Iraq War, Algerian War, Nigerian Civil War, First Indochina War, and Sudanese Civil War all had over a million casualties each.

&gt; 4) the civil war was caused by the major flaw in the Constitution, the 5/8 compromise, not anything to do with guns, although the North won faster, and abolished slavery, because of the massive amount of gun manufacturing (amongst others) that they were doing.

Causes don't matter in the slightest, and I never implied that it was about guns.  

My point is that you had a large, fairly well armed civilian militia that wanted to rebel against the government because of various abuses.  

This is the exact situation you imply we need to allow civilians to keep their guns for.  However, even with broad support, good generals, and a large amount of weapons, they lost.  

At the time, the North may have had an advantage, but it was minute compared to the advantage the government has now.  Thus it confirms my original point, that historical evidence (and common reasoning) tells us that allowing civilians to have guns will *not* matter if the government decides to ""take over"".

If we are already screwed regardless of whether we have guns or not, then taking them away only does one thing, reduce the number of gun related deaths per year.

9) I'm saying the opposite - state organs wouldn't have the ""honor"" to follow orders to shoot their kin like they would have in the past, so communities who ""stand there ground"" would find few takers willing to murder them. thugs and brown-shirts are another matter, but they lose their vigor quickly when outnumbered.
10) caused by demagogues who get elected - often with ties to criminal organizations (this describes most rep demos in history.) statesmen don't advance corruption, have credibility and succor from neighbors during crisis, and don't allow demagogues to operate illegally.

No it can not. The result is that a person has his freedom to choose what to do with his time taken away and then forced to learn CPR. This is essentially slavery.
It iss a subtle kind of tyranny. When people think they are doing goods i.e. saving life, they feel justified in enforcing others to do things they don't want to do. Just as the communists think they are doing good i.e. liberating the working class, you are following the same line of reasoning.

You can opt out of schools, as many people do. so no, it's not slavery.

If CPR is so great, you should have no trouble convincing people to learn it of their own free will. The fact that you can not convince people to learn it of their own free will means that those people disagree with you on the importance of CPR. Now you want to impose your value on them by forcing them to learn CPR because you think your valuation of CPR supercedes theirs.

&gt;As to your second point, I also think math is great, and math is taught in schools, but I have a hard time imagining too many people going out and learning math of their own volition. 

Do you have a hard time imagining convincing parents why maths is important and getting them to force their children to learn it? Because this case happens all the time and it simply shifts the burden of decision onto the parents.



--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-06 10:10:26 :

I don't think you're really arguing from a position of reality. For the most part, nobody has a direct say in what they learn in school, so to say that learning basic first aid is 'slavery' yet learning math is not is absurd.

Your second point is somewhat incoherent; I'm not really sure what you're getting at. When are parents being convinced to force their children to learn math? It's *required* that they learn it. And how does being forced by one's parents provide a child with more agency than being forced by law?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-06 10:31:58 :

&gt;  so to say that learning basic first aid is 'slavery' yet learning math is not is absurd.

What is the defining feature of slavery? It is that the slave does not get to choose what to do but his master chooses for the slave.

If that is the case then when you compare it to education, you would have to say that if the pupil can not choose what to learn but somebody else (in this case the OP or whichever government entity implements OP's vision) then he is also a slave.

And you can see there is nothing absurd with this comparison. What is absurd is the fact that you accept this configuration, yet rejects slavery as an unacceptable evil. This of course is not a result of quiet reasoning but a result of the social paradigm of the society you live in, one that vilifies slavery but has enforced education as the status quo. The morally consistent thing here is to reject enforced education as an infringement on people's ability to choose for themselves, the same way you would morally reject slavery. But instead you did a mental backflip and concluded that enforced education is not slavery.

&gt; When are parents being convinced to force their children to learn math? It's required that they learn it.

The point is that if parents are not forced to force their children to learn maths, it would be highly plausible to convince them instead. You can point out that they need maths for everyday living, to work with money. You can also show them that maths is important to learn science and will be required for advanced degrees and thus it is highly reasonable to learn relatively advanced maths to have the options of getting advanced education.

&gt;And how does being forced by one's parents provide a child with more agency than being forced by law?

Because parents love their children and government does not. If you agree that children are incapable of deciding for themselves what's good for them, the people that are most fit are the children's parents, not the government.



--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-06 11:29:54 :

Oh man, where do I even begin...

&gt;It is that the slave does not get to choose what to do but his master chooses for the slave.

This is a very particular and rhetorical definition; you're twisting the word to suit your purpose. One's children are not slaves, they are wards. Likewise, in many places, when one attends school they temporarily become wards of the state. If you think there is something wrong with this, this is perhaps because you do not entirely realize that most children simply lack the experience and development to care and provide for themselves properly.

I reject your assertion that I advocate schooling because I am indoctrinated or simply confined by social norms: the fact is that it is in everyone's best interest to educate our children, and I challenge you to prove otherwise. While I do not necessarily agree with all of the practices in the North American education system, claiming that it is slavery is moronic and anti-intellectual.

As stated numerous times, *children are generally not able to make the best decisions for themselves*. Your belief that all cases of constraint are slavery stems from a very bizarre moral absolutism: aren't all laws slavery, then, since we are required to obey them?

&gt;The point is that if parents are not forced to force their children to learn maths, it would be highly plausible to convince them instead.

Disregarding the fact that we are already speaking about the hypothetical, how would this not also apply to first aid? Would it not be beneficial for society to know how to, for instance, identify signs of a stroke or a heart attack? If they find *themselves* injured, would they not want those nearby educated in how to properly react to the situation? Not to mention that a basic first aid certification is beneficial, if not required, for getting many jobs in fields like education and health care.

&gt;If you agree that children are incapable of deciding for themselves what's good for them, the people that are most fit are the children's parents, not the government.

I do not necessarily agree with this. Ignoring the instances of parents who simply don't care about their children (which is sadly a not-entirely-uncommon occurrence), it also fails to answer my question: since you are taking such a strict definition of slavery --one that requires only a lack of personal agency-- why does it matter who is actually depriving the child of their choice?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-06 11:58:46 :

&gt; If you think there is something wrong with this, this is perhaps because you do not entirely realize that most children simply lack the experience and development to care and provide for themselves properly.

This would justify having the parents decide for children. It does not justify having the state, which is really just a random collection of strangers, decide for the children. 

&gt;I reject your assertion that I advocate schooling because I am indoctrinated or simply confined by social norms:

This is not what I asserted at all. I asserted that you resolve your internal inconsistency of supporting enforced education and disapproving slavery by pretending that forcing others to do something is not slavery if said something is education.

&gt;aren't all laws slavery, then, since we are required to obey them?

some are. some are not.

&gt;how would this not also apply to first aid? 

It would apply if OP said ""schools should try to get people to learn CPR"" but instead he said compulsory.

&gt;Would it not be beneficial for society to know how to, for instance, identify signs of a stroke or a heart attack?

sure

&gt;If they find themselves injured, would they not want those nearby educated in how to properly react to the situation?

ofcourse

&gt;Not to mention that a basic first aid certification is beneficial, if not required, for getting many jobs in fields like education and health care.

okay

but if these things are so good, you shouldn't have any trouble convincing people to learn them. Why do you have to force people to learn them?

&gt;why does it matter who is actually depriving the child of their choice?

Because parents are better positioned to decide what's good for their own children than random strangers.



--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-06 12:21:35 :

I don't have an internal inconsistency about equating mandatory education and slavery: I think it is a ridiculous notion which ignores the semantic space of 'slavery' and instead substitutes a uselessly concrete meaning of ""people making me do things I don't want to do"". This is not what slavery is, nor is it how the word is used by society. Your argument also seems to ignore the fact that many people often do not act not only in the best interest of their society, but in their own best interest.

&gt;some are. some are not.

How do you figure? Where is the line drawn?

&gt;Because parents are better positioned to decide what's good for their own children than random strangers.

This may be true in some cases, but not all. First off, it is disingenuous to call the government ""random strangers"". They are professionals, and their profession happens to revolve around making decisions of this sort. This is like saying you would be better off treating cancer with home remedies rather than going to the hospital and putting your life in the hands of ""random strangers"".

Ultimately, I'm not quite sure why you have such a strong opposition to standards, or from where you've adopted such an idealistic notion of personal freedom within a society. Who, if anyone, has granted you this freedom? Why is it good?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-06 12:32:56 :

&gt; ""people making me do things I don't want to do"".

What is a slave except somebody who is being forced to do something they don't want to do?

&gt;Your argument also seems to ignore the fact that many people often do not act not only in the best interest of their society, but in their own best interest.

Why does your idea of another person's best interest supercedes his own?

&gt;How do you figure? Where is the line drawn?

A law against murder makes perfect sense without coercion. It is an agreement between all members of society not to kill each other.

Taxation on the other hand is obviously slavery.

&gt;First off, it is disingenuous to call the government ""random strangers"". 

But they are. Government is a large collection of random strangers. How many people in government do you know personally? less than 0.0001%

&gt;They are professionals

That is great. Doctors are professionals too, yet they don't force their decisions on you.

&gt; This is like saying you would be better off treating cancer with home remedies rather than going to the hospital and putting your life in the hands of ""random strangers"".

But that is the fundamental difference. I have the choice to not accept the service of random stranger doctors. I could go see a doctor, he could explain to me how he intend to treat my disease, why he believes the treatment would work and how he had treated many people successfully in his career and he would convince me that he would be competent to treat me.

Doctors don't force their treatment on me. This makes them fundamentally different to a government and your comparison is completely invalid.

&gt;I'm not quite sure why you have such a strong opposition to standards

This is false. I am not against standards, im against forcing people to do things they don't want to do.

&gt;Who, if anyone, has granted you this freedom? 

freedom is simply an abstraction of the idea that people should not interfere with others.

&gt; Why is it good?

Would you prefer it that I don't blow your head off with a 12gauge shot gun?



--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-06 13:05:39 :

&gt;What is a slave except somebody who is being forced to do something they don't want to do?

For starters, it usually implies ownership to some degree. As a free citizen, you cannot be bought, sold, or traded. In many past slave societies, as well, slaves were not considered 'people' and were therefore not protected by the same laws as everyone else. There was an inequality. Mandated education, however, applies to *everybody*.

&gt;Why does your idea of another person's best interest supercedes his own?

I said no such thing. It's worth noting however, that this is not a universal order of values. I could just as well ask the opposite of you, though I won't.

&gt;A law against murder makes perfect sense without coercion. It is an agreement between all members of society not to kill each other.
Taxation on the other hand is obviously slavery.

I don't personally remember agreeing not to murder anybody. Does this mean I am not bound by this law, since I did not agree to it? Of course not: like you said, *it is an agreement within a society*. It's for this same reason that you pay taxes: you are part of a society, and therefore reap the benefits of being in that society --everyone has agreed on it. This is an exchange, not slavery.
Extending this to the matter at hand, the same applies to education. Mandatory education is something that all the members of society agreed would be beneficial.

&gt;But they are. Government is a large collection of random strangers. How many people in government do you know personally? less than 0.0001%

The entire point of democracy is that you have some say in who represents you. The merits and detriments of that system, however, are a whole other debate. 

&gt;But that is the fundamental difference. I have the choice to not accept the service of random stranger doctors. I could go see a doctor, he could explain to me how he intend to treat my disease, why he believes the treatment would work and how he had treated many people successfully in his career and he would convince me that he would be competent to treat me.
Doctors don't force their treatment on me. This makes them fundamentally different to a government and your comparison is completely invalid.

Is it that invalid, though? In the context of your logic, nobody is **forcing** you to be a part of this society, either. You can choose to go to the hospital and receive their treatment, just as you can choose to remain a member of a society and receive the benefits that entails. There is a cost to both. There is no such thing as a free lunch.

&gt;This is false. I am not against standards, im against forcing people to do things they don't want to do.

This is a big part of what standards are for. If you want to sell a food product that has been deemed unsafe, broadly speaking, you will be unable to do so. 

&gt;freedom is simply an abstraction of the idea that people should not interfere with others.

This doesn't answer my question. Why should people not interfere with others?

&gt;Would you prefer it that I don't blow your head off with a 12gauge shot gun?

Is this an answer or a threat? I would also prefer that you would save me if I were dying in the street, but I'd also like to have some confidence that you know what you're doing.

I enjoy freedom as much as the next guy, but all things within reason, yeah? I think you should maybe reflect on what it means to be part of a society; as much as you might like to think so, you don't live in a bubble.

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-06 13:30:51 :

&gt; For starters, it usually implies ownership to some degree.

What is ownership of a person if not the ability to force him to do things he doesn't want to do? Name one implication of ownership that will not result from being able to force a person to do things he doesn't want to do?

&gt;Mandated education, however, applies to everybody.

If I mandate murder for everybody, would that be okay too?

&gt;I said no such thing.

You said that sometimes people don't act in their own best interest. Which is really saying they don't seem to act in what you consider to be their own best interest i.e. you are saying your valuation of their best interest supercedes their own.

&gt;I don't personally remember agreeing not to murder anybody. 

It is simply a framework to understand laws against murder. Of course we could put it to a test right now, imagine we live in a society without laws except for what people agree and another person asks you to agree with him not to kill each other, would you do so?

&gt;you are part of a society, and therefore reap the benefits of being in that society

This doesn't justify taxation at all because taxation is not a pre-requisite of a society.

&gt;Extending this to the matter at hand, the same applies to education. Mandatory education is something that all the members of society agreed would be beneficial.

Well if everybody is going to agree it would be beneficial anyway why would you have to make it compulsory?

People agree that eating would be beneficial and you don't have to force them to eat do you?

&gt;The entire point of democracy is that you have some say in who represents you.

This does not address the point that government is a collection of strangers. Address the point and don't drift please.

&gt; nobody is forcing you to be a part of this society, either.

except I am being forced because in order to leave I would require a document from the government.

Not to mention that your claim of me being in this society is based no more than me being born here and the government claiming that everybody who's born here must be in the society that's being administered by the government.

So yes, I am being forced to be a part of this society.

&gt;There is no such thing as a free lunch.

You are using that incorrectly, which shows you don't have an understanding of what it actually means. The benefits of being in a society do not require taxation.

&gt;This is a big part of what standards are for.

No it isn't. The GCC standard for compiler did not force anybody to do anything. It was adopted voluntarily by many people.

&gt;If you want to sell a food product that has been deemed unsafe, broadly speaking, you will be unable to do so. 

unsafe according to the decision of another group of people, not the people actually doing the eating.

&gt;Why should people not interfere with others?

Because most people don't want to be interfered with.

&gt;Is this an answer or a threat?

an answer

--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-06 16:06:48 :

I'm not sure I can actually maintain this discussion since you seem to basically be using your own arbitrary definitions for terminology. You also seem fundamentally unable to grasp the concept that a lot of what you're arguing for only makes sense *within the framework you're arguing against*. In particular, look here:
&gt;It is simply a framework to understand laws against murder. Of course we could put it to a test right now, imagine we live in a society without laws except for what people agree and another person asks you to agree with him not to kill each other, would you do so?

Do you honestly not understand the flawed reasoning in your rebuttal? Particularly the fact that it directly contradicts this:
&gt;Well if everybody is going to agree it would be beneficial anyway why would you have to make it compulsory?
People agree that eating would be beneficial and you don't have to force them to eat do you?

And then this:
&gt;This doesn't justify taxation at all because taxation is not a pre-requisite of a society.

I never said it was, but it is certainly a pre-requisite of the *society you happen to be a part of*, and taxation is also *wholly fundamental to its operation*. I challenge you to provide one example of a successful nation which does not require any taxes at all, and doesn't exist solely in some insane fantasyland headscape.

&gt;This does not address the point that government is a collection of strangers. Address the point and don't drift please.

If you picked the person, you must know them to some degree and they are, by definition, no longer strangers.
&gt;except I am being forced because in order to leave I would require a document from the government.

This is a stretch. Which documents are these? I've never been asked for documents to leave my country, only to enter another country, which are two very different things.
We could also extend the discussion from simply your immediate national society to the ""human society"" which we often discuss in this globalized world. You could still complain that you're only a part of it because you were born into it, but what's your point?

&gt;You are using that incorrectly, which shows you don't have an understanding of what it actually means. The benefits of being in a society do not require taxation.

I am not using it incorrectly; the meaning of the saying is pretty plain. Many things are paid for by the government through taxes that you probably take for granted. Consider the fate of many micronations: they are often simply annexed by nearby powers since the micronation lacks the capital to do anything about it.

&gt;No it isn't. The GCC standard for compiler did not force anybody to do anything. It was adopted voluntarily by many people.

This is a different meaning of the word standard. 

&gt;unsafe according to the decision of another group of people, not the people actually doing the eating.

Tell me, do you think fraud is wrong?

&gt;Because most people don't want to be interfered with.

So? Many people like interfering with others. Why is one more important than the other?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-07 03:16:39 :

&gt; but it is certainly a pre-requisite of the society you happen to be a part of

no it isn't. Do you know what pre-requisite mean?

&gt;and taxation is also wholly fundamental to its operation.

Slavery was fundamental to pre-civil war south economy.

&gt;If you picked the person, you must know them to some degree and they are, by definition, no longer strangers.

This makes no sense. A government is not a person.

&gt;Which documents are these?

A passport?

&gt;Many things are paid for by the government through taxes that you probably take for granted.

Take for granted? Im paying for them with my own money. How can something im paying for be 'taken for granted'?

&gt;Consider the fate of many micronations: they are often simply annexed by nearby powers since the micronation lacks the capital to do anything about it.

Name one micronation that was annexed.

&gt;This is a different meaning of the word standard. 

No it isn't. The w3c publish standards for the internet, they do not force anybody to use it yet the standards are adopted voluntarily by most organisations on the web. They are standards organisation. You are just wrong.

&gt;Tell me, do you think fraud is wrong?

Fraud is a breach of contract.

&gt;Many people like interfering with others. Why is one more important than the other?

Would you prefer not to be killed to the option to kill other people?


--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-07 07:24:23 :

&gt;no it isn't. Do you know what pre-requisite mean?

Yes I do know what it means, and yes it is. Our current society would not be possible without taxation.

&gt;Slavery was fundamental to pre-civil war south economy.

So? You seem really hooked on the fact that taxation is slavery. It isn't. Your definition of slavery is incorrect.

&gt;This makes no sense. A government is not a person.

You do realize that the government is comprised of people, correct? Elected and appointed officials, and so on? It's not some faceless entity.

&gt;A passport?

I have never been asked for a passport by the country I was leaving, only by other countries I was entering.

&gt;Take for granted? Im paying for them with my own money. How can something im paying for be 'taken for granted'?

How? very easily, in fact. I'm sure you're aware you're paying taxes, but many taxpayers do not pay attention to the plethora of uses to which their money is put.

&gt;Name one micronation that was annexed.

Just one? [Minerva.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Reefs) I'll even throw in [The Republic of Indian Stream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Indian_Stream) as an added bonus.

&gt;No it isn't. The w3c publish standards for the internet, they do not force anybody to use it yet the standards are adopted voluntarily by most organisations on the web. They are standards organisation. You are just wrong.

You've completely ignored what I said. I didn't say that they weren't 'standards', I said that it's a different use of the word 'standard' which is semantically different. Consider, for instance, the different meanings in the phrases ""Jazz Standards"" vs. ""Health Standards"".

&gt;Fraud is a breach of contract.

Missing my point, even though you're actually wrong anyway: breach of contract is only one type of fraud.

&gt;Would you prefer not to be killed to the option to kill other people?

I personally wouldn't but that's not the point, and you've once again avoided answering my question. When did we start factoring what we'd 'rather' into the discussion? That's slippery territory, and there are definitely people out there who would kill at the expense of their own life, anyway. And what exactly qualifies as 'interference'?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-07 07:59:17 :

&gt;Our current society would not be possible without taxation.

that's a tautology. but a society is definitely possible without taxation.

&gt;Your definition of slavery is incorrect.

No it isn't.

&gt;You do realize that the government is comprised of people, correct? 

being composed of people does not make government a person

&gt;I have never been asked for a passport by the country I was leaving

you obviously never left a country then

&gt;but many taxpayers do not pay attention to the plethora of uses to which their money is put.

this does not justify accusing me of taking things for granted

&gt;Just one? Minerva.

Minerva was never recognised as a nation.

&gt;You've completely ignored what I said. I didn't say that they weren't 'standards', I said that it's a different use of the word 'standard' which is semantically different.

Point to why the w3c html standards are different to the food standards. they both refer to how things should be done i.e. how html page should be rendered or how food should be cooked. they are both generated as a guideline for organisations that deal with the things in question i.e. browser makers or restaurants.

They are both an rule set established by an authority detailing how to deal with something.

&gt;breach of contract is only one type of fraud.

this does not negate what i said

&gt;I personally wouldn't but that's not the point

it is the point




--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-07 08:32:17 :

&gt;that's a tautology. but a society is definitely possible without taxation.

Yes it is a tautology. Please refer back to my earlier point about how your arguments only apply within the system you're trying to deconstruct. It's paradoxical reasoning.

&gt;No it isn't.

Yes it is. I've pointed out several reasons why and you've addressed none of them. There is more to slavery than being made to do something you don't like. Are children slaves of their parents when they are made to eat their vegetables?

&gt;being composed of people does not make government a person

You first addressed the government as a ""random strangers"", identifying them as people, albeit ones you don't personally know. If you are making a comparison between legislators and parents, you must consider them as people or you're producing a false equivocation. You can't have it both ways.

&gt;you obviously never left a country then

I have in fact left several countries on numerous occasions. I believe you are confusing requirements for leaving a country with requirements for *entering a different country*, which are very different things.

&gt;Minerva was never recognised as a nation.

Micronations, by definition, are not recognized as nations. If they were, they would simply be very small nations (or microstates).

&gt;They are different for the exact reason you seem to reject: the W3C does not have authority. The subtle difference is that html and jazz standards claim what is *expected*, whereas health standards state what is *the minimum requirement*.

&gt;this does not negate what i said

No it doesn't but you didn't answer the question either. What you said had no bearing on the current discussion, at least not without additional context.

&gt;it is the point

Oh, is it? How so? Care to address what I actually said, then, instead of avoiding giving actual answers of substance?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-07 08:56:45 :

&gt; Yes it is a tautology.

which makes your point invalid

&gt;I've pointed out several reasons why and you've addressed none of them.

I have addressed all of them and you have resorted to saying I have addressed none of them instead of an actual argument

&gt;If you are making a comparison between legislators and parents, you must consider them as people or you're producing a false equivocation. You can't have it both ways.

So you admit that being composed of people does not make government a person, which is a point you refused before.

&gt;I have in fact left several countries on numerous occasions.

[here](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/checklist.html) shows that you need government document to leave the US.

&gt;Micronations, by definition, are not recognized as nations. 

so you admit that you were wrong when you said it was annexed

&gt;What you said had no bearing on the current discussion, 

it has all the bearing because you claimed that standards required enforcement when I showed you you were wrong by the counter-example of the w3c HTML standard and you have no counter-argument.

You keep getting shown wrong again and again and you keep going.... like you have no shame or any intellectual integrity

--------------------------------

Estaroc @ 2014-03-07 09:43:34 :

&gt;which makes your point invalid

No, because the whole point *was to prove you are arguing from a tautological position*.

&gt;I have addressed all of them and you have resorted to saying I have addressed none of them instead of an actual argument

Except no, you absolutely have no addressed them. You never addressed the fact that citizens cannot be bought, sold, or traded, and also failed to address the inequality of things you deem to be slavery. Everyone has to go to school. Everyone has to pay taxes. There is no implicit subservience. I also asked several questions which were completely ignored, such as ""when parents make their children eat vegetables, are they enslaving them?"" All you **actually** did was supply your own completely fabricated and self-serving definition of ""ownership"", which is just as useless as your artificial definition of slavery.

&gt;So you admit that being composed of people does not make government a person, which is a point you refused before.

I swear you're not even reading what I'm putting down anymore. I didn't claim that ""The Government"" was ""A Person"". I said the government is composed of people, and it's unfair to call them ""total strangers"", and drew an analogy to other professionals, such as doctors.

&gt;here shows that you need government document to leave the US.

The only reference to requiring documents to leave a country is this line:

&gt;Most foreign countries require a valid passport to enter and leave.

So first of all, no, by qualifying *foreign* countries, this excludes the US. Second of all, it only **explicitly** states that passports are needed for entry to other countries, and reentry into the US (which is also entering, not leaving, a country) which is *exactly what I said*. 

&gt;so you admit that you were wrong when you said it was annexed

How did you draw this conclusion? Annexation does not require that the annexed territory be an internationally recognized nation.

&gt;it has all the bearing because you claimed that standards required enforcement when I showed you you were wrong by the counter-example of the w3c HTML standard and you have no counter-argument.

There was a mistake in my formatting, my apologies. I was responding to two separate points of yours. The last bit of my last post should have read as follows:

&gt;&gt;Point to why the w3c html standards are different to the food standards. they both refer to how things should be done i.e. how html page should be rendered or how food should be cooked. they are both generated as a guideline for organisations that deal with the things in question i.e. browser makers or restaurants.
They are both an rule set established by an authority detailing how to deal with something.

&gt;They are different for the exact reason you seem to reject: the W3C does not have authority. The subtle difference is that html and jazz standards claim what is expected, whereas health standards state what is the minimum requirement.

&gt;&gt;this does not negate what i said

&gt;No it doesn't but you didn't answer the question either. What you said had no bearing on the current discussion, at least not without additional context.

And lastly

&gt;You keep getting shown wrong again and again and you keep going.... like you have no shame or any intellectual integrity

How the fuck do you figure? Where have you objectively proven me wrong on anything? I'm not the one being forced to make up definitions to reinforce my argument or completely ignore entire questions and explanations. Are you perhaps projecting?

--------------------------------

RempingJenny @ 2014-03-07 10:28:15 :

&gt; No, because the whole point was to prove you are arguing from a tautological position.

no the point was to prove YOU were arguing with tautology and you admitted to it.

&gt;Except no, you absolutely have no addressed them. 

Yes I have.

&gt;I didn't claim that ""The Government"" was ""A Person"".

You said that if you pick a person, he must not be a stranger. While this logic is already dubious as it's not clear whether you mean the person you vote for which would definitely be a stranger, or who else. but in either case you picking a person does not mean government is a person.

&gt;and drew an analogy to other professionals, such as doctors.

except i get to choose my doctors, i don't get to choose which class my children go to if OP has his way.

Wow. So I guess it's gotten to the point where you can just pass off bullshit and simply declare yourself correct, eh? All attempts to actually understand what I've been saying are just out the window. 

&gt;no the point was to prove YOU were arguing with tautology and you admitted to it.

Stop trying to tell me what I did or did not say. You realize it's all written down here, right? If I said anything of the sort, show me where.

&gt;Yes I have.

Oh, well *now* I'm convinced. Glad we cleared that up. /s 

Also, see above. If you did address those points, show me where. *I* certainly can't find such a response.

&gt;You said that if you pick a person, he must not be a stranger. While this logic is already dubious as it's not clear whether you mean the person you vote for which would definitely be a stranger, or who else. but in either case you picking a person does not mean government is a person.

We've already both agreed that a government is not a person. This is not something that I ever claimed. Are you dense? Also, what's dubious about that logic? Unless you made an uninformed decision, in which case that can hardly be blamed on anyone other than yourself, can it?

&gt;except i get to choose my doctors, i don't get to choose which class my children go to if OP has his way.

You already don't get to choose directly what classes your children go to. This was basically the very first point I made in this discussion. The decision is made for you by someone who has been chosen by the people as their representative.

&gt;How can you leave the US without entering another country?

THANK YOU. He finally understands! A miracle. Seriously though, do you not see the significance of this? Perhaps try reading our discussion from the beginning.

&gt;well i guess killing a cow does not require the cow to be a cow amirite?

&gt;so you admit you were wrong.

So yes.

I did this deliberately to show you how ridiculous your argument was. I even stated this explicitly **multiple times**.

&gt;I have made you admit that you were wrong in stating the government is a person.
So yes.

Again, you're clearly not reading. This was never an argument that anyone made. You are knocking down straw men.

&gt;Which is why forced education is slavery.

And so we're back to square one, I see. I also note you've **one again** conveniently neglected to defend your absurd definition of slavery.

&gt;lol what? I destroyed your argument and you somehow declared victory?
wow

Similar to point one, I made that point explicitly to point out the self-referential nature of your premise. You didn't destroy my argument; it wasn't even an argument. Read it again. The fact that I had to restate myself at least three times that going and leaving are not the same seems to have distracted you

&gt;So you have no argument.

I have no argument about a non-sequitur about cows? Obviously not, you weren't making any sense. I interpreted your statement as some sort of misguided disagreement about what exactly constitutes annexation. If you do in fact own a dictionary, I suggest you go educate yourself on the matter.

&gt;You admit you were wrong.

Again, no. Don't be such an infant.

it's an argument against your claim that you can annex a non-country.

Estaroc @ 2014-03-07 11:49:23 :

&gt;So you were wrong on purpose? lol

Technically, yes. I was using your own reasoning. If you read up, you may see that talking point evolved from this:

&gt;You also seem fundamentally unable to grasp the concept that a lot of what you're arguing for only makes sense within the framework you're arguing against. In particular, look here:
&gt;&gt;It is simply a framework to understand laws against murder. Of course we could put it to a test right now, imagine we live in a society without laws except for what people agree and another person asks you to agree with him not to kill each other, would you do so?

&gt;Do you honestly not understand the flawed reasoning in your rebuttal? Particularly the fact that it directly contradicts this:
&gt;&gt;Well if everybody is going to agree it would be beneficial anyway why would you have to make it compulsory? People agree that eating would be beneficial and you don't have to force them to eat do you?

It's *your own tautological reasoning*. Why is this difficult to understand?

&gt;You made a claim that if you picked a person, then he's not a stranger in response to my argument that a person and a government are not the same, so that means that you think government is a person. You made this argument many times.

I actually started out talking about people. You were the first person to even use the word government, in particular here:

&gt;in either case, the government i.e. a band of strangers

You are **clearly** equating the government with people here. This is actually fine: the government is indeed comprised of people. My qualm was with you calling them strangers. But nobody ever said The Government was A Person. It is a subtle but important difference, and an argument that nobody was making.

&gt;If I kidnap you, put you in my dungeon and made you learn calculus is that slavery?

Once again, you don't actually address my points but provide a nonsense hypothetical. But lets deconstruct it anyway. This is a false equivocation for numerous reasons: first, you've called it kidnapping; going to school is not even remotely close to kidnapping, and this changes the dynamic of the situation immensely, as well as telegraphing your motive in wording this example (also, why a dungeon? ). Second, I am not a minor. I am allowed to make all my decisions for myself, whereas children are not. Third, and perhaps most importantly, you are not my legal guardian, and I do not recognize you as having any sort of authority over me in this regard. This is the same principle that separates arrests from abductions.

&gt;but i did, multiple times. you even admitted.

I did not, and congratulations on once again disregarding the actual bulk of what I said.

&gt;it's an argument against your claim that you can annex a non-country.

It's not a claim, it's a fact. This is why I advised you to actually look up what annexation entails. Barring that, perhaps simply look at wikipedia:

&gt;Annexation (Latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous).

Note how it says ""territorial entity"". That means something on earth with borders. There is no requirement that the entity be a nation specifically, and especially not an *internationally recognized* one.

&gt;but you did. don't go back on your words now.

If you look at what I actually said, it was

I agree with you, but that doesn't make race disappear within the context of sociology or anthropology. And since this post was *about* race...Let's just leave it at this and stop arguing semantics. "	0	0	stop arguing comment					"I actually found Aamer Rahman saying he thought the movie was racist on his Facebook page, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why his fans and he find it racist. 

I thought it was quite fair to the hijackers. They were portrayed as being otherwise normal human beings, in very tough circumstances, in a complex situation (I never knew that these pirates had 'bosses' so to speak). I thought the pirates were portrayed with great, and very sensitive, equanimity. They weren't portrayed as monsters, and the white crew weren't portrayed as morally superior heroes. 

The US military was portrayed as the technologically superior, faceless, heartless, precise killing machine that it is (though not always so precise, but in this instance it was). Maybe some fan-boys of military tech might get off on this, but that definitely didn't feel like the point of the movie. Captain Phillips may have been portrayed as perhaps more stoic and level-headed than maybe he was in real life, but I don't know. And that's what we expect from any protagonist.

I think it would certainly have been silly and disingenuous to portray the pirates in any different light, given the actual events, and the actual background to those events. The pirates didn't kill anybody, but they got killed and captured. How were they supposed to be portrayed? Like a modern version of Saladin and his heroes? Come on. 

Anyway, I can only concede that the movie focused more on the actual hostage taking and US military response, and not as much proportionately as the background to the pirates themselves. However, I think it provided as much background to the pirates as was necessary to the narrative to make the audience understand that these pirate guys weren't evil, but human, and there but the grace of God go you were you to be born under those circumstances."	"bigDean636 @ 2014-03-18 16:32:04 :

As others have stated, it is very difficult to defend *someone else's* thoughts. Furthermore, I have not seen the movie so my opinion on it specifically would not be very constructive.

However, as with everything regarding race, it is always about *context*. Since ""race"" doesn't exist scientifically it is only a product of culture. And, at least in American theater, it is very rare to see the ""good guys"" be black and the ""bad guys"" be white. However, it is not uncommon at all to see the reverse. I would suspect that is what this person is commenting on. That the movie literally seems to be the heroic, brave white crew against the evil, greedy black pirates.

And I'm sure you'd say, ""So should they just arbitrarily change the race of the black pirates?"" of course not, I would say. This would probably be the case in real life, that the crew would be predominantly white and the Somali pirates black. Furthermore, I would not argue that the movie shouldn't have been made, or even that it was attempting to degrade a race of people.

However - and I must impress the importance of context, as that's the only thing that really matters when discussing race - in the context of a culture which has routinely and without fail seen white people as the good guys and black people as the bad guys, this movie does the exact same thing. I would imagine that is what the commentator meant when he said, ""This movie is racist"".

&gt;And, at least in American theater, it is very rare to see the ""good guys"" be black and the ""bad guys"" be white.

There are quite a few movies with black heroes, and more with black secondary sympathetic characters. Think of all the movies starring Samuel Jackson, Will Smith, Denzel Washington, Laurence Fishburne, Morgan Freeman, and so on. True, it's less common than white heroes, but I wouldn't say ""very rare"".

Maybe you just don't like the word?

&gt;[race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29) has often been replaced by other words which are less ambiguous and emotionally charged, such as populations, people(s), ethnic groups, or communities, depending on context.

Regardless, ethnicity is an absolutely real, observable variation of physical traits different groups within the homo sapiens species passed on through our lineage. You can try to argue that, but the entire field of anthropology will laugh at you. 

While I agree that assigning emotional responses to people of different skin color is outdated and pointless, people do in fact come in varying shades and characteristics. 

For example, Pigmy tribes being considerably shorter on average than northern Europeans isn't some kind of learned trait ingrained in a different *culture.* They're just actually shorter, dude. 

Doesn't mean they're lesser people, so get over it.

&gt; Race refers to a person's physical appearance, such as skin color, eye color, hair color, bone/jaw structure etc. 

So are we acknowledging our ability to genetically pass on those traits or are we pretending that Denzel Washington's parents could have easily had a child who looked like Jared Leto because there's no such thing as race? 

Look, **ancestry,** as you aptly pointed out is exactly how we arrive into a particular ethnicity or *race* whichever word you wanna use. 

Here's the crux of your AAA quote:

&gt;Given what we know about the capacity of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture, we conclude that present-day **inequalities** between so-called ""racial"" groups are not consequences of their biological inheritance

What these guys are saying is that it would great to destroy social judgmental constructs of superiority and inferiority. I'm sure you and I agree about that. But...it's not inherently judgmental or *racist* to simply acknowledge 

&gt;a person's physical appearance, such as skin color, eye color, hair color, bone/jaw structure etc. 

You know, the real observable shit that you just listed on your own accord. 

One guy's lineage can be traced to Japan, another guy's to Norway. They don't look *quite* the same. One's no better than the other, but please stop pretending you're so blind to the difference when you just literally fucking quoted the exact method by which you'd begin to guess their ancestry.

Obviously an animal having sex against their will, but that isn't what we're discussing.

They are not consenting because they mentally cannot consent.  This is why it is still rape even if a child initiates sex.

&gt;Does that make these two people having sex immoral?

No I already explained this.  You were ignoring that there was any possible harm, and I noted this as a possible physical nowhere.  Nowhere did I say the physical harm itself made it immoral.  That was a side point, so stop arguing it.

If the animal is bigger than the human, then the physical harm would probably belong to the female human.

&gt;You're also underestimating the different sex practices that exist within our own species.

I didn't know we were willing to kill other humans to get with one girl.  I didn't know it was commonplace to physically hurt the female just so we can impregnate them.  I didn't know guys carried the baby.  I didn't know males get beheaded at the end of mating.  None of this compares to whips and chain, because the exact method of consent and pleasure is still the same between humans."	1	0	stop arguing comment					With consent, it involves basic communication, so human language at least. So since they don't speak, and can't consent, they can't say no, so we truly don't know if they really want it. Most animals mate to reproduce, and that's their instinct. Dogs don't just randomly have sex for enjoyment, they do it to have puppies, and it applies to other animals. Someone can truly hurt an animal by having sex with them, especially if they're physically small animals. They cannot possibly understand what their owner is doing. It is completely wrong, and not good for the dog. If a dog truly doesn't want it, I think they can be traumatized. There have been documented cases where a dog was hurt, and had fear, and trust issues with men. It's just like beating a dog. Consent also implies an ability to understand the situation the being is in. It's just like a child. They truly don't understand it. If dogs that are continually raped they can show signs of trauma, like aggression, paranoia, insecurity, depression, and nightmares, in the same way they would if they were abused in other ways. Most animals do not have sex for the same way humans do. We should treat animals with some humanity, so that means not abusing them. If you would have sex with dogs, would you also think it's okay to beat them? It is also a crime in most states, and it's against the law for a reason. It's a fetish, not a sexual orientation, and it involves something harmful to another living being so therefore it is wrong.	"[deleted] @ 2014-03-17 06:24:06 :

What if an animal initiates sex with a human? For example, what if my dog starts humping my leg (something many dogs do) and I then get down on all fours without pants on and let the dog mount and have sex with me? In this situation the dog is the one initiating the sexual activity, so is it morally wrong for both myself and the dog to engage in sexual activity if the dog has initiated it and I have accepted it?

Disclaimer: This is a complete hypothetical situation and I have never had sexual relations with an animal nor do I wish to do so.

--------------------------------

thor_moleculez @ 2014-03-17 17:52:43 :

What if a 6 year old initiates sex with me? Can I go ahead and fuck that child? Obviously not, because the child doesn't have the necessary rational faculties to make an informed decision to have sex, and is probably just for whatever reason feeling horny. It would be wrong to take advantage of that. Initiation of sex is only an indication of consent if the initiating party is capable of making an informed decision about sex.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-17 19:30:24 :

Why can't a dog make an informed decision to have sex with a person? Can a dog make an informed decision to have sex with another dog? If so, then why not with a human?

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-18 01:07:58 :

Yes, because a choice to have sex with a dog is different than a choice to have sex with humans, where the human obviously has more power and an arguably manipulative and subservient relationship.  This is why two people under the age of consent can't rape each other.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 01:21:39 :

In the situation I provided, how does the human have more power than the dog of the dog initiated the sexual activity? People under the age of consent can't have sex because we as a society have determined that no one is mature enough to make those decisions until they are of a certain age. I'm not sure how this applies to animals who have sex on their own with other animals but for some reason can't have sex with humans.

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-18 01:27:38 :

Because of their relationship, where the human decides when the dog eats, where the dog lives, and every other facet of the relationship.  It's a weird power structure which does not allow consent.  This is why incest is viewed the way it is, however incest is not to mention the fact that the dog is less emotionally and mentally mature than the human.

There is no such power structure with dog to dog, or human to human 

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 01:45:27 :

But in the situation at hand the power structure that you're talking about is reversed. It's not like the human is deciding if/when to have sex with the dog, it's the other way around. How would the human manipulate the dog if the dog is the one initiating sex? This does allow consent because the dog has consented to sex by initiating it, and the human had the capacity to accept this.

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-18 01:49:54 :

Would you say the same thing about a child initiating sex with an adult?  If no, then why?  Both have diminished mental capacity, both and much more immature.

Both do not know and cannot understand the consequences of their action.

The manipulation is chronic, not a one time thing.  Their whole relationship is based on manipulation.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 02:39:46 :

I've already explained why children can't have sex until a certain age. Would you then say that it's immoral for a dog to have sex with another dog since both dogs have a diminished mental capacity and don't understand the consequences of their actions? If not, then do you think that two children having sex is ok even though they have a diminished metal capacity and don't understand the consequences of their actions?

&gt;Would it be morally acceptable for two dogs to have sex? If so, is it then acceptable for two children to have sex, since you want to compare dogs to children?

Yes, it is morally acceptable because there is no power dymanic that compromises consent.  

Notice how that is the exact same thing and the comment to which you replied that I'm ""dodging the questions""

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 03:30:47 :

What power dynamic would there be between two children? If the power dynamic is the only reason why it's unacceptable for dogs and humans to have sex, then how does this factor in to two children having sex where there is no power dynamic?

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-18 03:32:56 :

Exactly, there is none.  There is no power dymanic between two small children and none between two dogs or two adults.  Mix and match and we might run into some problems.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 03:37:54 :

So your argument for not allowing a dog and a human to have sex centers around the idea that there is a power dynamic between them, but it's ok for two children to have sex because there isn't a power dynamic between them?

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-18 03:43:34 :

For animals and humans, there is a power dynamic paired with the difference in mental and emotional maturity.  It's ""ok"" for children to have sex mainly because even though they both aren't legally able to consent, one isn't able to consent more than the other.  

Also, there is the argument that small children and dogs can't fully understand the consequences of their actions (specifcally dogs&amp;humans, small childrenx2, and smallchildren&amp;dogs)  It is in the dogs instinct to have sex with other dogs, not to have sex with humans

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 03:49:14 :

First of all no, it isn't ok for children to have sex (and by children I'm taking about children who aren't sexually mature). Now, if it's in the dogs instinct to have sex with other dogs, then why do dogs hump humans in the same sexual manner that they do to other dogs when they have sex?

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-18 03:55:54 :

&gt;First of all no, it isn't ok for children to have sex (and by children I'm taking about children who aren't sexually mature).

That's why I used quotation marks.  I don't support children having sex with each other but I don't believe either one did wrong since they don't understand the consequences

&gt;Now, if it's in the dogs instinct to have sex with other dogs, then why do dogs hump humans in the same sexual manner that they do to other dogs when they have sex?

You're misunderstanding.  It's in the dogs nature to make puppies with another dog.  This is one of the the reasons why dogs having sex is okay.  Just because that instinct translates to another behavior does not mean it is still okay.

No, once again because of the mental difference.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-18 21:54:07 :

There obviously isn't as much of a mental difference as you think since dolphins already have sex for pleasure.

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-19 01:04:33 :

I never said it wasn't.  I said it barely mattered since the rest of the brain is so different.  I'm sure we can find plenty of brain similarities between a zebra and a human, but that doesn't mean they have similar mental capacity/maturity.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-19 01:25:05 :

So do you think that humans are the only species that are mentally mature enough to have sex with each other for pleasure?

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-19 01:59:23 :

Humans are the only species mentally mature enough to have sex with humans.  Dolphins are mentally mature enough to have sex with dolphins.    Dolphins are not mentally mature enough to have sex with humans.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-03-19 02:06:07 :

Having sex for pleasure simply means having sex because it feels good. Why does a species need to have a certain mental capacity to make another species feel good? I don't see what mental maturity has to do with cross-species sex.

Having sex for pleasure simply means having sex because it feels good.  Why does a human needs to be a certain age to make another human feel good?  I don't see what mental maturity has to do with large-age-gap sex.

It's because they cannot understand the consequences.  They cannot understand how it will affect them.  They cannot understand their mental response late.  

No consent is to lack positive consent.  It doesn't have be a no, whether with words or claws.

Children aren't physically mature enough to have sex, as well as the fact that they don't fully understand the consequences of an accidental pregnancy in our society. Humans can't reproduce with other animals, so what negative consequences are there? Also, if an animal initiates sex it is connecting to sex. If animals can't positively consent to other animals, then wouldn't that make any sexual activity between animals immoral?

You are ignoring all of the psychological consequences, and the physical if the male is a human.

&gt;If animals can't positively consent to other animals, then wouldn't that make any sexual activity between animals immoral?

They can.  Their sexual instincts match up with each other.  Sex with those of the same species is different than with a different species.  Our brains and sexual instincts aren't made to deal with inter-special sex, and vice versa.

Like what?

Also, if the sexual differences between humans and other animals don't match up, then why have there been cases of dolphins trying to have sex with humans? Or why do dogs hump their owners?

--------------------------------

santa_cloud @ 2014-03-19 02:54:46 :

&gt;Like what?

There have been cases of animals showing rape-victim like behaviors, like keeping distance and being uncomfortable to touch, when an animal has sex with a human.  As for physical, I don't understand how you don't understand.  Animals are smaller, and therefore have smaller openings for a penis to enter.  This is why evidence of rape is often found as tearing in the vagina or anus, because the penis is too big for the opening and therefore cause harm.

&gt; Also, if the sexual differences between humans and other animals don't match up, then why have there been cases of dolphins trying to have sex with humans? Or why do dogs hump their owners?

I said this in another comment.  All animals, including humans, have an instinct to sexually reproduce.  This where the humping action comes in.  Just because the instinct in its natural state does not carry any direct adverse consequences, does not mean the action translated to another scenario is just as okay.  

I'm not arguing sexual instincts, at its base isn't similar, I'm saying that the nature and practice of sex for each animal is different and when applied to another animal it will bring harm.

Are these cases when the human initiates sex or when sex is initiated by the animal. Also, there are plenty of animals that are bigger than humans, like dolphins for example. Do you think it's wrong for a person who is 7 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds to have sex with a person who is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds?

The nature and practice of sex between humans is different as well depending on the people. Is it immoral for people to have sex who do it differently?

I don't remember, nor do I think it really matters.  If it was initiated by the animal but the human still continued, I'm still arguing that's wrong.  If the animal had sex with the human against their will, then that's a different story.

&gt; Do you think it's wrong for a person who is 7 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds to have sex with a person who is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds?

No my point wasn't that it's wrong to have sex with beings bigger, my point was that it could cause physical harm.

You're underestimating the different mating rituals and sex practices.  This isn't one being more kinky than the other.

I don't see why this is wrong if both parties have connected (with the animal consenting by initiating sex). Obviously an animal having sex against their will, but that isn't what we're discussing.

In terms of sex causing physical harm, this can happen as a result of two humans having sex as well. If a girl who has never had sex has sex with a man who has a large penis, this has the potential to cause the kind of harm you're talking about to her vagina. Does that make these two people having sex immoral? Also, my point was to demonstrate that not only are there animals that are bigger than humans to counter your point that animals are smaller than humans, but that there are also humans that are much larger than other humans as well.

You're also underestimating the different sex practices that exist within our own species."	"[deleted] @ 2014-03-19 15:09:14 :

&gt; They are not consenting because they mentally cannot consent.

By initiating sex an animal is connecting to sex. Just because an animal can't tell a human that it consents to sex doesn't mean it can't consent through non-verbal communication. This is different from a child who isn't mature enough to connect to sex. Also, the comparisons that your making to animals that behead their partners doesn't really apply since this is generally done by insects that humans wouldn't be able to have sex with in the first place. Stop making false comparisons.

An animal will never be mature enough to consent to sex with humans.   This is not about being able to verbally consent, it's being able to consent at all.  They are not mentally mature enough to consent to sex with a human, less so than even a child could.

&gt;Also, the comparisons that your making to animals that behead their partners doesn't really apply since this is generally done by insects that humans wouldn't be able to have sex with in the first place. Stop making false comparisons.

I'm not comparing anything.  I'm using them to show the different sex rituals between species, while also proving that the differences between humans are must less than the inter-special differences.

If we agree that veganism is a human construct then if all vegans in the world agree that breast milk is okay then perhaps it is the definition that is wrong, no? You know that the average vegan is not going to be looking at breast milk as an animal-derived product and you know that most people say animal meaning non-humans. Whether that is *technically* incorrect or not doesn't even vaguely matter as all you are doing is arguing semantics. 

For all intents and purposes, a child who eats and uses no other animal derived products than human breast milk is, essentially, vegan. You know that, stop arguing semantics and move on.

&gt;Thought experiment: Would vegans tolerate the consumption of products from a farm of volunteer humans?

The idea of volunteer humans is just not really realistic enough to properly have as a thought experiment. Having said that, however, as a vegetarian, aside from the extremely gross factor of eating human meat, if in this hypothetical scenario it was genuinely voluntary and there we no ethical issues then yeah I would not be opposed to eating human meat. Again, apart from the fact that it would gross me the fuck out.

Also assuming there was no environmental impact from this ""human farm"" as that is my personal reason for being vegetarian.

Just look at the idea of lab-grown meat, I would imagine the vast majority of vegans are okay with that, certainly vegetarians are but perhaps some vegans aren't due to the more new-agey hippy types being more common in that subset."	1	0	stop arguing comment					"I am on the fence about forced vegetarianism on children by parents, but forced veganism is wrong on so many levels. I am aware that vegans claim that vegan diets are healthy, but since vegans are against any product which is produced by an animal, they don't even let their kids drink milk or eat cheese. I am all for parental rights, but a vegan diet is simply too restrictive.

Meat provides protean in much larger doses than what is found in vegan food, even dairy products have far more calcium and protein than anything vegans eat. I am fine if vegan parents want to encourage veganism, but the child should at the very least have the option to eat meat and/or dairy products. Also, eggs provide many more health benefits than vegan food.

As a final statement, I am not against a healthy diet, but children should have the option to eat meat, dairy products, and eggs rather than be forced to only eat vegan food. Also, I am fine with parents limiting portions, however as long as the parents can afford to buy meat, dairy products, and eggs, the child should have the option to eat that rather than a vegan diet.

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

&gt;It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Everyone ""forces"" diets on their children, because children would choose a diet of candy if the choice was theirs. A vegan diet is perfectly healthy, and if a parent feels it is the best option for ethical, environmental, or health reasons, then they shouldn't be expected to choose differently.

--------------------------------

h76CH36 @ 2014-06-13 11:52:43 :

I'm not really sure that I trust the American Dietetic Association's opinion here considering that they are funded by companies like McDonald's, PepsiCo, The Coca Cola Company, Sara Lee, Abbott Nutrition, General Mills, Kellogg's, Mars, McNeil Nutritionals, SOYJOY, Truvia, Unilever, and The Sugar Association.

It's possible that they may be ever so slightly biased. 

Also, the suggestion that infants don't need milk should be setting off alarms for you. Although that passage is nebulous (perhaps purposefully so?) as to whether they are endorsing veganism or vegetarianism in the case of infants. So either they are kinda full of it (saying infants can be fine without milk) or they are *not* saying that a vegan diet is always appropriate for parents to force on their children. Either way, it's not really refuting OP. 

Finally, I don't think they have sufficient evidence to comment on this. AFAIK, there is no population which generally practices veganism (especially in the case of infants and small children), making population scale studies impossible. Thus, their population-scale claims are, at best, unfounded and, at worst, reckless. Individual studies meanwhile tend to turn up [dead kids](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1371172/French-vegan-couple-face-jail-child-neglect-baby-died-vitamin-deficiency.html).

ˈvēgən,ˈvejən

noun

A person who does not eat or use animal products.

Well, that seems to seal it as breast milk is undeniably an animal product. Thus, going on OPs stated view, one must convince them that infants are not better off with breastmilk, which is going to be a tough sell.

It depends on what classes and professors you take. If you take bs classes then it really isn't impressive. Also I know really smart people who don't give a damn and dont study at all and get a 3.4 GPA, but they dont care to study, so that is ok with them. And i know people who try their absolute hardest and get a 3.6. Its all relative. I myself, failed 2 midterms in my geography class, and still got an A. In my film class, barely showed up got an A. In my calculus class, my teacher was super hard, we had so much homework, hand written test, hard grading, i got a B, yet my other friends luckily got a easy teacher who let them use notes on test, gave study guides, extra credit, barely any homework, and the majority of them got an A yet barely understand the material, yet a got a B and have a superior understanding of the material because of my professor. It was a 5 unit class, so my B actually dropped my GPA, and im sure their A raised theirs. So GPA really isnt a good indicator. It just a general indicator. We can only assume people with 3.0+ are relatively good students, but it is a stretch to try and differentiate between a 3.3 and 3.7, too many variables at play. And dont forget all the cheaters also.

On an individual and anecdotal basis, there isn't much of a concrete difference between 3.3 and a 3.7 GPA. Would you stop arguing that? No one is disagreeing with you.

Overall a 3.7 gpa student is more likely going to be a better candidate than a 3.3 gpa student. Period. That is not true in every single individual case so you can tell me about your life stories all day, it doesn't matter. 

But you're right, GPA alone is not a good indicator of how qualified someone is. What GPA is representing in this argument is ""how quantitatively qualified someone is to do this task"". Something that is very imperfect. But if you look overall, a person who has the higher scores on the tests is more likely to be the person who is more knowledgeable, is more likely to be the person who did the reading and isn't going to miss that little detail later on, and is the person who is more likely to get their work done at the job because they're more likely the person who studied more and did their homework.

&gt;Everybody has to meet the minimum requirements first, then affirmative action comes into play. You fail to see this. And yes please, dont reply because i do not want to waste my time reading your lazy poor responses mis characterizing affirmative action, due to you never even glancing at its actual meaning and practice.

Just because they both meet the minimum requirements doesn't mean that one isn't the better candidate. If you had a school that accepts a minimum of 3.7 gpa but has limited positions, and the last spot was between a student who is at a 3.7 gpa and another who is at a 4.0 gpa and they have otherwise similar qualifications outside of gpa, then the smart choice is to pick the 4.0 gpa one. Right? They won't know whether or not that will end up being the best choice because they don''t get to play out both scenarios, but if they're making the statistical best decision to get the better student, then the 4.0 is the obvious choice. If affirmative actions would result in the 3.7 being picked over the 4.0 gpa then the school is choosing the morel likely to be worse candidate. This can matter a lot if you're talking about a difficult job that is constantly pushing the limits of the employees.


I don't even disagree with the merits of affirmative action, and you immediately assumed a lot because I was picking apart the logic of one of your arguments. I'm not even trying to say overall whether affirmative action is good or not because we're not considering all the factors here. I'm just outlining why affirmative action can result in the worse candidate being chosen."	1	0	stop arguing comment					"The statement ""affirmative action is wrong"" is very subjective. This can be twisted in many ways. For the purpose of intellectual honesty, we should argue whether affirmative action helps minorities more than it hurts those in the majority. We should also examine whether or not injury to the majority is such that affirmative action is unjust, regardless of its positive affect on minorities.

I would argue that though there are examples of affirmative action being injurious to the very organization employing it, there are far greater examples of affirmative action helping society overall. This may be indicative of the application of affirmative action in different settings, but the overall intent of affirmative action, as well as the primary benefits are not ""wrong"" by any measure I can think of.

Opponents make a misguided attempt to show that affirmative action is wrong based on emotional appeals, and irrelevant statements about one group that has benefited from affirmative action (blacks). They further implies those in the majority ""suffer"" from affirmative action. Opponents also imply that affirmative action is some kind of punishment against whites for having enslaved blacks. All these statements are based on a misguided interpretation of how affirmative action works, and who it benefits.

According to the National Council on State Legislatures, President John F. Kennedy first coined the term in an Executive Order urging that contractors use ""affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."" This led to the establishment of the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), and EEO policies in the workplace. Lyndon Johnson later issued his own Executive Order requiring contractors to raise their number of minority workers. Colleges and Universities later executed similar policies in recruiting in order to boost their number of minority students. (1)

The argument that simple policies somehow hurt whites as a whole is a very frivolous argument. For centuries, whites have held a monopoly on legislation, law enforcement, education, politics, finance, and land ownership. During the ""New Deal,"" according to the book ""When Affirmative Action was White,"" 65% of African Americans were denied benefits. During and after WWII, while black military members had trouble receiving even the benefits they earned like the GI Bill, recent immigrants from Eastern Europe experienced a revolutionary transformation in their citizenship status. (2)

In a country where the wealth gap is growing between whites and minorities, affirmative action is not only beneficial to all, but necessary. In 2005, whites had a median household net worth of $134,992. Hispanics had a median household net worth of $18,359, and black had a median household net worth of $12,124. Just 4 years later, white's median household net worth had fallen to $113,149. For Hispanics, it fell to $6,325, and for blacks it fell to $5,677. A third of Hispanic and black households in 2009 had a zero or negative net worth in 2009, while only 15% of blacks fit that profile. (3)

It is important to note, also, that the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action are not black, rather white women. White women, like blacks, once couldn't vote, and once were considered property. Thanks to affirmative action, the number of women (mostly white women) has grown in the following areas (and more):
"" The percentage of women architects increased from 3% to nearly 19% of the total;

"" The percentage of women doctors more than doubled from 10% to 22% of all doctors;

"" The percentage of women lawyers grew from 4% to 23% of the national total;

"" The percentage of female engineers went from less than 1% to nearly 9%;

"" The percentage of female chemists grew from 10% to 30% of all chemists; and

"" The percentage of female college faculty went from 28% to 42% of all faculty. (4)

It would seem to me that affirmative action is not ""wrong,"" rather beneficial to those it is intended to aid, and largely harmless to those who perceive it as ""wrong.""

which means they don't need affirmative action.

Take the jump in Doctors - 10% to 22% (over a period you never specified), and a sample of 100 doctors.

at the 10%, its safe to assume that all 100 doctor got there on merit (or another factor like rich parents or whatever that remains constant over the period so its not reasonable to account for)

At 22%, there are now 12 more women. How many people were there on merit? Its not 12 - if that were true, we wouldn't need affirmative action. Which means there is at least 1 person who isn't there on merit - thus weakening the pool. And its especially true for doctors - people have fucking died because doctors who were there based on skin color or genitals and not merit were in.

Yea, there is going to be *few* who are in not based on their merit. But this is where the gray area comes in. Lets say you needed at least a 3.5 GPA to get into a particular med school. And person B who is a woman or minority got a 3.35 GPA, and got in solely due to affirmative action. 

What really is the intellectual difference between someone who has a 3.5GPA and a 3.3? Really? of even a 3.7? GPA is not indicative of intelligence. There are a handful of people in Medical School who struggled academically in their biochemistry classes, genomics, pathology etc, but they make **excellent** doctors. 

There are *Whiz doctors* that kill people all the time too. I think your singling out a particular group to reinforce your bias.

Maybe if you compare two individual people with a 3.5 and 3.3 gpa there may not be much of a difference, but if you take the collective of all people with a 3.5 gpa and a 3.3 gpa, your average person of group 3.5 is going to be smarter and work harder than your average person of group 3.3 if GPA holds any meaning at all on intelligence and work ethic (which talking overall it certainly does). In that case, by very definition if you're hiring a lower average gpa because of AA then you're lowering the average intelligence/work ethic for your employee.

If you're going to argue anything, then it should be that the ends (equality) justify the means (reducing quality of the average skilled worker than its potential)

inconspicuous_bear @ 2014-06-29 18:34:21 :

Excuse me? Personal attacks are very weak, and for what its worth I am a college student.

Second of all, you're putting words in my mouth. Did I say that someone with a 3.5 gpa works much harder than a person with a 3.3 gpa? No I absolutely did not because obviously the difference isn't massive but there is a difference. 

If GPA has any correlation to how hard a person works at all, and without a doubt it does if you consider the average of all people, then you're lowering the overall quality if you take a lower gpa on the basis of race alone UNLESS by being that minority race you become more qualified for the job somehow. If you spend even a shred of thought on it and stop being so stubborn and combative with anyone who disagrees with anything you say then you'll realize this is obviously true. I don't even know what else to say, I'm not going to be replying to you anymore, this CMV is pointless.

YoungAthleticOne @ 2014-06-29 18:50:33 :

 &gt;No I absolutely did not because obviously the difference isn't massive but there is a difference.

There could be a difference, there could be not. It depends on what classes and professors you take. If you take bs classes then it really isn't impressive. Also I know really smart people who don't give a damn and dont study at all and get a 3.4 GPA, but they dont care to study, so that is ok with them. And i know people who try their absolute hardest and get a 3.6. Its all relative. I myself, failed 2 midterms in my geography class, and still got an A. In my film class, barely showed up got an A. In my calculus class, my teacher was super hard, we had so much homework, hand written test, hard grading, i got a B, yet my other friends luckily got a *easy* teacher who let them *use notes* on test, gave study guides, extra credit, barely *any* homework, and the majority of them got an A yet barely understand the material, yet a got a B and have a superior understanding of the material because of my professor. It was a 5 unit class, so my B actually dropped my GPA, and im sure their A raised theirs. So GPA really isnt a good indicator. It just a general indicator. We can only assume people with 3.0+ are relatively good students, but it is a stretch to try and differentiate between a 3.3 and 3.7, too many variables at play. And dont forget all the cheaters also.

&gt;If GPA has any correlation to how hard a person works at all, and without a doubt it does if you consider the average of all people, then you're lowering the overall quality if you take a lower gpa on the basis of race alone UNLESS by being that minority race you become more qualified for the job somehow.

Nah its just that your wrong. Not that I disagree. You didnt do your homework. You keep mis characterizing affirmative action as taking ""unqualified people for jobs their not qualified for by choosing on the basis of race alone"", that shows me how much you didn't read, by giving lazy responses with no intellectual effort made on your part to actually understanding what affirmative action is.

Everybody has to meet the **minimum** requirements first, then affirmative action comes into play. You fail to see this. And yes please, dont reply because i do not want to waste my time reading your lazy poor responses mis characterizing affirmative action, due to you never even glancing at its actual meaning and practice."	"YoungAthleticOne @ 2014-06-29 21:56:01 :

&gt; just because they both meet the minimum requirements doesn't mean that one isn't the better candidate. If you had a school that accepts a minimum of 3.7 gpa but has limited positions, and the last spot was between a student who is at a 3.7 gpa and another who is at a 4.0 gpa and they have otherwise similar qualifications outside of gpa, then the smart choice is to pick the 4.0 gpa one. Right? 

Did'nt you just refute yourself in own post? You said: 
""On an individual and anecdotal basis, there isn't much of a concrete difference between 3.3 and a 3.7 GPA. Would you stop arguing that? No one is disagreeing with you.""

&gt;They won't know whether or not that will end up being the best choice because they don't get to play out both scenarios, but if they're making the statistical best decision to get the better student, then the 4.0 is the obvious choice. If affirmative actions would result in the 3.7 being picked over the 4.0 gpa then the school is choosing the more likely to be worse candidate.

If they meet the minimum requirements, then their both qualified. And like I said, you specifically said and agree that there is not concrete difference between high GPAs, yet went on to argue based on that. So what exactly are you trying to argue?

&gt;I'm just outlining why affirmative action can result in the worse candidate being chosen.

By whos standards? Yours? Give me a real example assuming two candidates meet the minimum requirements. Use Medical school as an example or something.

No, I'm talking OVERALL a person with a 3.7 gpa is ON AVERAGE a harder worker than someone with a 3.3 gpa. This does not mean that every individual person with a 3.7 gpa works harder than every person with a 3.3 gpa.

GPA is not a precise exact indicator. Read this again.

&gt;But if you look overall, a person who has the higher scores on the tests is more likely to be the person who is more knowledgeable, is more likely to be the person who did the reading and isn't going to miss that little detail later on, and is the person who is more likely to get their work done at the job because they're more likely the person who studied more and did their homework.

There are a lot of reasons why a person may have a worse gpa that don't necessarily correlate to work ethic, but those factors apply to both the people with high gpa and low gpa, so overall on average the biggest difference between a high gpa and low gpa is that your average higher gpa person works harder than your average lower gpa person. Again, individual cases this may not always be true, but overall yes.

&gt;If they meet the minimum requirements, then their both qualified. 

Oh okay, so when you apply to a school they should look for all the people who meet the minimum standards and then pick who fills all the spots by pulling names form a hat. No. They pick the best of their choices. Affirmative action is by definition causing them to pick not based upon the best choices but upon race instead.

&gt;By whos standards? Yours? Give me a real example assuming two candidates meet the minimum requirements. Use Medical school as an example or something.

I literally already did exactly that in the last post:
&gt;If you had a school that accepts a minimum of 3.7 gpa but has limited positions, and the last spot was between a student who is at a 3.7 gpa and another who is at a 4.0 gpa and they have otherwise similar qualifications outside of gpa, then the smart choice is to pick the 4.0 gpa one. Right? They won't know whether or not that will end up being the best choice because they don';t get to play out both scenarios, but if they're making the statistical best decision to get the better student, then the 4.0 is the obvious choice. If affirmative actions would result in the 3.7 being picked over the 4.0 gpa then the school is choosing the morel likely to be worse candidate. 

A student with a 4.0 gpa is more likely a better student then a student than the 3.7 gpa. There is no guarentee of it because, as I said, every individual person with a 3.7 gpa is not a worse student than every student with a 4.0 gpa, but if they are going for the best students they are more likely to get a worse candidate by picking the 3.7 instead of the 4.0

First off your not even qualified to comment on how university admissions officers pick their students and the justification for doing so since you aren't one. Who knows why or how they pick their students. The only criteria is meeting the minimum requirements, if the respective university felt having a 3.7 was such a good thing, then the minimum would be a 3.7 to get into their respective program. Some universities might pick all else being equal a black kid with a 3.7 GPA over a white kid with a 3.7 GPA only because the kid is black. And i have no problem with that. The respective admissions officers already know they have a bunch of white kids at their school already, so the black kid is a much more interesting pick to that particular university, plain and simple. Its their choice, not yours. Don't matter what you think is *right*, because that is your idea of right.

But also, the points you are trying to make aren't doing anything in regards to disproving affirmative action. Tell me why you think affirmative action is a **bad** thing, and *harmful*, from an *objective perspective*, other than your personal philosophy and self-righteous indignation based on experiences you never lived.

(1) tell me who specifically it is harming and why. And then explain its mechanisms

(2)Tell me what is your race, and what class did you grow up in, and why disadvantaged blacks, hispanics etc should listen to you (if you are a white) if you are a person who was never born into poverty.

&gt;Secondly, why are miscarriages irrelevant?

To THIS discussion about abortion. It's the equivalent of saying ""Premature deaths of natural causes are irrelevant to a graph depicting ages of murder victims.""

&gt;You have admitted that it isn't yet a person and that it won't become one if she has an abortion. In these instances, no person is harmed.

it's ridiculous to value the comfort of a woman for nine months over the entire life of a soon to be baby.

I quite clearly said ""the comfort,"" I never said ""only a bit of discomfort.""

It's quite clear you disagree, but I've expressed my belief that abortion is ending a life, so yes, I don't like the way she takes responsibility.

&gt;It honestly seems like you just want to punish women for their sexuality.

If men and women were exactly the same physically and mentally as they are now, but with switched genitalia, I would think the same thing about abortion. It has nothing to do with women alone.

&gt;You seem to think she should be punished for that. You have not given any justification for this.

If the only two options are responsibility for the fetus, or ending the life, I do believe that the woman should have to choose responsibility. Now you might say this infringes on the woman's freedom. I say it infringes on the woman's freedom the same way laws against theft and murder infringe on the freedom of everybody.

It is completely reasonable for a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy for ANY reason. It is her body, so she gets to decide what happens to it.

What is hateful and horrible is the idea that she should be required to carry the child to term, regardless of the health of the fetus.

--------------------------------

numb3red @ 2014-08-14 02:31:41 :

Apparently, we should start ending lives so that people don't have to take responsibility for their actions? What the fuck?

--------------------------------

Dulousaci @ 2014-08-14 04:22:15 :

Why do you arbitrarily define life as starting at conception? 98.8% of abortions happen in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (89% within 12), yet it takes ~24 weeks for a fetus to even develop the brain function required to distinguish pain stimuli, let alone hold a conscious thought. There is zero harm in abortion, yet there is massive harm in giving birth.

Life doesn't begin at conception. Life has been going on for millions of years, without interruption; it only changes form. In the case of humans, the sperm and egg are alive well before they come together to form a blastocyst, a fetus, an infant, a child, an adult, a sperm or egg, etc... The point at which you are choosing to define life as ""starting"" is not only arbitrary, but extremely abusive toward women. If she decides she doesn't want to have a child, she shouldn't have to. No child is harmed. It is literally impossible to harm them at that point.

numb3red @ 2014-08-14 06:54:35 :

Without anything happening to the mother, and without an abortion, that fetus WILL develop into an infant. If you were aborted within 24 weeks of conception, you wouldn't be here today, and that's still being dead. But by your logic, it would've been fine if you were aborted.

--------------------------------

Dulousaci @ 2014-08-14 13:01:18 :

If I were aborted, I wouldn't exist to care about it. I wouldn't be dead, I would simply have never been ""alive"". I mean this in the colloquial sense, since life has not ceased since it first started.

You very clearly state that it WILL develop into an infant, not that it is one. Potential != actual. The fact remains that the fetus doesn't care at this point, but the mother certainly does. You are saying that it is OK to do actual harm to an actual human being in order to prevent ""harm"" from befalling a clump of cells with no higher brain function.

What is it that you value about humans? I'm not being facetious; I have an obvious answer to this question. When you understand what it is that gives human beings their value, then you will know when to start treating them like it.

EDIT: Not that it should even matter if the fetus were a person, since the mother should still have have the right to refuse the use of her body. And don't give me any of that trash about ""she volunteered"". If a person volunteers to give someone their kidney, we let them change their mind. Why should a fetus have more rights than the kidney recipient?

--------------------------------

numb3red @ 2014-08-14 17:45:06 :

I don't see why an individual life should be defined by whether or not they've become conscious yet, because the fetus *will* develop consciousness, *will* be born and *will* live. Regardless of if they have the ability to care about being aborted then, they most certainly will later. 

I can understand abortions with a serious threat to the life of the mother, but it's ridiculous to value the comfort of a woman for nine months over the entire life of a soon to be baby. 

And in terms of the woman volunteering, your example is flawed. With the kidney donor, the recipient's position they've been put in is not the fault of the donor. However, with pregnancy, the mother has decided to create another human being, and if not giving birth meant so much to her, she could have just gotten protection.

&gt;I don't see why an individual life should be defined by whether or not they've become conscious yet, because the fetus will develop consciousness, will be born and will live.

And if you go back a little farther, the egg *will* live, and the egg *will* live. This is meaningless. It is not a person at that moment, therefore the rights of humans do not apply. Not that that should even matter, since the woman shouldn't be compelled to carry it even if it were.

&gt; Regardless of if they have the ability to care about being aborted then, they most certainly will later.

If they are aborted, then they most certainly will not care later. You are arguing against harm that won't be possible.

&gt;it's ridiculous to value the comfort of a woman for nine months over the entire life of a soon to be baby.

You clearly do not have a grasp of the concept of potential vs actual. ""Soon to be"" is not the same as ""is"". There is no child at this point. If the abortion happens, there never will be that child. No child is harmed by abortion. You are taking rights from people over ""what if"". You even say so in your phrasing.

Also, if you think pregnancy is only a bit of discomfort, you need a biology (and psychology and economics) lesson.

&gt;However, with pregnancy, the mother has decided to create another human being, and if not giving birth meant so much to her, she could have just gotten protection.

You do not know that she decided to create another person, only that she engaged in an activity that most people find enjoyable. Sex is **not** just about procreation. Protection sometimes fails. People make mistakes. I think it is safe to say that since we are discussing abortion, that the mother has decided **NOT** to create another human being.

&gt;With the kidney donor, the recipient's position they've been put in is not the fault of the donor.

Allowing the fetus to use her body is something the woman is offering. The fetus didn't even exist before that. Everything the fetus is has been given to it. Are you saying that the woman is doing harm to the fetus by allowing it to exist in the first place? This view just makes no sense to me. It doesn't even make sense in the analogy, since even if the kidney recipient had needed the kidney because the donor had stabbed them, we still wouldn't require the donor to give up their kidney.

EDIT: You still haven't answered my question. What it is that gives human beings their value?

--------------------------------

numb3red @ 2014-08-15 06:45:48 :

&gt;And if you go back a little farther, the egg will live, and the egg will live.

If the woman never has sex, then the egg won't become a child. Conception is the point where the new life has been set in motion, and as I said, if not aborted/injured/starved it will become a baby. (With the exception of miscarriages, which are unrelated to this discussion.)

&gt;If they are aborted, then they most certainly will not care later.

What I was saying was if NOT aborted, the person would undeniably be grateful that they weren't.

&gt;You clearly do not have a grasp of the concept of potential vs actual. ""Soon to be"" is not the same as ""is"". There is no child at this point. If the abortion happens, there never will be that child.

I covered this with my first response.

I never said ""only a bit of discomfort.""

&gt;You do not know that she decided to create another person, only that she engaged in an activity that most people find enjoyable. Sex is not just about procreation. Protection sometimes fails. People make mistakes.

Shouldn't people be held responsible for their mistakes? There are condoms AND contraceptives readily available in developed countries.

Are you saying that the woman is doing harm to the fetus by allowing it to exist in the first place? This view just makes no sense to me. It doesn't even make sense in the analogy, since even if the kidney recipient had needed the kidney because the donor had stabbed them, we still wouldn't require the donor to give up their kidney.

If the donor stabbed the recipient, then they have put the recipient in the position of needing help from the donor. But even in the analogy, this doesn't equate to the mother putting the fetus into the world in the first place, entirely reliant on the mother.

&gt;What it is that gives human beings their value?

The potential to live a good life, accomplish and improve, and to help others.

Dulousaci @ 2014-08-15 12:02:37 :

&gt;Conception is the point where the new life has been set in motion, and as I said, if not aborted/injured/starved it will become a baby. (With the exception of miscarriages, which are unrelated to this discussion.)

Potential != actual. You are arguing what if again. No employer gives value to a *potential* college degree that a high school graduate might get in a few years. The fetus could just as easily grow up to be a rapist or serial killer.

Secondly, why are miscarriages irrelevant? 70% of conceptions end in miscarriage. We could very quickly reduce this number, yet we don't put many resources into it. If the potential for life were something to be valued by itself, this would be a much bigger priority. The 70% number casts significant doubt on your ""it **will** become a baby"". You claiming that it is irrelevant, especially while bringing it up yourself, is dishonest.

&gt;What I was saying was if NOT aborted, the person would undeniably be grateful that they weren't.

Doesn't matter. I'm sure the kidney recipient would undeniably be grateful for the kidney. This isn't about how nice it would be for her to lend her body to the fetus, it is about not forcing her to do so. 

&gt;I covered this with my first response.

No, you did not. You have admitted that it isn't yet a person and that it won't become one if she has an abortion. In these instances, no person is harmed.


&gt;I never said ""only a bit of discomfort.""

Since you seem to have a very poor memory:

&gt;it's ridiculous to value the comfort of a woman for nine months over the entire life of a soon to be baby.

.

&gt;Shouldn't people be held responsible for their mistakes?

Abortion **is** taking responsibility. The entire point is to deal with the consequences of having sex. Not liking the way that she takes responsibility does not mean that she isn't taking responsibility. It honestly seems like you just want to punish women for their sexuality.

&gt;But even in the analogy, this doesn't equate to the mother putting the fetus into the world in the first place, entirely reliant on the mother.

You seem to think she should be punished for that. You have not given any justification for this. The woman is not qualitatively different from the stabbing donor. In both situations the ""victim"" is in that situation entirely by the actions of another, and the ""perpetrator"" is the only one who can save them. Again, this just seems like you want to punish women. I will admit it isn't the best analogy, but only because it equates ""having sex"" with ""stabbing someone"", which should make my point all the more obvious. I'm sure I don't need to explain that difference.

&gt;The potential to live a good life, accomplish and improve, and to help others.

This can apply just as well to the unfertilized egg. Try again. Also, Hitler had the *potential* to live a good life.

For me, the answer is the capability of conscious thought. Abortions happen long before this point, so they cause no harm. You have by your own words admitted that a fetus is only potentially going to become a person. Choosing not to create a person, while causing no harm to actual people, should not be a punishable act.

EDIT: I'll make it easier for you. Here are the things you need to convince me of in order to change my view:

1. An **actual** person is harmed. Potential doesn't count, and by your own admission, a fetus only has potential to become a person.

2. The harm caused to that person outweighs the harm caused by taking away the woman's bodily autonomy."

**EDIT:** Somehow I mis-worded this so poorly that it became an off topic discussion about Gender Identity. That's not the case.

What I want to know is why the pronouns Ze, Ey or Xe, etc, need to exist as gender neutral pronouns when gender neutral pronouns such as They, Them, Their, It, Its' and It's already exist. What is the point of making up a word to describe yourself when the appropriate word already exists?

Are they meant to describe different levels of gender neutrality? Does Ze mean ""A person with a woman's breasts and a man's penis""? Does Ey mean ""A person with a vagina, but no breasts""? Does Xe mean ""A person without breast, penis or vagina""? If not, what is the point of these words when the word They already described a gender neutral person?

Ok, I'm transgender, and the amount of times I've ever ran into someone who actually uses gender neutral pronouns has been a big fat zero. Do I have any gripes about these pronouns? Doesn't matter, because at the off chance I'll ever run into someone who uses them, it's hardly going to be any skin off my nose. So, if I as a transgender person have never known anyone who uses gender neutral pronouns, then how often is the average person going to encounter them? Seems to me like you're making a big deal out of something that's probably not worrying about. 

--------------------------------

BenIncognito @ 2014-08-28 11:48:06 :

This summed up my views on the issue very well. I hear more about people whining about ""xe"" and ""xir"" (or whatever) than I've ever heard people actually request they be used. I will call anyone whatever they want to be called, it's easy and most people do it for me (like call me Ben instead of the name I was born with, Benjamin), and yet it just never comes up.

The weirdest I've ever had to endure was an acquaintance who wanted to be called ""Psycho."" And it was not a big deal at all.

--------------------------------

Stanislawiii @ 2014-08-28 12:44:20 :

I wouldn't mind using them so long as it's a single set.  Having 300 different versions of the pronouns IMO negates the reason we have pronouns.  Pronouns are properly used to refer to a person or object without the need to give the name of the person or object every time you reference them.  By having 300 different names, you make it impossible to do that.  If I have to refer to Peter as Xin, Paul as Hen, and John as Xir, then I'm not using a pronoun, I'm just using a second name.  If there's just one, then that doesn't happen.

--------------------------------

BenIncognito @ 2014-08-28 12:54:00 :

I don't mind them at all, and the most I hear about them or think about them is when people are complaining about them. I highly doubt that you've literally seen around 300 different pronouns.

Skavau @ 2014-08-28 14:16:57 :

No, but if people accepted the pronoun movement (for want of a better word) you could hypothetically be seeing it more. Which would be ridiculous.

&gt; Names are one thing, but why should people expect to have others call them by personalised pronouns? What does that have to do with gender identity?

It has everything to do with gender identity. We call each other by the pronouns of the gender we identify as all the time. I prefer he and him because I identify as a man.

But what if I didn't identify as a man or a woman? Should I have to accept the super-impersonal ""they"" (where it always sounds like you're talking about some hypothetical or unknown individual)?

I cannot stress enough how little of an impact being open about alternative pronouns has had on my life.

I didn't suggest that. I have no issue with a standardised gender neutral pronoun.

I first heard about all of these ""tumblr special snowflakes"" *years* before tumblr existed. Strange pronouns, weird genders, otherkin, I think tumblr has just provided an easy place for Internet people to congregate. Used to be they were spread out amongst small niche forums, but tumblr has burst the bubble and now everyone can see them.

Anyway, yeah I think people should be able to set their own pronoun. Because, and I don't say this to be insensitive to anyone's gender struggles, but I just don't care what people want to be called.

I do think it's important to note that the people coming up with nonstandard pronouns are honestly trying pretty hard to make them easy to use. It's not as if they're being totally selfish and unreasonable. All the pronouns still look like pronouns.

So the amount of work people are putting into making these easier for society to accept shows that a) this is actually an important issue to them, not just a joke, and b) that they recognize that people are slow to change.

I say just give it a little time and see. At best, the issue dies out as singular they becomes more accepted, and at worst, we end up with maybe three more pronouns at most added to the standard language.

Sure.

I wouldn't object to using neutral pronouns. Just don't get why being used specific personalised neutral pronouns should be an expectation.



--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2014-08-29 05:06:22 :

Why? Because none have been accepted yet, and the only ones that have had any popularity have had the most criticism. ""Xe/xir"" are probably the most well-known, and the most common argument I've seen has been, ""'Xe'? That's not a real word, I can't pronounce it, and I'll never be able to get used to it! Screw those special snowflake types!"" Which makes sense; if ones like ""ey"" or ""ne"" had had more popularity, people might have been more receptive.

So obviously people will want to make their own solutions. I don't think many people, aside from possibly a few otherkin groups, are intending their pronouns to be personalized. If they are, they don't understand how language works.

But anyway, as we currently have no standard neutral pronoun, there's not much you can do but go with what people ask and hope one eventually catches on. Like, what are your other options here? Insist on calling them ""xe""? Ignore them? Obviously it's completely up to you how to treat people, but I do think acknowledging their gender identity through pronoun usage is generally something that falls under ""nice"".

The ones that begin with ""X"" or ""Z"" do look and feel a little silly to say. Regardless, I'd use them interchangeably as a neutral pronoun if asked, just not a particular one for any individual.

I would agree that men shouldn't rape, but taking precautions for your own safety is smart and necessary. I am a male, and when driving in a strange/unsafe neighborhood, I wouldn't blast music to draw attention to myself or drive an expensive car. Even though doing so wouldn't mean I would ""deserved"" to be robbed, it is important for me to minimize the risk. Similarly, one should look both ways before crossing the street. Even though hitting someone with your car is against the law, you want to minimize the risk by looking both ways to ensure safety.

When I'm at a bar, I too ensure that I am the only one who touches my drink, don't show off jewelry/watches etc. It's just common sense.

Is there any evidence that suggests that wearing revealing clothing makes a woman more likely to be the victim of rape? 

Most of the standard feminist critiques of teaching women self-defense measures (broadly construed) are that those methods are insufficient, or that they provide an easy way to feel like we're doing something about the problem of sexual violence without actually making substantial changes to the attitudes that promote sexual violence. This is to say that feminists don't actually think that it's wrong to teach women to ""keep an eye on [their] drink[s]""; they just think that other programs also need to be in place.

The point is that in these cases, no one is saying that it's not ""smart"" to know basic ways to remain safe, they're just saying that there are systemic issues beyond individuals' knowledge of these safety measures that cause rape. All that being said, it isn't clear at all that women not wearing ""too revealing of clothing"" is even going to contribute to their own safety, regardless of the wider social issues at hand. Why do you think it will?

Thrillwaukee @ 2014-08-30 21:49:50 :

Just to be clear, I don't think someone is ""asking for it"" if she wears provocative clothing, I mean it could easily attract the wrong type of guy.

And no, there are no stats that show provocative clothing leads to rape, but why risk it? The most commonly stolen car in the US is a Honda Accord (this is true), that doesn't mean I'm clear to go into a bad neighborhood with a Lexus.

&gt; And no, there are no stats that show provocative clothing leads to rape, but why risk it? 

Seriously?  You have no evidence to support your suggestion that women dress conservatively, but you suggest it anyway?

Herein lies the problem.  

Women should be able to dress how *they* see fit.  Full stop.

That is the ideal. *Hopefully*, we can agree that is true.

Then, working from the ideal, we should ask if there is sufficient evidence to deviate from this idea. 

By your own admission, we lack this evidence.  Thus, there is no call to advocate that women dress different they how they see fit.

What if someone suggested to you that you should always wear a tie?  Because, you know, you never know if a potential employer is observing you.  

It is a ridiculous suggestion.  And the similar suggestion to women should be met with the same level of ridicule.

At least until evidence is presented otherwise.

Being transgender has a basis in biology. When the human brain is developing it develops differently based on the sex of the baby, and if it's hit with the wrong bath or hormones and chemicals or of there's some other anomaly occurs during development, you could end up with some mismatched wires that lead to your gender identity being flipped. 

There's no such biological mechanism to make a person feel like a wolf or a lizard.

We know that businesses typically have to pay more taxes than the average individual (corporate tax, estate or property tax, sales tax if retail etc.). A business owner must not only pay the taxes their business but also their personal taxes such as income tax. I think lowering a combination of these taxes would generate greater income for a business owner who might otherwise lose money from having to pay his employees more. Of course now the government is generating less tax revenue but if there are more people working for a higher wage there is a lesser need for social programs and welfare. This is in addition to the more taxes that someone making a higher minimum wage would pay.

What you are proposing is basically a tax-fueled subsidy to salaries.  This won't be balanced because a tax reduction benefits many companies that don't employ minimum wage workers and this will give them and edge over those that do.  What you are encouraging here is more outsourcing and passing this problem onto less profitable companies that pay less taxes in the first place.  

--------------------------------

TomShoe @ 2014-10-24 20:36:42 :

Who cares if it's balanced? We want growth here, that means pursuing expansionary fiscal policies, like cutting taxes, like increasing spending. I have no idea why people think one of those options necessarily precludes the other. We should be doing both.

We should be doing many things, but they have different reasons to be, different mechanisms and different effects with different outcomes.  

Minimum wage is one thing, and I agree it should increase despite the drawbacks.  
I am not sure taxes should decrease, it depends on what you want to de-fund or what you want to fund with it.  

Trying to pretend one helps the other doesn't make sense, unless there is data I haven't seen related to this.

Whatever, I'm probably not going to be the one pulling you out of that world so lets just stop arguing."	1	0	stop arguing comment					When a police officer gets killed, I almost always see the term 'cop killer' used to describe the person who killed. It seems that by using this term, it is assumed that this person is worse than your box standard, piece of shit murderer (and this assumption is usually backed up with much longer prison sentences for people who kill law enforcement). This seems to me that the justice system believe the lifes of police are more important than an innocent member of the public. I believe that if you kill a police officer, civilian, family member and so on, that you should be labelled as a murderer rather than a cop killer because that is what you are and all murderers should be treated the same, no matter what occupation the murdered person had.	"underpaidshill @ 2014-10-31 10:50:11 :

Killing any law enforcement officers, whether it is a cop or a judge or elected official can be considered to be a threat against law and order itself.  I personally live in a rural county that only has three a sheriff and two deputies,  who are we going to call if they were killed.  

--------------------------------

captain_craptain @ 2014-10-31 14:03:28 :

I see what you are saying but I also tend to think that people living in rural areas, myself included, will only call the sheriff as a last resort.  We'll deal with any problem ourselves and call them once it's all said and done.  

Response times are too long for you to be waiting around, time to take action and make decisions not sit around while some 911 operator asks you a bunch of questions.  Of course this is all depending on the situation, I guess I was mostly thinking of home invasion, theft etc.  

As for killing an officer, I think it is unfortunate but no more than if they killed a civilian.  They knew the risks they took when they signed up for the job, mourning a cop killed on the job is understandable but I don't see how it is any different than mourning a highway worker who was hit and killed on the job.  Which by your logic can be seen as a threat to public infrastructure and road repairs.  

My point is, there will be someone to replace them so it isn't a threat to law and order itself.  It is all based on the notion that they are a special class of people with power and authority and when they are killed in the line of duty people have a hard time rationalizing that all the power and authority in the world won't make you immortal.  

The fact that Police will pull all the stops and bend/break the rules to find a cop killer and not your average murderer shows that they consider themselves special and an elevated class of society who deserves more of a response than Joe Schmo's family after he gets whacked.

--------------------------------

BrQQQ @ 2014-10-31 20:58:23 :

Do they really bend/break rules to find a cop killer? I've only really seen that in movies...

I mean the part where they try harder than usual to find a cop killer makes perfect sense. One of their colleagues got killed. They have personal feelings attached to the case. That's not bad, unless it does lead to breaking rules.

&gt;They knew the risks they took when they signed up for the job, mourning a cop killed on the job is understandable but I don't see how it is any different than mourning a highway worker who was hit and killed on the job

People generally respect and admire police officers much more, because they risk their lives to improve other people's lives (or at least, that's the idea). If they are killed in action, it's a much bigger deal, because they were respected so much. A highway worker is doing a good job, but people generally don't find it very admirable, or at least not enough to care too much about them.

The untouchable elite comment is ridiculous. I don't know what country you live in, but over here we have a judge who makes decisions in court, not the police. Unless all the judges are corrupt, it's not possible for the police to get away with crimes if there is proof.

You don't have to kill a ""bunch"" of cops to be a cop-killer, nor do you have to hate them. If you kill one cop to get away from the police or for any other reason (like the guy in the news right now) you will be a cop-killer and get enhanced sentencing.

&gt;but over here we have a judge who makes decisions in court, not the police

1. A DA decides who to prosecute, not a judge.

2. A jury decides whether or not somebody is guilty, not a judge.

3. Police control the chain of evidence, not a judge.

None of these people are the judge, and you only need one of these groups to fail for people to get away with it. Police video footage gets ""lost"" and witnesses suddenly recant. The DA often can't risk alienating a department that they have to work closely with in 9 cases out of 10. Your view of the justice system is naive. And, of course, the judges themselves ARE a factor, but it's not about corruption. It's about a system that does everything it can to elevate and treat the police as a protected class because most people in our culture deeply believe that police are special. It's psychological."

I don't love Essex any more than I do the grand canyon. I think nationalism is nonsensical.

I'm not proud of England's history as a nation which subjugated half the world. I'm not proud of my current national government. I've not met most English people. I've not seen most of the country. Why should some borders someone else chose decide where my care begins and ends?

All of that sounds very much like what a spoilt child who hasn't experienced the harsh world outside his family would say of his own family. Go spend some time in a random third-world country and you may see your own country and government in a different light.

&gt; I'm not proud of England's history as a nation which subjugated half the world.

It was a rather benevolent ""subjugation"" compared to the empires before it. In fact, it was *the* ""subjugation"" that ended large-scale international subjugations. Which other empire before had withdrawn so voluntarily from so many territories in favor of democracy? I don't know, but was slavery ever abolished by any empire before Britain? Britain ushered in the modern era of international respect and respect for human rights - gradually, of course - you have to take the norms of the time into consideration. I'd far sooner have lived under British rule than under Nazi, Soviet or whatever other rule.

And I say all this not as a Brit nor even an Anglophone, but as a member of a nation that was subjugated and decimated by the British in a brutal war of resistance at the beginning of the last century - perhaps the nation that you could say has *most* reason to be bitter towards the imperial history of the British.

Your argument reads an awful lot like you're saying just because it's worse other places people must love what they have.

I can be repeatedly punched in the face but that doesn't mean I should love the person punching me just because other people get murdered.

tennenrishin @ 2014-11-06 13:23:26 :

It wasn't an argument. It was meant to widen your perspective. No argument or anything else for that matter can force you to love anyone or anything.

You say you love your family more than strangers because your family raised you and you spent your life with them, more than strangers did.

Likewise, your country raised you and you spent your life with it, more than foreign countries did. Why draw the line at your family if you care about the whole planet?

--------------------------------

Melancholicdrunk @ 2014-11-06 13:54:17 :

For the same reason I care about my friends. I don't love my whole family. I've never met a lot of them. I care about people I have shared things with, who have things in common with me. 

So my country being somewhere I was born means nothing to me. I have loyalty for the north east because I grew up there and have a fondness for middlesbrough and the places I know well. I don't know most of the country. Why should the border with scotland be where I stop caring?

&gt; I have loyalty for the north east because I grew up there and have a fondness for middlesbrough and the places I know well. I don't know most of the country.

Scale this one level down, and one level up:

***

I have loyalty for neighborhood X because I grew up there and have a fondness for street Y and the places I know well. I don't know the entire north east.

***

I have loyalty for the UK because I grew up there and have a fondness for the north east and the places I know well. I don't know most of the world.

***

It's just the same thing to different degrees at different levels. The smaller the circle around you becomes the more you identify with it. The circle around your country is smaller than the circle around the planet.

Yes. I know. Hence why I find the idea of national borders daft. If I lived smack bang in the middle of a round country maybe. As it is I could live nearer to france than to 90% of england. Why does the border matter?
I'm aware we're an island so it's slightly different etc. But nationalism taken generally means someone on the border of France is meant to have more loyalty to their country than their neighbours. Stupid.

Nationalism is to distinguish yourself from other countries. From ""foreigners"", it's easy to get people to think like it because people like to feel special. As it is your country doesn't make you special. Patriotism as a result of nationalism isn't about a global community. it's about pitting countries against each other. About saying ""we're better"". There's nothing special about us, or better, or different, we're just born on one side of a border. Other people were born elsewhere.

&gt;  If I lived smack bang in the middle of a round country maybe.

LOL

&gt; I care about people I have shared things with, who have things in common with me. 

You probably have a lot more in common with Englishmen than with Frenchmen. There's the language, the culture, the food you eat, the history you've learned, the schooling system, the news you listen to or read, the music you listen to, the laws you live under, the politicians you have to live with etc. It's like the familiarity you feel with the north east, just at a different level. But you wouldn't realize this unless you spend a few months in France.

&gt; it's about pitting countries against each other. About saying ""we're better""

Extreme nationalism, yes. But I don't see patriotism per se that way. Family love isn't about pitting families against each other, or saying that your family is ""better"". Likewise, love for your country isn't necessarily about pitting it against other countries or saying that it is ""better"". Well, in the case of the UK I think it should be, because the UK *is* better than most countries as a basic matter of fact.

Do you have any idea how unpopular Hollande is in France right now? The French say he wrecked their economy. He has the lowest approval rating of any president in French history, if I'm not mistaken. Because of him, some local municipalities that had been dominated by communists (yes, communists) for over a *century* have for the first time in a century voted the communists out, and the right in (yes, the *right* in their place) in their local elections.

&gt; Do you think patriotism makes as much sense in Lichtenstein as it does in Russia?

It doesn't make equal sense in all countries. In some countries, it doesn't even make sense at all, just like loyalty doesn't make sense in some families. It makes sense in ""normal"" countries, though, as it makes sense in ""normal"" families.

&gt; Do you think the borders of the countries matter?

Usually there is a transition of culture if you go across a border. Especially if different languages are spoken on different sides. Given that that is the state of affairs, yes. Also, borders are a good thing. They prevent misunderstandings between neighboring powers, which prevents wars.

--------------------------------

Melancholicdrunk @ 2014-11-06 19:21:12 :

Yes. It was a sarcastic point about Hollande. 

I disagree, I don't think patriotism makes sense in any country. I think you're now arguing for something other than patriotism, you're arguing for people to consider situations and decide what they like. Which I agree with, but that's not what patriotism is.

You say usually. I don't think your world geography is very good.

Traditionally stealing is taking from someone so that they no longer have the stolen item. This I believe is wrong. 

If I had a need for a physical item I would see what was available on the market. If nothing on the market was available at a reasonable price I might consider making it for myself. Companies who manufacture are able to mass produce goods for cheaper than an individual could because they have equipment available which would be cost prohibitive for an individual to acquire. This means that usually an item can be purchased cheaper than it could be produced at home. If I needed a new computer there is no way I could manufacture one as cheaply as easily as I could buy one so I am happy to purchase one.

I am not from the US but I know you have some very restrictive patent laws which aren’t consistent with much of world. Most places allow patents to be infringed for personal non-commercial use. I can build a Boeing 747 in my shed for personal use but I can’t burn a CD. The music industry sells CDs for a huge profit on what they actually cost to produce. Because of the huge mark-up people adopt a DIY attitude. Then rather than reduce price like another industry might, the music industry protects its sales by getting unfair laws passed forcing people to buy their product. 

Distributing music over the internet should be even cheaper than CD’s but it is still prohibitively expensive. I just opened the iTunes store on my phone and clicked the first album, Sonic Highways. $16.99 for the album or $2.19 for a single song.

The music industry has brought piracy on itself. It could have embraced the internet as a means of supplying music for a reasonable cost but it didn’t. I believe if the music industry lowered the price on music to ~ $1 per album or $0.10 per song very few people would pirate music. They would make less per download but sell much more music. It wouldn’t be worth downloading crappy unorganised bits of music mixed with malware and viruses, or spend weeks trying to find something obscure. Not to mention as people left piracy and started paying for music seeders would start to disappear. I would pay for all my music, in fact I would spend more on music than I do now, most people would.  I would be much more likely to spend money on music I hadn’t heard before or wanted to try.

You're stealing access to media when you pirate. Make no qualms about it. That's what you're doing. 


If you justify just because of high mark up then why aren't you stealing coke. Coke is just water and sugar resold at a high mark up.

I've never understood the entitlement that people feel towards songs and movies and such. If you want that stuff you need to pay to have access to it. If you steal it, you're taking it. All the justification doesn't really help. 

On my computer I have a short story that I'm trying to have published. Should you have free access to that?  Is that information free for you to take? Can I have free access to your information as well?  Would you let me make a copy of your entire hard drive?

longlivedp @ 2014-11-11 11:44:53 :

Music is information, and information, once it's on the internet, becomes a  [public good] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good). 

Coke is a bad analogy because it is a [private good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_good).

A better analogy would be a firework display. If you watch a firework display without paying for it, are you stealing?

It's not that people feel entitled to watch fireworks for free, it's that the mere act of watching them should not be policed.

This is flagrantly wrong. Most music ""once it's on the internet"" is still protected under copyright law and belongs to the copyright holder. Attempting to violate copyright protections puts you in violation of the law.

&gt;The act of actively acquiring information and the act of passively consuming information are morally two very different kinds of acts.

Oh, and see this is awkward, because I put it to you that it's hard to passively violate copyright law. You have to go out of your way to steal music.

Very many people believe that the usage of ""he"" as a gender neutral pronoun is not inclusive and is in fact harmful and wish this grammatical convention to be changed.

My point was that just because modern grammatical conventions define it to be correct usage as gender neutral does not mean that it is actually inclusive when used that way. 

You keep throwing up strawmen and hiding behind the fact that in the most technical sense it is defined as gender neutral by grammatical conventions without addressing the fact that its usage as such is not inclusive at all and is actually rather divisive as shown by studies and research.

Anyway, you should both cite sources, if one side doesn't they are doing nothing but arguing from an immature stance. Also any good debater absolutely looks up all the opposing information. The best way to win a debate is to know everything your opponent will say, to even have their sources on hand and have them debunked already.

I'm not going to lift a finger to find his source for him. Either he has it and he can cite, assuming sources should be cited, or he doesn't. That's all on him. All of it. I'm not his fact checker. This guy wants me to hear out his opinion and then search on his opinion to prove the wild claim he made is true. That's me doing his work for him.

I'll give you an example:


Let's say a person is completly isolated from religion, - it still exists, but he doesn't know that, nobody ever says anything about religion while near him, and he simply cannot see churches and other religious structures (suck it, this is just a made up story, you got my point).
The word ""religion"" is unknown to him and he doesn't know a single bit about religion.

This person goes through education just like any normal kid, but he is not taught of religion.
When he finishes college, somebody shows him this whole concept of ""religion"", the churches, the ritual, the culture.. But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.

I am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.

I have a few arguments to back this up.

**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**

I think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: ""Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one""?

Of course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.


**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**

Think about parenting. You wouldn't say the word ""fuck"" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. 

**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**

Kids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?


If you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.

Let's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.

If you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.


Would it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?

The younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.

Religion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.

Minors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.


That's it. CMV.

Atheist converts to Christianity would seem to contradict this. The church I used to attend (Roman Catholic) had a pretty large [RCIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_Christian_Initiation_of_Adults) program. Some members were non-religious types raised in non-religious households who only started questioning their non-belief later in life. 

While this only represents a small minority of religious peoples, I think it proves that the dissemination of religion can be accomplished without brainwashing children.

I do agree with you that this is happening, but the only way to see it is that you're refining your definition of an atheist and a christian to reflect what your opinion is. Kind of like a repackaged *No True Scotsman* thing. So, not particularly enforceable or good for drawing conclusions.

The foundation for this belief is the more fundamental belief that government should not restrict the actions of its citizens except when those actions affect the well-being of others sufficiently to warrant such a restriction. **Note, that I am *not* interested in discussing this more fundamental belief in this CMV.** You may reject any such principle, but that is not what I'm asking you to change my view about. Instead, I'm asking you to change my view about incest in spite of such a principle (hereafter ""the harm principle"").

I believe that many people implicitly (if not explicitly) endorse the harm principle, and I believe it's a driving force behind arguments for the legalization of recreational drugs, gay marriage, and many other causes that many people regard as laudable. I also feel that the harm principle defends consenting adults from prosecution for engaging in consanguineal sexual relations with one another. However, in many places (even among developed countries), such consenting adults can be punished with lengthy jail terms or worse. Whether or not they *are* frequently punished in such a way is another question whose answer varies from place to place, but my point here is that they *can* legally be so punished.

I understand that one justification of some laws against incest is that they protect children from being molested by older relatives. If such laws are to remain, they should not preclude such relations between consenting adults, which would really just reduce them to laws prohibiting the molestation of children. Instead of having blanket incest laws that prohibit relations between consenting adults, you could simply have molestation laws that carry more severe penalties when the victim is a relative of the perpetrator.

Another common argument is that incest is more likely to produce offspring with birth defects. Some proponents of abolishing incest laws would propose that blood relatives should be allowed to engage in sexual relations but should not be allowed to conceive, but I think even this is unnecessary. It may be the case that the chance of birth defects is increased when close relatives conceive, but it is not guaranteed. Furthermore, I know of no laws (and I suspect they are rare, if they exist anywhere) that prohibit the conception of children by carriers of genetic disorders, even in those cases in which the disorder is likely (or even guaranteed) to be passed down. Even if such laws exist somewhere, I think they ought to be questioned, and if they ought to be questioned, so should any law that prohibits blood relatives from conceiving.

How do you prevent a case where the adult grooms the child for an incestuous relationship in the future? Family members have a great amount of influence over children.



--------------------------------

Plasstik @ 2015-02-03 20:48:43 :

I personally have no proposal for this. There is an inherent tension between a parent's right to raise her children without outside intervention and the child's right to not be harmfully influenced by her parents' choices. But I am strongly convinced that outlawing sexual or romantic relations between ""seemingly"" consenting adults is not an acceptable solution.

--------------------------------

NaturalSelectorX @ 2015-02-03 20:52:46 :

We have a lot of precedent for outlawing relationships where there is a high risk of abuse. Should therapists be allowed to date patients? Should teachers be allowed to date students? When you have one person in a position of power or authority over another, it's ripe for bad outcomes. It would be impossible to distinguish between manipulation and genuine interest under those circumstances.

My answer to each question is ""If there is consent, then yes."" I'm not interested in the epistemic question of how we determine genuine consent.

Not the guy who responded to you, but I am also getting the feeling that you aren't really here to have your view changed. It can be summed up here:

&gt;Yes, it's a problem, just not the problem I'm interested in here.

You admit that there is an area of your view that is problematic. You then state bluntly that you don't want to explore that area where your view might falter. That gives the impression that you are not interested in exploring where your view falters. *Especially* since multiple posters have given similar responses to /u/Tsuruta64, if your view is weak there in any way (Yes, it's a problem...) that is likely where you should focus your replies. Not in areas where you believe your view is strong and correct.

Plasstik @ 2015-02-04 18:13:46 :

It's not an area of my view that's problematic, it's a separate problem that would need to be addressed before my proposal could be put into practice, and I acknowledge that.

--------------------------------

turole @ 2015-02-04 18:20:55 :

But definitions in regards to ""true consent"" are at the crux of the argument that legalizing incest would result in an increase in coercive relationships. If you don't want to discuss it here then you are basically ignoring one of two common arguments against your view. 

IMO, that's why you were accused of soapboxing by the other poster. Because someone seemingly identified where your view is weak and it is the only post that I can find where you completely dodge the question.

Plasstik @ 2015-02-04 18:33:55 :

&gt; But definitions in regards to ""true consent"" are at the crux of the argument that legalizing incest would result in an increase in coercive relationships.

I acknowledge that true consent is important, my view is that incest should be legal between adult individuals who truly consent. It is not an objection to my view to say, ""But how do we know who truly consents?"" That's a different issue, and even if we had a fruitful (or decidedly unfruitful) discussion of it here, it wouldn't change the view I put forward in my title, which is why I suggested it was better to leave it to someone else.

--------------------------------

turole @ 2015-02-04 18:43:23 :

&gt;But how do we know who truly consents?

They aren't phrasing it like that though. They are saying that incestuous relationships increase the probability of coercion and you cannot tell if true consent is present. So they (we) aren't trying to talk in a general sense, they are trying to point out that you cannot actually determine if true consent is present in many incestuous relationships and that this is bad.

&gt;That's a different issue, and even if we had a fruitful (or decidedly unfruitful) discussion of it here, it wouldn't change the view I put forward in my title, which is why I suggested it was better to leave it to someone else.


Really? If you were convinced that those in parent/children relationships are unable to truly consent that wouldn't affect your view? In my opinion this is the strongest argument against incestuous relationships. Power structures exist and parents have 18 years to stockholm syndrome their kids. This would significantly increases the chances of ""untrue consent"" occurring and justifies the laws.

Again, from an outside observer that hasn't yet posted it looks like you are avoiding this line of thinking while it is a strong argument. You can disagree, and that's fine, but it is an explanation for why you might be accused of not wanting to change your view.

--------------------------------

Plasstik @ 2015-02-04 18:48:47 :

&gt; they are trying to point out that you cannot actually determine if true consent is present in many incestuous relationships and that this is bad.

I agree that it's bad, but I don't agree that it justifies the law currently in place. I would be willing to discuss that, and I apologize to all readers and contributors if I gave the opposite impression.

&gt; Really? If you were convinced that those in parent/children relationships are unable to truly consent that wouldn't affect your view?

No, if I didn't think an adult offspring could ever consent to a relationship with a parent, then that would change my view. Rather, simply acknowledging that there is a serious (perhaps currently insurmountable) problem of how to separate genuine consent from forced consent does not change my view."

The word feminism has no inherent meaning.  No word has inherent meaning.  These squiggly things you're looking at?  They're just a bunch of black dots packed close together on a glowing screen.  The only reason this makes sense is that I have a particular thought that I am assigning to these dots, and I am trusting that you will interpret them as meaning the same thing.  Communication breaks down when we willfully look for meanings that are not intended.  If you know what a given person means when they say feminist, then it is a waste of time to interpret what they are saying as referring to something else.

I'm not saying that the term feminism isn't a complicated one.  There can be two people who say it and have meanings for it that share very little in common.  Like any term for a school of thought, it is simply a shorthand for a collection of expected ideas that we think most people who we call that term will share.  Everyone has a slightly different collection of ideas that they ascribe to the word, and no one will expect that everyone they associate the word with will exemplify every one of those ideas.  But if I know what ideas I mean when I say the word, and I see someone who exemplifies enough of them that I think it applies, and you know generally what ideas I mean to ascribe to that person when I say it, in what way am I wrong to use the word feminist to describe them?  I don't see any value in using two terms in my own mind for two people who I view as the same, just because one has a different association in their own mind with the word.  That would be like requiring that I only think in French when thinking about a Frenchman.

It can be helpful to give definitions when discussing terms like this(especially if one of the people has an unorthodox association with the word) but once everyone understands what the other is trying to convey, then it's time to stop arguing terms and time to start discussing ideas.

edit: forgot half a sentence"	1	0	stop arguing comment					"My main issues:

1 - What do feminists agree on? Even within feminism, there's such a broad spectrum of views and opinions on feminist issues that to call oneself as a simply a 'feminist' doesn't demonstrate anything except one thing. In my opinion, the core tenant of feminism is that everyone possesses equal rights - and as such, is the one, absolute trait that all feminists can claim to believe. But again, that's not really saying anything. It is possible to believe that everyone deserves equal rights whilst not being a feminist - in the same way it's possible to believe in a God or Deity whilst being irreligious.

2 - Feminist critique is ultimately useless due to it's incredible subjectivity. When feminism critiques something as sexist or misogynist, the strength of that argument relies on how well of a rhetorician the author is. Outside of very few circumstances, most scenes in literature can be argued both ways.

An example:

'Bayonetta' is a sexist character.

How could this be explored through a feminist framework? She could be seen as a character who is sexually objectified. She could be seen as a powerful women in control of her sexuality. She could be seen as merely a pawn of the player. She could be seen as the driving force of her narrative and it's most important character. She could be seen as someone who's slut shamed by certain critique. She could be seen as a stereotype for inhabiting the traditional female role of a witch. She could be seen as a re invigoration of a character archetype for how witches are presented in her mythos.

Ultimately, the strength of the argument relies on how well of a rhetorician the author is - not any sort of objective viewpoint. It's so subjective that it doesn't actually impart anything of substantial value - other than the fact that is so subjective.

3 - Growing numbers of women aren't identifying as feminist, and public opinion appears (IMO) to be slowly moving against it. When Time gave a poll on which word should be banned last year, the word feminism completely annihilated all competition - until feminists caused it to be removed. 

4 - 'Feminism' has been commercialized by sites such as Buzzfeed and Gawker, with op-editorials and clickbait articles. Furthermore, feminism nowadays is more often associated with some sort of moral outrage over some relatively unimportant issue (such as television or film), than it is with any sort of 'positive' news or change. In short, feminism and outrage culture are intricately linked.

This is not to say that I don't respect and admire feminism for what it's achieved. It is undoubtedly one of the shining moments of western civilization, and one we can hopefully share with the rest of the world. It's just unfortunate what is has transformed into in the twentieth century.

Things exist as themselves outside of our classification of them.  If a mute society totally cut off from all other humans slowly developed a system where they decide which direction to travel by seeing where a majority of their number are pointing, they have created a democracy.  The fact that they would not call themselves a democracy(neither having a concept to compare it against nor a language to express the idea in) is irrelevant to whether or not we would classify that society as such.

When I say ""feminism,"" there is an idea that I mean to convey.  If it were a specific club such as the NRA, that would be different, but here we are talking about concepts.  If someone exemplifies that concept, they are, in my definition a feminist, regardless of whether or not they call themselves such or have even heard the term.

NvNvNvNv @ 2015-02-24 17:39:08 :

Sure, but ""feminism"" and ""gender equality"" are not synonymous.

* First of all, there are some branches of feminism, such as radical feminism, which don't support gender equality.

* Second, the type of feminism which supports gender equality still maintains that in most cases women have it worse and it is a priority to address women's problem first. Somebody who supports gender equality as a general principle may not share the belief that women have it worse or the preference for dealing with women's problems first, and therefore they may not be a feminist.

* Third, gender equality is itself a relatively ambiguous concept: At minimum, you can distinguish between equality of opportunities and equality of outcomes. Modern mainstream feminism tends to support equality of outcomes (e.g. affirmative action). Somebody who supports equality of opportunities may not be a feminist, or at least not a mainstream one.

* Fourth, there can be a difference between the dictionary definition of a political movement and what its supporters actually practice. For instance, feminists may demand women quotas in STEM jobs (that is, high paying comfortable office jobs) and ostensibly motivate it as an attempt to correct their male-skewed gender ratios. But feminists do not demand women quotas in jobs like coal mining or oil rig operation, even if they have even more male-skewed gender ratios. Somebody who supports gender equality as a general principle may not want to be associated to a political movement of people who do these things, and attempts to do so may be considered instances of the [motte-and-bailey](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/) misdirection technique.

&gt; In my opinion, this leaves the US government and police as a occupying army that can be justly resisted by force if necessary.

How does one incident in a town in Missouri translate to the US Government and police being an occupying force? You're telling me that a small-town sheriff in the middle-of-nowhere Wyoming is somehow an occupying force that can be killed?

There is no strawman. You say it's justifiable to use lethal force against police as they are now an occupying army. I asked you if it was justifiable to use lethal force against a specific police officer that is clearly not a part of the problem you are talking about. How is that a strawman?

You cannot pay attention to international law and only do so halfway. The countries where the US has troops are by and large countries where their governments want US troops, and when countries have said they don't want them, the US has then left. There are a handful of complicated exceptions (Cuba being one of the more interesting ones) but that's it. And by what logic under international law would the US government be an occupying force of the US itself?

Hawkeye1226 @ 2015-03-05 00:17:56 :

I don't even know where to begin. So I'll ask some clarifying questions. What makes the government illegitimate and how is it an occupying force? And what countries are occupied by the US? The only one I can think of is Cuba due to the Naval base there, but the US still has legal claim to the land even if the Cubans don't like it. What are these 100+ other countries you are talking about?

--------------------------------

selfhatingyank @ 2015-03-05 00:21:26 :

There are 144 countries with US troops stationed in them according to the Marxist (/s) Cato Institute: http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/us-military-overextended-overseas

A more recent source has 150, including sworn ""enemies"" like Russia and China which at the end of the day are imperialist puppets. https://www.vetfriends.com/US-deployments-overseas/

Although their governments probably are fine with the forces,  all puppet governments must at least feign the support of their masters.

fanningmace @ 2015-03-05 00:25:00 :

&gt; International law says that peoples have the right to resist armed occupation with force if necessary.

I don't think you can count every single police officer as part of the occupying force.

I found this: 

*In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following
provisions:*

*(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.*

Hawkeye1226 @ 2015-03-05 00:34:00 :

So you're going to ignore the definition of ""occupy"" and use you're own? That's not how things work. An occupation means the host nation has no say in the matter, and all of those nations chose that. 

I'm going to ask a couple more clarifying questions to gain a better idea of how much you know about this, if you don't mind. 

Which ones have puppet governments, exactly? Middle eastern ones? European ones? I'd like specifics here. Because I can't think of any that really qualify. Every time a nation decided to no longer host US forces, the US forces left. 

And can you tell me what those deployments entail, exactly? What people are doing there? And how those actions qualify as occupation?

And what bring to to the conclusion that China and Russia, of all nations, are puppets? Especially Russia. They don't give half a fuck about *anyone.* And China certainly has their own thing going on as well, often coming to disagreements with the US. If these nations are puppets, they're really bad ones.

Edit, typo"	0	0	stop arguing comment					"I believe that well-behaved dogs should be allowed in most stores. I understand that, due to health codes, many restaurants cannot allow dogs. However, I think that if a restaurant has outdoor dining and allows children, dogs should be allowed as well.

Dogs require stimulation and socialization in the same way that small children do. In many cities, it is very difficult to find places to take a dog so that they can enjoy time out of the house. Where I live, even leashed dogs are not allowed on the beaches at the public lake. My dog can't enjoy a dip in the water on a hot day, unless we hike 6 miles to a local river/waterfall in the state forest. 

I fully realize that you make sacrifices when you have a dog. It would just be nice not to choose between necessary errands (like a run to Target to get household items) and spending time with my companion. And I can't think of any truly valid reasons that he shouldn't accompany me on these errands if he is well-behaved and doesn't bother other people.

Caveats

1) In any store that has shopping carts available, the dog should be required to stay in the shopping cart inside the store. Local leash laws should also be observed at all times.

2) Dogs should, as I said, be well-behaved and quiet. If they cause a disturbance, the owner should immediately remove them.

EDIT: I've awarded some deltas, and I want to thank everybody for their replies, many of which were very eye-opening. 

Believe it or not, I realize my dog is not a child. I only made that comparison because it seems that they share some common traits which lend themselves to possible disturbances (unpredictable, have trouble communicating, are sometimes loud for seemingly no reason). I also realize that there are places where it is wholly inappropriate to take a dog. Perhaps it's just wishful thinking on my part, because I see so many businesses where dogs and humans shop &amp; eat together just fine. I'd love for it to be more common that businesses allow pets, but fully realize that it will never be universal (nor should it). 

EDIT 2: Just want to take a moment to acknowledge the major point that has (if not totally changed) swayed my view.

ALLERGIES: I truly did not realize how prevalent pet allergies are. I have met and worked with a lot of people all over the US, and I know one person with a dog allergy (and even she has to actually touch the dog to have a reaction). I also didn't realize that even trace amounts of dander in the air could cause such severe reactions. I know that pet dander is carried on the clothing of people who own pets, so it would seem that I should be causing allergic reactions all the time. Maybe I am (unknowingly). 

So I will amend my original statement to say that I think it should simply be more common that dogs are allowed in businesses and in public green spaces/beaches. (Please understand I was never saying dogs should be allowed EVERYWHERE). It looks like lots of countries and cities are very dog-friendly, and manage to be so without an outbreak of dog fights and pestilence. Europe, California, Portland OR, and Seattle WA are a few mentioned in this CMV.

There's no way for a restaurant to know how well-behaved a dog is before allowing them in their restaurant.  The same applies for babies of-course, but where the two differ is the level of risk the establishment takes on with each.  

THe most damage an poorly behaved baby is every going to do is annoy the rest of the businesses customers.  Dogs can bite, contaminate food, scare customers, and cause them to have allergic reactions.

There's no way to regulate it, and its not worth the risk.

There is always room for improvement. That said, I think homeschooling should be illegal (or severely restricted, i.e. tight requirements for testing, certification for the parents, standard curricula that mimics those taught in public schools) for a few reasons:

1.) From personal experience, homeschooling severely retards the growth of the homeschooled in terms of social and intellectual development.

2.) Homeschoolers do not have access to the same education as students in public school. They cannot share the same level of facilities, expertise in teaching, nor access to different  opinions (the basis of higher education) when they are homeschooled.

3.) in an age of interconnectedness, interpersonal skills are paramount. Knowledge of how to deal with people is essential in every job. Being at home interacting with a few people every day does not allow the student to learn these skills.

4.) Motivation: Homeschoolers do the work because Mom or Dad tell them to. People who go to school do not. When they get to college, and Mommy or Daddy is no longer there, which one has a higher likelihood of success?

In short, homeschooling should no longer be an option as it denies the child the basic right to an education that prepares the pupil for society. Instead, it is a breeding ground for narrow-mindedness, and limited social development. CMV reddit"	"Hq3473 @ 2015-04-02 16:04:31 :

I may have been raised differently than you, but my parent's job was not to protect me from danger 24/7. Sure, if I tried to touch a hot stove the first time they would swat my hand away and tell me not to do that. If I tried again, they'd be more forceful. On my third attempt, they'd let me burn myself. (this is metaphorical)

The point being, in my view, parent's are supposed to prepare children to be adults, functioning members of society. This is not achieved by coddling them and preventing them from learning the skills necessary to overcome adversity. Will you be there to spare them dangers and indignities when they reach adulthood? Will you go to the office that rejected them for their first job and demand they reverse their decision in order to protect your child from indignity? Or is it wiser to teach your children the tools that can only be learned through adversity. Teach them how to handle bullies, drugs, sex, violence, in order to equip them for adulthood?

Ennuiandthensome @ 2015-04-02 16:38:58 :

I fail to see how keeping them from public school magically keeps them from danger, unless all communication and interaction with their peer group is ceased. Unless they live in a bubble, their friends carry these dangers with them. Instead of limiting their potential for danger, you are limiting their potential ability to deal with those problems effectively.

The way you deal with asthma is you teach your child to ALWAYS have the emergency inhaler ready.

That is the skill she will NEED in real life.

School will actively PREVENT her from learning this skill, and thus deprive her of ability to deal with problems effectively.

Ennuiandthensome @ 2015-04-02 17:10:20 :

what school are you talking about? every school I know allows kids to have rescue inhalers.

""However, some schools perhaps as part of a drug use prevention program or in hopes of minimizing liability claims, do not allow students to carry their inhalers in school.8,9 In 2000, students were allowed to self-medicate with prescription inhalers in 68% of all schools nationwide .""

Doing simple math - 32% of schools do not allow emergency inhalers.

So in 1/3 of school district your advice will result in your child being disciplined by the school.

zero-tolerance rules are stupid, everyone agrees with this. but you realize that this statistic supports my argument right? 70% of schools allow self medication. the ones that don't are in the significant minority. 38 states allow self medication. Federally, chronic conditions such as asthma are covered under IDEA (CFR sect. 300.7(b)(9) (2003), :other health impairments:) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which requires free and equal access to schools by children with disabilities, which includes respiratory disabilities (section 104.3 ""Definitions, physical or mental impairment"").

The top poster said that society, like offspring, didn't do anything to deserve your money.  I pointed out that society *has* done something to deserve your money by enabling wealth accumulation in any number of ways.  The next person said that even if that was the case, any amount of money that society deserved was already paid in taxes.  I then pointed out that the amount paid in taxes is not necessarily equivalent to the amount of money someone deserves.  It *can* be, but it's hard to make an argument that any number that is below the value they created with their work is a number that they don't ""deserve"", because the determination of that value is simply an arbitrary allocation of surplus between two parties.

You are focused on an agreement being broken.  But I'm not talking about an agreement being broken.  I'm talking about a change in public policy that would give ""society"" more of your wealth than it currently gets, but less of your wealth than it is the cause of.  I am assuming such a system would come about through a normal democratic policy process, and I'm assuming that's what the OP's proposal would entail.

Note that a predicate assumption of that is, obviously, that society has the right to vote to confiscate your money ~~from~~ through taxes even though you may not want it to, and in total disregard of any natural rights that you would have in the absence of government.  If the reason you are arguing this vociferously is because you *disagree* with that predicate assumption, then great!  We should stop arguing.  Because you're not going to convince me that you have any meaningful property rights that are not a creation of the state - so why bother?"	3	0	stop arguing comment					"Okay, first of all let me get this out of the way: I'm very aware that this is practically impossible to implement. I'm arguing how theoretically, *if* we could implement this, society would be far better off for it and approach a near-perfect meritocracy. The CMV concerns the system being *desirable*, for nearly everyone.

Secondly, I am far from arguing communism. As far as I'm concerned, communist markets are doomed to fail and go against human nature. Capitalism is fine.

It's familial inheritance that I argue against. Inheritance, as the root of all *unfair* inequality. Money begets money, and a wealthy inheritance can catapult a child with mediocre abilities into greater wealth. If you start out with the money needed to invest in a business, or even inherit a company itself, you'd have to be an idiot not to accumulate more. Relatively little effort is required. On the other hand, a brilliant child starting out in poverty can have its abilities go to waste, having to work multiple jobs while attending college, starting out with no capital to speak of, and struggling an entire lifetime to achieve any sort of dream. 

Familial inheritance undermines the ideal of meritocracy. On the other hand, societal inheritance *stimulates* it. By societal inheritance I mean this: capital of those who are deceased is seized by society, and used *exclusively* as a start capital for those coming into adulthood. This could be at a certain age, or something that could be requested within a certain age span (say, 18-25). The practical details can be discussed. The point is, this start capital would be exactly equal for everyone.

Naturally, the first objection to this would be that the system is bad or unfair to the wealthy of the world. But hear me out: what person, who has actually worked for their wealth, would want their child to never know the hardship such wealth warrants? Would you want your child to be spoiled and immoral, naive to how the world works, living on your work? Or would you want your child to get the same chance everyone gets and prove itself, to work for what it achieves and to actually *merit* their wealth? I'd go further, is such a way of life not indeed *preferable*, to know you've earned everything you have?

And then there is society itself to take into account. Suppose we have two societies, one operating on familial inheritance, the other a near meritocracy due to societal inheritance. The second society would, over time, evolve to be far more preferable for anyone living in it, and naturally exceed the other society in prosperity. The wealthy of the other society would *want* to live in the meritocratic society.

Two counter arguments I'm anticipating:

1. Even with an equal start capital, you don't have meritocracy. This is true. There are environmental factors, especially growing up. Eliminating that would mean eliminating familial life itself, and I'm not going to argue that that is desirable, that's a different discussion. But societal inheritance is a big step towards meritocracy, regardless.

2. An equal start capital for everyone would cause inflation. This is an argument I've seen against basic income, and while it does have some merit there, it makes no sense here. The redistributed money in basic income could be seen as ""unearned"" and elicit a collective response from the markets to readjust money value, but this is not the case for societal inheritance.

One final interesting consequence of the system is this: since more people now have possession of the money necessary to start their own business or project, some of the perceived ""merit"" of being a business owner will decrease. This also means that the demand for manual labor jobs and the employed will rise (since there are more business owners and less employed workers), and with it, the wages. The inequality in wages will more reflect the difficulty of the job (but also of course demand, ingenuity etc. Business owners will inevitably still make more, as they should). People who fail and lose their start capital will therefore still have better prospects than they would now. 

So there you have it. Societal inheritance is preferable for nearly everyone in society, except for those who want to spoil their children by working in their stead; those who wish their children unearned wealth. As I see it, it would lead to near meritocracy, and usher in higher prosperity for everyone.

I dont understand your argument. You think familial inheritance is wrong because the kids are getting unearned wealth. Then what is society getting? They sure as fuck didn't earn that wealth either

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-13 23:03:32 :

? Society created the conditions (free market, infrastructure, currency, intellectual property, police protection of security and property) under which wealth can accumulate at all.

--------------------------------

LC_Music @ 2015-04-13 23:14:06 :

Society didn't create any of that. My and your tax dollars did. So since it's my money, and not society's that made those things possible, I'd say your idea is just flawed

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-13 23:33:10 :

You wouldn't have any money without society.

--------------------------------

LC_Music @ 2015-04-13 23:34:57 :

Nah, money has existed long before anything resembling society.

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-13 23:41:48 :

Not really. Anything beyond bartering requires a shared understanding of the representative value of currency. But even beyond that, currency, infrastructure, police, and IP all enable the accumulation of wealth at an exponentially higher level than would be possible in their absence. So to the extent that you'd rather I say ""in the absence of society you wouldn't have 99% of your money"" I'm comfortable with that and it doesn't change my point. 

--------------------------------

I_Love_Liberty @ 2015-04-14 15:02:28 :

Protection, currency, and infrastructure are products and services created by individuals who are compensated for their services at the time that they trade them to other individuals in society. You argument doesn't sound so convincing when you say ""In the absence of Frank and Bill protecting you, and John and Albert providing a useful currency, and Tim, Joe, and Mike building infrastructure, you wouldn't have 99% of your money, so society deserves some more of your money."" They've already been paid for the work they did to help you get where you are. You don't owe them anything on top of what they already got paid.

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-14 15:22:31 :

My initial statement - that society created the conditions under which wealth can accumulate at all and is responsible for 99% [or some other extremely high percentage] of the wealth created - is still correct, but you are right that that isn't necessarily an argument for why society deserves even *more* compensation from me when I die.  But as between your offspring and society, society has contributed a great deal more to your wealth than your offspring have (unless you're, e.g., Lindsay Lohan's mom).  That was meant as a retort to the above poster who argues that society has done nothing more than your offspring to deserve wealth.  

OP could easily argue that there is a better justification for giving a ""bonus"" to society than offspring, and that the bonus would get put to better use in helping society accumulate further wealth.

--------------------------------

I_Love_Liberty @ 2015-04-14 16:03:32 :

&gt;That was meant as a retort to the above poster who argues that society has done nothing more than your offspring to deserve wealth. 

But society doesn't deserve your wealth. The individuals responsible for ensuring you could accumulate wealth already got paid for what they did.

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-14 16:13:02 :

Saying they got paid for what they did only says that a market transaction was made that was sufficient to convince them to undertake work.  That's one measure of compensation.  But they may ""deserve"" more in the sense that they were not fully compensated for the value they created.  

Anyway, I agree with you that you could argue that the compensation they received was sufficient because by definition it was enough to get them to do the work.  I meant my point to be largely comparative - society versus offspring.  Unlike your offspring, society actually did do things that enabled the creation of the vast majority of a decedent's wealth. 

Whether society should receive any additional compensation beyond what it has already been given is a separate but related question, which could turn on whether you want to ""reward"" society with part of the additional wealth they helped create or whether giving money to society would help create more wealth than giving it to your offspring.  But convincing you of that was not my goal - my goal was simply to flag the fact that society and offspring are not in the exact same position as it regards their respective roles in enabling the creation of your wealth, which is what the above poster seemed to imply.

--------------------------------

Rudd-X @ 2015-04-14 23:11:02 :

&gt; But they may ""deserve"" more in the sense that they were not fully compensated for the value they created. 

I hear this nonargument trotted out all the time.

The most obvious question that dismantles this baseless idea: how do *you* know what ""full compensation"" is?

The obvious answer to the obvious question is: you simply don't.  Only the person receiving the money, and the person paying the money, know that.

In other words, you, along with every single other person not the parties of the exchange, have exactly zero moral authority or factual knowledge to make such a determination against the will of the participants.  You can have an *opinion*, but your *opinion* is irrelevant in answering the question of ""did Person X get fully compensated?"".

It stands to reason that, if you agreed to do something for a certain X consideration, and you obtained that consideration, you have been ""fully compensated"" for every practical purpose.  This notion forms the basis of *all trade* -- every grownup ought to understand this.

This notion that ""people who got paid in full did somehow not get paid in full"" is a complete fabrication with no basis in reality.  It's the sort of nonsense peddled by politicians to sow division and hate among society's members and gain power.

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-14 23:14:17 :

It's not a fabrication. If you pay me $5 for a service that generates $10 of value for you, there is no way of saying which number between $5 and $10 is the ""right"" number. There would be nothing ""wrong"" with you paying me $6 for the same task. Therefore, just because we transacted at $5 doesn't mean that there would be anything unjust about me receiving $6.

--------------------------------

Rudd-X @ 2015-04-14 23:30:29 :

&gt; It's not a fabrication. 

Absolutely is.  I will show you exactly how:

&gt; If you pay me $5 for a service that generates $10 of value for you, there is no way of saying which number between $5 and $10 is the ""right"" number. 

Nonsense.  Of course there is.  [Humans have known this, in one form or another, for tens of thousands of years](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html).

The *right amount* is whatever you and I agree upon.  The agreement is final (save, obviously, exceptional cases of fraud).  Unjust -- in fact, *dishonorable* -- would be you demanding that I give you *more* money after we've settled on an agreement, just as it would be unjust -- again, *dishonorable* -- for me to decide to pay you *less* money after you've delivered as promised.

In other words, what is **right** derives from **agreement between the parties**.  Little Lulu's and Elizabeth Warren's opinions are irrelevant w.r.t. how right our own agreements are.  In fact, your hypothesis of what is ""right"" -- namely, that what is ""right"" is subject to change after the fact of the agreement -- is in fact exactly what is *unjust and dishonorable*.

Every grownup understands this.  Presumably you are a grownup.  How do you not understand this?  What falsehoods were taught to you, that this seems nonobvious to you?  In any case, you better learn this lesson right now, because the success of your entire life will depend on whether you've understood this elementary fact of every human society beyond savages.

--------------------------------

bananabooks @ 2015-04-14 23:38:54 :

Everybody who has studied economics understands that many transactions have consumer surplus.  The question of who gets said surplus is morally arbitrary.  It's no unjust for the consumer to get a lot - it's not unjust for the consumer to get a little.

Rudd-X @ 2015-04-15 00:58:30 :

You do understand that your latest comment doesn't even address what I wrote, right?

Maybe. Can I provide a counterexample? The US has a dramatically increasing Hispanic population, and within a couple decades, we won't have a white majority anymore. Some states already have majority Hispanic status. 

Nothing happened.

They didn't revolt and join Latin America or suddenly take on a special culture. One of them, California, is one of the powerhouses of American culture. Various Hispanic cultures did become more relevant and mainstream (and are elsewhere in the US), but US culture didn't disappear and no one considers it to be a Latin american country, culturally, historically, or ethnically.

I'm curious. Do you feel like you guys get more media, culture, etc. from Asia than from the US and Europe? I'm an American in New Zealand (Auckland, where there is a sizeable Asian population, more so than most of Australia). I find that I get exposed to way more American and English-language European stuff than Asian stuff (food, tv, music...). You may feel differently and have different experiences, of course. But if you do get more US/European culture than Asian culture, I'm curious as to why you think Australia will basically get absorbed into Asia. Geographically you really aren't that close--it's its own continent. It seems more likely that Australian culture would fuse with other English-speaking countries regardless of geography, since distance isn't such a limiting factor these days. 

Not to mention, there are many, many Asian cultures, not one (the same is true for Europe and the US). Which one do you expect to be absorbed into? What would that mean?

well media and culture arent the same thing. I dont think it will happen overnight, but because of the reasons in the OP I think it's already happening and will continue until we percieve ourselves at least partially as an asian country rather than strictly western.

Asian culture. It is one distinct culture even if there are regional and national cultures that exist within it.

It would simply mean that when you asked people whether Australia was a western country they would at least have to think about it, and a lot of people would consider us Asian.

What makes us western? The fact that until the 80s we were populated almost exclusively by western european immigrants who had no access to media and influences from other cultures. But that's changed dramatically and is not going to stop changing."	"[deleted] @ 2015-05-06 07:32:24 :

It doesnt 'go anywhere' or fall away necessarily it just gets changed and influenced into something distinct from the way its viewed now (western).

Even among white australians the idea of the 'national cultural identity' makes a lot of young adults feel alienated. My generation (im 21) has a much stronger tendency to identify as cosmopolitans who are defined by international culture which they access through the internet/mass migration of everyone to everywhere.

its always been like that though. its not increasing. a few generations we *were british/europeans*. That's changed over the generations and we've reached a point where we dont really know who we are.

&gt;But Europe and Asia are literally touching, and we're assuming they're different.

Because they're distinctly different cultures. So are we currently, but for how long is the question im posing.

What makes asia asia and what makes australia australia?

I think those things are changing.

A lot happened. You live in a bi-cultural country now where people have complex bi-cultural identites.

&gt; They didn't revolt and join Latin America

I never suggested anything like that needs to happen.

&gt; or suddenly take on a special culture.

yeah you did man, your culture definitely changes a lot when the nation where your culture is contained mixes with a huge amount of people from another culture.

the difference is you're already both from america (as in continents) so there's no dispute over which region the US is in.

&gt;but US culture didn't disappear 

what defines US culture and what are the main difference between it and hispanic culture?

im not saying australian culture will disappear im saying it will change.

&gt; and no one considers it to be a Latin american country, 

because you are the poster child for the west, and you are geographically western.

if the USA was south of mexico and mexicans became the ethnic majority it would be considered a latin american country."

&gt;Just because the wife doesn't have any employable skills now shouldn't mean that she should be entitled to a continuous supply of Gucci and Benz.

The wife presumably was assured she could *stop* developing her own skills, pursuing education, other spouses who had high income, by the earning husband. She was told or otherwise assured she didn't need to keep working, and so she stopped. She was 22 and willing to kick butt in law school, but her husband earned enough and he told her she would be provided for. 

10 years later she's not 22 anymore, she's middle aged. She doesn't have *the option* of going back in time and developing a career from that age. She's stuck trying to put together the pieces at 33. 

It isn't her fault she can't earn what she could have earned but for the marriage-it's the fault of the marriage. She's owed *something* for that loss. 

That said, at least in my state, alimony/maintenance is far from guaranteed and is based more in what I described above than ""lifestyle."" If you married me and lived high on the hog for 5 years and wanted a divorce, in my state, tough shit. You'd be lucky to get two years of maintenance. If you did, it'd be a fucking gift. 

You aren't likely to get alimony if your marriage is under 10 years, not really guaranteed until 20 years. So I don't really think it's like one party is winning by virtue of having a great lifestyle, I just don't see it in my practice.

gabrielmodesta @ 2015-09-24 02:00:48 :

While I understand your point, it creates a financial disincentive to marry at all, which is what I'll be teaching my children is the only smart option, particularly if they enter upwardly mobile careers.

Weddings and rings are fine, just no marriage license.  Then there's no issue, but your points go unaddressed.  This may not be the intended consequence of the laws, but it is certainly a consequence.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 02:36:02 :

What is the disincentive exactly? A possible negative outcome? If you are not legally married you are missing out on all the legal benefits of marriage. Let's say you have a daughter and she is very successful but leaves the workforce to have children and her husband is very successful. 

They raise the kids to 18. Your daughter is over fifty, out of the workforce for decades. Her ""husband"" kicks her out, trades up for a younger model. 

What happens to your daughter? She is left destitute. Penniless. Without marketable skills. No protection because no legal marriage. 

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 14:49:53 :

&gt; If you are not legally married you are missing out on all the legal benefits of marriage.

That is only the case in some countries. In Canada, all the legal benefits of marriage can be had simply for living together for a year or more, with a lot less risk to the higher earning partner.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 15:36:49 :

If there is less risk for the higher earning partner, how on earth are the protections the same?

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 15:47:05 :

It's not an equal sum game. At least not in all scenarios. Like in a case without kids, the higher earning partner can have less risk without the lower earning partner losing anything either.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 15:50:42 :

Okay I didn't ask correctly. You can't have equal protections for both parties but less risk for one, that's impossible. Assume two couples together for 10 years no kids. One couple is married one is not. Both have a wife who earns $100,000 and the male earns $50,000. 

At dissolution of the relationship, what risk is the unmarried person not facing that the married person is? If any exist, how do these risks impact the other party?

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 16:01:09 :

The unmarried person doesn't risk having to pay a portion of their income to the other person. That is the risk I am talking about.

I'm thinking about this in the context of my life personally. I'm unmarried, don't want kids, and dating someone who makes roughly half of what I do. Since I can get the legal benefits of marriage simply by living with them for a year plus, why would I ever marry them? It does nothing but add more risk with no practical reward.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 16:11:02 :

&gt; The unmarried person doesn't risk having to pay a portion of their income to the other person. That is the risk I am talking about.

Okay so the unmarried, non-earning spouse does not have the benefits of the marriage-that is, they do not have the protection of alimony/maintenance. Do you see how that works? If it's good for one person it's necessarily bad for the other person. 

YOU don't gain anything by getting married, but they do.

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 17:05:56 :

There is no ""non-earning"" spouse in my scenario. I don't quite understand what you are talking about there. We aren't talking about a ""protection"" of maintenance, we are talking about two people who each make more than enough to support themselves.

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 17:23:59 :

Well my specific circumstance is a common one, hence my argument ""It's not an equal sum game. At least not in all scenarios."" So your question ""But what about this other scenario"" doesn't do anything to refute my argument.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 17:26:05 :

That's not what equal sum means. 

Yes, in your particular and frankly not common arrangement, there is not much to be gained. Society wide, there is a significant difference 

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 17:33:05 :

&gt; That's not what equal sum means.

Yes it is. When you assume that a downside to one equals an upside to the other, or a risk to one equals a reward to the other, that implies an equal sum. As in 5+5 = 10, take away one from one partner means an addition to the other, 4+6 = 10.

Or in your own words "" If it's good for one person it's necessarily bad for the other person.""

I'm saying that isn't always the case.

&gt; Yes, in your particular and frankly not common arrangement

How is it not common?

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 18:15:06 :

You think a DINKer arrangement is common? Most people have children. Most people get married. Most people have differing levels of income.

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 18:25:39 :

A couple without children is extremely common, yes. And as I've said we do have differing levels of income.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 18:28:46 :

&gt;A couple without children is extremely common

I can't speak for your country but in the US:

&gt;Only six percent of Americans aged 18 to 40 do not have, and do not want to have, children

Not common at all

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 18:39:42 :

Where did you get that statistic?

http://www.torontomike.com/2010/01/how_many_canadian_women_choose.html

""Twenty percent of American women from the ages of 40 to 44 have no children, double the level of 30 years ago""

20% is pretty damn common.

http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx

We aren't talking about the number of people with children. Your situation, as I recall, is not having kids and *not wanting kids*. Someone wanting kids may very well benefit from marriage. 

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 19:44:12 :

But even if only 6% report they don't want children clearly a lot more eventually decide against it if as much as one fifth of woman haven't had kids yet in their 40s. Regardless, its a semantic argument of the word ""common"" but my point is being a childless couple as a certain point of time certainly isn't rare.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 19:52:30 :

&gt; clearly a lot more eventually decide against it 

You think that's what's happening? They're just deciding against it? Couldn't be fertility problems, financial obstacles, not finding a suitable partner, *losing* a suitable partner? Evidence indicates the desire to have children *increases* as you approach 40, not decreases. 

&gt;being a childless couple as a certain point of time certainly isn't rare.

That isn't what you said, you know that isn't what you said. We were talking about people who did not marry and needn't get married because they weren't going to have kids. That's your situation, that's the situation we talked about. You said it was common, I said it wasn't common, I showed evidence indicating I'm right, and now you're shifting the goalposts to appear right. This is *infuriating* and you are inserting real and not insignificant obstacles to productive dialogue by doing these things.

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 20:53:00 :

No, not everyone ends up in a situation for the exact same reasons. But someone's desire to have kids or not if they don't end up doing it is rather besides the point. 

In a discussion about alimony and when it should apply, whether a couple wants kids or not isn't an important factor its whether they *actually have kids or not*. I meant someone is my situation as in *a couple without children*. Which is rather common, especially among highly educated people like myself.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 20:57:42 :

&gt; In a discussion about alimony and when it should apply, whether a couple wants kids or not isn't an important factor its whether they actually have kids or not.

We weren't talking about that. We were talking about whether your situation is common, and it isn't. Not even a little bit. 

Alimony is not related to children ever. That's child support. Alimony is a separate question entirely. So *putting aside that you created this new discussion about ""alimony and when it should apply"" relative to the presence of children*, it doesn't matter, because alimony does not relate to children. Source: I'm a divorce attorney. 

--------------------------------

Cooper720 @ 2015-09-24 21:16:27 :

I understand the difference but children absolutely do factor into the discussion of alimony given that since it is often the case one will stay home to look after them that should factor into alimony decisions. Also, if a couple has kids the lesser earning partner doesn't just to make a living for just them they also need to have a place that is suitable to look after the kids in joint custody arrangements. A recently divorced person can get by fine in a studio apartment, but not if they are supposed to look after the kids 3 days out of the week.

I, however, don't see how alimony is just in cases where the couple doesn't have kids and both make enough to live off of.

--------------------------------

goldandguns @ 2015-09-24 21:17:35 :

So I'm realizing more and more that you have absolutely no idea how alimony works and that's more the reason this conversation has been so miserable.

the definition of ""empire"" requires it to be a multiethnic state, this is tautologically true. what i am saying is that these empires were not pluralistic everyone-shares-political-power hugfests, but a core ethnic group dominating client states/cultures. this does not presuppose no cultural sharing in both directions.

&gt;The Romans would not have built their empire without diversity. Again, this is literal, not speculative. They got their sword from Iberians, their shields from Gauls, their ships from North Africans, etc.

this is equivalent to stating ""modern china would not be successful without european inventions, therefore is a diverse state.""

&gt;Is that ""retaining dominance""?

yes. if you read roman history of the period of most rapid expansion during the late republican era you would see that the vast majority of powerful families traced their ancestry to the founding of the city. the problems that gradually accumulated with the degeneration of the core ethnic group and incomplete assimilation of many german and celtic peoples played large parts in the collapse of the late imperial period. adopting a multitude of technologies and a fair amount of cultural practices from various client states does not change this.

i am not the OP, please stop arguing with me against his point. i agree you have successfully proven the OP incorrect as he worded it. 

"	2	0	stop arguing comment					"When in history has multi racial, no, multi ethnic even societies ever worked together successfully?

In the middle east today, you have ethnic groups fighting each other that were only held together in the first place through the utter force of a tyrant prior. Now there's a power vacuum and mass fighting.

In america, we still see people say things are not equal despite multiple services that prefer people of ""minority"" status to extra privileges. Despite decades of this, there's been little improvement and people still think it's some how an issue they can solve.

Areas largely segregate themselves by population alone, going decades back even. The creations of ""Little Italy"", ""china town"" etc. are evidence of migrants typically collecting together.

As the media presents it, there's constant friction between races alone. Even some modern day speeches of saying ""color blindness is racist"" meaning, unless you give some one special treatment due to their ethnicity or race, you're scum of the earth. How does that make any sense what so ever? That's ignoring how it implies they're inherently inferior some how because they NEED the help to be equal.

This is flat-out wrong. Women, Asians, Southeast Asians, and Hispanics have done extraordinarily well in a short time with an evened playing field, and the first three in particular do not receive affirmative action at all.

&gt;When in history has multi racial, no, multi ethnic even societies ever worked together successfully?

I'm sorry, but examples of powerful empires consisting of diversity are not very hard to find in history at all. The most famous empires in history succeeded from diversity.

Rome had Italians, Gauls, Celts, North Africans, Middle Easterners, Greeks, etc. under its empire for hundreds of years and it certainly flourished. Romanized Hispanics, Gauls, Africans, etc. became so thoroughly Roman some became senators and emperors. 

Carthage was a trading empire that flourished, mixing Berbers, Libyans, Phoenicians, Hispanics, etc. to found colonies all across the Mediterranean in little more than rowing ships.

The Mongols, who held sway once from Korea to Poland, flourished because Genghis Khan married the best ideas of the Mongols, Chinese, Koreans, Persians, Christians, and Slavs. The last Khan was deposed in the fucking 19th century-- that's how long the Mongol empires lasted.

The United States I am sure needs no mention to you.

C-LAR @ 2015-09-24 13:05:49 :

imperial nations tend to have the core ethnic group at the top with others in generally subservient roles. the histories of the empires you have listed should prove how unstable that is.

not exactly supporting your point....

&gt;you showed they were false so long as the core ethnic group retains dominant, yeah, i agree with you.

Reading this again, I thought I just had to show you step by step how silly this statement is.

In order for a nation/empire to be great, diversity is *a necessity.*

We will define greatness as a nation that is able to project its cultural, philosophical, and economic values 1,000 miles beyond its own natural borders for a period of 100 years or more. 

Your undiverse, monoracial ""empires"", if I can even call them that, are things like the Zulu ""empire."" Or the Polish ""empire."" Basically, I cannot think of a single monoracial nation that ever achieved greatness.

You state ""the core ethnic group retains dominance"" but this is just flat out wrong.

The Mongols were vastly outnumbered by the people of the nations they conquered. Something like 400,000 Mongols (Of which probably 80,000 or so were actual soldiers) conquered pretty much all of Eurasia. They ruled these lands for hundreds of years, some almost a millenia. You think the Mongols didn't adapt to the local cultures? Ninja, please. The Mongol rulers  became Sinicized, Persianized, etc. wherever they conquered after some centuries. They had to. The conquered and the conqueror had a cultural synergy that lasted for centuries. 

The Mongols could not build their empire without diversity. This isn't one of those ""hurr the USA needed blacks or it would have collapsed"" bullshit.  In order to conquer the Middle East, the Mongols needed Northern Chinese engineers. In order to conquer Southern China, the Mongols also needed Persian engineers. In order to *govern* China, the Mongols needed to learn from Persian and Muslim bookkeepers. Every civilization that had an expertise the Mongols didn't have became valued, and were incorporated fully into the empire. 

The Greeks never did shit. It was only when Macedon married elements of Thracian, Macedonian, Greek, and (later) Persian culture did Alexander's empire form. This required diversity.

The Romans would not have built their empire without diversity. Again, this is literal, not speculative. They got their sword from Iberians, their shields from Gauls, their ships from North Africans, etc. Do you think the Romans could have built their empire without diversity? We don't have to guess-- we already know. The Romans could not even subjugate their direct neighbors when relying on good ol' monoracial nondiversity. Greek tutors taught the wealthy's children. Without Numidian cavalry, Hannibal Barca never would have been defeated.

Romans were changed as much as the ethnic minorities in their empire. You say ""core ethnic group retains dominant"" without knowing what it means. The ethnic minorities in Rome changed the way Romans spoke, the foods they ate, the gods they worshipped, the way they waged war, the way they traded goods, the way they sailed ships, the way they raised their children. Is that ""retaining dominance""? 

Name me one monoracial, homogenous nation that ever achieved greatness. Poland? The Zulus? Nigeria? I seriously cannot think of any.

I've been to one. Anyway, people take one word and derive an entire point out of it that I'm not even making. Strawman detected on ""who have a fairly mild issue of some sadness and awkwardness."" There's no point in arguing for something I agree with.

&gt; Instead we should encourage government funding for srs.

Stop arguing my points if you're going to oppose me."	-1	0	stop arguing comment					"Let me make my point perfectly clear right off the bat: I am not open to debate about whether gender dysphoria exists. It exists and I don't wish to debate that. I hold that it's a mental illness which does sometimes cure itself in some cases, but not all. I also hold that gender reassignment regret exists, but is rare- it is very difficult to tell how many regret their change, but reassignment surgery to their original configuration has occurred and does exist.

Gender Dysphoria should be treated as it is; except that dramatically more research should be given to finding a cure which realigns the brain to no longer experience gender dysphoria in patients whom retain their body's sexual function at birth. By granting gender reassignment research is not given into those people and we are losing potential test subjects to hopefully cure this disorder.

It is cruel to subject a person to a society which detests their existence. We should not lie about the state of the world. We are not super heroes of justice and we cannot convince everyone to not hate them. We are subjecting them to an entire world which doesn't like them. Even if we come to acceptance within the Western world there are still countries such as Russia whom would either kill them or force them into endless pain. This on it's own would not stand as a good argument, but there is an alternative: we need to treat them as mental patients, put them in institutions to ensure their survival, and try our hardest using good science (not the stupidity that was Pray the Gay away) in ways that are safe. We must not treat them as horrible human beings, but as people who are in severe pain and distress. Whom need all the help they can get: this is an argument that might convince even gay-hating-Russia to follow. With this argument we can convince the world and we can take the steps necessary to help all of them.

I will end this by giving a counter argument to a common point:

&gt; Ultimately, if an individual decides for themselves they wish to do a thing to themselves, and it causes no harm to others, then that individual should have right to act as they please. Even if it ultimately causes their death.

By this logic we should do the same for people who have suicidal thoughts. By the logic that surrounds this we should even encourage them to take their own lives like we do for transgender people to become their new gender. We know that this disorder results, or causes, changes in the brain the same as depression. By this logic we should remove suicide prevention because that would be the same as shaming gender dysphoria patients. This is horrible and cruel.

The reason that much of this argument does not apply to homosexuality is simple: there is no need to remove healthy organs in their cases (which then leads to a chance of infection and death) and there is evidence that suicide is not nearly as epidemic in their group as trans-gendered peoples.

In countries where it has not been accepted it would indeed be cruel and this argument would apply. For those countries we may still wish to gain sexual orientation alteration drugs, but here in the West it may as well be a cosmetic change.

This argument does not apply to peoples who are not born XX or XY. They are special cases and I don't hold any view concerning them.

&gt; If there was a magic pill to give these people that would solve their problems than I'd have zero problem with it, but there isn't one.

Well, lets make one.

**EDIT:** Holy crap this blew up! If I don't respond to your individual points it's because the volume of points being made is... A lot. I'm super sorry if I don't get to all of you.

**EDIT2:** I never made the statement that SRS should absolutely never be done. I'm saying that it's horrible to press people into it or to make them believe that it's a good idea in our media. I am not talking about medical personnel who actively discourage it. I'm talking about the media's favor towards it.

**EDIT3:** A Delta has been awarded against the clarification of my points in EDIT2. As medical profession at large thoroughly believe it's worth the risk you can't very well tell the media to stop saying the same.

**EDIT4:** Most posts aren't arguing against my view when it comes to the following-

&gt; we need to treat them as mental patients, put them in institutions to ensure their survival, and try our hardest using good science

It would be up to the medical practitioner which to do. In reality I made this point *horribly*. I'm talking about creating ""safety-wards"" for gender dysphoria sufferers. Places that can do both long-term and short-term aid. The reason I even mention this is because of transgender people I know in real life who... Need more help than most people admit. It would be best if they could far more easily slip out of society for a while.

Another point people aren't even arguing against my view is this- I'm not saying depression = gender dysphoria. I'm saying that both affect the brain and by the logic of the listed counterpoint you'd have to apply it. It's hypocritical thinking to try otherwise. It should not be their individual choice; that should be the choice of medical practitioners. **NOT family.**

**EDIT5:** Institution idea was shot out of the water and a Delta was awarded. Suicide rates are negligible when compared to the general population. This means that there is no reason to set up specialized safe-housing in addition to what's already done.

**EDIT6:** My head is spinning from too much debate. The only point remaining unchanged is that it shouldn't be their choice, but that of medical practitioners taking care of them. Except that then I remembered that half the US supports Hobby Lobby as it pertains to doctors. That makes supporting my position impossible.

I'm surprised no-one tried to point that out to me. I'm going to collapse now. My head is heavy. Congrats to everyone that got a Delta. Those were hard-earned because my belief was fairly solid. And to those who straw-manned my arguments to oblivion: Come on, seriously? I never said stop GRS/SRS until the pill was researched.

The only point that might be of contention is whether the pill should be taken *instead* of GRS once it's out. Options are cooler. I'm headed out. Peace.

**EDIT7:** I'm back. Ish. I took a nap. Another Delta was awarded because, honestly, expecting Russia to not horribly torture people is probably a bad idea. One that didn't really occur to me until pointed out. I also noticed that someone else deserves a Delta, but I totally completely forgot who or where. They essentially convinced me that GRS should not be phased out whatsoever unless another treatment had remarkable success and was cheaper. It was probably one of the people whom got a Delta though.

**EDIT8:** All possible Deltas are gone! All points have been rebuked and my view is fully changed.

You want to- make trans people human experiments, stop them having sanity saving gender reassignment, not accept them, lock them in mental hospitals, lie and say they're in horrible pain and distress, blame trans people for them being depressed rather than people who bully them.

You have numerous hurtful and murderous ideas. Your plan would be terrible for trans people. It sounds like the sort of plan that would be devised by someone who wanted to massively worsen the lives of trans people, the same as if someone suggested we round up all the black people and put them in camps where we'd experiment on them to cure their blackness because they love them so much and want to make them one of us.

Denying the uniqueness of different people and forcing them away from their homes and families into places where you do scientific experiments on them isn't loving.

Funny, as the group of people who advocate most for trans rights will **not accept people that disagree with them.** I've already had one verbally threaten me on this subject on a separate comment on this post despite the fact that, several times, I've said that I'm in favor of trans-acceptance: I just don't think it's practical.

I am sure they would find many 'volunteers' for experiments. Probably for organ donations and such too.

&gt;Funny, as the group of people who advocate most for trans rights will not accept people that disagree with them. 

https://i.imgur.com/ES6sP.jpg

Why would they accept people who want to lock up trans people? They generally want allies who say things that would help them. 

&gt;I've said that I'm in favor of trans-acceptance: I just don't think it's practical.

Lots of countries have become more trans accepting. This reads more like the argument of a person who secretly is against trans acceptance and wants to use it as a cover to discriminate against trans people. Like saying...

""I love black people, and want them to be accepted. It's not practical for the majority to do so though, so we should round them up into concentration camps till we can genetically exterminate the taint of their blood from humanity.""

&gt;What, exactly, is hurtful and murderous about any of the ideas I've spoken here? Hell- I'm against all forms of death, especially suicide. Don't put words in my mouth. I won't have it.

Trans people are generally suicidal because the thing they value, being a gender, is denied to them and they're bullied for not conforming to society.

You're suggesting we lock them up till we can destroy the thing they value. That would massively increase the suicide rate.

We can reduce suicide by accepting people's differences. You are suggesting we do the opposite. You're against death, but for bullying trans people in a way that makes it more likely they kill themselves.

I don't know. I was hoping that Russia would actually be like ""oh, you found a drug which will change them into cis people. Cool. We'll actually use it"" or like ""oh, you want to find a drug. Cool here's money to do it."" But now that I think about it- they'd just do what they're already doing. Locking them up and doing their own experiments via torture.

And no, I don't really think about what I write on Saturdays. Why the fuck would I? It's my day off.

I doubt they'd care to pay for what would probably be very expensive magical pills or to hand money over for it or to pay for an extermination. 

What they'd likely do is this.

Use trans people as cheap slave labour. That way, not only do they not have to pay to help those 'scum' they can actually make money off them.

&gt;You're suggesting we lock them up till we can destroy the thing they value. That would massively increase the suicide rate.

I got the impression that the aim was to cure people of their dysphoria so that they could feel comfortable without having to go through SRS.

Of course, I would say ""That's like looking for a pill to cure homosexuality or skin pigmentation"", but OP distinguishes it by saying that trans* individuals involve the mutilation of their own body in a way that destroys the function of some of their most important organs, and thus could be seen as a form of self-harm.

If the aim is to cure gender dysphoria, and it succeeds, I fail to see how that would lead to increased suicide.

There are indeed many excuses for the mass destruction of people's identities.

People don't want to be cured generally, they like their personality.

Etular @ 2015-09-27 11:08:51 :

&gt;People don't want to be cured generally, they like their personality.

But surely part of a cure is to change what they see as a ""dysfunctional thought"", in they same way they give a person with psychosis anti-psychotics (or, similar to the hypothetical ""trans* cure"", anti-depressants exist to deal with depression). 

In such a manner, such a ""cure"" doesn't even require the input of the person - a psychiatric cure would aim to change the thought process through targeting neurotransmitters in the brain. Whether people ""want"" to maintain their personality of their gender identity is almost irrelevant in this hypothetical situation, because if a cure were to exist then it would seek to change those thoughts. It would seek to medically erase such compulsions - in the same way we saw such attempts in the past. 

The adoption of identities, gender or otherwise, are hardly an inalienable right to many people.

Being trans isn't actually dysfunctional, hence a big part of the issue. They can function just fine in society for the most part, just people bully them a lot.

Incidentally, how would you feel if this was targetted at you? Suppose your government decided that something you liked such as video games or partners of your preferred gender was dysfunctional and, without your input, they wanted to change the neurotransmitters in your brain so you would hate that group?

A lot of the same could be said, arguably, for a lot of individuals labelled as having a mental illness, especially those who are only mildly affected by it.

Gender dysphoria, almost by definition, is a dysfunctional thought which disrupts everyday life, often by causing depression, with its current treatment being Sex Reassignment Surgery. In many ways, we're simply talking about changing the treatment to some hypothetical magic pill which gets rid of the problem.

&gt;Incidentally, how would you feel if this was targetted at you?

Obviously, I would resist it - in the same way that you are, yourself - but, if they were to actively decide to force it upon me, I would have no say in the matter. I may be able to flee to a less authoritarian government, but that would be the most I could do.

It may be seen as unethical, since it was done without consent, but if it were to change my views alongside then surely at that point I would be agreeable to it post-treatment. To the people who administered the treatment, I'd be ""cured"" of such compulsions, on the basis that I'd been drugged into no longer having such compulsions.

They experience discomfort and distress, quite reasonably. If you forced me to wear a dress and make out with men I would likely also become depressed, as a heterosexual male. That would then be worsened if I was bullied. I also not like being forced to take a pill to enjoy making out with men.

If they're changing your views too then they have fairly radical technology. I'd also not trust them to stop at that. They might rewrite my political and religious and sociological views to adhere to the social norms. 

I'd count that as my mental death. My replacement would be agreeable to it post treatment, yes, but I regard murder like that as radically immoral.

In many ways, that would lead to the perfectly functional society - where everything could be predicted mechanistically, everyone would adhere to the social norms, and the slightest deviance would be dealt with by an increased dosage.

Illiberal and absolutely totalitarian to many, but there will be some who feel that such an elimination of all social conflict and psychological troubles in favour of the absolute homogenization of humanity is desirable. In many ways, most interest groups - regardless of ideology - support some form of that view, whether they call for the ""elimination of bigotry"" or ""preventing the spread of religion""; people are always trying to change eachother's views and beliefs.

There are people who, taking the opposite perspective to the above, would condemn the application of the drug to trans* individuals, but would happily use it on transphobes, and simply justify it by ""fairness""/""equality"". For many, the ends would justify the means.

You seem to want to argue that ""not clinically depressed""=""happy"".  Which is a mistake.  One can be unhappy and not be clinically depressed.  For example a mother who has just seen her child die may well not be clinically depressed (as clinical depression is not caused by a loss or other life tragedy) but may well (and likely is) still depressed or at the least unhappy.

We can't conclude from lack of clinical depression among the Kaluli, that they are happy, only that they are not clinically depressed. 

--------------------------------

wedontluvthemhoes @ 2015-12-21 02:46:45 :

Obviously the people in a society where 1 in 2000 people are depressed, are happier than the people in a society where [1 in 10](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/statistics-infographic) people have depression at some point in their lives.

--------------------------------

law-talkin-guy @ 2015-12-21 03:04:51 :

Depression is not the same as clinical depression, and clinical depression is not the same as ""not happy"".  Clinical depression is a specific medical diagnosis, which requires specific criteria be met.  That a person does not meet the definition of clinical depression does not make them happy, it makes them not mentally ill in a particular way.

Think of it this way, suppose I told you that among the Kaluli only 1 in 2,000 people suffer from obesity, compared to 1 in 4 among modern Americans.  Would you then conclude that they are more healthy?  Or would you conclude that they suffer from a particular problem less?

Clinical depression is a single mental illness.  It is not all mental illness. Further, not all people who are unhappy are mentally ill (a mother who has just seen her child die is not mentally ill for being depressed).  To say that because these people suffer from a particular mental illness at lower rates than modern society means they are happier is to conflate a number of issues into one.

--------------------------------

wedontluvthemhoes @ 2015-12-21 03:21:10 :

It would follow that their rates of anxiety etc are lower as well. Its fair to assume that the rate of clinical depression in a society is a strong indicator of overall mental health and its fair to assume that people in a society with virtually no clinical depression are happier than people in a society where depression affects 1 in 10 people and mental illness of some kind affects 1 in 4.

--------------------------------

law-talkin-guy @ 2015-12-21 03:48:16 :

&gt;It would follow that their rates of anxiety etc are lower as well.

That doesn't follow at all.  

&gt;Its fair to assume that the rate of clinical depression in a society is a strong indicator of overall mental health 

Why?

What makes clinical depression a good bell-weather for overall mental health?

I'd argue that, in fact, it is a poor metric as, unlike other mental illnesses, the average age of onset for clinical depression occurs after the teenage years have passed.  (Average age of onset is in the late twenties or early thirties depending on what source you look at, rather than in the teens when most mental illnesses have their average age of onset).  That's a significant difference.  And one which might be relevant when comparing a culture with lower life-expediencies to one with higher ones.

&gt;its fair to assume that people in a society with virtually no clinical depression are happier than people in a society where depression affects 1 in 10 people 

First, and again, ""Depression"" is not the same as ""Clinical Depression"" you cannot treat the two as equivalent.    Second, again, ""not clinically depressed"" is not the same as ""happy"".  I can be not clinically depressed and still be deeply unhappy.  For example, a mother who is not happy because her child just died is not clinically depressed, she is still not happy.  If life is shitty enough, if there are enough rational reasons to be sad, it is almost impossible to be clinically depressed as recent bereavement is grounds to exclude a diagnosis of clinical depression.  If friends and family die on a regular basis, then you won't be clinically depressed, you'll just be sad and miserable in a mentally healthy way.  Clinical depression is severe depression without understandable external cause, if there is an understandable external cause for the depression you aren't mentally ill, you are just miserable.

--------------------------------

wedontluvthemhoes @ 2015-12-21 04:13:44 :

&gt;What makes clinical depression a good bell-weather for overall mental health?

Because overall mental health is measured by how happy people are. Depression is more or less just chronic unhappiness, so the higher the rate of depression within a society, the lower the rate of happiness/overall mental health would be.

&gt; ""Depression"" is not the same as ""Clinical Depression""

But its an entirely subjective difference anyway.

&gt; I can be not clinically depressed and still be deeply unhappy.

And it wouldnt be a problem. We're *supposed* to suffer. But a healthy person suffers for a good reason and then recovers from it.

But if a person suffers for ""no reason"" and is unable to recover from it, they have depression, and when 1 in 10 people start to feel this way there's obviously something fundamentally fucked up in their culture and they're obviously not a very happy bunch.

&gt;  If friends and family die on a regular basis,

you make it sound like a weekly occurrence and youre setting up a false premise.

you also have no idea how people grieve in that culture, or whether death is even seen as a bad thing.

&gt; Depression is more or less just chronic unhappiness

No, chronic unhappiness is one of many [symptoms of depression](http://www.allaboutdepression.com/dia_03.html).  It's perfectly possible to be clinically depressed without being unhappy, although this is unusual as depression tends to prevent behaviour which promotes happiness.

law-talkin-guy @ 2015-12-22 06:35:28 :

How is this so hard to understand?

Imagine a woman who becomes convinced she is Mary, Mother of God. This belief makes her happy - Blessed is She Among Women, after all - it gives her a sense of peace and she spends her days in almost beatific joy.  Is this woman mentally ill?  Is this a problem if it leads her to, say abandon her husband and children (since he is not Joseph and, therefore, not really her husband, and since they are not Jesus and, therefore, not really her children)? The delusion brings her happiness, but is still a mental illness.

Or consider the man who hears the voice of God order him to kill children.  In killing the children he is, he believes, carrying out God's will, and this brings him happiness.  Is he not mentally ill?

Or the serial killer who finds great joy in the torture and murder of other people.  Again, those impulses bring him happiness (and orgasmic pleasure in some cases).  Is the impulse to murder not a problem because it doesn't make him unhappy?

I could go on and on.  There are plenty of mental illnesses that do not hamper happiness.  This is why ""happiness"" as a single metric for mental health is totally useless.

&gt; In a lot of cultures what we call being schizophrenic, they call shamanism. Would you consider a south american tribal shaman to be mentally ill?

Oddly enough, this is not true.  Being a shaman is not the same as being schizophrenic - the hallucinations/mystical insights/whatever of shamen come from extreme physical situations or the use of hallucinogenic substances.  (Read *The Teachings of Don Juan* for a great anthropological/sociological look at what being a shaman actually looks like.)  Schizophrenia is not at all the same thing as the experience of a shaman.

&gt;And would you consider a serial killer who wasnt delusional to be mentally ill? Because youre conflating two things: delusions and murderous tendencies.

Yes.  And no - serial killer was an additional example of mental illness without unhappiness.  Most serial killers are not delusional - they know that they are killing people - they simply enjoy doing so and while they know it is ""wrong"" they don't care about social judgment (except in so far as it might lead to not beign able to do what they want).

&gt;If you take away the negative affects that these people have on others people, you could definitely call them delusional but I dont see how its an illness. 

Your previous stance was that if the person with the mental illness was not unhappy, they were not mentally ill.  That has nothing to do with the impact on others.  Is the schizophrenic who happily kills because God told him to mentally ill?  Is the sufferer of Jerusalem Syndrome who abandons her family because she is Mary Mother of God mentally ill?  

If you start to focus on how their thoughts impact others, you've already changed the criteria.  If you focus on how it impacts others, you've conceded that happiness alone is not the measure of mental health.  (Which, to come back to the main point, would show that lack of a particular mental health issue in a particular pre-industrial tribe is not evidence that they are, over all, happier and more content.  It would also show that your contention that clinical depression is a fair measure of over all mental health is equally ungrounded.)

&gt;Like if I have a benign tumor im not physically ill, so how is benign delusion an illness?

Only your contention was that if you were not unhappy you were not mentally ill, which is a lot more like saying if I'm not in pain I am not physically ill.  So the parallel would be more like a malignant tumor causing no pain (yet).  

&gt;You could call Trump voters delusional too but you wouldnt call them mentally ill.

Right, because mental health can't be collapsed to a single metric (and certantly not to a single binary metric). Delusional/not-delusional is as bad a metric for mental health as happy/unhappy is.

Its pretty common knowledge.


&gt;Your previous stance was that if the person with the mental illness was not unhappy, they were not mentally ill.  That has nothing to do with the impact on others.  Is the schizophrenic who happily kills because God told him to mentally ill? 

How does the effect that the person has on society reflect on whether or not they are mentally ill? At what point does your disruption of society make you mentally ill? 

And for your example where your state of mind makes you do something which then causes you to go to jail or something, then clearly your state of mind doesnt make you happy...

&gt;If you start to focus on how their thoughts impact others, you've already changed the criteria.  If you focus on how it impacts others, you've conceded that happiness alone is not the measure of mental health.

But im not focusing on that... you are... I dont agree that how your behavior impacts others is a metric that can define whether you are mentally ill or not. Youre erasing the line between criminal and mentally ill. We dont treat a lucid, intelligent serial killer as mentally ill. What about the soldiers who kill civilians through carelessness? What about the guy who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima?

&gt;Only your contention was that if you were not unhappy you were not mentally ill, which is a lot more like saying if I'm not in pain I am not physically ill.

&gt; Its pretty common knowledge.

First, West Africa is not the same as South America.  Second, ""common knowledge"" often turns out to be assumption and prejudice in disguise.  Third, I can't seem to find a single source to support this claim that doesn't come from Some, who seems to have a vested interest in this claim as it promotes his business as a workshop presenter. Fourth, see *Shamanism: An Encyclopedia of World Beliefs, Practices, and Culture, Volume 1* "" Psycopathology and Shamanism"", ""[...]there are distinct differences between shamanic and schizophrenic states of consciousness, not only in terms of the intentional and voluntary nature of these states, but also in terms of the affective, perceptual, and cognitive entailment's associated with each."" (The same source will, to go back to your ""common knowledge"" inform you that this is a belief that has long been discredited by actual study in the field.)

&gt;How does the effect that the person has on society reflect on whether or not they are mentally ill? At what point does your disruption of society make you mentally ill? 

It doesn't.  And never.


&gt;And for your example where your state of mind makes you do something which then causes you to go to jail or something, then clearly your state of mind doesnt make you happy...

Why not?  Plenty of people are happy in  prison.  Plus, who cares?  If they were happy before they went to prison, they were (according to you) not mentally ill.  What does it matter if they later became unhappy?

&gt;But im not focusing on that... you are... I dont agree that how your behavior impacts others is a metric that can define whether you are mentally ill or not. 

That's not what you said in your previous reply.  ""If you take away the negative affects that these people have on others people, you could definitely call them delusional but I dont see how its an illness. Like if I have a benign tumor im not physically ill, so how is benign delusion an illness?""  

&gt;Youre erasing the line between criminal and mentally ill. 

No I'm not.  The serial killer is criminal and mentally ill.  The woman who thinks she is Mary Mother of God is mentally ill but not criminal.  I've given you examples of people who are happy and mentally ill and criminal and people who are happy and mentally ill and not criminal.  Since clearly I think both the criminal and the non-criminal can be mentally ill, I am not erasing the line

&gt;We dont treat a lucid, intelligent serial killer as mentally ill.

Sure we do.  We don't treat him as criminal insane or as incompetent to stand trial or as not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect (or whatever your state's terminology is), but we still treat him as mentally ill.  Sane enough to stand trial and sane are two very different things.

&gt;What about the soldiers who kill civilians through carelessness? What about the guy who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima?

What about them?  They could be mentally ill and they could be not mentally ill.  I've no idea about their mental state.

&gt;How do you figure? 

Because pain is a better analogy to unhappiness.  Pain is symptom of the physical system, as unhappiness is a symptom of the psychological system.  Pain can stem from multiple stimuli, like unhappiness.  Etc.  The analogy is much closer.

&gt;Are you assuming that when I say happiness and unhappiness im refering to one fleeting moment rather than one feels overall?

I assume you are referring to a discreet moment in time, though not necessarily a fleeting moment.  I assume that you wouldn't say 10 years of a happy childhood, followed by 5 years of an unhappiness amounted to a happy person at the end of that 5th year.

1. The pee does not all go down the drain. If you are taking a hot shower, some of it mixes with the steam of the shower. And guess what? It condenses with that steam as well. If you do it regularly you will start to see streaks of pee on your bathroom walls where the steam has cooled and run down. Speaking from experience as someone who used to pee in the shower and had shower-pissing brothers.

I am not sure distillation is the word you were meaning to use for steam that ferries urine to the deepest, darkest, hardest to clean nooks of your bathroom.

Distillation is not a naturally occurring process unlike urine steam that apparently makes your bathroom smell like a dirty, public restroom.

Pipette-Queen @ 2016-03-24 04:19:24 :

You know, I do actually understand the basic concepts of distillation...

We call what is floating around in your ""steamy"" shower steam, but it is not technically. Steam is water in a gaseous phase (invisible vapor) and this is what distillation relies on.  The movement of hot gas, into a cool chamber where it changes to liquid, thus separation/purification. This occurs ONLY when you heat the water to boiling, so 100 deg C or 212 deg F. This extreme temperature is not happening in your shower.

Instead, in your ""steamy"" shower are very, very small droplets of misty water (capable of carrying urine) in a condensed phase being kept in motion by thermal Brownian motion. When it cools, the water (capable of carrying urine) parks itself on walls, sinks, nooks, and crannies causing your bathroom to smell like a truck stop. The droplets of water are not gaseous nor purified, so the distillation argument doesn't hold up in this case. They can contain salts, ammonia, sulfur compounds, delicious proteins that bacteria will later feed on, etc. This will make your bathroom smell. 

Think of it as the same concept as fecal matter being carried by small droplets of water onto the surfaces of your bathroom when you flush except the water molecules are moving more vigorously and have more of a widespread journey. 

TL;DR The steam in a shower is not in a gaseous state and, therefore, is not purified it can contain urine or the compounds of urine that make things smell.

I am sure you know better than I how and where the urine falls. However, in this case, I believe OP of this comment was speaking of urine collecting in the bottom of the tub (not a stream directly in the drain). Urine that is swirling and mixing with the water in the bottom of your tub and being hit repeatedly and forcefully by the streams of water from the shower head. These actions are causing the urine mist aka steamy urine.

Despite your slow, volatile distillation example, the point remains: distillation is not occurring in your shower. It may occur at lower temps in various conditions and at various pressures, but, in your shower, you have water droplets not gas.

One last point, I feel some de ja vu here... , emulsify is not the word you want to use. Emulsify means to mix two immiscible liquids, like oil and vinegar into a vinaigrette or when you make aioli or mayo. Not when a solid mixes with water as in the case of the mists of fecal matter flying through the air when you flush. It has been well-established that the fecal matter is taken for a ride by the superfine water droplets ejected into the air.

I honestly don't care if you piss in the shower. Not my piss, not my shower.

Specifically I mean issues such as ""cis-sexism"", ""ablesim"", ""cultural appropriation"" and the concept of various ""privileges"" which a vocal minority seem to champion. Essentially these ideas seem to originate online on sites such as Tumblr, and have gained support on some uni/college campuses particularly in the US. In my view these kind of ideas are a new form of counter culture, as people who believe in them often use rhetoric attacking the ""system"" as ""white, Cis, male supremacist"" or the like. I believe these issues are largely imaginary or are exaggerating and misrepresenting other long accepted problems such as racism. 

Also more worryingly I think these kind of ideas hold very negative consequences. For example the ideas of ""cultural appropriation"", racial based ""privileges"" and a divide between ""whites"" and ""people of colour"" essentially reintroduces the ""separate but equal"" doctrine of Jim crow times and shits on the legacy of MLK and the civil rights movement. The idea of ""safe spaces"" and ""trigger warnings"" destroys free speech and debate and creates the dangerous notion that feelings are infallible and absolute, basically making adults into babies who can't deal with criticism.

I'll focus on one part, because I think it underscores a lot of things:

&gt; The idea of ""safe spaces"" and ""trigger warnings"" destroys free speech and debate and creates the dangerous notion that feelings are infallible and absolute, basically making adults into babies who can't deal with criticism.

There's a danger everyone has to assume (falsely) that their own conclusions are reached through reason, while those who disagree are overemotional.  This causes people to create a false binary where emotion necessarily leads to false conclusions, and so emotions become devalued.

This is a problem, because emotional distress is an enormously important thing.  Acting to minimize people's negative feelings is one of the primary functions of society.  Feelings are things to take very seriously and to respect.  Disagreeing with the proper way to address them is one thing, but it's unhelpful to assert, as you do here, that someone is prioritizing feelings and therefore that's bad.


&gt; EDIT: Wow my point of view was not popular

That's true, but be careful about the conclusions you draw from it.  Underdog narratives are EXTREMELY easy to fall into with social issues.  Be careful not to fall prey to the line of thinking that we all disagree, so your point of view is necessarily speaking truth to power.

This seems like a very odd view.  Why would society be responsible for the feelings of its members?  Why should emotions as such be taken seriously, much less very seriously?  

&gt; it's unhelpful to assert, as you do here, that someone is prioritizing feelings and therefore that's bad.

What's wrong with that?

PreacherJudge @ 2016-04-06 19:23:15 :

&gt; This seems like a very odd view. Why would society be responsible for the feelings of its members? Why should emotions as such be taken seriously, much less very seriously?

Because society is primarily about protecting and boosting the quality of its citizens' lives, and emotions are the most direct representation of (and in fact may well be equivalent to) their quality of life.

&gt; What's wrong with that?

Well, first, because it implies that some people AREN'T prioritizing emotions, but that's impossible.  Everyone is emotional all the time, and everyone's emotions influence the conclusions they draw about everything.  If you didn't have emotions, it's be impossible to prefer anything over anything.

And also, if you have any sort of utilitarian view of ethics, then positive emotions are inherently valuable as ends in and of themselves.

foot_kisser @ 2016-04-06 19:43:33 :

It's not only not impossible, many people (probably most) actually do this.  

&gt; Everyone is emotional all the time

Not true.  I'm not, for one, and I know I'm not alone in this.  

&gt; If you didn't have emotions, it's be impossible to prefer anything over anything.

If you lacked emotions entirely, yes, you'd have problems.  However, there are a lot of intermediate positions between being totally and irrationally emotional all the time, and being so utterly emotionless that you have no motivation to do anything at all.  Most people are somewhere in the middle.  

&gt; emotions are the most direct representation of (and in fact may well be equivalent to) their quality of life.

I think you're confusing 2 things here.  Emotional reactions to criticism and a general feeling of satisfaction with life (or lack thereof) are very different things.  

If I get into an argument online and somebody insults me, it's not likely to even ruin my day, and it certainly won't ruin my life.  

&gt; And also, if you have any sort of utilitarian view of ethics, then positive emotions are inherently valuable as ends in and of themselves.

I'm not sure if I have a utilitarian view of ethics or not.  I would say that positive emotions are a good thing, but that the truth is better and that the ability to take criticism and deal with it rationally is also better.

Perhaps we're running into a problem with the word ""emotional.""  I'm using it to mean ""influenced by emotion.""  Using that definition, everything everyone does is emotional, including logical thought.  The dividing line between ""emotion"" and ""logic"" doesn't really exist.

Here's one example: Have you ever been convinced by evidence?  That's an emotion.  Finding something convincing is a FEELING.


&gt; I think you're confusing 2 things here. Emotional reactions to criticism and a general feeling of satisfaction with life (or lack thereof) are very different things.  If I get into an argument online and somebody insults me, it's not likely to even ruin my day, and it certainly won't ruin my life.

You're treating a quantitative difference as a qualitative one, and I worry you're starting to move the goalposts.  If people criticize you to the point that it DOES ruin your life, then yeah, that's your quality of life right there; society should care about it.  It's a matter of degree, not kind.

Also, the only way your experience arguing online is relevant to how other people deal with other situations is if you are projecting yourself onto others, which is probably not justified.


&gt; I'm not sure if I have a utilitarian view of ethics or not. I would say that positive emotions are a good thing, but that the truth is better and that the ability to take criticism and deal with it rationally is also better.

Again, false dichotomy between ""truth"" and ""emotions.""  It's the truth that people feel emotions, but you steadfastly deny that that's important.  But it seems you have no reason for this other than the fact that you've defined the two in opposition to one another.  If someone says ""X hurts my feelings"" and you say ""Well, it shouldn't,"" then that's you denying the truth of the situation.

foot_kisser @ 2016-04-06 21:41:16 :

&gt; I'm using it to mean ""influenced by emotion."" Using that definition, everything everyone does is emotional, including logical thought.

That's a definition so broad it's useless.  If everything is emotion, then saying ""I'm emotional"" means nothing.  Any sane definition of emotion would exclude logical thought.  

&gt; Have you ever been convinced by evidence? That's an emotion. Finding something convincing is a FEELING.

Finding something convincing may be accompanied by a feeling, but the feeling isn't what being convinced is.  

&gt; I worry you're starting to move the goalposts.

I haven't moved any goalposts.  If you think I have, you should state where you think they started and where you think I moved them to.  

&gt; It's a matter of degree, not kind.

A sufficiently large difference of degree is a difference in kind.  The OP was arguing against arrangements that silence controversial opinions, so as to completely prevent even the tiniest emotional perturbance.  They're worried about tiny emotional disturbances, and you're saying they're justified because extremely large emotional perturbances could potentially ruin someone's life.  A billion dollars and one dollar are different enough in degree that they're different in kind, and the same thing applies to emotional disturbances.  

&gt; the only way your experience arguing online is relevant

It was an example of the general idea that not all emotional disturbances are the same size.  

&gt; If someone says ""X hurts my feelings"" and you say ""Well, it shouldn't,"" then that's you denying the truth of the situation.

No, I'd be making an assertion about the acceptability of X hurting their feelings.  

&gt; It's the truth that people feel emotions, but you steadfastly deny that that's important.

I don't believe I ever said that.  "	"foot_kisser @ 2016-04-06 22:20:44 :

&gt; Oh, okay, is that what you're arguing?

Not particularly.  I agree with the OP on that point, but I'm mostly taking issue with your opinions on emotions.  

&gt; No one really thinks that, so you can stop arguing against it.

There are people who think that.  If you don't think that and don't want to defend their views, that's fine.  

--------------------------------

PreacherJudge @ 2016-04-06 22:33:14 :

Oh, okay then, backing up:

&gt; That's a definition so broad it's useless. If everything is emotion, then saying ""I'm emotional"" means nothing. Any sane definition of emotion would exclude logical thought.

I didn't say everything was emotion, I said everything a person does or thinks is INFLUENCED by emotion, and that includes logical thought.  

Not only that, but feeling is PRIMARY: it literally happens faster than everything else, so it colors any subsequent thoughts in subtle ways (Zajonc, 1980).  

&gt; Finding something convincing may be accompanied by a feeling, but the feeling isn't what being convinced is.

How do you know the difference between finding something convincing and finding something unconvincing?  I challenge you to explain the difference in a way that does not involve emotion.

&gt; It was an example of the general idea that not all emotional disturbances are the same size.

You weren't using it that way.  You, I think, were trying to say that there's some kind of objective measure for what emotions are appropriate for what contexts, and then using your own experience as an example of someone who, presumably, has the appropriate emotions.  But even if that objective, emotional appropriateness existed (it doesn't), then your own experience would not be any more valid a measure for it than the experiences of these people calling for trigger warnings.

&gt; There are people who think that. If you don't think that and don't want to defend their views, that's fine.

I need specifics.  Who?  When?  Under what circumstances?  What consequences have resulted?

Bear in mind, I'm asking about examples of times that people want to *silence controversial opinions, so as to completely prevent even the tiniest emotional perturbance.*

foot_kisser @ 2016-04-07 01:30:30 :

&gt; Not only that, but feeling is PRIMARY: it literally happens faster than everything else, so it colors any subsequent thoughts in subtle ways (Zajonc, 1980).

Looking at that paper and some of the other top google hits for ""Zajonc, 1980"" it looks like a lot of subsequent papers didn't agree with him and a lot of the subsequent discussion was hindered by lack of precise definitions for 'affect' and 'cognition'.  (Also, 'affect' and 'cognition' would not necessarily match up with 'emotion' and 'logic'.)

But more importantly, even if this were all true and taken for granted, an emotion happening first does not mean that it will determine subsequent logical thoughts.  Logical thought remains the same, emotion or no emotion.  

&gt; How do you know the difference between finding something convincing and finding something unconvincing? I challenge you to explain the difference in a way that does not involve emotion.

Check that all of the premises of the argument are factually correct.  Check that the argument is logically valid.  If both of them are true, then the argument is convincing.  

I'm curious, how do you explain it in a way that does involve emotion in any essential way?  

&gt; You, I think, were trying to say that there's some kind of objective measure for what emotions are appropriate for what contexts

I wasn't trying to say that there was an objective measure of appropriate emotions, because of course there is.  I had no idea you'd deny it.  

Since you are denying it, tell me, is it appropriate to react to being raped by saying ""oh, well"" and ignoring it?  Is it appropriate to react to somebody politely disagreeing with you by flying into a screaming rage?  Or would it be more reasonable to flip those two around?  

&gt; your own experience would not be any more valid a measure for it

Experiences are not a valid measure for how appropriate an emotional reaction is, whether mine or anyone else's.

(Also, 'affect' and 'cognition' would not necessarily match up with 'emotion' and 'logic'.)

I'd love to have this debate with you, if you wanted to argue it (I am only 75% sold on Zajonc myself), but this probably isn't the place.  I'll just say that it (or the modern variations it inspired) is a pretty mainstream view agreed on by many experts, so give it that due, even if you don't buy it. 

&gt; But more importantly, even if this were all true and taken for granted, an emotion happening first does not mean that it will determine subsequent logical thoughts. Logical thought remains the same, emotion or no emotion.

I'd ask for proof of this, but it's inane.  There can't ever be an absence of affect in a conscious adult person (I'm just using affect as a more general term for emotion, including mood; let me know if you have a problem with it).  

I think you might be confused about what emotion is.  I don't blame you; I'm confused about what an emotion is, too.  The best definition I've encountered is ""a subjective reaction to self-relevant information.""  

If that's too general for you, just know that I'm including in my definition preferences (including values) and valenced assessments.  If you disagree, please explain why these don't count; just know that's what I'm proceeding with.

&gt; Check that all of the premises of the argument are factually correct. Check that the argument is logically valid. If both of them are true, then the argument is convincing.  

This isn't what I asked.  This is what you do to get information that tells you whether or not an argument is convincing, not how you know when you're done.  I also think it beggars belief that you do this every single time you've ever been convinced or not convinced by something.


&gt; I'm curious, how do you explain it in a way that does involve emotion in any essential way?

The capital of Brunei is Bunnytown.

Take a second.

Okay, were convinced by what I just said?  I presume not.  Was it because you knew it was incorrect, because you know off the top of your head what the capital of Brunei is?

Maybe you looked up the capital of Brunei; fine.  Did you wait until you knew the right answer to doubt what I said?  I think it's more likely you read what I wrote and thought some version of ""That doesn't sound right"" or ""That's just ridiculous.""  But you didn't know.  You weren't basing it on anything but a feeling.

You know you're convinced or unconvinced because you feel that distinctive ""convinced"" emotion, the same way you know something is interesting or angering.  That's what being convinced is.

This isn't to say that we're slaves to this emotion; we can always reassess (that is, to go back check argument premises, facts, etc).  But that's not acting without emotions, it's replacing one emotion with another.  

&gt; Since you are denying it, tell me, is it appropriate to react to being raped by saying ""oh, well"" and ignoring it? Is it appropriate to react to somebody politely disagreeing with you by flying into a screaming rage? Or would it be more reasonable to flip those two around?

Well... first of all, some people are raped and totally do react that way, and I hope you wouldn't tell them they're reacting to being raped incorrectly.

More generally, you're mixing up two different kinds of norms.  There is emotional appropriateness of the kind I think you mean, which frankly is an inane concept, because it's impossible to imagine the alternative.  Every emotion is ""appropriate"" in the sense that it was generated organically by the person feeling it as a reaction to the external situation and their internal traits.

But what you're talking about is BEHAVIORAL norms: i.e. what people will look at and think you're out of line.  If you're having a mild argument with someone and they're in a fit of screaming rage, the problem isn't the rage, it's the screaming.  If they're angry, but you can't tell, there's no problem.  Likewise, if they're NOT angry, but they're screaming at you, that's inappropriate.  

Even so, these norms are far from universal, people disagree all the time about what kind of emotionally laden behavior is appropriate or inappropriate.  

&gt; This link describes an event where the support of a particular presidential candidate resulted in a member of student government being asked to resign. You can't argue that the emotional disturbance caused by somebody disagreeing with you politically is anything other than tiny.

Being asked to resign is not being silenced in any way that I can understand.  At most, it's asking someone to silence themselves and them saying no (as far as I could tell, she's still a rep).

Second, the group that asked her to resign is her own campus political party.  The ""hurt feeling"" in this case is embarrassment that her views reflect on them, which I don't really think is what you're talking about.

&gt; Off the top of my head, there was an incident involving former professor Melissa Click, where she decided that the presence of a polite student journalist with a camera was so emotionally damaging that she called for ""muscle"" to help her physically kick him out. 

This is a better example, in the sense that I can at least connect this to trying to silence someone in a direct way.  Trying to grab a reporter's camera is a version of silencing.

Where this falls apart as an example, though, is that she's acting to 1. silence a controversial opinion (what opinion was the photographer trying to express?) and 2. To prevent the tiniest emotional perturbance (there is absolutely no evidence she's trying to protect anyone's emotions).

So no, neither of these examples works.

It was unfair because I didn’t put enough time into it then expected people to understand me perfectly?  Also I’ve felt my argument has changed to some extent and my post doesnt represent that very well at all, my view hasn’t changed very much but people 75% of the time seem to want to argue points I didnt raise that are possibly more relevant to the ‘point’ I guess? I know people are going to say “ Youve changed your entire view! ” and to some extent thats correct but only because people didnt really want to have an argument about the points I raised so I had to explain the same points in over 100 replies which really takes it out of me haha . So I will try a second time




So in posting this edit a new trend has made itself apparent to me and it goes something like this:

*""Do you not agree that it in day to day life it only matters what they think of themselves? as its better and far easier to just take their word for it?*

So my simple answer to that is, no, I do not disagree with that at all as it is obviously not incorrect. I think we are having different conversations as this is not about what I think is easier or what matters more in day to day life my argument is about the intrinsic state of how things are. On one of these threads we got into a debate about the matrix in reference to this and I found it help convey what Im trying to say so I will try to sum it up here. This person said something like this to me; ""Neo only knows the matrix so in his life that is all that matters and in transgendered peoples lives they think of themselves as a different gender and thats all that matters in life"" so whilst I enjoy reading comments like these I have to constantly tell them we are having a different debate, in my view that I posed on the post Im not taking into account how Neo or Transgendered people feel because it isnt relevant as how someone feels about this doesnt influence its intrinsic state of being and that is what Im trying to get at with this post **what is the truth of the matter regardless of feelings or the ease of life.** Unlike people like to say Im open to be wrong. I will state my argument in a nutshell here :

Saying there is a notion of a psychological gender is not correct, furthermore may be fundamentally unknowable

As such its not a good idea to base your view (especially when many take their own view as fact) on something so possibly *unknowable* like gender, on testimony of the people, regardless of how many people. Just as millions could tell me they think they know what happens in the center of a black hole I will not just take their word on it without something concrete, no matter their numbers. Someone had what I would argue was a meta-argument about this post asking why its relevant, I have two answers to that.

1. This is not r/ change my relevant view

and

2.Real decisions that affect things are being made running under this assumptions, an assumption I would say is currently impossible to get to. 

 
On with the show.









So I will first start off with this, Im not at all trying to impeach on anyones freedom, if you want me to call you a man, woman, cat or duck I couldnt care less but that doesn’t mean I agree you ‘are’ in fact a man, woman, cat or duck. It reminds me of the Abraham Lincoln quote “How many legs does a dog have if you call its tail a leg? Four because calling a tail a leg doesnt mean its a leg” I will sort of sum up an encounter I had with a good person today on this thread:  Someone was asking me why I couldn’t essentially take someones word on them feeling like the opposite sex and posed me this question; “if someone were to tell you they’re happy would not believe that person?” and among my reply I said “well maybe you shouldnt”  Someone didnt really understand why I said that and asked if I could clarify and explain so heres what I came up with:

So Ill lay out a hypothetical scenario based around your question:


My friend Campbell comes to me looking visibly happy, hes smiling and is generally carrying himself in a positive way. He says to me ""Im happy""


Im obviously going to 99.99% believe him but I know for what ever reason he could be being deceptive among other things as those things he just displayed could theoretically have been done by anyone happy or sad.


Now I will give you a hypothetical scenario based on my view on transgenderism:


My friend Campbell walks up to me and says ""Hey Frank I feel like you""


Now I don't believe him at all because... what even is it to feel like me? I cant identify intrinsic things that go along with feeling like Frank.


Then Campbell says to me ""No not anything specific I just feel like like I connect with all your traits rather than my own, on every level I feel like Frank and soon I will alter my appearance to look like frank""


That makes no sense to me? if you cant identify everything that entails being frank how do you expect me to believe you feel exactly like frank? because I dont even know what feeling like frank means! and I am Frank! 

First of all I’d like to say my name isnt actually frank so no one get exited they can use that fact in aid of finding and killing me haha and I would also like to point out I understand this person doesnt represent everyone. In my original post I used the word gender very very loosely as to be honest no one had ever completely fleshed out  everything that word entails to me in reference to this sort of thing, obviously I had some kind of an understanding but in reading the hundreds of peoples comments yesterday I believe to some extent I have a pretty good understanding now, well as good as I can. Ive had a lot of different definitions on what it means to not identify as your ‘sex defined?’ gender some people say its identifying with all the roles that accompany that sex, some people said “if you think youre male, that means you are regardless of what that means” but one stood out to me, a user called Chel_of_the_sea said this
   

When I say ""I identify as a woman"", what I mean is ""I would like:


•	...to have the body characteristics typically associated with women, to the greatest degree possible. These include a particular body shape, particular hormone regime, breasts, female genitalia and reproductive organs, etc.


•	...to be treated socially, professionally, romantically, sexually, and personally, as a woman""
But it's a lot shorter to just say ""I identify as X"" when the folks around you understand what that means.


And yeah I mean if youre a man and are just saying “I indentify as a woman” because its easier to explain the things you ***want*** then fine?  but humor me if you will: imagine if the title ‘chair’ was given to an individual who wants to eat a lot of avocado, I mean yeah Id have no problem calling you a chair but that doesnt at all mean you are anything like an actual four legged wooden chair. Maybe people will say “Thats all they want you idoit! You never disagreed in the first place!” but I mean thats not entirely true for a few reasons


1.	Even when I bring this up people will disagree with me about 80% of the time 


2.	I  think there should be a better way of classifying people like this then use what I would call a  biological term.  I cant think of another word used like this to describe someones want for something and just find it odd. I know words dont need to answer to me but it just seems like homonyms are confusing enough without one word meaning something extremley straight foward and the other something so impossibly complex and philosophical about the  same sort of thing


3.	Some people have argued that a women who identifies as a man is as much of a man as me on every single 
level


Regardless of if Im missing Chel_of_the_sea’s point, many people will say I have but for the record Chel_of_the_sea Im sorry if you feel I misrepresented you but regardless it served as a good thing  to help flesh out my point.

So I imagine by now people will want me to talk about the scientific reasoning so I will. I actually noticed a trend  with the science part of the opposing argument, at first an overwhelming amount of people linked me the same two articles which absolutely killed me haha and then said these article prove they can identify a transgender brain apart from another but at the bottom of these article they both said this wasn’t the case and they may never be able to but that wasnt really important to me as there are a large amount of scientists saying the opposite so Im not saying ones right but how can I pick one or the other? So at one point everyone started changing and raising the arguably better point “Transgender brains and bodies are more similar to there chosen gender and they exhibit different qualities such as more estrogen and what not.” and gave me examples where people display different sex chromosomes than xx and xy. So I actually enjoyed reading these comments and other comments where they brought up other cases where people were born with defects affecting their sex chromosomes are interesting and I mean without saying the maybe abhorrent “well they arent male or female” I dont really know what to say? Same with people born with both genitalia, I mean in the cases where its objectively extremely unclear what sex to classify someone as I dont know. I guess you could compare this to one of Einsteins most famous theory's breaking down at the center of a black hole, in my mind it doesn't necessarily mean my view is fundamentally incorrect rather I dont know as its maybe somewhat unknowable. As for the similarities in the brain and estrogen levels and what not I liked when people would bring these up because I was getting in a rut of people asking the same questions so subsequently I had to give the same answers, so it was nice to really have to think. In my mind that arguments sounds like this


 “if you were to put a rotor and life jackets on a car can you call it a boat?”


 I know I’m vastly over simplifying it but more estrogen seems to me like it would raise the odds of someone thinking theyre the female gender but that doesnt change their classification for me, as for the brain similarities I mean I would honestly love someone to show me a study showing otherwise but from what I’ve read the similarities are extremely minor and somewhat infrequent so it falls under the previous estrogen and boat thing. Maybe it makes someone more prone to think theyre the opposite sex but I dont think that fundamentally changes what I would classify them as.

As for my Guesses about the subconscious internal reasons why one would say they are transgendered, I actually wasn’t even  going to put that in there at all because I dont really care about it, as theyre just observations that dont really mean anything, I put that in there to preemptively combat comments asking about it. Some argued its necessary to my point and why could I not come up with a reason for older people, I mean is it ***actually*** important in this situation?  I think not, I thought of it as an ‘additive’ of sorts?  I think this is a different debate in it self.

As for the people asking if its legal for me to breed and stuff of that nature I mean theres nothing I can do about you people who leave those comments, they dont hurt my feelings or anything but its sort of dragging down everyone arguing on your side, I dont think they want to be associated with people who say stuff like this, this sort of goes with everyone leaving these comments that end with some sort of dig on my education and stuff like that, I mean who knows maybe they do like it but Im just saying in my experience it always annoys me when my argument gets dragged down by people saying things like that. Actually just a side note, that also goes for people saying hate speech about transgendered people as well, there are places to do that and its certainly not here.

You're making the impossible assumption that it is impossible to know your own gender identity in your argument here. You're demanding that trans people can't be the gender they identify as because, 'they can never have this **mystical property that I made up and am not defining** that is exclusive to cisgender people'.

You can't define this quality, and yet you reject the idea that gender identity is innate.

You're placing an impossible burden of proof on trans people here - how in the world are we supposed to tell you we have this quality that even you can't define? At what point would anything a trans person be able to say to you to convince you when you've already made up your mind, something which no amount of evidence has changed?

Here's a different angle that shows the impossibility of what you're asking - imagine you said to a gay person 'you can't experience attraction to your own sex.' Realistically, how would a gay person be able to tell you otherwise when you refuse to take their word for it? Maybe you don't understand what it's like to feel gay feelings - does that mean that it is impossible to assume that that person's feelings are in fact legitimate?

You still haven't accepted that gender identity is innate, despite the links in my last comment that showed that it is often demonstrably so. If you're not going to accept information when it is shown to you, how are you expecting anyone to change your opinion?

EDIT:

&gt; There is no 'Mental Gender'.

Most trans people spend a lot of their lives going through incredible discomfort as their assigned sex, and this is thoroughly alleviated through transitioning and becoming more like their preferred gender. This is 100%, indisputably true. How is this not clearly the signs that 'mental gender' as you put it does exist? You're doing an incredible amount of mental gymnastics to try and justify your own opinions, and you're ignoring an awful lot of evidence.

Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 08:17:21 :

Okay so I think youre somewhat not understanding what Im saying, Im not demanding trans people explain to me what a gender is to get a special 'pass' to be another sex. What I tried to make clear in my Frank hypothetical is there arent these 'mental genders' to switch between. In my head I have no gender? I have a complex consciousness, it seems silly to put that in some category as arbitrary as male female? and sorry but to continue this line of debate I will have to ask you to re send those links as I really dont want to scroll through like 400 comments

That's great for you, it's just not the case for me. Being male to me feels wrong to the extent that I feel physically uncomfortable every time I am reminded of that fact. What more do you want me to say if me outright saying that isn't going to convince you?

In all of my dreams, I have a fully female body. I dream just about every night. When I wake up, and I feel my broad shoulders, my lack of breasts, my genitalia, my facial hair, it feels absolutely, terribly wrong. These dreams were what made me recognise I was trans in the first place - before I even knew what being trans was, I would have these dreams, and I would wake up, and I would be crying without any idea why. This is how gender dysphoria feels for me on a daily basis.

Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 08:38:41 :

Well okay first off thats awful you have to go through that and I truely mean it but Im sorry this doesnt change anything for me, I will pose you a counter question:


What if I said this to you


In all of my dreams, I have a fully cow body. I dream just about every night. When I wake up, and I feel my lack of a cow body terribly wrong. These dreams were what made me recognise I was a cow in the first place - before I even knew what being a cow was, I would have these dreams, and I would wake up, and I would be crying without any idea why. This is how gender dysphoria feels for me on a daily basis.

Assuming this exact problem affected 20% of all people on earth, What would you call me?

pm_me_your_dresses @ 2016-04-20 08:48:27 :

I'm going to try and suppress my initial reaction of replying with 'What the hell is your problem?' and answer your question seriously.

In the Reimer case I previously linked you to, a biological male was given a botched circumcision and raised as a female from birth. He had experienced life as a woman since birth, and yet he still knew innately that he was not a woman, and was a man. Does this (and cases such as this) not prove that gender dysphoria is indeed a real, provable, tangible condition, and that it correlates with a sense of innate gender identity?

Comparing gender dysphoria as being similar to a delusional condition where someone believes they are a cow or a chair is absolutely a false equivalence. This is similar to saying that same sex attraction that gay people feel is the same as attraction to chairs - it is literally nonsensical.

Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 09:00:56 :

Well I apologize if it offended you so as for the Reimer case out of the billions of people on earth its certain this would at least once regardless of if Im right or wrong, you mentioned other cases and I would be happy to view them if you could link them.

On to your last paragraph here; no I dont think it is a false equivalent at all? you didnt really say why its a false equivalent so I cant really argue it but I will if you explain yourself. As for your last sentence that is utterly ridicules? There is a huge amount of people attracted to inanimate objects such as roller coasters and fences to name some I have seen, I think their sexual attraction is the same as mine?

pm_me_your_dresses @ 2016-04-20 09:26:18 :

Here's a couple:

*  [Lili Elbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Elbe) - thought to be intersex, she was assigned male at birth and later identified as female.
*  [Herculine Barbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculine_Barbin) - intersex person assigned female at birth, later identified as male.
*  [Maddie Blaustein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddie_Blaustein) - intersex person assigned male at birth, transitioned after many years to live as a woman.
*  [Mauro Cabral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_Cabral) - intersex person assigned female at birth, but now lives as a male.
*  [Karl M. Baer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_M._Baer) - intersex person assigned female at birth, who transitioned to live as a male.

There are many documented cases of this occurring (I've literally compiled this short list in 20 minutes from a brief glance at a few wikipedia pages) and they should hopefully be pretty clear in showing that people are sure of the mismatch of their perceived gender identity and their assigned gender at birth. We can extrapolate from this then that similar feelings caused in trans people can also be boiled down to legitimate feelings of discomfort from the same mismatch of gender identity and assigned gender.

--------------------------------

Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 09:57:58 :

Okay so this isnt me trying to dodge the question at all but I googled ""Define intersex"" to make sure I knew what it was and this comes up: ""the abnormal condition of being intermediate between male and female; hermaphroditism""

If Im missing something about that word I honestly would love you to correct me about it but like I said in my revised post I dont really have strong thoughts on what to classify someone born with both genitals? The interesting thing about your original post with that case of the botched circumcision is that he was able to identify his sex even when told otherwise. But like I said if the word intersex has more to it than that please tell me.  

--------------------------------

pm_me_your_dresses @ 2016-04-20 10:02:48 :

The main point I'm trying to bring across is that there are people who born not fitting 100% into the categories of 'male' or 'female', and yet it is still abundantly clear that they feel gender dysphoria similar to trans people when assigned a gender that does not 'match' their gender identity. This at least should be enough evidence - I've given you a number of examples - to show that 'mental gender' as you put it does indeed exist. Saying that these are just outliers would also be demonstrably false.

Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 10:14:08 :

Well I just think they aren't relevant at all? like I said that child with a botched circumcision was a perfect piece of evidence for your point I mean like I said the sample size was literally as low as it could get without being zero but it was still interesting but someone born with both genitalia being assigned a sex then switching isn't remarkable at all for two reasons. One: they were never 100% any gender in the first place so switching from one to the other is arbitrary, also you would expect that the proportion of the regular general public to be trans would be the similar for all groups of people, so if anything it would be crazy if there weren't these cases you've brought up. My second reason is that if a child is told they didn't have a gender at birth and the parents just had to pick one for them, that child is far more likely to think of gender as something more fluid than the regular person thereby increasing their chances of 'switching' "	"Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 10:28:04 :

pm_me_your_dresses @ 2016-04-20 10:38:13 :

Cheers for the downvote. Just in case you haven't noticed, I've been listing sources and explaining things clearly and you've resorted to saying things like gender dysphoria is like somebody calling themselves a cow or a chair. I understand you're not trying to be disrespectful, but it's getting very difficult to not get a little annoyed at this point.

&gt; when you give information that is evident of nothing

This is exactly what I'm talking about. The sources [listed in my original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4fdee1/cmv_you_are_the_gender_you_were_born_as_because/d284nrk) indicate - from peer reviewed studies and journals - that gender identity develops pre-natally. What I've been talking about - unlike you - isn't just my opinion, it's genuine, backed up science. I've come at this from a number of different angles at this point because I'm honestly just trying to help you understand. What's evident is that you have some sort of pre-conception that is making you automatically assume - against all evidence, by the way - that a trans person's thinking is 'wrong' and not 'legitimate' because you don't understand it.

Djangofett98 @ 2016-04-20 11:03:48 :

I down voted you because Im very annoyed because people seem to think they can say whatever they want to me and its okay because everyone else will have their back regardless. When I said tell me whats wrong with the comment I just left I wasnt asking about any random prior events I was asking about the ***last comment I left*** because you sent a comment that contained a point that I thought was clearly false and when I told you that you changed the subject and said I wasn't listening, well I have been listening, not just to you but to hundreds of people and I always apologize if I mess up and a point doesn't come off correctly or is just plainly wrong, I sent a comment out yesterday that read ""You know what you're right the point I made was unfair and wrong, sorry"" why am I not entitled to the same thing? I know you arent necessarily wrong Im just saying from my end it just seems like you're dodging giving me an ounce of respect. You are honestly the first person I have got annoyed about. I know you will say something like ""you dont want to change, you ignore the data!"" but youre not understanding that all this 'data' you're sending me isnt cut and dry there is much room for interpretation, just because you see it one one doesnt have any affect on how I should see it.

Cooled off a bit, sorry. I'll analyse the last comment you left.

&gt; Well I just think they aren't relevant at all? like I said that child with a botched circumcision was a perfect piece of evidence for your point I mean like I said the sample size was literally as low as it could get without being zero but it was still interesting but someone born with both genitalia being assigned a sex then switching isn't remarkable at all for two reasons.

My second reason is that if a child is told they didn't have a gender at birth and the parents just had to pick one for them, that child is far more likely to think of gender as something more fluid than the regular person thereby increasing their chances of 'switching'

This is generally missing the main point of what I was doing by listing those examples - I was showing that most humans have an innate sense of 'mental gender'.

&gt; One: they were never 100% any gender in the first place so switching from one to the other is arbitrary, also you would expect that the proportion of the regular general public to be trans would be the similar for all groups of people, so if anything it would be crazy if there weren't these cases you've brought up.

The thing is, it shows that gender is **anything but arbitrary**. These are examples of people who were raised as being one gender, but rejected that gender as not matching them despite the fact that it has no correlation to their chromosomes. Think about how important that is - these people have no concrete sex, experience sexual characteristics of both sexes, and yet still know that their assigned gender is wrong. There is still a mismatch between the gender they have been assigned and their perceived gender, and a mismatch that is apparent enough for many to have 'transitioned' sometimes more than a century ago.

&gt; My second reason is that if a child is told they didn't have a gender at birth and the parents just had to pick one for them, that child is far more likely to think of gender as something more fluid than the regular person thereby increasing their chances of 'switching'

I don't have any evidence for this being the case 100% of the time, but intersex people are usually not known to be intersex by doctors or parents from the outset - they are often assigned a sex (like most people) based on their immediate physical appearance as infants. This means that a lot of the time, intersex people, their families and their doctors are completely unaware of these issues for a lot of their developing years.

I ignored this response the first time round because I assumed that the argument I was making was not going to change your mind, so I'm sorry about that.

&gt; youre not understanding that all this 'data' you're sending me isnt cut and dry there is much room for interpretation

This is the kind of thing you say that makes me feel like you're misunderstanding a lot of the evidence people have linked - there is very little room for interpretation on a lot of this science. There is the backed up opinion of thousands of researchers and medical professionals, and then there are a vastly smaller number of people in the field claiming that that opinion is incorrect or inaccurate. In this regard, it puzzles me that your use of strange, obviously dissimilar comparisons (gender dysphoria is nowhere near the same as wanting to be a chair or a cow) seems to be an argument against the years of studies done on these issues.

It just seems to me like you're going out of your way to assume trans people are wrong in the first place based on the fact that there is no water-tight, concrete evidence that trans people's feelings are 'legitimate'. What you're asking for is impossible for me to give you evidence for - there unfortunately is no possible way for me to show you that I am a woman despite being assigned male at birth, as much as I wish there was. It would be fantastic if there were because it would change a lot of people's minds, but as of yet - if you're willing to change your mind - you have to just trust us when we say that our feelings are in fact grounded and genuine. I have a lot of respect for the fact that you've continued the conversation for this long, and I hope you respect the fact that I've been doing my best too.

On the Vi Hart video, the assumption that you were harbouring opinions for trans people for the reasons she stated may have been wrong, but I hoped that it would show you that a lot of people don't feel a solid sense of their gender, and that that's completely normal too. Using that information to dismiss other people's also equally valid sense of gender is perhaps a little misguided, and I hope that that's something that could potentially change your mind a bit.

This is a beautiful comment! and Im glad you said it, Im sorry for getting annoyed as well, it just seems as you think I have a predisposition to disagree so does everyone on this page, wheither thats justified or not I do not know. In my response to this I will sort of go over a little bit of my overall reasoning then go into things you've said. So first off I know what it seems like to someone who doesnt share my view, that its akin to people who do not believe in global warming but you must understand a couple things, first of which I want to talk about my 'interpretation of data' because Im asking a slightly different question then the data is set out to answer, take this statement (and just assume its true for the purposes of this analogy) **100% of scientists say that transgender brains have minute similarities to that of the sex they identify with!** Im not arguing that that isn't concrete data Im saying that what that data means isn't 100%, I dont think having similarities in the brain constitute a new name for something so complex, obviously that was an example but now I will go through your comment point by point. First I will group your first two points, I will not answer this question but rather answer it with a question I feel sums up what Im saying

What is more representative of your point:

Intersex children with no identifyable gender who grow up as a one gender only to change to the other




or




A normal person who has a gender written in genetics completely goes against that by changing gender later in life.


Maybe you disagree but the second one to me seems far more to your point. Okay onto your third point; If what you're sayings true then sorry scrap my second point as it probably doesnt apply to the majority, It would still be interesting to see if that was the case for the people you put forward. As for the fourth point I think I inadvertently answered it in my sort of overview at the start. As for the Vi Hart video I know its my fault but I dont really get what your saying, could you elaborate if you feel its important

You're missing my point again! XD What I'm saying is that these people don't *change* their gender at all - they already have it (whether they are aware of it or not). I'm saying that this information about intersex people is indicative that they have a sense of their 'correct' gender, and that it is so strong that from birth they will feel the same disconnect as trans people feel - gender dysphoria. When you say 'normal person who has a gender written in genetics', that is exactly what a lot of scientific studies show - a lot of development of gender (bear in mind, different from sex) is done prenatally, before birth has even happened.

&gt; As for the Vi Hart video I know its my fault but I dont really get what your saying, could you elaborate if you feel its important

In the video, Vi discusses that she never felt a strong sense of what her gender was, and that she assumed that everybody else must have similar feelings on their gender. I believe you feel the same way - and that's not a bad thing - but maybe it goes some distance to explaining why you are so skeptical of trans people in the first place? It's often difficult to empathise with people you can't relate to, so maybe your lack of a strong sense of clear gender is subconsciously making you assume that others must also not know. Obviously this is hard to say for sure, but I'd fairly confidently say that I have a much greater internal importance than you of what my gender is. Your gender seems to match your assigned sex, so it's going to be hard for me to convince you that my strong sense of gender is equally as valid as your relatively much weaker sense of gender. At the end of the day, if I don't convince you to change your mind, it's going to upset me a little because you seem so willing to talk about it yet so unwilling to change your position. This isn't a character attack or anything, I just think at this point there is possibly something that maybe you've subconsciously internalised about trans people or gender (or something similar) that is making is harder for you to accept that trans people's thoughts may not be 'wrong' as you put it.

Haha Well again I enjoyed this but I would say with your first point it was my fault you said this but that's not at all what I meant, when I say change I mean change what they call themselves. Even though I obviously don't agree that we all have an innate physiological gender if If I did and I was on your 'side' I would think it far more remarkable someone 'realizing' they were the other sex regardless of being labeled the opposite their whole life and even having the opposite genitalia, that to me is far more representative of your 'it is innate argument' than someone 'realizing' they weren't their birth given gender when they never had a concrete sex to begin with and their gender was picked at somewhat random (I know its not random but I hope you get what I mean) as for the Vi Video thing, you dont need to worry about me being offended by you saying my argument may be ill conceived of I may have a prejudice because believe it or not Im on your 'side' 99% of the time, that is to mean the left wing, do what makes you happy 'side'. I am of the mind set of if you want to do it and it wont make others feel bad always do it. Im by no sense of the word a bigot and dont have some deep seeded dislike for trans people, in fact I have only ever properly known one trans person who I thought was a fine human being, me thinking they're wrong didnt affect my view on them at all otherwise I would dislike everyone thats religious. Like I said to some extent in my post just because I dont believe what youre doing is bounded by fact Im never going to think down on it if you want to do it it, if you feel bad in your body every day those feelings are real and if you want to get a sex change because of them, do it.

I'm going to stop trying to convince you right now because honestly it looks like you've already made up your mind. I know in like 20 years or something you'll almost certainly have come round with the rest of everybody, just gotta wait for you to have that moment where it clicks properly, or you see a concept or idea that you hadn't thought of before and it makes you change your mind.

If you're not too annoyed by me giving up, any possibilities of a delta? I'm just worn out at this point, but I'd like to think I've at least shown enough different arguments and perspectives to warrant that. Cheers, if you want message me when you finally come round! :)

Well I must say Im not trying to have a dig at you but I find it quite condescending you assuming Ill come around to it, I guess you could say ""you could come around to stop believing your view"" about to anything eg. If a piece of information came out that was strong enough to convince me the world was not round that would make me 'come around' to the other point of view that it was flat but your certainty is what is odd to me and I would prefer you refer to this as an impasse but like I said Im not having a dig and it was lovely conversing and debating with you and as with the spherical nature of the earth maybe one day I will change my view haha but in the meantime I think your perspective has definitely earnt this  ∆ (PS Im not as sure about this view as I am the spherical nature of the earth)

The only thing that's wrong is that 50 years ago you could lynch people or otherwise physically harm them without consequences. I'm not advocating that we go killing racist people. I'm saying that if something is reasonable and important, the logical argument will slowly cause society to change. There is nothing wrong with not giving a platform to racists or shouting them down.

I'm not saying that this type of activity isn't a problem in itself, but rather it's not nearly as widespread as so many people make it seem.

I think similar types of activity has more or less, [always](http://time.com/4110570/1970-2015-campus-protest-politics/) happened(in modern history), but now, there's 20 million college students, and everyone has a near-perfect quality video camera in their pocket on them at all times that they can turn on within literally seconds - so there's a virtually non-ending supply of anecdotal evidence to 'prove' this problem.  If 100,000 college students across the country acted like this, it's still only about 1% of college students - and again, I don't think the number is even remotely close to that high.

And on a personal level, I just graduated from college last week from a liberal east coast school and this 'sjw' illiberalism on college campuses that everyone talks about, was virtually non-existant.  To the extent that it did, it didn't influence basically anyones lives.  it was a 15,000 person campus, and there was a 'safe space' in the library during finals week that people in theory could go to to get away from finals stress for a little bit.  I don't know anyone that went, and probably in total about 30 people went.

It has always happened in history that one group thought of themselves as morally superior. and its always been dangerous. it prohibits people from having discussions on topics because the one side can just disregard any argument the other brings up and automatically label them as immoral. this is pretty dangerous in a society that relies on people being able to discuss their differences and reason with each other. I guess here is how you know if sjw and political correctness is a problem - have you every thought of something but were too scared to voice your opinion in a public setting because you thought you could get in trouble for thinking it with your school or be threatened by your peers? if you have then its a problem, because its already limiting how you express yourself.

50 years ago it was socially unacceptable to express a pro-LGBT opinion, do you know why it's different today? Because people spoke out their unpopular opinions and challenged the narrative.

Your CMV statement says **any human interest** but then you go on to list examples that are simply for amusement, pleasure and entertainment.

Also, 'human' animals are just as much a part of the food chain as any other species. Just because we are at the top of that food chain doesn't mean we need to follow special rules. By your definition, it would also be immoral for *any* animal to kill *any other* animal unless it was absolutely necessary to its survival. Many animals (not all, but many) could survive without killing other animals but they do it anyway because it's the most expedient way to introduce nutrients needed for survival into their system. 

&gt;Humans have no dietary need for flesh, dairy, eggs or honey:

True, but including those things allows us to fulfill dietary needs more efficiently than if we went without them in the vast majority of cases.

--------------------------------

VeganTruth @ 2016-06-18 23:26:57 :

""By your definition, it would also be immoral for any animal to kill any other animal""

No:

Nonhuman predators are not capable of understanding or following human moral codes. We are. To claim that a being who can't understand a moral code breaking such a code justifies a human inflicting unnecessary suffering and death is like claiming that because an armless person failed to rescue a drowning swimmer, that justifies you drowning 100 more people.

Although human animals created a concept of morality, many humans commonly break the moral codes imposed by society. This is why we have human slavery, rape, torture, murder, and all the other atrocities that civilized humans abhor. Nonhuman animals, however, while they cannot understand the concept of a moral code, almost always follow our moral codes better than we do. They do not enslave us, create concentration camps, weapons of mass destruction, torture chambers, or pollute or otherwise destroy our habitats. Nor do they wage war on humans, or any of the other atrocities that humans are guilty of. They merely wish to be left alone to live and die on their own terms.

On the other side of the coin, humans enslave, rape, torture and murder nonhumans by the hundreds of billions each year, merely because we enjoy the taste of their dead bodies and secretions and the conveniences that it affords us. And we also are intentionally destroying every wild habitat that we can. We regularly treat nonhumans worse than we would treat the worst human criminals.

The idea that we should be able to do these things because say, a lion eats a zebra is ridiculous in the extreme. A male lion often will kill a rival male and their offspring before copulating, in public no less, with the mother. If a mother lioness gives birth to a severely ill or deformed baby, she will usually cannibalize them. When applied to human contexts, do we think these are morally justifiable ways to behave?

There is no such thing. Different cultures define morality differently. Some cultures practice cannibalism. Some Inuit tribes in the Arctic North place their elderly (who can no longer produce for the tribe) on ice flows and send them out to sea to die.

- Black people are committing a significantly higher amount of violent crime than all other races in America.  Fixing this will lead to less police brutality, and will make non-blacks more sympathetic to the unfair police brutality that blacks ~do~ experience.

First off, this is coming from the perspective of a straight black man (technically Black American/West Indian American) raised in a two-parent household who hasn't committed any form of crime or gotten in any trouble with the law, and who is in no way chauvinistic or homophobic (far as I know, anyway). Secondly, I wasn't raised in a stereotypically black household or area. If anything, I'm more West Indian in my cultural identity, and fairly culturally neutral otherwise. And third, I'm not a sociologist. But hey, I'll give this a shot. That said...

Yeah, no. I disagree with you, although I understand where you're coming from. However, what you're asking for is (at the very least) the diminishing of a cultural identity, while not actually acknowledging where the points you brought up are coming from. I realize that you acknowledge that those circumstances are not the fault of the Black American population, BUT it's also not actually something they can control, for the most part. With the exception of the chauvinism and homophobia, but I'll get to that in a bit here. So, first things first...

&gt; The fact that 72% of black families are living in a single parent household

...isn't a part of Black American culture. Or, more specifically, isn't a part of the cultural identity. First of all, [it's more like](http://www.actrochester.org/children-youth/family-support/single-parent-families/single-parent-families-by-race-ethnicity/charts) [66%, as of 2014](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/869,36,868,867,133/10,11,9,12,1,185,13/432,431). Second of all, the fact that the percentage is that high is a product of systemic racism (which I know you acknowledge) affecting areas with high populations of Black Americans. It's really not about the fact that they're Black Americans, it's about the environment in which they are raised. Poverty, lack of employment, all that. So you absolutely can't ask Black American populations to change that because...well, it's not exactly under their control. Yeah, you could say, ""well, why don't the black fathers just stay with the kids?"" Again, environment. Poverty and lack of employment (which contributes to poverty) leads both to raised crime rates (which lands many young black fathers in prison, away from their children, creating more single parent households), and to, well, scared kids who don't feel they have the ability to raise their child. And so, they leave. Irresponsible, yeah, but not a phenomenon exclusive to black people in the slightest. So, yeah, not a part of the cultural identity, and not really something that they can control.

&gt; Black people are committing a significantly higher amount of violent crime than all other races in America. Fixing this will lead to less police brutality, and will make non-blacks more sympathetic to the unfair police brutality that blacks ~do~ experience.

See the previous point as to why the crime rates are higher. Again, think from a sociological standpoint. And, yeah, that's not going to lead to less police brutality, like /u/zzMojaveExpress said. That's profiling, and it's something ingrained into the system. Think about the majority of police brutality on black people has happened in the past couple of years. It's gotten press because the vast majority of those people injured or (usually) killed are *innocent*. The police are profiling, not actually reacting to violent crimes. That's not on the Black American culture, it's on the police. There needs to be more of an emphasis put on reacting to actual crime, rather than to the fact that the suspected individuals are black. And, even if they ARE guilty of crime, the methods to control that crime are usually ENTIRELY unnecessary in the situation. Take Michael Brown's case. The policeman, Darren Wilson, actually had a reason to accuse Michael Brown (which was discovered later, so it may have still been profiling, but let's ignore that for know), as he was seen stealing. That REALLY didn't deserve the response that it got. Yeah, OK, Brown was guilty, which is why I personally never put as much stock into the ""innocent black man shot"" part of that whole thing. BUT, Wilson WAS a shitty, *shitty* cop. Yeah, that particular problem is on the police and authority figures, not Black American culture.

Also: explain [this](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/aclu-sues-police-force-release-documents-officers-order-profile). And [THIS](http://www.npr.org/2014/09/12/348010247/in-ferguson-mo-before-michael-brown-there-was-henry-davis). Those have NOTHING to do with Black American culture.

And lastly:
&gt; Black men need to stop being so chauvinistic and homophobic. I know black men who are ridiculed and even assaulted for being homosexual.

Yeah, this is definitely something that Black Americans should change. Actually, to be more accurate, this is something that EVERY SINGLE CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES (and the world, but we'll aim small for now) NEEDS TO CHANGE, AND IS IN NO WAY EXCLUSIVE TO BLACK AMERICANS. Like...yeah. You realize that this is a problem in the United States in general, right? This is not something to pin on Black American culture, man. Pin this one on American culture in general.

Look, I realize that your heart's in a good place, and that you're not trying to blame the victim...BUUUUUUUUUUT you are. At least, that's certainly how it appears. But no hard feelings from me, personally, on this. If I came off as a little harsh, I apologize. Didn't intend to.

**EDIT:** One more thing...
&gt; ...white racism has had a significant impact on the black population historically and **even today**.

Yeaaaaaaaaah...get rid of that ""even,"" because it's still happening today, and the ""even"" implies that it either rarely happens, or it's surprising that it happens. But it's still fairly common. And it's not surprising to Black Americans, because we've kind of grown up with that expectation. And, hell, I haven't experienced much in the way of racism personally, but my parents essentially ingrained that expectation into me. And it's always in the back of my head (especially as someone who goes to grad school in New Hampshire, where I am DEFINITELY a minority), but I've managed to be plenty happy anyway.

Also, it's not just that it's *had* an impact. It *has* one. Because, although institutionalized racism is a part of our history, it's also unfortunately a part of our present, whether you realize it or not. You say that the cause may by white racism historically...but it's STILL the cause today. And that's what needs to change.

Again, sorry if I was harsh, didn't mean to be. 

--------------------------------

synergistali @ 2016-08-14 09:02:11 :

I would say that the most important next step is for blacks to take control and be aware of their own circumstances. I know people (my parents for example) who came to the US with 7 dollars in their pocket, no family here, and 3 kids with them. All around the same time 9/11 happened. That was a hard time to be from the middle East and moving to the US. But they took their circumstances as they were and they got any job they could find (computer repair and convenient store) even though one is a physicist and the other a nutritionist. Now we are living very comfortably and don t worry day to day about poverty related issues. It's all because their attitude was completely different then blacks. They took control of the situation they were in. They didn't feel like they were owed something from the US govt (like many blacks do). 


Another point I would like to make is that blacks need to see what the bigger issues are in the united states. As in, blacks killing blacks far outnumber cops killing blacks. Statistically speaking. So why are we not focusing on this issue of blacks killing blacks? 


Last point I want to make is that blacks need to stop acting like everyone is out to get them. A student at my school said something like ""shouldn't be blacks live matter, should be all lives matter"" and she was basically condemned for exercising her speech rights and stating her opinions. She said nothing wrong at all. And she has to pay quite a bit of consequences since the black community was outraged at this non-issue. If we can't have a discussion about the issues with blacks without them getting extremely vulgar then how can we resolve anything. 


I agree with OP in that first blacks must change their attitudes (and possibly goals) before any change can be made. 

--------------------------------

otusasio451 @ 2016-08-14 16:59:04 :

There's only a certain point to which the Black American community can take control of circumstances. I agree that it should be done, but it CANNOT be just on them, sorry. At this scale tha it would need to be accomplished, that just isn't possible. I admire your family's progress given the circumstances that they encountered, but that's an individual case Not everyone in that situation has been so fortunate. And I agree that many black people feel that the government owes them (I'm definitely not one of them), and I disagree with that for the most part. There needs to be a healthy amount of autonomy in the community in order for there to be any change. BUT, it can't be accomplished alone at this scale. Not at this point.

Gang violence and such is an issue that the community's fully aware of. And I'm not really a part of that community, so I can't speak to how it's being addressed, assuming that it is. But, yeah, it hasn't disappeared, obviously. That doesn't mean that police brutality isn't still an issue that needs to be addressed. They just BOTH need to be addressed. Don't diminish the issue, because it exists. But, yes, there are still other issues within the community that need to be addressed.

And I'm not a part of the BLM movement, but I understand why the ""all lives matter"" thing is offensive to them. Of COURSE all lives matter, but that's not the point. The POINT of BLM is to bring attention to the issues currently facing the Black American community. By saying ""all lives matter,"" you draw attention away from the issue currently at hand. Nobody's denying that everybody matters, but denying that there's an issue specifically facing the black community is not helping. At all. And I'm not trying to be rude or ""vulgar"" about this. Just pointing this out.

I won't deny that the Black American community has to make changes. They do. However, they can't be solely responsible. Other changes have to be made as well.

--------------------------------

synergistali @ 2016-08-14 17:43:04 :

I agree with you that they cannot do everything themselves (I never said they should btw). What I'm saying is that without the black population (speaking generally) changing their attitude, we can't resolve this issue. Also, yes my family did very well for themselves but they are not special people and I don't believe in luck. Life is entirely what you make it. If you fail, you have to try again if it's something you really want. If the black community really wanted to get out of poverty, why are they not working for it? (Remember I am speaking from my experiences)

Why is it okay to make waves in an entire country over a problem which is small in comparison to black on black crime? I've talked with many blm supporters and when I ask this question I always get a similar response. ""we gotta focus on the real issues"". It's like they don't understand what is going on in the world. Which brings me to my point, education is the ultimate resolver. If you don't understand what's going on in the world or in your own community, then you will see no reason to change. 

So because something offensive is said, we get to punish them?! That's not right. I've been ridiculed my whole life for being a middle eastern. It's harder to be from there then to be black in this country from my experience. But I've never once felt that anyone should be punished for what they said. How can this even be justified, I would like to know? Actually this has gotten to a point where you can't even criticize a black person on anything or they will accuse you of being a racist and out to get all blacks. 

Yes other changes have to and will be made. However, I'm arguing that this needs to be the first step. Black students at Yale and Princeton are yelling and screaming at authorities there about changing names of schools and restricting students rights so that they may be more comfortable. First of all they are not intentionally making them uncomfortable. Second, they chose to attend those schools. And third, no one is responsible for making you comfortable after a certain age. College is a place for intellectual growth and friendship etc. If you can't be open minded and realize that these problems won't go away without black s cooperation then the problems can't be solved. 

--------------------------------

Fair enough. And a good portion of the Black American population already knows that (to counter the whole ""speaking generally"" thing). And I don't believe in luck for the most part, nor am I arguing that that's how your family was so successful. But there are many extenuating circumstances in each individual person's life that allow success. I have no idea what those were for your family, but they were there. That's not the case for everyone. And not all people can work for it. Extenuating circumstances exist, whatever they may be.

As I said, I'm not a BLM guy, but I understand what they're saying. I'm an advocate of education, and I'm also not blind enough to believe that this is theonly problem in the world that needs to be focused on. But even a small problem in the grand scheme of things is a problem. And I suppose it's a problem that the BLM movement feels could be easily fixed, so they mention it. And, for the record, no offense, but it's not a big deal for you. You're not black. I am, and even though I'm not connected with the Black American community, I am terrified of police brutality, because I AM black. Might not be as big an issue as gang violence in some communities, but it's an issue that affects ALL Black Americans. There are no gangs near me, far as I know. So that's never been high on my radar of concerns. But the police are everywhere, ubiquitous, which I'm not arguing against. But if I had to choose a bigger concern for me and my family between gang violence and police brutality, the latter wins by 1000%. Gang violence might be more prevalent when looking at the country as a whole, but it's still geographically limited.

I'm not going to argue the difficulties of being Middle Eastern vs. being black, mostly because I haven't been on the blunt end of straight-up racism, for the most part. And I sincerely aologize for what you must've gone through as a Middle Eastern person in this country. I'd never, NEVER, diminish that. It sucks, and is also a huge issue that this country needs to get ahold of. And, yeah, honestly, I'd argue that Islamophobia is a more severe issue than racism against black people right now. But this post is meant to be about the issues facing (andm yes, within) Black America, so I'm focusing on that. And those black people that cry racist when criticized? Yeah, that's stupid. Not gonna pretend that that's justified, because it's not. I agree that it's a stupid accusation. However, it's absolutely not the norm. And I believe in free speech, and I don't think that that girl should've been punished for what she said. Probably should've larified that. She should not have been punished. However, I understand where they're coming from. DOn't agree with their actions in the slightest, but I get what they're emphasizing.

I don't really think there needs to be a ""first step."" One change is NOT more important than the other. I may have thought slightly different when this whole fracas started, but I suppose that's what this subreddit's about. Not sure who to give a delta to, but no matter. And even if one actually is more important somehow, it doesn't matter. ALL changes need to be made, simultaneously if possible. As for the Yale and Princeton thing...yeah, I got nothin' on that. I actually hadn't heard about that until now, and...eh, I can't say I disagree with you there. I'm a huge advocate for education, but Yale and Princeton shouldn't have to change the names of buildings to suit any one community. Honestly, doing so is...well, kinda racist, in a way. But the fact that black students are demaning that...yeah, not a fan of that either, honestly.

I acknowledge that the black community needs to change things in order to be improved. However, there are still a lot of things (equal or greater in number) outside of the black community that need to change, too. Not denying either.

synergistali @ 2016-08-14 18:37:14 :

Good discussion!

I guess I kind of would like to get the ball rolling in a sense. We keep on talking about what the issues are but we don't seem to be doing anything about them. That's why I am advocating that the black community take the challenge on. Have you ever heard of this concept of generous orthodoxy. It basically means that you must be flexible in your traditions. This requires sacrifice, both on the part of whites and blacks. If blacks want the name of a building changed because it is named after Woodrow Wilson, an extremely racist and horrible person, they need to exercise generous orthodoxy. Instead of demanding, they should sacrifice something. They have to be wiling to give up going to that school. And they have to spread the word that other blacks shouldn't go there. Only then can change occur. Yes this is extremely hard but just think about what blacks went through during the civil rights movement. That could not have been easier than what's occurring now. 

So yea my point is that resolutions need to be kickstarted right now. And since it is blacks who want change, they are going to have to be the kickstarters. 

--------------------------------

otusasio451 @ 2016-08-14 18:46:54 :

I agree! 

And...yeah, I agree with what you're saying about sacrifice. That's the true purpose of a boycott, after all. Sacrifice for change. and all that. And I suppose that if the black community wants change, they need to take action to start that change, but the government still needs to be able to change considerably, alongside them. And...eh, hell with it. &amp;#8710;

Can't say that my overall opinions have been changed completely, but this conversation has made me think about this issue much more than I have, honestly. So, yeah. A delta it is.

--------------------------------

synergistali @ 2016-08-14 22:31:21 :

Idk if you know what's going on in Milwaukee right now but I would pretty much say, point proven. Blacks are beating white people just for being white. And some whites were protesting alongside. It's really a shame how horrible the black community is responding to everything.  They need to think with a level head and be calm. Instead they think violence can solve everything

...Huh. Yeah, OK. Never mind. That's stupid, didn't realize they were doing that. And, yeah, I wholeheartedly agree that the black community in Milwaukee (and I'm stressing that part) is handling this very badly. I'll be fair and say that that particular community hasn't had it good in the recent past, but...yeah, no, this isn't good.

And I figured that. Don't worry, I ain't cryin' ""racist."" This is a discussion about an important issue, and I'm not going to pretend that this reflects upon how you think of individual black people overall. And I understand what you're saying. Don't worry, we're good. :)"

Things like opposition to gay marriage (""defending traditional marriage"") are offshoots of these ideas.

The problem with that is that society (at least, for the past few hundred years) becomes less bigoted and more tolerant over time (abolition, women's suffrage, civil rights, gay marriage acceptance, etc). So how can an ideal of ""return to traditional values"" not be a bigoted idea, since values in the past were significantly more bigoted than values today?

This is not about fiscal or political conservatism, nor is it about any specific group or organization that supports/claims to support social conservatism.

What????? You gotta be kidding me. We live in a society that is less bigoted than before? This is the definition of bigot by wikipedia

&gt;The English noun bigot is a term of abuse aimed at a prejudiced or closed-minded person,

So you think that we live among people that are less ‘closed-minded’ than before? Are you new to reddit? Didn’t you look around you, we are the most closed minded society ever to exist in the u.s. We are unwilling to accept that other people have different views from us, and view the very fact that those people voice their opinions, an offence.

&gt;Bigot: a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. : a bigoted person; especially : a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)

The two particular examples it gives are racial and religious groups. Do you think society, as a whole (not just reddit, which represents a fraction of society), has become more or less racist in, say, the last 100 years?

Every single thing you list as a positive aspect of religion can be achieved without it.

Here's why religion is inherently bad: it encourages people to believe in things that are not there, and provides a convenient excuse for them to do anything they want to do.  You allude to some of those things, but fail to mention slavery, racial discrimination, the murder of doctors, the refusal to provide adequate (or in some cases, any) healthcare, drastic interference in education, etc.  

I'll grant that religion was probably once necessary for our development as a species, but we've outgrown it.  Some of us are just more reluctant to leave the nest and take responsibility for ourselves than others.

&gt; Aren't you making the assumption that without religion, those things would not have existed? 

No, I'm making the verifiably true statement that religion was, and in some cases still is, used as an excuse to do those things.

&gt;How would you know it would not have been much worse without religion?

I don't, nor did I attempt to make that argument.  Hence my statement that religion probably was once necessary.  

--------------------------------

mr_fallacy @ 2016-08-16 15:55:53 :

What I meant was, yes, you are correct that religion was and in some cases still used as an excuse to do those things; but in the absence of religion, how do you know those things would not have happened anyways or have been even worse?

For example, in an article by [Jeffrey Guhin](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2096315-a-rational-nation-ruled-by-science-would-be-a-terrible-idea/), he notes, 

&gt; So many times throughout history, humans have thought they were behaving in logical and rational ways, only to realise that such acts have yielded morally heinous policies that were only enacted because reasonable people were swayed by “evidence”.

Of particular note, he mentions slavery was ""scientifically justified"".

Similarly, in an Aeon [article](https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-original-laissez-faire-economists-loved-slavery), the author notes the economic justification and thought.

&gt; Their writings, which inspired the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776), aimed to convince the French monarchy to deregulate key businesses such as the sale of grain and trade with Asia. Only a few specialists read them today. Yet these pamphlets, letters and manuscripts clearly proclaim a powerful message: the birth of modern capitalism depended not only on the labour of enslaved people and the profits of the slave trade, but also on the example of slavery as a deregulated global enterprise….Morellet reasoned that the slave trade proved Africans were equal to Europeans. Self-interest motivated both groups to sell or purchase enslaved people…**And, in a disturbing paradox, the founding fathers of laissez-faire saw the slave trade as a showcase of liberty.**

In other words, one could hypothetically argue all these things would have happened even without religion and the consequences may have been even worse."	"mr_fallacy @ 2016-08-16 16:32:31 :

No need to get so angry; this is a CMV, I'm just trying to understand your position more.

&gt; I stated quite clearly in my initial reply that religion was likely once necessary and that it no longer is.

Fair enough - We're fairly secular these days as you pointed out. If then the world got worse from this point on (increase slavery, extreme racial tensions, extreme poverty, extreme drug dependency, etc.) and not as a result of religion, would you consider the possibility that religion may be required in such a hypothetical world? (Again, I know that is hypothetical - I'm just curious if in your mind you could ever envision a future state where increased religiosity was required).

&gt; Now stop arguing against the strawman you invented.

To be honest, I'm not sure what the exact definition of a strawman is, but I don't see how my questions were not justified. You said, ""Here's why religion is inherently bad: it encourages people to believe in things that are not there, and **provides a convenient excuse for them to do anything they want to do.**"" And I was just providing non-religious examples (slavery as a particular example) to show that you are correct, people will find convenient excuses to do whatever they wanted to do - so it follows that blaming these things on religion is not exactly useful (imo) since there were plenty of non-religious justifications around during those times anyways.

--------------------------------

fungoid_sorceror @ 2016-08-16 16:49:21 :

&gt; I'm not sure what the exact definition of a strawman is,

It's inventing an argument your opponent didn't make, then arguing against that instead of what they actually said.  In this case, your strawman is this:

&gt;Aren't you making the assumption that without religion, those things would not have existed? How would you know it would not have been much worse without religion?

All of your subsequent statements flow from this incorrect basis.  I never supposed that bad things would never happen in the absence of religion, I merely pointed out that religion historically has been cited as a primary justification for such things.

If we could completely eradicate religion, and subsequently document an increase in people being shithead towards one another, your argument would have merit.  However, we can't do that, and all available data suggests that the opposite would in fact be the case.

Basically, I never claimed that people wouldn't suck in the absence of religion, just that religion is frequently used by them to justify their suckage.



--------------------------------

mr_fallacy @ 2016-08-16 17:00:29 :

&gt; However, we can't do that, and all available data suggests that the opposite would in fact be the case.

Couldn't one make the argument we actually have had those in isolated cases (Russia, China, etc.). Similarly, aren't the cartels in Mexico some of the most brutal in history yet there is no religious motive; Duterte in the Philippines is against religion and we'll have to see how effective his policies are.

&gt; Basically, I never claimed that people wouldn't suck in the absence of religion, just that religion is frequently used by them to justify their suckage.

Yes, I absolutely agree with you. I guess my point is, the exact same could be said of science (reference to first link I posted) - yet no of us would say let us eradicate science, that would be absurd. If we isolate to the US only, and we can accept that both science &amp; religion have been used to justify immoral behavior, yet, they both grew into what we have today, then I don't see the strong justification for eradicating religion (as they can be both accused of the same crimes in the past). ""Religion"" today in the states is more or less just a charity organization and for many people (I'm assuming working professionals in major metropolitan cities), they can quiet easily live their entire lives without any contact with religion.

Chemical reactions proceed in entirely predictable ways; physical objects move and react to each other in entirely predictable ways; energy is transmitted and affects matter in entirely predictable ways.

The last and weakest hope for the existence of free will is the subatomic particle which behaves in ways we are currently unable to predict.  However, in the past we were unable to predict many things that we now can, and I believe the same will eventually be proved for even those things which currently puzzle us the most.  Unfortunately for those who believe in free will, there is no evidence at the moment that the behavior of those subatomic particles have any affect on the behavior of whole atoms or molecules, thus they likely have no effect on the brain.

You may feel you are in control of your actions, but even you can find a causal link for all of them.  For example, in order to prove me wrong, you decide to demonstrate a random act that has no reason or rhyme to it.  However, your doing so was prompted by exposure to this idea, which I was prompted to write here because I wasn't finding any topics I wanted to chime in on, which in turn was prompted by my exhaustion with arguing about feminism, etc, etc, ad infinitum.

Many people object to this idea because it annihilates current ideas about personal responsibility and justice.  However, a justice system that removes bad actors from society, or attempts to rehabilitate them, still works from a standpoint of harm prevention and general utilitarianism.  Do those bad actors *deserve* their punishment?  No, not by most people's operating definition of ""deserve"".  However, incapacitating them insofar as their ability to do harm still serves the public good.

--------------------------------

playludesc @ 2016-09-21 03:45:22 :

I will define free will as the ability to act freely of or in contradiction to the previous state of affairs and all applicable natural laws.

To me, it is almost impossible to envision.  It would imply a world without causality.  The existence of time almost necessitates causality from a three-dimensional being's perspective.

Free will is difficult to explain because the framework for a world without causality is incomprehensible to me and I suspect most humans.  Even in primitive cultures without much of a grasp of natural laws, these people will invent phenomonological explanations for what causes things.  Very few people think that effects without causes do or can exist, yet most people hold the contradicting view that free will exists.

--------------------------------

Amablue @ 2016-09-21 04:01:33 :

It's sounding very much like you can't define free will in a consistent way. I mean, if we had a word like Glorpy and I made the claim that the universe is not Glorpy, you couldn't tell me if I was correct or not without a coherent definition of the word, could you? When you say ""act freely"", what does that even mean? What are you free from? And ""in contradiction to the previous state of affairs and all applicable natural laws"" seems to contradict itself - you're saying that free will means that you can act in ways that you can't act. You've ruled it out by defining it out of existence. 

I don't think that's what people mean when they talk about free will in general. Being able to make choices doesn't require that you be able to break the laws of physics. If we are going to define it in a way that's useful and applicable to the reality we live in, we should do so in a way that lets us distinguish between things with free will and things without. I mean, that's what all adjectives do. We have the word red because somethings are blue. We have the word fast because some things are slow. These words distinguish things with certain properties from those without those properties. So if we have a word ""free will"" we should use a definition that actually distinguishes some things from others and doesn't collapse under it's own definition. If we're defining free will to mean ""an indescribable property that nothing has"" then that's not only a useless definition, it's not one I think anyone uses. And even if we did define it that way, we'd still need to come up with a word to describe the way a person is different from a rock, cognitively speaking. Free will I think fits the bill.

Because people are distinct from rocks. Sure, at our core we're both completely stochastic - but that just suggests that what makes us different is not whether we're predetermine or not. Rather, you have to realize that your free will only works because it follows rules. If it didn't, that would be random, and that's not free will either. It's a dice roll. 

Free will is more like the ability to make a selection from a set of possible choices by using your knowledge of past events and personal preferences to determine that selection. Every piece of that definition is based on things that are outside your control, but that doesn't make your choice any less your choice. That would be like saying the car factory didn't assemble a car just because all the machinery and raw materials came from outside the factory - it's still happening in the factory. This definition is much closer to what I think people mean when they talk about free will in general, and it's much more useful because it's something much more concrete that we can actually talk about, reason about, make observations about, and study. People talking about free will aren't thinking about physics defying magical selection, they're talking about the process that happens in your head when you take an action.

I actually don't disagree with you very much.  However, I hold that insofar as an ability to make true decisions, humans are not different from rocks.  It is my position that ""free will"" is a term that defines something that does not and cannot exist in a universe like ours that is determined by natural laws.  In your example, ""free will"" is very much like ""glorpy"":  it is an unuseful term that describes nothing that actually exists.

I like the analogy of a car factory for the brain, and I agree with you that most people believe that what goes on in your head during a decision indicates free will.  However, that weighing and considering that happens within your head is determined, and becuase of that, the choice that occurs is significantly cheapened.  It is so cheapened that I believe most individuals would consider it no more free than a rock is free as it falls down a mountainside in an apparently random but actually predictable manner.

Amablue @ 2016-09-21 04:47:44 :

&gt; true decisions

This sounds no-true-scotsman-y. What is a 'true' decision? I don't think this phrase can have an internally consistent definition (and is therefore not a useful or meaningful phrase).

&gt; However, I hold that insofar as an ability to make true decisions, humans are not different from rocks.

But we are different from rocks. If I place a rock on a hillside, it's going to roll down. It did not decide where to roll based on any preferences or prior knowledge. It just rolled. 

If I visit that same park, I can use my knowledge of that hillside to determine how to proceed. I can select a scenic path because I prefer it. 

*That* is the difference. You're reducing the entire question down to whether or not its predetermined, but that's not the axis that me and the rock are different on. It's like you're arguing that there's no difference between a car tire and a hula hoop because they're both round. Sure, they share that fundamental characteristic, but they're completely different in their construction, usage and purpose.

(While we're on the topic, I'm going to just point out that nothing is determined - that's why I used the word stochastic before. Quantum mechanics tells us that the universe is fundamentally random, not predetermined. I don't personally believe that has any impact on the question of free will, but I feel the distinction is important to make.)

&gt;  In your example, ""free will"" is very much like ""glorpy"": it is an unuseful term that describes nothing that actually exists.

I would disagree - unless we provide specific definitions for words in the context of a discussion (like academic text books or scientific papers often do), then words' meaning is determined by their usage. You haven't really given a coherent definition of free will, but that doesn't mean we can't look at how the word is being used and determine if there's merit to the concept. I didn't use glorpy in any sentences, but if I started describing certain things as glorpy, we could start to form a picture in our heads of what kinds of things are glorpy and what qualities that word represents. 

Think about the word 'art'. There's no one single definition of the word - many people use it to mean different things, but there's a family of qualities that sort of nebulously form a general concept of what people mean when they say art. But the fact that it's a little loosely defined doesn't mean art doesn't exist. There is certainly art in the world, we just have to agree on what qualities the word represents before we decide if something is art. 

So with free will, there's this body of ideas around what it means. I maintain that we are different from rocks in a number of meaningful ways. An XBox and [this lego contraption](https://vimeo.com/44202270) are different in a number of meaningful ways, even though they are both fundamentally Turing machines. They have important differences that impact how they act, what they can do and how they're made, and those distinctions are important and interesting, and we shouldn't just ignore them because they have one quality in common. 

"	"Amablue @ 2016-09-21 15:59:37 :

My argument is more that being bound by rules is a necessary prerequisite for free will. That is, free will and determination are not in contradiction with each other. The operations your brain undergoes while making decisions *is* the process of exercising your free will. It is the only definition that makes sense.

playludesc @ 2016-09-21 17:42:31 :

So what's your definition of free will that allows a determined brain to exercise it?

--------------------------------

Amablue @ 2016-09-21 17:45:31 :

&gt;&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism

&gt;They define free will as freedom to act according to one's motives without arbitrary hindrance from other individuals or institutions.



--------------------------------

playludesc @ 2016-09-21 18:51:52 :

But if those motives are determined, and it's impossible to act against your motives, where is the ""free"" part of free will?

I have to say I'm with Kant on this one (shudder), in that your position is ""word jugglery"".

Compatibilism is an anti-logic created to comfort, not help understand.  However, there is a reason this is the only definition that makes sense, and that's because it redefines free will as something that's not actually free.  It's consistent with your own motivations, but since those motivations are determined, nothing about the process is free.

""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.""

I would add one word to that quotation:
""Man can do *only* what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills."""

Stop arguing this point.	2	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]	"thevirtualme @ 2016-09-28 10:06:40 :

The problem is that the gender pay gap is not the specific problem that needs solving, but a measure of problems that need solving. 


The debate between the 'myth' or 'reality' of the gender pay gap can be boiled down to a matter of perspective. But the result, like you state in your post, when you aggregate all working men and women together shows a disparity in average overall pay and lifetime earnings.  


The disparity is the result of many factors. Women are overrepresented in lower paying work, and men are overrepresented in higher pay work. There is a problem here, that problem is access to and encouragement for education. In earlier years girls often outperform boys in academia, in latter years the situation changes - the problem is not the pay gap, the problem is that despite the evidence suggesting that girls have no difference (if not a minor advantage!) in academic ability compared to boys, there is less encouragement for them to pursue education in their teenage to young adult years. This encouragement comes from culture (family expectations, social expectations, religious expectations, romantic expectations etc.)


Women often take the burden of childcare over men. This means they lose key years in work, where they would develop, be promoted, maintain and grow important working relationships internally and externally (for example in industries relying on client service). Again, the problem is not the wage gap, the problem is that society considers women to be the natural parents. This problem affects women (for example the pay gap) and it affects men - especially in their difficulty winning custody or even basic access to children in the event of divorce/break-up - even when they are the more stable, mature and capable care-giver. 


In the same vein, women are overrepresented in nursing and teaching, lower paid jobs (which in my opinion is unfair considering the value and demanding nature of those professions) for the reason that society appropriates 'care-giving' as a quality possessed by women. There are many capable, care-giving men who seek these types of profession and are considered to be less naturally capable than women.


There is also the factor that men are more likely to be assertive and ask for payrise, whereas women are likely to be less assertive. The problem is not the pay gap, the problem is cultural attitudes towards men and women's confidence and the appropriateness of being confident. 


Then there is the outright discrimination of different pay for the same work - and this seems to be the hot-button issue that politicians are focusing on, when it is a very small factor compared to those outlined above. I would imagine the reason people focus on this issue is because it is the easiest to fix. Politicians can quickly score points for finding and condemning the villains who outright discriminate based on pay. 


You asked for a change my view on the pay gap being a myth. My argument is that the overall disparity in pay is not a myth, that is the overall figure. But the causes and solutions for this gap are misrepresented. It can't be solved by raising or lowering women and men's pay - that would be lazy, unfair, ineffective and impossible to implement. But the gap is *one* measure that we should look at when examining society's progress in achieving equality between men and women.  


EDIT: regarding the point on access to and encouragement of higher education, the more significant factor is how these degrees convert to access and progression in the job market. Apologies for misinformation on university enrolment: there are more women in higher education than men in the USA.

I'm glad to see some change acknowledged, however...

&gt; Women, statistically, dominate jobs that are less paying than male dominated fields that are high paying. They are overwhelmingly employed in jobs like schoolteacher or nurse, while men dominate engineering fields and other fields with huge pay gaps.
&gt; That is not to say some women aren't discriminated against sometimes. But it is clearly not a systematic issue anymore. When I make claims like ""men do"" or ""women do"" it is based on most, not all.

Not a systematic issue? You don't think that the fact that the pay for a particular job drops when women begin to dominate the field says something about systemic sexism?

Do female dominated jobs, even if they were dominated by men, *deserve* more money? I just think that the female dominated jobs get the money they deserve. I don't think a state sponsored teacher deserves 75k a year.

--------------------------------

geenja @ 2016-09-28 12:50:55 :

why? doctor and teacher are completely different jobs that have their own separate and unique values in society and both are important. in fact, teachers have a lot more influence on society because they teach things to kids that will shape them into the adult they will become. I'm sure you remember nearly all your teachers and that each one had a lasting impact on you, whether it be good or bad. what type of connection do you have with your doctors?

--------------------------------

JustAGuyCMV @ 2016-09-28 12:54:53 :

The connection I have with doctors is the ability to literally make me not die.

I don't think my 1st grade teacher teaching me to spell simple words is that big of a deal. 

I have never met someone who believed a teacher deserved as much as a doctor. Do you actually believe that or was that more of a rhetorical answer?

--------------------------------

geenja @ 2016-09-28 13:13:15 :

exactly. a doctor has literally no influence on you other than helping you not get sick and die. I'm not in any way advocating that doctors and teachers should make the same salary. doctors are paid more because they've had to invest a lot of time and money to get where they are.  they are under high amounts of stress almost constantly and you have to have to be pretty intelligent to even get to med school. now let's look to the teacher. sure what they're doing can be a lot easier than what a doctor does but they influence a far greater portion of society than a doctor. students interact with their teacher almost every day throughout the year. they color the material they teach with their own personal experiences and world views. and while you're not as influence by your first grade teacher, you would be a whole lot worse off not being able to read without them. what about a high school teacher teaching college level courses? what about your favorite teacher? you're least favorite teacher?  every single one of them will having a lasting impact on a student. 

edit: and as others have pointed out below, supply and demand of teachers to doctors is large factor in pay

--------------------------------

JustAGuyCMV @ 2016-09-28 13:30:03 :

&gt;a doctor has literally no influence on you other than helping you not get sick and die.

And for someone who believes that death is the end, that is literally the biggest hope I have. To not get sick and die, regardless of education level.

&gt;but they influence a far greater portion of society than a doctor. 

You can't influence dead people. Plus, doctors see thousands of patients a year while a schoolteacher may teach 200. 

&gt;what about a high school teacher teaching college level courses?

This whole argument is based on the idea that the occupations have the same benefit. They don't. Teaching is important to the furtherance of our species. However, being alive is more important to me. That is why I would pay a doctor more money than a teacher.  

--------------------------------

geenja @ 2016-09-28 13:40:30 :

literally said that they shouldn't make the same amount. plus most doctors will not see thousands of patients a year unless they work in specific specialties such as emergency medicine. some doctors operate a private practice and see the same patients all year. some doctors work directly with only a small number of patients, such as oncologists. however the most you probably know about a doctor is their name, if that. I'm not diminishing a doctors value at all (I'm premed myself). but you saying a teacher has lesser value than a doctor is ridiculous. your first figure of 75k a year, is not a lot of money in many places. now factor in if that teacher has dependents, that 75k is stretched more. do you honest think that teachers shouldn't make a comfortable wage? many teachers are now having to take second and summer jobs just to survive.

edit: a word

I must say, I'd love to see how you'd do that. I'm not even sure what numbers you'd be doing math on.

&gt;  We don't just have the idea of an apple we saw this morning sitting around waiting to be recalled in there.

Yeah, but we do have the idea of an apple.

&gt; Our memories are much lower fidelity than a computer's memory.

Which is exactly what you'd expect if memory was build by strengthening or weakening connections between neurons. This is evident from the Neural Networks I talked about before. They don't come to the right answer, but they come to a close enough answer (e.g. can identify standard images very well, but show it a leopard print sofa, and it will think it's a leopard).

&gt; For ideas, we can learn some things through the artifact of the mind, (brains, tools, etc.), but we also have access through living events.

I get the classification of tools, but I don't get why you classify a brain as an ""artifact of mind"". Isn't a brain more of an active account (at least while it's still in a head)?

&gt; There are lots of ways that sociological events affect physical outcomes.

But what in Trump's election was non-physical? Where did something non-physical affect something physical?

&gt; Ideas do affect inanimate objects through us, so I might challenge the question.

Ok, let me ask another question. In my model, ideas are electrical signals in your brain. What they ""do"" (for lack of a better word) is transmit from neuron to neuron. In your non-physical model, what do ideas ""do""? Do they exist when we aren't thinking of them? Do they float around in the ether, waiting to ping into a mind? I just don't understand what they are in your model.

&gt; Definite attributes aren't necessary for existence writ large, but they are necessary for determinism, materialism, and arguably your claim that parts determine attributes.

I can see determinism easily, but materialism? Only if you define materials as things with definite parts I guess.

&gt; If parts don't have definite attributes while wholes do have definite attributes

My point was that wholes don't have definite attributes either. For example, you know that wave particle duality stuff? Well, this is weird, but even something like a golf ball has a wavelength. It's just tiny compared to the actual ball.

&gt; Have you ever read about or heard of the problem of induction?

Interesting. Never thought about that. Though, one thing I think I should say. The Stanford place says induction is basically assuming that ""instances of which we have had no experience resemble those of which we have had experience"". This cannot be demonstrated or implied without begging the question. But you said that instances of which we've had no experience *do not* resemble those of which we have. Where are you getting this from? Is it not fallacious to assume the opposite just because I can't prove it?

&gt; If physical accounts can't touch i, then math can't be just a language for describing physical things.

If it comes up in AC engineering, how can physical accounts not touch i?

&gt; It is the colloquial definition of evolution, but not what we mean by natural selection.

Well, sure, but this is only a point of contention because scales aren't living organisms.

&gt; However, I didn't mean to imply that our theories undergo a survival of the fittest type scenario in typical cases.

But they kind of do. Isn't that what a hypothesis is? You find an explanation that is most fit for the observations of reality. Reject it if it fails, and accept it if it succeeds.

&gt; As far as definitions go, what would you call a definition, if definitions aren't models for the use of a term?

A definition relates a thing to a meaning, a model relates a thing to a thing (or multiple things, depending). A model would be like F=ma. It tells you how a force relates to an object. A definition would be like what a force is (a push or a pull), it doesn't relate two or more things.

Essentially, a model describes how the world works, and so can either be right or wrong. A definition describes how our language works, and so can't really be wrong.

&gt; I'm sure no definition I've heard answers all of this while remaining non-trivial. I don't think a non-physical definition would add to the problems or is the cause of them here.

I think you're right here, so I'll stop arguing on this point.

&gt; The brain does some modeling, but the brain isn't a model itself.

This is a silly thing to say. Everything is a model. It's a model of itself. I may have misspoke, but I didn't mean to suggest that the brain doing modeling means we can model the brain. I meant to say the brain does stuff, which means we can simulate it.

&gt; They seem to be interested in applying our best model of the brain to practice application in computer science.

Didn't they say that they wanted a model of the brain so you could test drugs on it? To sum up what I heard in the video they said that they wanted to have a full, working, model of the human brain, but to do so would require vast computing power we don't have. To achieve that, they'd use the research they're already doing on the brain for their overall goal to pioneer new computing technology that can do what they need it to.

&gt; They don't claim to have a perfect model of the brain or a complete model or even a functions model.

No, but that's their goal.

&gt; Just to make my objection more clear, I'm talking about computational complexity. Some problems are theoretically impossible to solve even with machine assistance.

Do you mean that this isn't impossible, but is complex? Because something being complex (takes a long time to return) and something being impossible (never returns) are very separate in computer science, and this seems oddly worded with that in mind."	1	0	stop arguing comment					"To review briefly, the Hard Problem of Consciousness is a hot topic within contemporary philosophy. According to it's advocates, the Hard Problem presents a major challenge to certain suppositions about the power of science to answer important questions about consciousness. According to it's detractors, the Hard Problem is a contrived non-problem conjured out of semantics and a poor understanding of the brain. Here, I will argue that the Hard problem is a legitimate challenge; Accounts that ignore it are doomed to fail.

I. A Brief Exposition.

Imagine you are laying on a green lawn one September afternoon. It is a windy but pleasant day, and you take advantage of the last of Indian summer, soaking up the long rays of the sun. If you can cut past my dime-store writing, you can surely place yourself in this scene. You feel the warmth of the Sun, the gentle push and pull of the breeze, the rough sod poking through the soft fibers of your t-shirt.

The Hard Problem centers around the qualitative features of scenes like this. On one hand, there are physical features that ground the quantitative facts about what's happening. Facts about astronomy ground facts about the changing seasons, facts about meteorology ground facts about the weather, facts about plant biology ground the difference between the plant fibers in the grass and the fibers in the cotton t-shirt, and so on. On the other hand, there seem to be distinctive properties that accompany the perception of these grounding fact. There is a way the sun feels to us, a way the breeze sounds, a way the texture of the grass feels compared to the texture of the shirt, etc.

In short, the Hard Problem of Consciousness is identifying the important features of ""What is it like to..."" questions: questions admitting qualitative answers. The ""Easy"" Problem of Consciousness is identifying the important features of ""When does/ How does..."" questions: questions admitting quantitative answers.
The Hard Problem poses a challenge for sciencistic and physicalist accounts of consciousness, since both insist on only appealing to the resources of scientific materialism. Given that the scientific method address questions from a quantitative perspective, it isn't clear that science directly answers qualitative questions about the subjective features of perception. Prima Facie, it seems like answering questions about when something occurs or how something occurs leaves questions about what something is like to experience open for further investigation.

II. A Brief Rebuttal

I'm not personally convinced that this line of thinking amounts to an iron-clad argument against physicalism. There are a lot of under-laying assumptions that can be challenged: the relationship between primary and secondary qualities, the issue of nominalism vs platonism, etc. However, in my experience, responses to the Hard Problem typically fall under two categories.

First, many people insist that indulging the Hard Problem amounts to begging the question against materialism. According to this response asking specifically about qualitative features gives the (misleading) impression that there are strictly mental features in the first place. However, physicalism is the position that all mental features are reducible to physical features. Therefore, the terms of the Hard Problem are biased. There is no burden to answer the Hard Problem, since the game is rigged.

Second, many people insist that they don't understand what people are talking about when people talk about qualitative features. According to this response, the physicalist literally doesn't understand what people are talking about with all of this ""What is it like.."" talk. Since these features are supposedly only accessible from a first-person perspective and there supposedly unable to be explained in quantitative terms, there is no way to 'let them in' on the secret.

I think both of these response are weak and the rest of this post will be dedicated to answering these challenges.

III. A Taxonomy

I propose that we consider questions concerning experience along two distinctions. I won't insist that these categories are mutually exclusive, but I believe these distinctions represent the opposition of two conceptual poles.

First, let's consider questions by contrasting public questions from private questions. Public questions are accessible from an unlimited number of new perspectives while private questions are accessible from a finite number of perspectives. At one extreme, this implies that some questions are relative to just one perspective, while at the other end some questions open to anyone.

Second, let's consider questions by contrasting questions about whether something exists with questions about what things would obtain given that something exists. Let's call the first kind of questions assertive, since answers to these questions assert the existence, (or non-existence), of something. Likewise, let's call the second kind speculative, since answers to these questions speculate what would happen if something existed.
With these distinctions, I think it is possible to phrase the Hard Problem in a way that doesn't beg the question and makes contents of qualitative features more apparent.

IV. The Argument

Rather than assuming that qualitative features admit a unique category of analysis, let's try to pin down how they fit into this scheme.

Are qualitative questions Public and Assertive? This seems unlikely to me. Just consider the case of optical illusions. Let's say I see a dress as white and gold while everyone else sees it properly as blue and black. When I discover that the dress is really blue and black, I may still see the dress as white and gold. Despite the fact that other people can correct me and there is an objective fact to the matter, I can maintain the perception of the illusion. Therefore, questions of qualitative experience don't seem directly related to this kind of question. Facts about the existence of something don't fix facts about the perception of existence.

Are qualitative questions Private and Speculative? This also seems unlike to me. While this doesn't run aground on the publicity issue, it seems like we don't need to speculate about the state of our own consciousness. We don't need to suppose what it would be like to feel hungry when we haven't eaten all day. We are intimately acquainted with our own hunger. While this category might admit questions about other minds, it seems to miss the mark in terms of questions about our own subjective experience.

Are qualitative questions Public and Speculative? Again, this doesn't look promising. It runs afoul of the two previous problems by being public and speculative. Furthermore, the most paradigmatic example of this kind of question would be the questions of mathematics, (given that math is about applying public rules in light of given axioms). The contrast between subjective experience and cold reason may be a trope, but I think reasonable people would reject the kind of rationalism that places the two in the same basket.

Are qualitative questions Private and Assertive? To me, this is our best bet. It doesn't suffer from the first two problems and seems reasonable enough. It certainly seems like my perceptions can only be experienced by me or things very much like me, (implying privacy) and that my perceptions are presented to us as opposed to being considered as possible things by us, (implying assertion).

Unfortunately, scientific materialism only deals in public questions. If a question can't be answered in terms of repeatable observations, then it isn't scientific. Therefore, science isn't in the business of answering Private Assertive questions. Furthermore, as stated above, deductive reasoning seems inappropriate for describing felt experience. This implies that a priori 'sciences', like math and logic, aren't in the business of answering Private Assertive questions either.

All together, this gets us the same result as the naive version of the Hard Problem without begging the question against physicalism. Furthermore, the categorization here provides more than just bare reference. Rather than just 'pointing' to these properties, I give a clear definition of what exactly is being referred to. The physicalist must either provide a sophisticated account of the relationship between these categories that explains away some of these problems, accept robust phenomenological properties, or take the eliminitivist position and reject consciousness all together.

Easy Problem: how does thinking work? (how cognition, classification, memory, problem solving etc exists)

Hard Problem: how does qualia work? (how does blue-ness exist)

Is the Hard Problem of ""Gravity"" a genuine obstacle to understanding of Spaceflight? Not really. Even though we don't really know what gravity is (like we don't know what blueness is) - it doesn't stop us from building spacecrafts and understanding what a spacecraft is and does, it doesn't stop us from understanding how to use it to our advantage, and increasing our understanding of how to move through it.

To understand the human experience, it is enough that you experience being one.

Not understanding *how* it exists is not a barrier to understanding what it is like *to* exist.

I agree that there isn't a Hard Problem of Gravity, since Gravity is a public phenomena. Unlike personal experience, Gravity is something that can be examined by an indefinitely large group of people, (it seems like it can be observed universally, in fact). There is no 'inside' to examine with Gravity; it simply is the external behavior exhibited by massive objects. Because Gravity is a public and assertive phenomena, it fits well under the umbrella of physical science.

&gt; To understand the human experience, it is enough that you experience being one.
Not understanding how it exists is not a barrier to understanding what it is like to exist.

I agree here too. Understanding exactly what is going on in a given experience in gory, rational detail wouldn't give us super-experience, or something like that. However, that doesn't imply that there is nothing to learn or that private, assertive questions can be easily assimilated into another category.

All personal experience is public phenomena because all humans have (almost) exactly the same brains and if you take that human through the same experience you had, that experience becomes public. Your issue is that you can't take someone off the street and have them experience every second of your life like you did so their experience is slightly different from yours. But the difference is so small that it's still public. 

Just like you are standing at a different point on Earth and thus each feel a different amount of gravity, we still know what gravity is and can talk about it. You don't need to know the EXACT gravitational force I'm feeling to know that I'm feeling the same thing as you are even though I'm not. You don't need to memorize every square inch of a gravity well map of Earth to talk about gravity with me.

I think you'll find it easier to think about the brain if you just picture it as a hugely complicated circuit composed of many other circuits. You and I share at least a few million exact replicas of circuits.

But the difference is so small that it's still public.

I'll grant that I could take another person through the exact circumstances of my life in order to have them 'share my experience'. Telling someone to 'walk a mile in another's shoe's' is good advice. However, no one can ever literally have experience my experiences besides me. Other's may share very similar experiences, but my token experiences can never be repeated.

To illustrate this idea, let's say that we are able to condition a set of twins in order to given them identical predispositions and set them in (functionally) identical rooms. While the twins might share appearantly identical experiences, the experiences aren't going to be self-same. Giiven experiences are either preseneted to Twin A or to Twin B; This implies to distinct things for the respective twins.

&gt; Just like you are standing at a different point on Earth and thus each feel a different amount of gravity, we still know what gravity is and can talk about it. You don't need to know the EXACT gravitational force I'm feeling to know that I'm feeling the same thing as you are even though I'm not. You don't need to memorize every square inch of a gravity well map of Earth to talk about gravity with me.

Totally! It is enough that we both recognize that our experiences share a common referent. I don't seem capable of directly referring to other people's experiences the same way that two people can refer one in the same external object. For starters, I don't always know what people are thinking. More importantly, I'm not a mind reader. When I do know what people are thinking, it is by inference or projection.

This is more or less the problem of other minds. Even if there is more to say about access to our own minds, the problem of other minds points to a publicity problem. Information about other minds at least seems private; This seems like a way to secure privacy without just asserting it.

&gt; I think you'll find it easier to think about the brain if you just picture it as a hugely complicated circuit composed of many other circuits. You and I share at least a few million exact replicas of circuits.

That may be a good way to talk about my brain, but I really want to know about my mind. The fact that my guitar is tuned to A# doesn't tell me everything about what song I'm playing

You said that one of the criticisms of the hard problem is that it begs the question against physicalism. Assuming the brain could not be simulated (or even that there was such a thing as a mind that is divorced from the physical brain) would be assuming physicalism was incorrect. Would it not?

Very good question! Philosophical treatments of consciousness usually do conceptually separate mind from brains. This doesn't imply a real distinction, though. It is totally acceptable to insist that this is a distinction in name only. The exact nature of the distinction is a huge sticking point.

Also, I think nearly every philosopher would accept the a perfect physical replica of the brain is possible. It might way beyond our current capacity, but it is doable in principle.

But they'd say differently about the mind I presume?

Also, it's a bit tangential to the discussion we just started, but I'd like to ask anyway. When you want to rephrase the Hard Problem so it doesn't ""beg the question"" against physicalism, I'm not entirely certain what that means. I understand begging the question is having the conclusion be one of the premises (more or less), but if you don't wish to ""beg the question"" against physicalism, does that mean that you want to phrase it in a way that assumes physicalism is true, or just that you want to phrase it in a way that doesn't assume physicalism is false?

I bring this up, because if not begging the question against phsyicalism meant phrasing the question in a way that assumes physicalism is true, then (assuming my understanding of physicalism is correct) that would necessitate that you must frame the Hard Problem in a way that does not distinguish between the mind and brain. Right?

I suppose, to phrase another, more concise way: Is there any way under physicalism that the mind could be separate from the brain?

I'm not sure really. I think that sounds like a reasonable inference, but I don't know what the consensus is on that. I'll do some research.

Definitely the second; I don't want to define mental or phenomenal properties in opposition to whatever physical things are. I agree with many critics of the Hard Problem when they say this line of reasoning is unproductive and misguided.

This is very insightful. I think it would be fair the characterize the problem this way. The heart of the issue is the relationship between our brains and our mental lives. If there is a one-to-one reduction between mental features and brain features, then physicalism is obviously true. This radical nominalism is naive and arguably demonstrably false given findings in neuro-science, though. If our mental lives are attachted to an entirely distinct substance from our bodies, then physicalism is obviously false. This is clearly an unaccpetable form of dualism that is impossible to justify in the face of our contemporary understanding of the brain, though.

Somewhere in the middle, there are positions that does justice to the complexity and confusion within our actual science without defaulting to antiquated assumptions. I would argue that none of these views are physicalist views.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-10-11 17:32:17 :

I'm not quite sure what you mean by that, could you explain it another way?

I also don't quite understand this, though I suppose I have trouble with this line because I don't understand what you mean by the previous line.

Coming back to what I said before, would our mental lives being at all distinct (not necessarily entirely) not also imply physicalism is obviously false? If our mental lives held any distinction from our bodies, then wouldn't that imply something non physical?

As a side note, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by physicalism, but I've so far assumed that it's something close to what I've heard called materialism. Materialism was explained to me as the idea that everything is made of materials, so if I'm right, then physicalism is the idea that all things are made up of physical phenomena (energy, matter, fields, or whatever, I'm not really a physicist). Is this understanding correct?

&gt;I also don't quite understand this, though I suppose I have trouble with this line because I don't understand what you mean by the previous line.

Let's compare the pigment of a dollar bill with the value of a dollar. Arguably, there is a physical arrangement within the dollar that exhaustively justifies claims like, ""There are green pigments in this thing"". Fact about the chemical composition and the way the dollar bill was assembled tells us everything there is to know about pigmentation.

In contrast, the physical make up of an individual bill tells us almost nothing about its value as a commodity or currency. To justify claims like, 'This dollar is worth X pesos', or 'The value of this dollar is controlled by the Fed', we need to appeal to explanations that appeal to 'dollar talk' or put forward an economic theory of value respectively.

This requires appealing to explanations beyond physical information about things, either explicitly or implicitly. Physicalists contest that mental features are more like the first case and can/will be explained fully in terms of objects and there physical properties. I would say that mental properties are best seen in light of the second case. Explanations involving phenomenal events either require their own domain of discourse or posit robust metaphysical theories about mental entites. 

&gt; Coming back to what I said before, would our mental lives being at all distinct (not necessarily entirely) not also imply physicalism is obviously false? If our mental lives held any distinction from our bodies, then wouldn't that imply something non physical?

This is a very difficult question to answer. I delayed my reply just to give it some serious thought. My intuitions tells me yes: a real distinction between the two implies non-physicalism. It is also possible that, while we explicitly talk about distinct mental events, all claims about mental events are false. I think this amounts to cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, but it is a logical option.

There are plenty of potential replies that would insist on a weaker distinction. The physicalist could insist that there is only a distinction in the way the talk about mental events and physical events, or only distinction that doesn't posit casual or objective properties. These are legitimate options that are backed up by hundreds of years of debate surrounding platonism and nominalism.

&gt; As a side note, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by physicalism, but I've so far assumed that it's something close to what I've heard called materialism. Materialism was explained to me as the idea that everything is made of materials, so if I'm right, then physicalism is the idea that all things are made up of physical phenomena (energy, matter, fields, or whatever, I'm not really a physicist). Is this understanding correct?

I would be careful about equating materialism and physicalism, but your explanation at the end is just about right. Including energy as a physical force in its own right I at odds with corpuscle-type materialism. Saying everything is a body and a wave function is different from saying everything is just a bunch of bodies.

Sure, but the physical make up of the brain will never tell you how it will react, simply because it's reaction depends on the circumstance. This circumstance is not contained in the physical make up of the brain, but instead in the surrounding world. Similarly, while the atoms and whatnot that make up the bill won't tell you about the value, the wider world will, and is exactly how we get things like how many pesos a dollar is worth: By measuring how much ""stuff"" people are willing to exchange for them. I'm not sure how this requires ""requires appealing to explanations beyond physical information about things""

But to get back to the main discussion at hand:

&gt; My intuitions tells me yes: a real distinction between the two implies non-physicalism.

If this is the case, I feel like I'd have to agree with what some other commenters have said. The Hard Problem seems to just be a question of whether or not physicalism is true. If physicalism *is* true, then there's no problem. There's no distinction between brain and mental features, and our experience is simply a series of reactions in our brains that we don't yet understand. If physicalism is false, then the Hard Problem exists, but from what you said it's ""a major challenge to certain suppositions about the power of science to answer important questions about consciousness"" To which I'd say, ""well, of course"". Science generally assumes physicalism, does it not? And if physicalism is ultimately false (the only scenario in which the Hard Problem actually exists), the Hard Problem isn't the actual problem, just a symptom of it.

A very astute point! I'm very partial to this view to boot. I agree that the mind is the product of the observer and what it observes. It isn't truly reducible to either. However, I think this only deepens the mystery. Leibniz said something like all monads contain the entire world. This view of a conscious moment strikes a similar chord: all perceptions contain the entire event they train on. Given a generous interpretation of event, this could contain an entire slice of space-time.

However, single events can entertain multiple perspective. I might be included in your perceptions of me, but my perceptions might not be your perceptions. Within a given event are countless autonomous perspectives. However, we clearly never synthesize all these perspectives, since we are incapable of assimilating the perceptions of others completely. Other minds remain distinct from our own even if our minds aren't localized to just our brains. This seems weird to me.

&gt; Similarly, while the atoms and whatnot that make up the bill won't tell you about the value, the wider world will, and is exactly how we get things like how many pesos a dollar is worth: By measuring how much ""stuff"" people are willing to exchange for them. I'm not sure how this requires ""requires appealing to explanations beyond physical information about things""

Let's test how much we can learn B just looking at extensional exchange:

1. If I was an ignorant tourist and was convinced that $20 equals 1 peso,that wouldn't imply that the value of the peso has gone up. I can be willing to exchange without knowing anything about actual value.

2. If I was being held at gunpoint and told to fork over all my cash, that doesn't imply that I can pay for my life or that dollars ate worth nothing in exchange. Coercive exchange is exchange, but not and indication of value.

3. If the world economists all over-estimate the value of the dollar, it is still possible to sensibly talk about the real value of the dollar. Therefore, unanimous expert consent isn't enough to fix value.

All together, these are examples of naive extensional theories failing to explain the whole picture. This isn't definitive, but it shows that some thought needs to be put into how exactly measurements are meant to relate to the truth. I would say we use autonomous, non-reducible concepts to make these kinds of calls. Therefore, the methodology we use for determining value is at least distinct from the methodology of physical science.

&gt; If this is the case, I feel like I'd have to agree with what some other commenters have said. The Hard Problem seems to just be a question of whether or not physicalism is true. If physicalism is true, then there's no problem. There's no distinction between brain and mental features, and our experience is simply a series of reactions in our brains that we don't yet understand. If physicalism is false, then the Hard Problem exists, but from what you said it's ""a major challenge to certain suppositions about the power of science to answer important questions about consciousness"" To which I'd say, ""well, of course"". Science generally assumes physicalism, does it not? And if physicalism is ultimately false (the only scenario in which the Hard Problem actually exists), the Hard Problem isn't the actual problem, just a symptom of it.

They say one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollen. Depending on which premises you find basic, any argument can be read as either a deduction of the conclusion from premises or a rejection of some premises in the face of a repugnant conclusion. I'll consider myself a 'winner' here, if I can get people to accept the framework either way.

In theory, there is nothing stopping the physicalist from running this argument backwards. If the physicalist insists on reading my argument backwards, then I would insist that they are eliminativists, however. If the privacy and assertiveness of phenomenal experience is an illusion, then there just aren't genuine experiences to be had.

If this is a justified move, then I think the Hard Problem is a genuine issue either way. If read as a proof against physicalism, it provides some prima facie reasons to question reducibility. If read as an argument for fictionalism, it seriously challenges the idea that our most vivid and intimate impressions are real events with causal effects on behavior. Both takes shake up common assumption about how ideas relate to brains.

awenonian @ 2016-10-22 23:53:55 :

Ok, to start, I would like to admit that I often find myself confused by the language in your replies, which I assume is because I'm not as well read on these concepts as you. So, I'll ask for clarification from time to time. First off: reducible. What do you mean by that, in layman's terms if possible? I think that it means something along the lines of this event or attribute could not be reduced to a chain of causes, no matter how long. Or stated another way, you could not predict such things even with all the (infinite) relevant information. I feel like this may be inaccurate.

&gt; Let's test how much we can learn B just looking at extensional exchange:

Well, you're entirely correct, but that's because we don't extrapolate (or interpolate?) the exchange from dollars to pesos on a single event, but instead on the aggregate of all economic events. It's like how we don't price a bottle of water based on how much a man who's been stuck in the desert for 3 days would pay for it, but instead by how much, on average, a consumer is willing to pay for it, taken from the millions of purchases of bottles of water that occur. None of this ""requires appealing to explanations beyond the physical information about things"", just to explanations beyond the physical information about the dollar itself, or single events in a vacuum, but instead the wider world that the dollar exists in. Given my understanding of reducible, I don't see how these concepts are non-reducible.

&gt; I would insist that they are eliminativists

This is another term I'm unfamiliar with. It seems, from context, to relate to your later statement about ""genuine experiences."" Though I'm not sure what that means either. What makes an experience ""genuine"" or not? If I claim that my experiences are simply a reaction to stimuli passing through the complex machine of my brain, is that claiming that my experiences are non ""genuine""? Is this at odds with physicalism? Is it not exactly what physicalism would assert is the case?

&gt; They say one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollen.

I can certainly see that. Though I think this is misunderstanding what I said. My claim was physicalism's truth eliminates the Hard Problem, and its falsity ends up making the Hard Problem unnecessary. As a proof against physicalism, if physicalism is false, it's unnecessary. Assuming phyisicalism's truth provides no contradictions with the Hard Problem, as qualia are just quantifiable events that have passed through our complex machine of a brain, nothing more. If physicalism is false, then qualia may not be simply quantifiable events passing through the brain, but using that to show that physicalism can't explain minds is begging the question.

I think I used the correct terms in this post, but I do believe I'm starting to get a little out of my depth.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-10-23 03:21:32 :

&gt; Ok, to start, I would like to admit that I often find myself confused by the language in your replies, which I assume is because I'm not as well read on these concepts as you. So, I'll ask for clarification from time to time.

No worries! I'm not deluded about my abilities; I'm not a great writer. Even without the jargon, I can be very obscure. I'll try to clarify as much as I can.

&gt;  First off: reducible. What do you mean by that, in layman's terms if possible? I think that it means something along the lines of this event or attribute could not be reduced to a chain of causes, no matter how long. Or stated another way, you could not predict such things even with all the (infinite) relevant information. I feel like this may be inaccurate.

You're not far off. Reducibility is meant to mark our real distinctions from distinctions in name only. The shape of a piece of pie, for example, is reducible to physical properties of the slice. The shape is just a factor of the force vectors exerted by the slice under a certain frame of observation. In this sense, there is no real distinction between the shape of the slice and the physical protperties that entail the shape. The shape of the slice is reducible to the physical piece of pie.

In contrast, I'd argue that certain state of affairs aren't explicable in terms of physical properties alone. The value questions involving the dollar, for example, seem to rely on more than the physical specifications of any particular dollar or the aggregate of dollars. There might be some broader state of affairs that involves all of the dollars and all of the events involving the exchange of dollars. However, there is a certain point of generality that strains credulity. If a state of affairs encompasses every conceivable thing, then it probably out-strips every meaningful definition of the physical.

&gt; Well, you're entirely correct, but that's because we don't extrapolate (or interpolate?) the exchange from dollars to pesos on a single event, but instead on the aggregate of all economic events. It's like how we don't price a bottle of water based on how much a man who's been stuck in the desert for 3 days would pay for it, but instead by how much, on average, a consumer is willing to pay for it, taken from the millions of purchases of bottles of water that occur. None of this ""requires appealing to explanations beyond the physical information about things"", just to explanations beyond the physical information about the dollar itself, or single events in a vacuum, but instead the wider world that the dollar exists in. Given my understanding of reducible, I don't see how these concepts are non-reducible.

Another way of looking at this might be under a pragmatic interpretation of reduction. If a given explanation requires just as much information, or effort, as checking every individual induction related to said explanation, then the given account is weak. If people working with a theory have opportunity to deduce several useful solutions from a single account, then the account is strong. If there is an alternative scheme that allows us to make accurate predictions with more general information, then that account holds more explanatory power.

I know this introduces a bunch of jargon, but I think it will help you see where I'm coming from. I'm interested in which account of mental phenomena has the most explanatory power. I think physical accounts of mental events fail to account for the generality of mental events across individuals, since the kind of 'future science' physicalists usually appeal to move from specific premises about momentum, charge, etc. to general accounts of mental events across individuals. If we accept mental attributes at face value, then we are able to make more general conclusions from a smaller pool of information.

&gt;&gt; I would insist that they are eliminativists

&gt;This is another term I'm unfamiliar with. It seems, from context, to relate to your later statement about ""genuine experiences."" Though I'm not sure what that means either.

If I claim that my experiences are simply a reaction to stimuli passing through the complex machine of my brain, is that claiming that my experiences are non ""genuine""? Is this at odds with physicalism? Is it not exactly what physicalism would assert is the case?

There are two kind of physicalist accounts. The first asserts that experiences as we know them are reducible to physical states of affairs. That's to say that the exact explanatory power we currently enjoy in everyday speech can be replicated in a physical theory. The second asserts that experience as we 'know' it is a fiction. Whatever is actually going on is totally alien to what people believe about mental activity. In this case, the explanatory power of a physical theory will excede any competing theories.

The second kind of theories are generally considered eliminitivist thoeries, since they eliminate mental explanations for our perceptions in favor of physical explanations. The first kind of theories are 'soft' physicalist theories that leave room for mental explanations of events, but insists that these explanations are equivalent to physical explanations in terms of explanatory power.

I'm insisting that the Hard problem makes the second kind of theory impossible. If I am right about domain exclusivity, then no physical theory has the exact same explanatory power as a mental theories since physical theories offer a different mode of explanations from mental theories. If this is right, then either mental theories are best for explaning mental events or physical events do a better job of explaining mental events. This implies that either non-physicalist theories are true or eliminitive theories are true.

&gt; ...I think this is misunderstanding what I said. My claim was physicalism's truth eliminates the Hard Problem, and its falsity ends up making the Hard Problem unnecessary...

I would say that the Hard problems makes only certain kinds of physicalism impossible: namely, non-reductive or soft physicalism. Elimitivist views, which posits that we don't actual experience to any qualitative events, are still game under the Hard Problem. However, given the extreme, counter-intutive implications of this view, I think non-physicalism is more likely than eliminitivism.

&gt; I think I used the correct terms in this post, but I do believe I'm starting to get a little out of my depth.

Welcome to the Club! You've been very helpful. Trust me; Even if you are confused, you are in good company.

&gt; If there is an alternative scheme that allows us to make accurate predictions with more general information, then that account holds more explanatory power

Hm. I think I understand, but I don't know how accurate this is. For example, certainly not worrying about the underlying explanations about how the brain works and explaining it as ""inputs in, stuff happens, outputs out, we'll work on relating inputs to outputs, and not worry about what 'stuff' actually happens"" may give you good explanatory power, but won't necessarily give you *true* explanatory power.

Take for example something simple, like projectile motion. If, given an initial velocity, and acceleration due to gravity (assuming a vacuum, etc. just for simplicity), you can plug things into a simple equation (x = vt + .5*at^2) and get a pretty good answer as to where the ball would fall. Except this is only ""pretty good."" For one, acceleration due to gravity would be put at 9.81 m/s^2, but really, it's a much more precise value. And it's not constant over the surface of the earth due to non uniform density. You won't really get the ""right"" answer unless you model every particles interaction with every other particle, which, while being a pretty exhaustive approach, that's not quite necessary for any actual application, is truly the only way to get the ""right"" answer.

Similarly, approaching the brain as a series of mental activities, as we do now by talking about things like ""the speech center of the brain"" allows for good approximations (well, not really, our understanding of the brain is basic at best, but you probably get what I'm saying), and so may well have good explanatory power. However, if we want *true* explanatory power, to not just get a good approximation, but instead the ""right"" answer, we'd need to exhaustively model everything in the brain. I believe a physicalist would insist that to get this right answer, we could model the brain as a series of physical interactions between atoms and molecules and whatnot. I don't believe a physicalist would say that this is the best way to predict how a given individual will act in a given situation, though.

Ultimately, I think you could easily also have a definition of explanatory power that prizes accuracy, instead of prizing minimal input parameters. You may say ""well if I have to model every atom's interaction with every other atom, how useful is the explanation?"" I'd argue that it's still useful, because it tells you how to model the interactions. Do you divide or multiply by the radius? Is the electric charge squared or doubled? etc.

&gt; In this case, the explanatory power of a physical theory will excede any competing theories.

Well, no, it won't ever do that, at least not under your definition of explanatory power, because the brain is very complex. Just like how using the abstract concept of gravity as ""a value which is 9.81 m/s^2 on Earth"" will give better explanatory power under your definition, but won't give better explanatory power under a definition that prizes accuracy above ease of use.

&gt; Elimitivist views, which posits that we don't actual experience to any qualitative events,

I feel like these 2 views (soft physicalism and eliminitavism) are not so easily divorced. If anything, a soft physicalist is just a non-committed eliminitavist (or some form of vice versa). At least, as far as I can tell. Saying that we don't actually experience qualitative events seems silly, because we clearly do*. Instead, I would imagine the eliminitavist is insisting that our experience of qualitative events ends up being explained by physical, quantitative events. This is a conclusion you can derive from a soft physicalist's premise that there are physical explanations that could model the mental explanations. If there are physical explanations, then physical events are actually what's happening. The strength, and ease of use of predictions made with either the physical or mental explanations is irrelevant as to the actual events themselves.

*we clearly do, as in there are events which we call ""experiencing qualitative events"". The explanation for how these experiences happen is what the eliminitavist is getting at, not whether they happen at all.

&gt; However, given the extreme, counter-intutive implications of this view, I think non-physicalism is more likely than eliminitivism.

I don't know what extreme, counter-intuitive implications eliminitavism has. It seems reasonable enough to me. Though this may be off topic.

Whether we are in a position to check our models against an accurate picture of things is the entire problem in the first place. I'm no skeptic; I think everyday people know plenty of trivial things. However, the fact that we are talking about using science to explore this issue in the first place tells us that we currently don't have an adequately accurate picture on hand. If we did, there would be no reason to explore the issue scientifically in the first place.

We use science to move from less accurates pictures to more accurate pictures. It seems strange to me to use accuracy a metric for science, since the only way to verify accuracy is through more science! This circularity may even be less odious in cases where different fields of science are verifying and supporting each other, but it seems like a major problem if we are using our current working models to judge the accuracy of those models.

There may be other metrics besides pragmatic use, but you seem to understand where I'm coming from. The only problem is that you think I'm wildly inaccurate. Progress!(?)

&gt;  I think I understand, but I don't know how accurate this is. For example, certainly not worrying about the underlying explanations about how the brain works and explaining it as ""inputs in, stuff happens, outputs out, we'll work on relating inputs to outputs, and not worry about what 'stuff' actually happens"" may give you good explanatory power, but won't necessarily give you true explanatory power...

I'd argue that it's still useful, because it tells you how to model the interactions. Do you divide or multiply by the radius? Is the electric charge squared or doubled? etc.

Building off of my previous reply, I think there are problems with using accuracy as a metric in itself. We ultimately want accurate pictures, of course, but we can't test for accuracy directly. We infer accuracy based on other metrics, things we have more direct access to. I also have two auxillary points in response to this reply:

1. I will concede that if an account leaves things out, then we are just 'black boxing'. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing in all cases. If we are interested a course-grained theory, then some micro-interactions can be faithfully averaged out as their impact on outcomes 'goes to zero'. Given that minds su

2. I think the history of science shows very few examples of complete information coming before mathematical models. If this were an undergraduate lab an acceleration under gravity, it might be a good idea to have the students plot every point along a trajectory in order to learn what inverse square motion looks like. Historically though, advancements in mathematical analysis after lead the data by the nose. I can't think of an example from the history of science that matches the second part of your reply.

&gt; I feel like these 2 views (soft physicalism and eliminitavism) are not so easily divorced. If anything, a soft physicalist is just a non-committed eliminitavist (or some form of vice versa). At least, as far as I can tell. Saying that we don't actually experience qualitative events seems silly, because we clearly do... (we clearly do, as in there are events which we call ""experiencing qualitative events"".)

This bracketing is the problem. Eliminitivsts really do believe there are no such things as experiences, as in the things we identify as our personal experiences never happen. They would say that the language we use to our inner experiences don't refer to anything.

&gt; Instead, I would imagine the eliminitavist is insisting that our experience of qualitative events ends up being explained by physical, quantitative events. This is a conclusion you can derive from a soft physicalist's premise that there are physical explanations that could model the mental explanations. If there are physical explanations, then physical events are actually what's happening...

This is a pretty accurate interpretation of a soft physicallist view. It might be open to charges of epiphenomenalism, since there is no mental causation. On these grounds, many people would say that mental entities should be eliminated per Occam's Razor. In this sense, soft physicalists are often challenged by or forced into eliminative positions. However, there is a logical distinction.

awenonian @ 2016-10-25 19:00:32 :

&gt; but it seems like a major problem if we are using our current working models to judge the accuracy of those models.

But we aren't. We use observation to verify the accuracy of our models. Some of those observations may be done using tools developed based on earlier models, but those models were in turn built on observations, all the way back to our base assumptions. It's less a circle, and more a tree.

&gt;Given that minds su

I'm not sure what you meant to say here.

&gt; I think the history of science shows very few examples of complete information coming before mathematical models.

Sure, not complete information, simply because we still don't have complete information (why is gravity even a thing in the first place?). But we didn't arbitrarily decide the models, we measured them with observation. We found that the pull of gravity decreased proportional to the inverse square of the distance, and increased proportional to the mass of the object. We did meticulous calculations (and I think still do) to determine that Earth's acceleration due to gravity was 9.81... m/s^2, along with every other constant we use in science.

&gt; as in the things we identify as our personal experiences never happen

As in our brains don't actually process information? Because that's what I'd call personal experiences. The processing of inputs in our minds (generally referred to as ""thinking"", or similar terms) are the events I was referring to when I said ""events which we call 'experiencing qualitative events'"". If eliminitavists somehow believe that our brains do not actually process information, then I can't defend it.

&gt; charges of epiphenomenalism

I'll admit, I haven't a clue what that word means.

&gt; However, there is a logical distinction.

I'm having trouble determining what that logical distinction is though. If a soft physicalist believes that mental phenomena can be explained through physical phenomena, how is that different from an eliminitavist's belief that mental phenomena are no more than a name we give to a certain set of physical phenomena, and are not a distinct entity in any way?

You don't get observation for free. Even if direct observation has special status, we still interpret observations in light of their significance within our wider understanding of the world. All observation is conditioned by theory.

&gt;I'm not sure what you meant to say here.

Oops! I meant to delete that. It was part of a longer sentence that I though I deleted.

And I said as much. I agreed it was a collaborative process: A push and pull between pure theory and pure observation. It has never been a matter of complete information dictating best theory. This is the picture that physicalism paints for the end of scientific inquiry into mind though, which I find strange.

&gt; As in our brains don't actually process information? Because that's what I'd call personal experiences. The processing of inputs in our minds (generally referred to as ""thinking"", or similar terms) are the events I was referring to when I said ""events which we call 'experiencing qualitative events'"".

When you wake up in the morning to the smell of bacon, do you think 'Animal Fat;6 sensors responsive- composition June 2, Sept. 4, Sept. 26...'? Or, does it seem like someone is cooking bacon?

&gt; I'll admit, I haven't a clue what that word means.

Epiphenomenalism is the belief that ideas have no causal relation to anything besides their originating physical causes. For example, when I burn my hand, the pain comes from the firing of neurons in response to temperature and cell damage. This idea that, I am in pain, doesn't cause any subsequent ideas though or account for physical behavior that follows.

&gt; I'm having trouble determining what that logical distinction is though. If a soft physicalist believes that mental phenomena can be explained through physical phenomena, how is that different from an eliminitavist's belief that mental phenomena are no more than a name we give to a certain set of physical phenomena, and are not a distinct entity in any way?

Again, you're right about what soft physicalism is. However, eliminativists think mental things are like unicorns. They don't name or label anything. They don't match up to anything real, even clusters of physical events loosely related within a body.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-10-25 22:48:17 :

&gt; All observation is conditioned by theory.

Yes, but science does it's darnedest to minimize this impact. Through things like repeatable experiments, and peer review, we try to make sure that what we are observing is what's happening, and that we aren't succumbing to confounding factors like confirmation bias (which is, I assume, what you meant when you said ""observation is conditioned by theory""). Except within the realm of theoretical sciences (where we aren't testing mostly because we can't), we only base our assumptions on wider understanding if that wider understanding has a good basis, that is, it's held up to peer review.

&gt; It has never been a matter of complete information dictating best theory.

Maybe I misunderstand what you mean by complete information. We do try to get and use as much information as we can. Sure, it's not ""complete"" because our brains are finite, and so can only hold so much information, and our lifespans are finite, so we can only gather so much information. But by keeping a willingness to drop theories if we find evidence to the contrary, we can maintain an understanding that is as close to the best theory we'd get from complete information as is humanly (and societaly, in the sense of ""group of humans""-ly) possible.

&gt;  This is the picture that physicalism paints for the end of scientific inquiry into mind though

Because this is the ideal for science. It's what we strive to reach. Sure, it's an inattainable goal, without omniscience (which we can't have, with our finite minds and lifespans), but it is the goal. We will never reach the ""end of scientific inquiry"" into anything, but it's what we're working towards.

&gt;do you think 'Animal Fat;6 sensors responsive- composition June 2, Sept. 4, Sept. 26...'? Or, does it seem like someone is cooking bacon?

You're right, I don't think that. But the fact that I don't say ""Left eye, rods 1034 through 4363 registered photon wavelength 465 nm"" doesn't mean that they didn't. And more to the point, it doesn't mean that that group of rods firing and sending the information through the neurons in my brain is not what I experience as thinking ""The sky is blue.""

&gt; Epiphenomenalism...

Hmm. That seems silly from both the physicalist/eliminitavist, and the non-physicalist side. I can't think of a rationale as to why the registering of ""I am in pain"" would not lead to a subsequent ""I burned my hand on the stove"" and ""touching hot things is a bad thing that I should not do anymore"", or whatever.

&gt; They don't match up to anything real, even clusters of physical events loosely related within a body.

So, they don't find any value in saying ""This pattern of neurons firing is what people colloquially refer to as a thought""? Confronted with that they'd say something like ""Nope, that's just neurons firing, screw the idea of 'thoughts', screw the idea of 'ideas', crap, I've painted myself into a corner with the fact that I'm thinking enough to speak.""? Maybe I continue to misunderstand, but it seems to me that either eliminitivism is a position no one actually does, or even can rationally, hold, or you're misrepresenting it slightly.

From my interpretation of what you're saying, while trying to maintain eliminitavism as something other than a school of *thought* that denies that *thoughts* are a thing, it sounds like eliminitivism decides that thoughts are not an actual entity, but simply a firing of neurons in our brain (or whatever explanation, what the actual one is is rather tangential). From this position it's fine to talk about ""thoughts"" and ""memories"" as an abstraction for various patterns of firing neurons to use as a tool to simplify language, even while under the impression that a thought is still not an entity in and of itself. Just like making calculations with gravity and ignoring the effect of the sun and the moon, and every other particle in the universe is fine, even with the understanding that every particle in the universe is actually contributing.

Under this understanding, I fail to grasp how a soft physicalist is different. If they believe that mental phenomena are not simply an abstract term for the firing of neurons, then they don't believe that mental phenomena can be described in physical phenomena, and are thus not a physicalist. If they do, then they are an eliminitavist.

I'm not particularly worried about things like confirmation bias. I'm not a skeptic; I think ordinary people know many trivial things. With the use of science, we can even learn sometimes revolutionary things. However, this knowledge is only gained through the lens of theory. Science itself is comprised of hypothesises, abstract entities, heuristic devices, and metaphysical suppositions. When we use science, we are engaged with theory and observation all at once. Therefore, knowledge gained through science can never shed these originating conditions and become raw truth.

&gt; Maybe I misunderstand what you mean by complete information. We do try to get and use as much information as we can. Sure, it's not ""complete"" because our brains are finite, and so can only hold so much information, and our lifespans are finite, so we can only gather so much information.

We will never reach the ""end of scientific inquiry"" into anything, but it's what we're working towards.

I think it is important to note the tension here. What you are proposing as a model or goal for science is infinite, inattainable, and implies omniscience. At the same time, you recognize that science as practiced is finite, pragmatically-oriented, and implies a finite perspective. I'm trying to highlight the strangeness in this.

Let's suppose I find a knife in my kitchen drawer. It is dull and chipped, but something that can be salvaged. To improve the knife, I could shapen the blade or repair the handle. That would help improve the cutting ability tremendously. If I wanted to improve the cutting ability more, I could work on my own cutting technique, or even redisign the form of the knife in light of best practices and particular tasks.

This is a process of incremental improvement based on partial competency. It begins with a general inefficient process and ends at a refined, specified method. The knife was ductile, thin, and tapped to one end; Then, it was polished, sharp, and ergonomic; Finally, it was a 7"" fish boning knife with a custom grip. I would find it very strange if my ideal knife in the end became a manifestation of all possibilities at once, since the knife in itself occupies a finite function within a wider world. An infinite knife might be able to cut anything, but it can't be anything; A knife is still a knife. A limited human social experiment is still a limited human social experiment.

&gt; You're right, I don't think that. But the fact that I don't say ""Left eye, rods 1034 through 4363 registered photon wavelength 465 nm"" doesn't mean that they didn't. And more to the point, it doesn't mean that that group of rods firing and sending the information through the neurons in my brain is not what I experience as thinking ""The sky is blue.""

You know what it is like to think about those cones doing that work, though. I could record your brain when you are looking at the sky and then show you those scans. No matter how futuristic those scans are, looking at those brain images isn't the same as looking at the sky. Experiencing the sky is clearly different from experiencing the explicit physical phenomena going on in your brain.

I don't see how you can think that you experience your brain directly, frankly. I've always seen experience as something outward facing. We experience objects through the use of our innate tools, or something like that. It isn't as if I turn inwards to experience other things.

&gt; Hmm. That seems silly from both the physicalist/eliminitavist, and the non-physicalist side. I can't think of a rationale as to why the registering of ""I am in pain"" would not lead to a subsequent ""I burned my hand on the stove"" and ""touching hot things is a bad thing that I should not do anymore"", or whatever.

It is usually taken as a silly view. That is why I tried to use it as a stick, (as opposed to carrot). You can think of it like the letter 'E' if that helps. The three legs in 'E' are all connected by a central spine. Mental events would be the legs while the spine is the collection of events under causal closure. Mental events are causally linked, just indirectly, and therefore are likely to be as we find them as opposed to totally random.

&gt; So, they don't find any value in saying ""This pattern of neurons firing is what people colloquially refer to as a thought""? Confronted with that they'd say something like ""Nope, that's just neurons firing, screw the idea of 'thoughts', screw the idea of 'ideas', crap, I've painted myself into a corner with the fact that I'm thinking enough to speak.""? Maybe I continue to misunderstand, but it seems to me that either eliminitivism is a position no one actually does, or even can rationally, hold, or you're misrepresenting it slightly.

You've got it, though. ""Screw the idea of thoughts, screw the idea of *ideas*..."", is a perfect incapsulation. If you don't believe me, check out the [Churchlands](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/).

&gt; From my interpretation of what you're saying, while trying to maintain eliminitavism as something other than a school of thought that denies that thoughts are a thing, it sounds like eliminitivism decides that thoughts are not an actual entity, but simply a firing of neurons in our brain (or whatever explanation, what the actual one is is rather tangential).

If they believe that mental phenomena are not simply an abstract term for the firing of neurons, then they don't believe that mental phenomena can be described in physical phenomena, and are thus not a physicalist. If they do, then they are an eliminitavist.

This isn't a matter of simplification. The eliminativist would insist that explaining human mental life in terms of thoughts and qualitative experiences is just as bad as explaining planetary motion in terms of gods and goddesses. It might be something you do to children or guilible adults, but doesn't do anything on the explanation side. It is just an arbitrary fiction.

awenonian @ 2016-10-28 02:49:11 :

&gt; When we use science, we are engaged with theory and observation all at once. 

No, when we use science, we do our absolute best to derive theory from observation. Theory only enters the equation when deriving new knowledge because it must in order to build upon the knowledge that came before. This is true in every field of anything. When proving something in math, you don't start from the basal assumptions every time, because that would be silly, we already have proofs for certain theorems, so we use them. It's similar in science, new theory only become accepted if built off of nothing but observation, and previously accepted theory.

&gt; I'm trying to highlight the strangeness in this.

There is no strangeness. Lets say you are motivated by obtaining money. You want to obtain as much money as you can. Since you always want more money than you have, it would not be incorrect to say that your ultimate goal is infinite money, as anything less than infinite would imply that there would be a point where you wouldn't want to obtain more, and therefore wouldn't want as much as you can. However, obviously, you can't have infinite money, because that's not how money works. There is no strangeness in this, though, even if the goal is infinite, but the practice is finite.

Similarly stated, science's goal is to obtain as much knowledge as possible.

&gt; An infinite knife might be able to cut anything, but it can't be anything

I'm not certain where in this stated goal of ""as much knowledge as possible"" science started trying to be anything other than science. To improve the analogy, the end goal of the knife isn't '7"" fish boning knife with a custom grip', but instead, ""the best knife possible"". If there is any way it could be improved, then you haven't attained your goal. The knife can remain a knife, while you have an infinite goal in a finite world, while maintaining rationality.

&gt; No matter how futuristic those scans are, looking at those brain images isn't the same as looking at the sky.

Well, of course not. But this is like saying that a ""futuristic"" picture of a pie should be like eating it. It doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Experiencing the sky is clearly different from experiencing the explicit physical phenomena going on in your brain.

Is it? Can you show me how? All you've shown is that looking at the sky is different from looking at brain scans. Looking at an image of my brain isn't going to elicit the same response that looking at the sky does, even if the scan is showing the response of me looking at the sky. This would be like saying that a blueprint for a hard drive should be able to hold data like a hard drive.

&gt; I don't see how you can think that you experience your brain directly, frankly.

I'll admit, you've lost me with abstract language here. What does ""experiencing my brain directly"" mean? I mean, I don't sit here observing how the neurons in my brain are firing, because to do that I'd have to be outside of my brain. Otherwise it would be a loop, like I make an observation then think ""Huh, I made the observation that ""I made the observation that ""I made the observation that ""I made the observation that...

But I believe (I want to say know) that this propagation of signals through neurons is actually what is happening. This is similar to how I know that the earth is actually rotating on its axis, even though I seem to observe the sun revolving around the earth.

&gt; It might be something you do to children or guilible adults, but doesn't do anything on the explanation side.

Having gone back to the start of this tangent about eliminitivists, I'd have to suggest that either (1) eliminitivism is more reasonable than you're making it out to be, or (2) ""running your argument in reverse"" as you said, does not imply one is an eliminitivist. (Given what you've told me, it seems that the latter is the more likely.)

To me, in order to run your argument in reverse, it seems sufficient to make the claim that mental activities are simply an abstraction to refer to what are actually physical phenomema. If this is all that eliminitivism means, then it seems my statements about eliminitivism being able to be derived from the soft physicalism point of view hold. If it isn't, then running your argument in reverse does not seem imply one is an eliminitivist.

I thought you put the case eloquently:

&gt; Well, of course not. But this is like saying that a ""futuristic"" picture of a pie should be like eating it. It doesn't make any sense.

A detailed schema of a given state of affairs isn't identical to the experience of living through that given state of affairs. Experience isn't equivalent to information about brain states. If consciousness was just a running commentary on brain states, then having all of the relevant information about consciously available would be enough to relive the moment. It clearly doesn't work like that. You agree.

&gt; All you've shown is that looking at the sky is different from looking at brain scans. Looking at an image of my brain isn't going to elicit the same response that looking at the sky does, even if the scan is showing the response of me looking at the sky. This would be like saying that a blueprint for a hard drive should be able to hold data like a hard drive.

I agree that it is silly, and I agree with you about the mistake implied here. This is a case of mistaking schematic, idealized pictures of things with the full-bodied, actual things themselves. I would say that this obsession with reducing experiences to experiences of explicit brain states over-extends our schematic understanding, projecting our rationalizations onto the world.

&gt; I'm not certain where in this stated goal of ""as much knowledge as possible"" science started trying to be anything other than science. To improve the analogy, the end goal of the knife isn't '7"" fish boning knife with a custom grip', but instead, ""the best knife possible"". If there is any way it could be improved, then you haven't attained your goal. The knife can remain a knife, while you have an infinite goal in a finite world, while maintaining rationality.

There isn't just knife XP laying around, waiting to level up our knives. Knives are the best knives at a specific purpose. I'm glad to have a butcher's knife to cut chickens into quarters but not onions. Similarly, the point I was trying to make had to do with the contextual nature of knowledge. A perfect, monolithic eye from the center of the nowhere is a poor model for science. In practice, science is polycentric and at war with itself constantly. If the best understanding of the mind might require adaptation and assumptions that would never be made when explaining other phenomena. Science is concerned with best practices, not a single model for practices.

&gt; But I believe (I want to say know) that this propagation of signals through neurons is actually what is happening. This is similar to how I know that the earth is actually rotating on its axis, even though I seem to observe the sun revolving around the earth.

There is a crucial difference here. After learning something about astronomy, I can experience sunrises in a totally different way. There is a marker gestalt shift, even if it last only as long as you concentrate on the idea. I don't lose my train of phenomenal consciousness upon learning anything about neuro-science. Even after 'the curtain is pulled back', we still feel the rhythm of experiencing pulling from one moment to the next.

It might not be magic, but how exactly all this noise in the brain relates to qualitative life isn't as clear as fact and fiction.

&gt; To me, in order to run your argument in reverse, it seems sufficient to make the claim that mental activities are simply an abstraction to refer to what are actually physical phenomema. If this is all that eliminitivism means, then it seems my statements about eliminitivism being able to be derived from the soft physicalism point of view hold. If it isn't, then running your argument in reverse does not seem imply one is an eliminitivist.

1. It isn't what eliminativism means. The article I linked spells that out clearly.

2. What premise from my original argument are you rejecting specifically? Claiming that experiences are abstraction seems like claiming they are speculative entities.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-10-28 16:25:53 :

&gt; Do you think science ever posits unobserved or unobservable entities?

It shouldn't. Unobservable entities are unscientific by definition. Maybe you're considering something like the Higgs Boson being hypothesized before it was observed. This happened, yes, but I don't think it would fall under ""positing unobserved entities"". Simply put, the Higgs Boson seemed to be the logical conclusion of certain things we had learned (I don't know what things, I'm not an expert in this field). We then raced to observe it, so we could confirm that this was in fact the case. This is the role of hypotheses in science, statements which we expect to be true, but hold next to no weight until confirmed to be true through experiment.

&gt; then I would say desires for infinite things are irrational... Greed is considered a vice for good reason.

Why, though? Again, the use of the word infinite was simply a rewording of trying to attain a maximum. If you have a function that constantly grows (tries to attain a maximum value) it is said to tend to infinity. Even if it will never actually reach it for any finite value of x. You can create an equivalent goal that doesn't require stating it as the impossible ""infinite"". Just change it to short term instead of end goal: I want more of Y than I currently have.

And on the Greed front. Ok, let's say instead, we keep the example, but exchange money for happiness. I don't think there's any generally accepted form of belief that posits that trying to attain as much happiness as possible is a vice (assuming it's not visceral pleasure in some cases, but that can be taken care of by exchanging ""happiness"" for ""non-visceral happiness"").

&gt; If consciousness was just a running commentary on brain states

I'm not sure where I implied this. Consciousness isn't a ""commentary"" on brain states, it is the series of states themselves.

&gt; having all of the relevant information about consciously available would be enough to relive the moment.

Only if you also have the ability to translate that relevant information into the brain states themselves. Our eyes do not do this job. They do not look at brain scans and reconfigure our brain into the pattern we see, instead they offer info into what photons are hitting our retina.

To that end, this example of showing me pictures of brain states is not equivalent to ""experiencing the explicit physical phenomena"", it is instead showing me the explicit physical phenomena. Experiencing them is a different deal, and is what happens when you say, look at the sky. This is why I can't agree that experiencing looking at the sky is necessarily different from experiencing the physical phenomena.

 &gt; projecting our rationalizations onto the world.

I could say the same thing about you claiming that our experiences are not just the physical phenomena. You're taking a rationalization that your thoughts and feelings are actual things, and projecting it onto a world that doesn't consider them that.

&gt; Knives are the best knives at a specific purpose. 

No, they could always be sharper, dull slower, be lighter (or heavier if it calls for it), be made out of better materials, etc. etc. There are always improvements you could make. A perfect knife is unattainable, but that doesn't mean we can't strive for it.

&gt; Science is concerned with best practices, not a single model for practices.

Really? Generally, it seems to me we try to fit everything into a single model. We believe that the laws of the universe are the same everywhere and everywhen. We even have [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything) as a goal. Yes, taking things to abstractions is good, we don't want to have to plug in all the parts of an equation that tells us every particles interaction with every other particle when we can just say yeah, let's use simple parabolic motion, but those abstractions are for approximation. They simplify calculation to get to a useful level of information, so we can do things like rocket science. But they remain abstractions from the ultimate, single model for how things work.

&gt; There is a crucial difference here.

I'm not going to quote the whole paragraph, but I'm going to address a lot of it. 

To start with, I didn't experience sunrises in a different way after learning that the earth rotates and that's why the sun goes up. They looked the same, they felt the same. I just knew what was actually happening. This is exactly how I experience consciousness. After learning that thoughts are just neurons firing in specific patterns, I still thought and felt the same, I just knew what was actually happening.

Second, there is a marked difference in what we know about astronomy and what we know about neuro-science. There is not much more relevant information to know about why sunrises happen than that the earth spins. There is a lot more relevant information to know about how thoughts and stuff work, but you (probably) won't learn it, because no one has learned it. Essentially, the curtain hasn't really been pulled back.

&gt; It might not be magic, but how exactly all this noise in the brain relates to qualitative life isn't as clear as fact and fiction.

Sure. I'm of the mind that, in time, as our tools and technology progress, it will be explained more and more, until we come up with a full explanation. We may never do so, but I see no reason to believe we won't. You clearly don't think that this is the case, and admittedly, with our limited understanding of the brain, I'd struggle to give reason why we necessarily would. To me, it just seems reasonable, since everything else about the world can be explained through physical phenomena, why would our brains be different?

&gt; What premise from my original argument are you rejecting specifically?

Not your original argument. You stated a while back in this thread that ""one man's modus tollens is another's modus ponens"" and that one could run your argument in reverse, but if they did you would insist they were an eliminitivist. You said ""If the privacy and assertiveness of phenomenal experience is an illusion, then there just aren't genuine experiences to be had."" To me it would seem that claiming that ""mental activities are simply an abstraction to refer to what are actually physical phenomema"" would be sufficient to show that privacy and assertiveness were illusion. And you just said that this isn't what elimintivism is. I'd link to the actually comment, but I don't know how to do that...

Bringing the argument back to that point would allow the restating of what other commenters had said about the Hard Problem simply being reduced to ""is physicalism true?"" That is to say, the Hard Problem only exists if physicalism is false. It would seem that ultimately, the Hard Problem is meant to be a problem for physicalists, but a problem that only exists if the thing it's trying to be a problem for is false doesn't serve much use.

This is the role of hypotheses in science, statements which we expect to be true, but hold next to no weight until confirmed to be true through experiment.

You can't have it both ways. Positing unobserved things can't be deeply unscientific and an essential part of the scientific method. The hypothesis of the Higgs Boson can't be both baseless until observed and the focus of intense research before its observation.

Follow-up: Do you consider things like mass, causation, and fields to be directly observed objects? Does considering whether they are observed or unobserved affect their importance in our understanding?

&gt;&gt;If we are going to get technical about this, then I would say desires for infinite things are irrational. Desiring things that are incoherent or impossible to fulfill in practice is opposed to promoting human flourishing and impossible to entertain as a maxim for action.

&gt;Why, though? Again, the use of the word infinite was simply a rewording of trying to attain a maximum. If you have a function that constantly grows (tries to attain a maximum value) it is said to tend to infinity. Even if it will never actually reach it for any finite value of x. You can create an equivalent goal that doesn't require stating it as the impossible ""infinite"". Just change it to short term instead of end goal: I want more of Y than I currently have.

I would say that even this paraphrase is an expression of an irrational desire. Our desires and values only make sense against the back-drop of our engagement with the world. All rational desires are weighed relative to the body of our character: our drives all things considered. Any unbounded desire threatens the balance and integrity of this unity by outstripping the priority of other ends. While money is good and more money is better, the unfettered desire to constantly have more money is the worst.

&gt; And on the Greed front. Ok, let's say instead, we keep the example, but exchange money for happiness. I don't think there's any generally accepted form of belief that posits that trying to attain as much happiness as possible is a vice...

I guess I'm the weirdest person you've ever met then, ;). I am actually very critical of utilitarian reasoning. I wrote a short argument arguing against the logical cohesiveness of this kind of thinking a few years [ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1ugwgg/consequentialsim_and_the_publicity_problem_what/?sort=confidence)

&gt;I'm not sure where I implied this. Consciousness isn't a ""commentary"" on brain states, it is the series of states themselves.

This two quotes capture what I'm getting at:

&gt;[Brains processing information are] what I'd call personal experiences. The processing of inputs in our minds (generally referred to as ""thinking"", or similar terms) are the events I was referring to when I said ""events which we call 'experiencing qualitative events'"".

&gt; [T]he fact that I don't say ""Left eye, rods 1034 through 4363 registered photon wavelength 465 nm"" doesn't mean that they didn't. And more to the point, it doesn't mean that that group of rods firing and sending the information through the neurons in my brain is not what I experience as thinking ""The sky is blue.""

In these accounts of experience, conscious experiences are equivalent to the names of brain states. As we experience a given phenomena, the qualitative features that jump out as salient are just names or tags or signals that a particular brain state occurs. The stream of experience is therefore a series of signs about internal brain states. Does this represent your view?

&gt;Experiencing them is a different deal, and is what happens when you say, look at the sky. This is why I can't agree that experiencing looking at the sky is necessarily different from experiencing the physical phenomena.

Ah-ha! So a given experience isn't equivalent to just the information. It is the information under a specific mode of representation or given through a specific causal chain. Is that correct?

&gt; No, they could always be sharper, dull slower, be lighter (or heavier if it calls for it), be made out of better materials, etc. etc. There are always improvements you could make. A perfect knife is unattainable, but that doesn't mean we can't strive for it.

The perfect knife isn't just unobtainable. There is no one perfect knife. There is no such entity that could perform all the tasks a knife can excel at and still be called simply, 'knife'. You reveal as much when you note that the perfect knife would need to be either heavy or light depending on the context.

&gt; Really? Generally, it seems to me we try to fit everything into a single model. We believe that the laws of the universe are the same everywhere and everywhen. We even have this as a goal.

1. You're citing an example of a unifying theory within the field of physics. It could be possible that there are different pressures on physics, (to move towards a smaller body of theories), while other sciences flourish under different pressures, (with a larger sets of theories perhaps). Physic's hunt for parsimony isn't necessarily science's hunt for parsimony.

2. The 'single-model' model is itself more contentious than you seem to think. [Here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModRed) is a very brief statement on the topic. The most relevant section begins at 5.2.

&gt; I didn't experience sunrises in a different way after learning that the earth rotates and that's why the sun goes up

I guess I'll just have to take your word for it. Are you familiar with the concept of a gestalt shift? Are you saying that you still believed that the sun was literally rising when you saw the sun rise?

&gt;Sure. I'm of the mind that, in time, as our tools and technology progress...

I've been befuddled by this kind of reply, since it is the kind of thing my Jehovah's Witness in-laws tell me. They tell me that God has apparently kept his promises up to now, and they see no reason to doubt the coming fulfillment of his future promises. They insist that it would be rational for me to change my mind on the subject, in spite of having no particular reason to do so at the moment.

I'm sure you are screaming at your computer: ""But science is clearly different from religion! Science has a great inductive track record while religion is woo!"" To that, I say you are fixated on science's success in spite of its failure. The history of science is littered with unfinished and falsified theories. Science is just as much about mistakes as it is about success. Furthermore, again, there is no way to check the accuracy of science from outside to verify the inductive success up to this moment in the first place.

&gt;Not your original argument. You stated a while back in this thread that ""one man's modus tollens is another's modus ponens"" and that one could run your argument in reverse, but if they did you would insist they were an eliminitivist. You said ""If the privacy and assertiveness of phenomenal experience is an illusion, then there just aren't genuine experiences to be had."" To me it would seem that claiming that ""mental activities are simply an abstraction to refer to what are actually physical phenomema"" would be sufficient to show that privacy and assertiveness were illusion. And you just said that this isn't what elimintivism is.

This is an explicit rejection of the disjunct I laid out, then. The way I lined things out, all questions are either assertive or speculative and private or public. You seem to be saying that ideas actually fall into one of the categories I dismissed. It seems like you are saying experiences are speculative, (in light of being abstract), and public (in light of functioning like a name).

I think this result is very strange, since it would lump mathematics and psychology together in a single type. Psychologism in mathematics and rationalism in psychology are both wildly unpopular, so I think this is very unlikely. Moreover, experiences don't seem like abstractions from our primary contact with the world. They are our primary contact with the world! We live through our experiences and abstract things like material identity fall out of the mix. Therefore, the speculative/abstract part of your definition seems amiss.

&gt;Bringing the argument back to that point would allow the restating of what other commenters had said about the Hard Problem simply being reduced to ""is physicalism true?"" That is to say, the Hard Problem only exists if physicalism is false. It would seem that ultimately, the Hard Problem is meant to be a problem for physicalists, but a problem that only exists if the thing it's trying to be a problem for is false doesn't serve much use.

I don't know if there is a way for us to agree on the logical priority here. If the hard problem implies soft physicalism is false logically, then it seems foolish to pin-point 'when' physicalism is shown as false, though. It shouldn't matter where you start as long as you maintain a valid argument form.

What matters is whether you accept all the premises and why you reject certain premises. You seem to reject my original categorization, which is a perfectly fine move. However, if this is a matter of being a ride-or-die physicalist, then there is nothing I can do. If you are willing to reject every argument to preserve physicalism, then rational arguments won't do me much good.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-10-31 19:29:56 :

So, I hit a character limit on this... Um. I'll just post 2 replies I guess?

Part(1/2)

&gt; Positing unobserved things can't be deeply unscientific and an essential part of the scientific method.

I think one of us (probably me) is misusing ""posit"". To claim unobserved things (e.g. ""The Higgs Boson exists"" before it's been observed) is unscientific. To hypothesize unobserved things (e.g. ""The Higgs Boson might (or even ""probably does"") exist, and here's what we'd expect to see if it does"") is not.

&gt; I would say that even this paraphrase is an expression of an irrational desire.

I'm not sure where to keep going with this. I mean, to me I would think that if you had taken math to a point where you talk about limits, the value of talking about infinity (even if you'd never reach it) would be obvious. I assume you have taken such a math class, so I'm not certain where the hang up is for you.

&gt; ... Does this represent your view?

&gt; Ah-ha! So a given experience isn't equivalent to just the information. It is the information under a specific mode of representation or given through a specific causal chain. Is that correct?

I suppose this is one way to phrase it? I'll try to iterate exactly what I think, and hopefully that'll clarify. In human experience, I don't think there is anything that happens besides the chemical and physical interactions that occur inside one's brain. All experiences are simply different combinations of physical interactions inside our brain. How *exactly* those physical interactions come together is beyond my understanding, but I do believe that there are, in fact, some physical interactions that are occurring, and that there is nothing else that affects those physical interactions besides previous physical interactions. Therefore, the experience isn't equivalent to the information, because I don't know if the ""information"" actually enters the situation, that is, knowing what physical interactions occur for a certain scenario is not the same as those physical interactions occurring. Does that make sense?

&gt; The perfect knife isn't just unobtainable. There is no one perfect knife.

I'd like to stop talking about the knife. A knife has too much nuance for the simple point I was trying to make, and to try to narrow it down is tough. I could go on to say something like ""Fine, instead of 'best knife' let's go 'best knife for slicing a specific orange'"" or something, to try to narrow out the nuance, but then we're answering the question of how well can I phrase the question, instead of the question itself.

&gt; Physic's hunt for parsimony isn't necessarily science's hunt for parsimony.

So, this might sound weird, but I want you to look past the language I'm about to use and find the meaning of what I say, because I don't think I can phrase it well: Physics is the only real science. To clarify, when I've been talking about science, I've been talking about the physical sciences (physics, chemistry, etc. not sociology, and political science, etc.), though I think that was fairly obvious. What I'm trying to say when I say physics is the only real science is that other physical sciences generally behave as abstractions of physics. Chemistry may model chemicals, but if you get fine grained enough, all chemical interactions are physical interactions, between protons and neutrons and electrons. Chemistry just allows us to talk about them as atoms and molecules, instead of large numbers of points with given charges and masses. Reduce biology enough, and you get to chemistry, as life is, at it's base, just self sustaining chemical reactions. We've established that chemistry can be reduced to physics, so therefore, so can biology. We don't oft do this, because trying to match the reading of DNA to the actual physical interactions is a lesson in futility for our current processing power.

&gt; The 'single-model' model is itself more contentious than you seem to think. 

The second sentence on that pages says this: ""Evidently, multiple models for the same target system do not generally stand in a deductive relation as they often contradict each other."" Now, I won't claim to be perfectly aware of everything in science, but I don't know what models in science contradict each other. That would seem to be a problem, and a good reason to correct the models. After all, if one model says X will happen, and one says Y will happen, and we actually recreate the event, and X happens, then model 2 was wrong, wasn't it?

Following the page down, in 5.3, it talks about models and the laws of nature, and how they relate. It says ""What role do general laws play in science if it is models that represent what is happening in the world and how are models and laws related?"" This confuses me, because as far as I'm aware, models are ways we can process the laws. They are, at their heart, models, and should be understood as such. When you make a model of the solar system, it generally doesn't have a ball of nuclear fusion in the center of it, and the planets are generally styrofoam balls painted different colors or something. It's not the actual solar system, it's just something that matches it in the relevant categories. Similarly, the models in science are simply us attaching something that matches in the relevant categories, so we can better understand the actual process.

&gt; Are you familiar with the concept of a gestalt shift?

No, I am not. Gimme a sec. Hmm. I don't know if that describes the change when I learned that the Earth's rotation was why the sun rose.

&gt; Are you saying that you still believed that the sun was literally rising when you saw the sun rise?

Certainly not. But the sun didn't look any different after learning that. I knew the explanation, but the event still looked the same. Maybe when you said experience, you meant it called up different thoughts, and when I said experience, I was referring to only the physical sensations. I'll be honest, I've forgotten what this particular tangent's purpose was, so maybe that clarification on ""experience"" clears things up?

To hypothesize unobserved things (e.g. ""The Higgs Boson might (or even ""probably does"") exist, and here's what we'd expect to see if it does"") is not.

I would say that the hypothetical is still a pretense to knowledge about unobserved think. It is a prediction about how things will behave given predictive circumstance. You're basically saying, ""I'm not positive these things exist, but if they did they would do X.""

&gt;&gt; Our desires and values only make sense against the back-drop of our engagement with the world. All rational desires are weighed relative to the body of our character: our drives all things considered.

I assume you have taken such a math class, so I'm not certain where the hang up is for you.

I've taken everything up to Physical Systems (Dirac Delta equations, Laplace transforms, etc.). My gripe here isn't with the possibility of infinite tasks. I have a gripe with your ethics interpretations.

&gt;In human experience, I don't think there is anything that happens besides the chemical and physical interactions that occur inside one's brain. All experiences are simply different combinations of physical interactions inside our brain... (T)he experience isn't equivalent to the information, because I don't know if the ""information"" actually enters the situation, that is, knowing what physical interactions occur for a certain scenario is not the same as those physical interactions occurring.

So, any given experience is identical to physical states of affairs; Your thoughts, ideas, and experiences are literally identical with some part of your body, not the form or properties of those physical things?

&gt; I'd like to stop talking about the knife. A knife has too much nuance for the simple point I was trying to make, and to try to narrow it down is tough?

That is the point, though. If consciousness is a tool that developed over time and in response to particular tasks and operating parameters, then it isn't simple. It demands nuance and specification.

&gt; Physics is the only real science.

Can you back up this assertion with a serious argument? This seems like a very bold claim that non-physicists should rightly dismiss out of hand.

&gt;The second sentence on that pages says this: ""Evidently, multiple models for the same target system do not generally stand in a deductive relation as they often contradict each other."" Now, I won't claim to be perfectly aware of everything in science, but I don't know what models in science contradict each other. That would seem to be a problem, and a good reason to correct the models. After all, if one model says X will happen, and one says Y will happen, and we actually recreate the event, and X happens, then model 2 was wrong, wasn't it?

Sure; that is a case of simple falsification. Sometimes, science appeals to two useful models that appeal to radically different working metaphors. Some models tell us, ""This is a matter of particles doing their thing"", while other models say, ""This is a matter of waves doing their thing."" Both can be useful even if it isn't obvious how something is both a particle and a wave all at once.

&gt; It's not the actual solar system, it's just something that matches it in the relevant categories. Similarly, the models in science are simply us attaching something that matches in the relevant categories, so we can better understand the actual process.

I agree, but don't laws also make it easier for us to understand the actual process too?

&gt;(T)he sun didn't look any different after learning that. I knew the explanation, but the event still looked the same. Maybe when you said experience, you meant it called up different thoughts, and when I said experience, I was referring to only the physical sensations. I'll be honest, I've forgotten what this particular tangent's purpose was, so maybe that clarification on ""experience"" clears things up?

Aren't you begging the question by supposing that there are 'physical sensations'? Let's say that you'd never seen a television before. Upon seeing the black box with a glass screen, you'd see the same physical manifestation as anyone. However, you wouldn't experience it as a TV, since you don't know what a TV is, right? 

Experiencing something at least has something to do with making metaphysical assumptions about what you are in fact looking at. Watching TV, while seemingly just a matter of processing photons streaming out of LEDs, includes positive assertions about what the device is for, what a TV show is, what the narrative of the program is, etc. This involves more than passively processing given packets of truth.

&gt;If it's the former, I'd say that's got nothing to do with science, and everything to do with humans.

Does science transcend the physical tools and events that humans created?

&gt; Science has worked when applied. Science got us to the moon, and I'm not certain how you could say that that wasn't a way to check it's accuracy.

Isn't it possible to create a useful fiction? Certainly, there are many assumption in classic mechanics that are literally false, but incredibly useful when modeling mid-range, local phenomena.

&gt;If you presented an argument that attacked physicalism, then I wouldn't reject the argument simply because it does so, but I am examining your arguments from a point of view where I believe physicalism is the case. If examining it from this point of view creates a contradiction, then either the argument is flawed, or physicalism is flawed. I'd like to say that if it turned out physicalism is flawed, I'd turn tail and accept that, but knowing me, I'd probably do my darndest to put the flaw on the argument.

The mark of an intelligent man is the ability to entertain an idiot without accepting it. It seems like you should take a non-partial position that doesn't assume or deny either side.

&gt;I feel like this entire qualification places a level of importance on human perspective that simply doesn't exist. Presumably, something like pen falling is a public question, as everyone could observe that pen falling, where as how you feel about your pet dying is a private question, as only you can really experience that. However, from a physicalist perspective, that's not much of a distinction. Neither are more than a series of physical interactions occurring. The only relevant difference to your categorization is that one series of physical interactions is occurring within your skull, but I don't see why that should hold much of any importance.

I'm not supposing an anthropic perspective. You can confine the perspective to a particular person, or all koalas, or all objects including inanimate ones. If you don't think there is a relative difference between the way a single human being perceives the world, or a difference between the way koalas cognize the world and the way humans generally cognize, then you are probably should just eliminate talk about experience all together.

&gt;But, if private questions aren't actually a thing, then this isn't a problem.

Do you saying I am confused when I ask, 'What is it like to be you?' How so? It seems like a sensible question to me.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-10-31 23:42:13 :

&gt; You're basically saying, ""I'm not positive these things exist, but if they did they would do X.""

Well, yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. But there's a clear difference between ""X exists"" and ""X might exist"".

&gt; I have a gripe with your ethics interpretations.

Just to tidy things a bit, we got onto this tangent when I stated that science aims to gain infinite knowledge. Despite the admittedly poor wording of that statement, I'd stick with it. Are you suggesting that too much knowledge would be a bad thing?

&gt; So, any given experience is identical to physical states of affairs; Your thoughts, ideas, and experiences are literally identical with some part of your body, not the form or properties of those physical things?

I agree with what I think you're trying to say, but I'm not sure I'm interpreting correctly. I mean, my ideas are not identical to my finger, because if nothing else (but definitely other things as well), one's in my head, the other's on my hand, but in terms of them being able to be described as an arrangement of physical things (generally particles, potentially fields and stuff as well) at a given time, then yes.

&gt; If consciousness is a tool that developed over time and in response to particular tasks and operating parameters, then it isn't simple. It demands nuance and specification.

This tangent with the knife never had anything to do with consciousness. It spawned from the tangent about science's quest for infinite knowledge.

&gt; Can you back up this assertion with a serious argument?

I attempted to do so in the rest of the paragraph. This is exactly why I said try to look past the language. Because I'm not saying there isn't any value in being a chemist, or a biologist, I'm saying that those fields can (through a great degree of tedium, which we bypass by having separate fields) be reduced down to physics. Which, ultimately, is the position of a physicalist.

&gt; Both can be useful even if it isn't obvious how something is both a particle and a wave all at once.

Yeah, I'll admit wave-particle duality is confusing. But these models don't contradict. They don't simultaneously predict different things will occur at the same time. And, as I said, if they do, we need to refine whichever model gets it wrong. And, while it may be a weird concept for us to grasp, because at our macroscopic lens, you don't really see the effects (even though they are actually there), the whole point of wave-particle duality is that there isn't a contradiction in seeing electrons and photons as both waves and particles.

&gt; I agree, but don't laws also make it easier for us to understand the actual process too?

Well, not really. The models make it easier for us to understand the laws. I'm not sure if this will clarify things, but something like Newton's First Law is actually a model, used to describe the relevant ""law of nature"". That is, there's a difference between ""laws of nature"" and what we term a Law in science. This is evident from the fact that things still fell before someone came up with the Law of Gravity.

&gt; Aren't you begging the question by supposing that there are 'physical sensations'?

I don't think so? I think this is just the position of physicalism. Have I commited a faux pas by doing that?

&gt; This involves more than passively processing given packets of truth.

Not necessarily. We aren't examining someone who popped into existence watching TV, and knowing what a TV is. The experience he is having is molded by previous experiences. Last week, when he watched the show, some connections between neurons in his brain strengthened to form a memory, and now, seeing these photons hit specific cones in his retina, it has triggered vastly complex responses throughout the neurons in his brain, causing some of those connections made previously to activate. This is him recalling the memory. Not to mention, when he sat down, he had some thoughts in his brain. This means that from his previous activity he had signals zipping around in his brain already, these shape his experience as well. But ultimately, all of these signals originated from some point, whether that be his retina, his ear drum, his nerve endings in his fingers, whatever. All these signals constantly enter the brain, swarm around, interact, etc. to create a complex web of experience. But every signal had a source, somewhere.

&gt; Does science transcend the physical tools and events that humans created?

I think science as we know it is a human generated concept, so, I don't think so, no.

&gt; Certainly, there are many assumption in classic mechanics that are literally false, but incredibly useful.

I don't understand this. If it gives the wrong answer, how is it useful? If it gives the right answer, how is it false?

&gt; It seems like you should take a non-partial position that doesn't assume or deny either side.

Yes, I should. I hesitate to claim I will though, given my track record through life. I understand this ideal, and I want to strive for it, but I don't trust myself to succeed in striving for it.

&gt; or a difference between the way koalas cognize the world and the way humans generally cognize

I do think there are differences, because congnization is done through the complex machine of our brain, and our brains are structured differently from koala's brains. However, I do think that by even talking about private questions, you've assumed humans are more than biological machines that take inputs and, after some fancy processes, produce outputs.

&gt; Do you saying I am confused when I ask, 'What is it like to be you?' How so?

If someone asked me this question, in all honesty, I would say ""What do you mean?"" I'd need more specific lines of inquiry to really answer there question. I'm honestly not sure where I'd start to answer that question. That's actually very interesting. I know it's tangential, but I'm curious, how would you answer that question?

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-01 01:05:32 :

&gt; Well, yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. But there's a clear difference between ""X exists"" and ""X might exist"".

Of course! They are different claims. However, they are both predicated on knowledge of X. Since the second claim is like our working model of hypothesis, pretense to knowledge can precede experience.

&gt; Just to tidy things a bit, we got onto this tangent when I stated that science aims to gain infinite knowledge. Despite the admittedly poor wording of that statement, I'd stick with it. Are you suggesting that too much knowledge would be a bad thing?

Yes, I think knowledge is only definable as relative to human ends. Knowledge, in terms of the number of justified true beliefs, is conceptually limited by our finite capacities.

&gt; I mean, my ideas are not identical to my finger, because if nothing else (but definitely other things as well), one's in my head, the other's on my hand, but in terms of them being able to be described as an arrangement of physical things (generally particles, potentially fields and stuff as well) at a given time, then yes.

How can my body parts relate to outside objects in an intentional relationship? Ideas are about objects. My impression of a piece of fruit, for example, is about a particular orange or a particular pear. How can my brain be about those things? Moreover, how can my brain represent different things moment to moment? How can the same pieces be about a pear one minute and an orange the next?

&gt; I attempted to do so in the rest of the paragraph. This is exactly why I said try to look past the language. Because I'm not saying there isn't any value in being a chemist, or a biologist, I'm saying that those fields can (through a great degree of tedium, which we bypass by having separate fields) be reduced down to physics. Which, ultimately, is the position of a physicalist.

It didn't seem like a defense as much as an exposition of a hierarchy. I don't see any reason to privilege that particular ranking though, and don't think it is necessary for physicalism. It could be that the physical sciences are sufficient to explain consciousness but is comprised of non-reducible fields, like physics, biology, psychology, etc.

&gt; Yeah, I'll admit wave-particle duality is confusing. But these models don't contradict. They don't simultaneously predict different things will occur at the same time. 

Their predictions don't have to differ for the models to differ. They clearly use different means to explain the same family of phenomena.

&gt; Well, not really. The models make it easier for us to understand the laws. I'm not sure if this will clarify things, but something like Newton's First Law is actually a model, used to describe the relevant ""law of nature"". That is, there's a difference between ""laws of nature"" and what we term a Law in science. This is evident from the fact that things still fell before someone came up with the Law of Gravity.

OK, that seems sensible. I think there is some room for disagreement about how much human beings discover about laws of nature and how much humans actively create, but this seems like a tangent.

&gt; I don't think so? I think this is just the position of physicalism. Have I commited a faux pas by doing that?

It seems presumptuous to assume that a given sensation is just physical information, but you seem comfortable with assuming physicalism over other theories as a starting position. If you don't think you can be more impartial about this, there isn't much I can say.

&gt; Not necessarily. We aren't examining someone who popped into existence watching TV, and knowing what a TV is. The experience he is having is molded by previous experiences. Last week, when he watched the show...

I'm not talking about an outlandish case. Surely, there are still
isolated people that have never seen a TV before. Their experience of the object is going to be very different from our experience, since we have active concepts to interpret the TV's behavior.

&gt; some connections between neurons in his brain strengthened to form a memory, and now, seeing these photons hit specific cones in his retina, it has triggered vastly complex responses throughout the neurons in his brain, causing some of those connections made previously to activate. This is him recalling the memory. Not to mention, when he sat down, he had some thoughts in his brain. This means that from his previous activity he had signals zipping around in his brain already, these shape his experience as well. But ultimately, all of these signals originated from some point, whether that be his retina, his ear drum, his nerve endings in his fingers, whatever. All these signals constantly enter the brain, swarm around, interact, etc. to create a complex web of experience. But every signal had a source, somewhere.

And none of this pinpoints the most interesting distinction: some people are capable of recognize objects while others can't. No of this explains the phenomena of representation of an experience as an experience of something.

&gt; I think science as we know it is a human generated concept, so, I don't think so, no.

If no other human activity is self-authorizing or potentially infallible, then why is science exceptional.

&gt; I don't understand this. If it gives the wrong answer, how is it useful? If it gives the right answer, how is it false?

Well, in classic mechanics, objects can be modeled as rigid, while relativity tells us no objects are actually rigid. Moreover, classic mechanics models all causation as local, while Quantum Mechanics models some relationships as non-local. CM is useful within local conditions, but doesn't reflect the way things are essentially.

&gt; I do think there are differences, because congnization is done through the complex machine of our brain, and our brains are structured differently from koala's brains.

What would you say about individual human experiences? Humans are surely far hard to distinguish. Also, do you think it is possible to explain the similarity of experiences across species and individuals with this model?

&gt; If someone asked me this question, in all honesty, I would say ""What do you mean?"" I'd need more specific lines of inquiry to really answer there question. I'm honestly not sure where I'd start to answer that question. That's actually very interesting. I know it's tangential, but I'm curious, how would you answer that question?

I suppose I would appeal to inter-subjective experiences that I thought we could share. For example, I could highlight the similarities in our families, our habits, our aspirations, etc. This wouldn't allow you to deduce logically what I'm like or even predict my behavior inductively, but it might allow you to intuit my experience by analogy. You can't literally see through my eyes, but perhaps you can imagine seeing through your eyes as if they were more like mine.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-01 15:04:37 :

&gt; Since the second claim is like our working model of hypothesis, pretense to knowledge can precede experience.

This isn't entirely accurate. Both are predicated on a *definition* of X. It's not that we knew what a proton was, and sought to find it, it's that we found something and called it a proton. Does that make sense? We find something, it suggests that there is a thing causing X, by causing X it's likely to have Y properties, if it had Y properties it would cause Z, can we set up an experiment to see if it does in fact cause Z? 

&gt; Knowledge, in terms of the number of justified true beliefs, is conceptually limited by our finite capacities.

To be clear, it doesn't matter if knowledge is limited, but is there a point where more knowledge, while more knowledge is still possible, is a *bad* thing?

&gt; How can my brain be about those things? Moreover, how can my brain represent different things moment to moment?

I don't know what you mean by ""my brain be about those things"", further, your brain doesn't ""represent"" different things moment to moment, but it is a different arrangement of particles moment to moment, because those particles are moving.

&gt;  and don't think it is necessary for physicalism.

It is though. If the world is made up of only physical phenomena, (i.e. mass, energy, etc.), then everything is fundamentally reducible to physics, since these are the terms physics works in.

&gt; Their predictions don't have to differ for the models to differ.

If at some level they differ, then at some level they're predictions differ. If they're predictions never differ, can they really be said to be different? If they're predictions do differ, then you can determine which is right, and which is wrong.

&gt; since we have active concepts to interpret the TV's behavior.

Yes, and these concepts arose from our previous input of information. There still isn't necessarily anything except our brain processing information, which I believe is how we got on this tangent?

&gt; If no other human activity is self-authorizing or potentially infallible, then why is science exceptional.

I'm having trouble parsing this. Science is self authorizing, but so is math, and hell, any form of logic, so philosophy as well. I don't really think science is exceptional in this regard.

&gt; Well, in classic mechanics, objects can be modeled as rigid, while relativity tells us no objects are actually rigid. 

It seems folly to say that an approximation is ""literally false"". Classical mechanics are false, but in the same way modeling gravity without accounting for every particle in the entire universe is false. Your original statement was ""Isn't it possible to create a useful fiction?"" And if you take approximations as fiction then yes it is. However, we have the word approximation for a reason, and the fact that we've verified our approximations general accuracy with field tests like landing on the moon is a reasonable way to verify science without simply using more science.

&gt; What would you say about individual human experiences?

Similarly, every human's brain is structured differently. Probably less differently than general human compared to general koala, but still differently. And with a machine as complex as the brain, different structuring is likely to result in vastly different output.

&gt; Also, do you think it is possible to explain the similarity of experiences across species and individuals with this model?

Yes, see my previous statement: ""Probably less differently than general human compared to general koala, but still differently.""

&gt; You can't literally see through my eyes, but perhaps you can imagine seeing through your eyes as if they were more like mine.

Yeah, it's an odd question. My first instinct was actually to start describing myself, in terms of things like ""I'm a white college age male who lives in North Carolina"", because I think, due to your experience of the world, these bits of information are the most information dense, that is, while you may not get a fully accurate picture of me, knowing my environment and appearance is likely to allow you to extrapolate more information from it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alright, at this point, I think I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by this. We've gone on like 12 different tangents, and it's a lot. So I'd like to simplify. Feel free to respond to the things above, and I'll continue to reply back in kind, but I'd like to kind of restart this with a direct challenge to your OP, and see if starting over might help.

My main goal in all this was to try to show that despite your categorization, you are still begging the question against physicalism in posing the Hard Problem. The simplest way to put it is ""If physicalism is true, science can explain everything."" This is fairly unconvincing, because your obvious reply would be ""Ah, but the Hard Problem poses a challenge to science's ability to explain everything, therefore, either your statement must be false, or physicalism must be false!"" So, to state it more complexly, your categorization of Public vs Private questions is what pre supposes physicalism's falsehood. Your categorization on Assertive vs Speculative is not really relevant, since your statement of ""Unfortunately, scientific materialism only deals in public questions."" will no longer matter if I can show that all questions are public.

All questions are public because all happenings are simply interactions of physical phenomena. The difference between you feeling sad and a pen falling is not anything fundamental, they're simply different sets of various particles interacting with each other. Either of these interactions can be examined from an infinite number of frames of reference (which I'd call perspectives), and so are therefore public. To suggest otherwise would suggest that not everything is physical phenomena, which is fine, but you can't then go on to use the argument as an argument against physicalism.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-01 17:53:12 :

&gt; We find something, it suggests that there is a thing causing X, by causing X it's likely to have Y properties, if it had Y properties it would cause Z, can we set up an experiment to see if it does in fact cause Z?

That seems like a lot of things to know without directly observing protons, (that they cause X, that they have Y properties, that they also cause Z). Even if they are true by definition, we would still have justified true beliefs about protons.

&gt; To be clear, it doesn't matter if knowledge is limited, but is there a point where more knowledge, while more knowledge is still possible, is a bad thing?

I think wanting impossible or poorly defined things is irrational, so unlimited knowledge is an irrational goal. Speaking to your point here though, sometimes ignorance is bliss. I heard a story on the radio about a family lying to a very old Grandma-type. She was diagnosed with terminal cancer, but the family decided not to tell her. She ended up living through the ordeal none the wiser. It is better live without anxiety than to worry about things beyond our control.

&gt; I don't know what you mean by ""my brain be about those things"", further, your brain doesn't ""represent"" different things moment to moment, but it is a different arrangement of particles moment to moment, because those particles are moving.

I tried to explain what I meant here.

&gt;Ideas are about objects. My impression of a piece of fruit, for example, is about a particular orange or a particular pear.

Our experiences take objects. They are about places, things, and events in the real world, apparently. If parts of are bodies are literally identical to ideas, then they must share all the same properties. Since intentionality is one of the most important mental property, it is good place to start.

&gt; It is though. If the world is made up of only physical phenomena, (i.e. mass, energy, etc.), then everything is fundamentally reducible to physics, since these are the terms physics works in.

There are a lot of physical sciences though. I'm trying to do you a favor here! Defending this kind of hard reductivist approach is more trouble than it's worth. Isn't it enough that the brain could be explained in terms of physics, chemistry, biology, and neurology within their domains of applicability?

&gt; If at some level they differ, then at some level they're predictions differ. If they're predictions never differ, can they really be said to be different? If they're predictions do differ, then you can determine which is right, and which is wrong.

This is a position known as logical positivism or logical empiricism. It was very popular in the 20's and 30's, but is very unpopular in contemporary academia. This is just a tangent, so it isn't worth harping on. However, if you want to know what is wrong with this position, you should search these terms.

&gt; Science is self authorizing, but so is math, and hell, any form of logic, so philosophy as well. I don't really think science is exceptional in this regard.

Different strokes, I guess. I don't think math and philosophy are self-authorizing. The deliverance of both fields are checked against the body of human knowledge just like anything else. This is just a tangent, though. We can move on.

&gt; It seems folly to say that an approximation is ""literally false"". Classical mechanics are false, but in the same way modeling gravity without accounting for every particle in the entire universe is false. Your original statement was ""Isn't it possible to create a useful fiction?"" And if you take approximations as fiction then yes it is.

It looks like we are in agreement then. Approximations aren't literally true. They are strong analogies that are incredibly useful.

&gt; However, we have the word approximation for a reason, and the fact that we've verified our approximations general accuracy with field tests like landing on the moon is a reasonable way to verify science without simply using more science.

That's fine. There are some ideas are clearly better informed than others, even if no idea is infallible.

&gt; Alright, at this point, I think I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by this. We've gone on like 12 different tangents, and it's a lot. So I'd like to simplify. Feel free to respond to the things above, and I'll continue to reply back in kind, but I'd like to kind of restart this with a direct challenge to your OP, and see if starting over might help.

Works for me! The things I didn't respond were sensible in my book. I think you sciencism does hinder the discussion somewhat, but we can return to the main topic.

&gt; My main goal in all this was to try to show that despite your categorization, you are still begging the question against physicalism in posing the Hard Problem. The simplest way to put it is ""If physicalism is true, science can explain everything..."" So, to state it more complexly, your categorization of Public vs Private questions is what pre supposes physicalism's falsehood. Your categorization on Assertive vs Speculative is not really relevant, since your statement of ""Unfortunately, scientific materialism only deals in public questions."" will no longer matter if I can show that all questions are public.

This is case in point. Physicalism needn't imply that all questions are scientific question. One could be a phyiscalist with regards to the mind, but a platonist in mathematics and a realist in ethics. The later positions would set up domains where science doesn't have final authority. Therefore, physicalism doesn't necessarily imply sciencism. Physicalism is a thesis about the human mind. I think you are letting wider commitments to sciencism bleed into this discussion.

&gt; All questions are public because all happenings are simply interactions of physical phenomena. The difference between you feeling sad and a pen falling is not anything fundamental, they're simply different sets of various particles interacting with each other. Either of these interactions can be examined from an infinite number of frames of reference (which I'd call perspectives), and so are therefore public. To suggest otherwise would suggest that not everything is physical phenomena, which is fine, but you can't then go on to use the argument as an argument against physicalism.

If you don't see how this reasoning is circular, then I don't know what to tell you. Ideally, as you admitted, you should be committed to physicalism or non-physicalism when considering the argument. If you reject my categorizations just because all things are physical, then you are clearly failing to do this.

I'm not trying to be mean. I'm not even frustrated. I just don't get it. I don't know your background, so it might just be a difference of fields of study. My undergrad was a traditional philosophy curriculum with some physics thrown in for kicks. Argument structure was a very big deal. If you are familiar with symbolic logic, it might be best to break this down in terms of symbols and operators. I might be easier for me to see your argument.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-01 21:30:39 :

&gt; That seems like a lot of things to know without directly observing protons,

These things result from observation. We have observations that X happens under Y conditions, and if we don't have something to explain that, then we add to the model. So we've indirectly observed protons.

&gt; It is better live without anxiety than to worry about things beyond our control.

Different values I guess. I don't think it's objectively better.

&gt; If parts of are bodies are literally identical to ideas, then they must share all the same properties.

I'm trying to follow, but why are you using ""parts of our bodies"" here instead of just, any generic object?

&gt; Isn't it enough that the brain could be explained in terms of physics, chemistry, biology, and neurology within their domains of applicability?

Yeah, I guess.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; If you don't see how this reasoning is circular, then I don't know what to tell you.

Mm. I'm trying to think about it, but I honestly don't see how it's circular. I don't see where I've strayed from ""all things are physical"" either. We may just be at an impasse. Sorry.

&gt; I don't know your background, so it might just be a difference of fields of study.

Well, I'm a 19 year old college Junior majoring in Computer Science. So, probably more just different levels of education, especially on this subject (and philosphy in general, I've taken 1 class on it...)

&gt; If you are familiar with symbolic logic, it might be best to break this down in terms of symbols and operators. I might be easier for me to see your argument.

Well, I'm not terribly familiar, but let me try to be as organized as I can.

1. Everything is physical phenomena

2. The laws of the universe regarding physical phenomena are consistent regardless of position, orientation, or time.

3. Because 2 we can set arbitrary axes on any interaction between physical particles

4. There are an infinite number of arbitrary axes

5. Because 4 and 3, there are an infinite number of axes (normally called frames of reference) any physical phenomena can be examined from.

6. Because 5 and 1, everything can be examined from an infinite number of frames of reference.

7. Frames of reference = perspectives

8. Because 6 and 7, everything can be examined from infinite perspectives.

I believe at that point it's the end. Being able to be examined from infinite perspectives is how you defined public, so, therefore, everything is public.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-02 00:47:43 :

&gt; These things result from observation. We have observations that X happens under Y conditions, and if we don't have something to explain that, then we add to the model. So we've indirectly observed protons.

I think we could really play around with the distinction between indirect observation and unobservables all day. It's really interesting and relevant with we are going to seriously push the philosophy of science side of the debate. However, it might be too tangential.

&gt; Different values I guess. I don't think it's objectively better.

Isn't it better to be happier all things considered?

&gt; Why are you using ""parts of our bodies"" here instead of just, any generic object?

Because you think ideas are identical to parts of our bodies. If ideas of intentional properties, then our bodies must have the same properties.

&gt; Mm. I'm trying to think about it, but I honestly don't see how it's circular. I don't see where I've strayed from ""all things are physical"" either. We may just be at an impasse. Sorry.

You're basically saying that physicalism is true because all questions are public. And, you believe all questions are public because physicalism is true. It's a loop.

&gt; 1.Everything is physical phenomena.

This shouldn't be the first premise of your argument. This is what you want to prove in the end. Beginning with your conclusion as a premise is the literal definition of begging the question.

&gt; 2.The laws of the universe regarding physical phenomena are consistent regardless of position, orientation, or time.

Do you think this is consistent with relativity and the apparent effects of observation in quantum mechanics.

&gt; there are an infinite number of axes (normally called frames of reference) any physical phenomena can be examined from.

This is probably true given that physical things are typically concrete objects. As objects, they are defined in terms of being discrete and public. However, appearances are clearly tied to specific frames of reference. For example, a stick appearing to be 2 meters long might depend on the relative speed between the observer and the stick. A stick appearing straight depends on the medium between the observer and portions of the stick. These appearances can't be examined from just any perspective.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-02 18:29:03 :

&gt; Isn't it better to be happier all things considered?

Didn't you say earlier that too much happiness could also be bad?

&gt; Because you think ideas are identical to parts of our bodies.

Yes, I suppose I did say (or at least imply heavily) that ideas are parts of our bodies. What's the relation to ""are"" vs ""are identical to""?

&gt; You're basically saying that physicalism is true because all questions are public.

My attempt was to say all questions are public because physicalism is true. I did not attempt to use that to prove physicalism, just to disprove the Hard Problem. I'm not trying to say ""The Hard Problem is false, therefore physicalism"", but instead ""if physicalism, the Hard Problem is false"". Because the Hard Problem's purpose is to pose a challenge for physicalism (as far as I can tell), showing it is false under physicalism renders it's purpose null. This does not prove physicalism, just disproves your attempt to disprove physicalism.

&gt; Do you think this is consistent with relativity and the apparent effects of observation in quantum mechanics.

Yes, I do. This is an assumption, but it's one that is basal in science. In fact, there is a really interesting thing that I won't pretend to understand, but was explained to me as using this assumption to show why there is conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum. It's called Noether's theorem if you're interested. That's fairly tangential. As far as I know, as long as you take your inertial frame of reference into account, relativity doesn't affect anything, and quantum mechanics, while random, are still consistently random (i.e. X event under Y conditions will always have a 40% chance of happening).

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-02 20:05:36 :

&gt; Didn't you say earlier that too much happiness could also be bad?

I did and still do. It's still better to be happy than not happy, all things being equal. Learning something that you can't change doesn't change what you can do. It only affects your attitude.

&gt; Yes, I suppose I did say (or at least imply heavily) that ideas are parts of our bodies. What's the relation to ""are"" vs ""are identical to""?

I was just trying to capture your position. If you don't think they are identical after all, we can interpret 'are' however you like.

&gt; My attempt was to say all questions are public because physicalism is true. I did not attempt to use that to prove physicalism, just to disprove the Hard Problem. I'm not trying to say ""The Hard Problem is false, therefore physicalism"", but instead ""if physicalism, the Hard Problem is false"".

To be clear, changing someone's mind involves moving someone from a state of belief to a state of disbelief. I agree that people committed to physicalism often dismiss the Hard Problem. After all, they believe that all mental properties are reducible to a single dimension. I'm trying to change minds though. By breaking the Hard Problem into orthogonal components indirectly related to physicalism itself, I am trying to shake up people's perspective.

Maybe physicalism implies not-Hard Problem, but we are suspending our opinions to considered a separate proposition. I can convince you that these propositions are well supported and in tension with physicalism, then I can point to a reason to change your mind. This isn't a matter of picking a partisan position come what may. That would be dogmatic; you should be open-minded.

&gt; Yes, I do. This is an assumption, but it's one that is basal in science. In fact, there is a really interesting thing that I won't pretend to understand, but was explained to me as using this assumption to show why there is conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum. It's called Noether's theorem if you're interested. That's fairly tangential. As far as I know, as long as you take your inertial frame of reference into account, relativity doesn't affect anything

I agree that somethings are constant across frames of reference. That doesn't imply that everything real is constant. This passage from my previous reply addresses a cases where things are apparently real but observer dependent.

&gt; However, appearances are clearly tied to specific frames of reference. For example, a stick appearing to be 2 meters long might depend on the relative speed between the observer and the stick. A stick appearing straight depends on the medium between the observer and portions of the stick. These appearances can't be examined from just any perspective.

&gt; Learning something that you can't change doesn't change what you can do. It only affects your attitude.

This is completely tangential, but when does more happiness outweigh more knowledge, and vice versa?

&gt; we can interpret 'are' however you like.

So, ideas are a set of particles inside your brain. While I suppose you could call this a body part, it seems odd, like calling blood a body part. In fact, that's a good analogy I suppose. Ideas are stuff moving in your brain, just like blood is stuff moving through your, say, arm. That analogy falls apart fairly quickly, though I think.

&gt; This isn't a matter of picking a partisan position come what may.

As per your title, your position is ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness is a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience."" You also say: ""According to it's advocates, the Hard Problem presents a major challenge to certain suppositions about the power of science to answer important questions about consciousness."" If I say ""not under physicalism"" then I believe that shows your position is false.

&gt;For example, a stick appearing to be 2 meters long might depend on the relative speed between the observer and the stick.

Yes, but if you take into account your inertial frame of reference, this won't contradict any other frame of reference.

&gt; These appearances can't be examined from just any perspective.

But all perspectives are examining the same thing. There may be a discrepancy in what photons reach your point of observation, but from any other perspective, you could still conclude what photons reach that point anyway. This is kind of a subtly human-centric view. A human standing at point A might see something different than one standing at point B, but the human at point B (assuming he had the relevant information) could calculate what photons are reaching A's eye's enough to actually reconstruct what A is seeing.

That's tough! That might be out of my depth.

Ideas are stuff moving in your brain, just like blood is stuff moving through your, say, arm. That analogy falls apart fairly quickly, though I think.

So, when an idea is traveling through my body, does it make sense to say, ""This impression of blue was here, now it's there,"" or ""My hunger hasn't moved for hours""?

If I say ""not under physicalism"" then I believe that shows your position is false.

How? It seems like you are just refusing to reconsider your position. If you aren't willing to part with physicalism under any circumstance, then there is nothing I can do to change your mind. By assuming that you are right from the beginning and evaluating all propositions under this assumption, you aren't really engaging with the idea.

&gt; Yes, but if you take into account your inertial frame of reference, this won't contradict any other frame of reference.

Your missing the point. I'm not saying this implies that the stick is both 2 and not-2 meters long. I'm saying that it appears 2 meters long under a limited number of perspectives. Changing the interpretation to include all frames of references obliterates these frame specific facts. There is no way the stick appears from every perspective.

&gt;  But all perspectives are examining the same thing. There may be a discrepancy in what photons reach your point of observation, but from any other perspective, you could still conclude what photons reach that point anyway.

What information reaches A or B is a physical fact, since information is defined in a specific way in the physical sciences. That doesn't imply that A can see what B sees. What appears to A is grounded by A's particular perspective: FoR, History, Body, etc. These individuating facts tie the appearances before A to A specifically, as opposed to B.

We can guess what A is thinking from a second-person perspective, but this is different from seeing exactly as A sees. No matter how accurately B predicts A's experiences, B will never literally know what A knows: what's it like from the other side. Considering the question from an entirely third-person perspective obscures the issue further, since physical descriptions are insensitive to particular perspectives. You agreed to this much already.

awenonian @ 2016-11-03 14:36:55 :

&gt; ""This impression of blue was here, now it's there,"" or ""My hunger hasn't moved for hours""?

Not really. I suppose that analogy falls apart nearly instantly, doesn't it. The ""impression of blue"" would've been a specific arrangement of particles, generally not so specific that the arrangement needs to be defined across the whole brain, but more like this group of neurons needs to be in this state.  That is to say, there is nothing fundamentally different about the blue and the hunger, so moving the hunger doesn't really make sense. If it moves, it stops being hunger, because the arrangement has changed. I don't think I'm explaining this very well.

&gt; How?

Simply put, the Hard Problem attempts to show issue with physicalism. Under physicalism, it is a non-problem, so it fails to do so. Under other systems, its irrelevant, as showing issue with physicalism from a non-physicalist perspective seems like begging the question. In other words ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness is *not* a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience.""

&gt; It seems like you are just refusing to reconsider your position.

To be completely fair, it seems the same from my side. I hope I'm not making you frustrated with me.

&gt; By assuming that you are right from the beginning and evaluating all propositions under this assumption, you aren't really engaging with the idea.

Starting with assumptions is not a problem, it's used fairly often. Here's a question, since I must start from some basal assumptions (i.e. the universe exists, etc.) which would you like me to use to engage with your idea? To be clear, upon hearing your proposals, I may try to challenge your assumptions instead of engaging with your idea.

&gt; There is no way the stick appears from every perspective.

This attachment to ""appearance"" is what I was talking about when I said ""subtly human-centric"". Every perspective can agree on the facts of the situation, regardless of what photons hit their observation point, and what thoughts those might conjure up if filtered through a human brain.

&gt; B will never literally know what A knows: what's it like from the other side.

All of this is assuming that A and B are intelligent, and more importantly, that this intelligence is divorced from the physical world on some level. When I said frame of reference, I didn't mean putting a human in those positions. Further, if there *were* humans in those positions, B had the relevant information (which is impossible by today's technological standards, but this is hypothetical), could process it all, and their intelligence was *not* divorced from the physical world, B could recreate the entire mind of A and would, in essence, know what A knows.

It would still make sense to say that ""Hunger is still"" or ""Blue is to the right of some memory of a time when I was 5"", right?

Frankly, this question about where ideas are is secondary to how physical parts can have intentional properties, (e.i. be about something), in the first place. I think this is the first stumbling block for any physicalist theory.

&gt;Simply put, the Hard Problem attempts to show issue with physicalism. Under physicalism, it is a non-problem, so it fails to do so. Under other systems, its irrelevant, as showing issue with physicalism from a non-physicalist perspective seems like begging the question.

You haven't defended physicalism, though. You haven't provided any reason to put physicalism forward besides your prior commitment to it. Retrenching and doubling down might work in a political debate, but this should be an un-empassioned and cooperative dialogue. As I've said before, no argument can change someone's mind, if they are willing to cling to a contrary position no matter what. If you choose to believe physicalism is true in the face of any potential evidence, then I can't shake your faith, can I?

&gt;To be completely fair, it seems the same from my side. I hope I'm not making you frustrated with me.

I'm not that frustrated. Most people aren't familiar with the expectations of logical rigor put forward by philosophical arguments. In an ordinary argument, it would be enough simply to explain your position and hope the other side agrees eventually. People don't explicitly think about explicit truth conditions and the logical connections that would support these conditions very often.

Here, I've tried to expand beyond the dichotomy of physicalism/non-physicalism. I tried to introduce supporting premises that secure non-physicalism without assuming its truth before hand. In contrast, your rebuttals have all assumed the truth of physicalism and used this a justification for everything else. You haven't put effort into offering supporting premises to get what you want.

&gt;Starting with assumptions is not a problem, it's used fairly often. Here's a question, since I must start from some basal assumptions (i.e. the universe exists, etc.) which would you like me to use to engage with your idea? To be clear, upon hearing your proposals, I may try to challenge your assumptions instead of engaging with your idea.

Assumptions are fine, but assuming you are just right is clearly not fine. If you don't get this, just read the definition of this [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question#Definition). This doesn't necessarily mean you are wrong, but it does mean you have poor support for your position.

As far as I'm concerned, the only thing you aren't allowed to assume is the explicit rejection of a premise in the argument. Rejecting a premise requires offering an additional premise or sub-argument to make your case. If you need an explicit list of premises, this might help:

1. Questions are either public or not (P or ~P; Disjunct)
2. Questions are either assertive or not (A or ~A; Disjunct)
3. (P or ~ P) and (A or ~A) (Conjunct of 1-2)
4. (P and ~A) or (~P and A) or (P and A) or (~P and ~A) (Equiv. 3)
5. The argument from illusion implies (~(P and A))
6. The argument from other minds implies (~(~P and ~A))
7. The argument against rationalism implies (~(P and ~A))
8. ~(P and A) and ~(~P and ~A) and ~(P and ~A) (Conjunct of 5-7)
9. ~((~P and A) or (P and A) or (~P and ~A)) (De Morgan's; 8)
10. ~P and A (Disjunctive Principle with 4 and 9)

You can disagree with any of these premises, but you should provide at least one novel positive reason for doing so. Just assuming (P and A) because you think (P and A) is true doesn't cut it, for example.

&gt; This attachment to ""appearance"" is what I was talking about when I said ""subtly human-centric"". Every perspective can agree on the facts of the situation, regardless of what photons hit their observation point, and what thoughts those might conjure up if filtered through a human brain.

Your lack of attachment to appearance is making this harder for both of us! What is our conscious experience if not the world as it appears to us? We are humans, so I'm not surprised that an account of human experience was human centric, for that matter. Did you expect an account of human experience to focus of something other than the world as it appears to human?

&gt;&gt;&gt; A human standing at point A might see something different than one standing at point B, but the human at point B (assuming he had the relevant information) could calculate what photons are reaching A's eye's enough to actually reconstruct what A is seeing.

&gt;&gt;What information reaches A or B is a physical fact, since information is defined in a specific way in the physical sciences. That doesn't imply that A can see what B sees. What appears to A is grounded by A's particular perspective: FoR, History, Body, etc. These individuating facts tie the appearances before A to A specifically, as opposed to B.
We can guess what A is thinking from a second-person perspective, but this is different from seeing exactly as A sees. No matter how accurately B predicts A's experiences, B will never literally know what A knows: what's it like from the other side. Considering the question from an entirely third-person perspective obscures the issue further, since physical descriptions are insensitive to particular perspectives. You agreed to this much already.

&gt;All of this is assuming that A and B are intelligent, and more importantly, that this intelligence is divorced from the physical world on some level. When I said frame of reference, I didn't mean putting a human in those positions.

I think you're confused, because you mentioned humans explicitly when you introduced A and B. Moving on though, this is all hearsay until you can explain how a third-person description can encode intentional content. I agree that B can accurately guess A's mental states and empathize/sympathize with A's experiences. However, it isn't clear that B can acquire A's experiences as A experiences them. 

To prove this, you would need to show how we can recover appearances directly from objectified information. This is unlikely, in my opinion, because objective information is valid across FoR/perspectives. This is built into the definition of objectivity, and essential to the appeal of objective facts in the first place. However, since appearances supervene on perspective- and perceiver- specific facts, objective facts seem like poor vessels for capturing the content of our mental lives.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-04 16:36:20 :

&gt; It would still make sense to say that ""Hunger is still"" or ""Blue is to the right of some memory of a time when I was 5"", right?

Maybe, but probably not, at least not those specific statements. To start, it can't be still, because memories and thoughts and such aren't generally stored as like a charged up neuron, but more as the placement. What I mean is kind of that they can't be ""still"". Also, there's likely to be more overlap between things than very distinct ""blue is here, memory from 5 is there"". There's likely some sharing of neurons, and potentially some other stuff. We don't really have a huge grasp of the brain, and I'm certainly not an expert, so I can't give you a full explanation.

&gt;  how physical parts can have intentional properties

I'm still not quite sure what this means. I honestly don't understand.

&gt; You haven't defended physicalism, though

I don't need to, though. As I said, if we split it up into 2 arguments that encompass all possibilties, that is physicalism, or anything non-physicalism, then we can show that the Hard Problem is a non-problem. Under physicalism, the Hard Problem  doesn't work. Under anything else, it's irrelevant.

&gt; If you choose to believe physicalism is true in the face of any potential evidence, then I can't shake your faith, can I?

Yes, but what potential evidence have you given to show it's not the case? Either way, as I said above, this isn't relevant. The Hard Problem is not a problem under physicalism, and is irrelevant under anything else. Regardless of physicalism's truth, the Hard Problem isn't a problem.

&gt; Assumptions are fine, but assuming you are just right is clearly not fine

It's a good thing I'm not trying to prove physicalism then. Remember, I'm trying to show the Hard Problem isn't a problem.

&gt; Just assuming (P and A) because you think (P and A) is true doesn't cut it, for example.

Sure, I rejected 1. Or I introduced a new premise of ~(~P)? I suppose either would work.

More accurately, I introduced a premise of ""if phsyicalism ~(~P)"" Then I also said ""if ~physicalism then it's irrelevant"" Which is loosely stated I understand, but essentially, your derivation of (~P and A) then goes on to be used to say, from what I can tell ""physicalism will have a problem explaining consciousness"". So, at this point, I say ""Well if ~physicalism, then of course it would, but that's because it's false, not because of the Hard Problem.""

&gt; Did you expect an account of human experience to focus of something other than the world as it appears to human?

In order to understand the brain, you have to go beyond your human experience of it. Just like to understand most of anatomy and physiology you have to go beyond your human experience of it. You don't generally feel the blood grabbing oxygen from your lungs and diffusing it into your muscles, but that's what's happening.

&gt; I think you're confused, because you mentioned humans explicitly when you introduced A and B.

You're right, I did, and I remembered that after having posted. I apologize for that.

&gt; Moving on though, this is all hearsay until you can explain how a third-person description can encode intentional content.

I may be misunderstanding, but I'm pretty sure I'm saying there is no such thing as ""intentional content"". I'm not quite certain what ""intentional content"" is, which is why I expect I'm misunderstanding, but from the context, I think that is what I'm saying.

&gt; However, it isn't clear that B can acquire A's experiences as A experiences them.

Only because anything B learns has to be filtered through his brain. This presents a challenge, and is why I was trying to divorce it from a human perspective.

It's like someone who only sees the world through red tinted glasses talking with someone who only sees it through blue tinted glasses. There's a clear, inescapable barrier to them understanding each other's experiences, but someone who isn't wearing glasses could determine what each of them sees in a given state. In that case, the non-wearer could simply put on some tinted glasses to see what they see, though we have no known mechanism for doing the same with one's brain.

&gt; To prove this, you would need to show how we can recover appearances directly from objectified information.

Under physicalism, we must be able to. There isn't anything else besides objective information.

And again, this is an OK assumption to make, because it's the only part where the Hard Problem actually causes contention. As I said above, if ~physicalism, the Hard Problem is irrelevant, so I only need to concern myself with showing that it's not a problem under physicalism.

There's likely some sharing of neurons, and potentially some other stuff. 

What sense does it make to say that ideas are physical objects, if it turns out that ideas don't have definite positions or positions relative yo other ideas. All other physics objects have a position and orientation with respect to other physical objects. Why don't ideas?

&gt;&gt; this question about where ideas are is secondary to how physical parts can have intentional properties, (e.i. be about something), in the first place.

&gt; I'm still not quite sure what this means. I honestly don't understand.

The best example I can give you would a be street sign. 'Stop' signs have intentional properties that make it significant to drivers. Drivers take in the directly sensible properties, like shape, color, and placement, and infer meaning, namely that the sign means I should stop. Some physical objects are clearly capable of conferring meaning, otherwise things like the written word would be impossible. However, what makes something meaningful, or significant, can be hard to explain.

&gt; I don't need to, though. As I said, if we split it up into 2 arguments that encompass all possibilties, that is physicalism, or anything non-physicalism, then we can show that the Hard Problem is a non-problem. Under physicalism, the Hard Problem doesn't work. Under anything else, it's irrelevant.

Isn't this argument meant to help us select from these theories? It would be strange to assume any particular theory is true, if this argument is meant to guide us on the topic. Suspending belief and operating under minimum assumptions about the mind seems called for, if we are going to evaluate the effectiveness of this argument in a non-partisan way.

&gt; Yes, but what potential evidence have you given to show it's not the case?

That the argument from illusions implies that public assertions are ill-equipped to handle the relevant distinctions (5). Do you have a reply?

&gt; Sure, I rejected 1. Or I introduced a new premise of ~(~P)?

This is just a rejection of (~P and A), given that (~P and A) implies (~P). Since (~P and A) is logically derived from 1-9, your probably better off attacking one of the premises.

&gt; More accurately, I introduced a premise of ""if phsyicalism ~(~P)"" Then I also said ""if ~physicalism then it's irrelevant"" Which is loosely stated I understand, but essentially, your derivation of (~P and A) then goes on to be used to say, from what I can tell ""physicalism will have a problem explaining consciousness"". So, at this point, I say ""Well if ~physicalism, then of course it would, but that's because it's false, not because of the Hard Problem.""

Again, the whole point here is to suspend judgement and let the argument land where it will. I get your whole, 'no use preaching to the choir; no use preaching to the heretic' mentality, but that isn't the point of philosophy. Within the confines of this rational discussion, everything is meant to be guided by argument, not conviction.

&gt; In order to understand the brain, you have to go beyond your human experience of it. Just like to understand most of anatomy and physiology you have to go beyond your human experience of it. You don't generally feel the blood grabbing oxygen from your lungs and diffusing it into your muscles, but that's what's happening.

You are presuming that we are just interested in brain anatomy, and you might be right about brain anatomy. However, we are still on the mind here. Our mental lives obviously have a great deal to do with appearances as given to us. Assuming that the mind is identical to the brain is, again, just assuming physicalism is true.

&gt; I may be misunderstanding, but I'm pretty sure I'm saying there is no such thing as ""intentional content"". I'm not quite certain what ""intentional content"" is, which is why I expect I'm misunderstanding, but from the context, I think that is what I'm saying.

This is a valid position, but it is an eliminative position. If our ideas had no intentional content, then they wouldn't relate to the world in a significant way. If our ideas lack significance, then they cease to function as representations of the world and the like. Therefore, ideas wouldn't really be ideas anymore.

&gt; It's like someone who only sees the world through red tinted glasses talking with someone who only sees it through blue tinted glasses. There's a clear, inescapable barrier to them understanding each other's experiences, but someone who isn't wearing glasses could determine what each of them sees in a given state. In that case, the non-wearer could simply put on some tinted glasses to see what they see, though we have no known mechanism for doing the same with one's brain.

I can agree with this but would like to point out that everyone has there own glasses. No one exists without a pair of glasses. The very act of cognition implies engaging with a pair of glasses. Whatever problem applies here applies to all of us in all cases.

&gt; this is an OK assumption to make, because it's the only part where the Hard Problem actually causes contention. As I said above, if ~physicalism, the Hard Problem is irrelevant, so I only need to concern myself with showing that it's not a problem under physicalism.

What does a problem for physicalism look like if physicalism is always assumed to be true from go? Genuinely curious. It seems like you are insulating yourself from criticism by appointing physicalism as judge, jury, and executioner in its own trial.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-05 17:03:24 :

&gt; All other physics objects have a position and orientation with respect to other physical objects. Why don't ideas?

Well, consider something like a bowl of spaghetti. Now with the noodles all tangled, does it really make sense to say ""this noodle is left of that one""? Some of it might be, but probably not all of it. What if some of these noodles share some dough? Now it makes less sense to say one is left of the other. If they're in motion all the time (which, you know, doesn't make sense for spaghetti, but maybe fast moving worms?) it doesn't make sense to say they're still. But spaghetti (and worms) are clearly physical objects.

&gt; 'Stop' signs have intentional properties that make it significant to drivers.

So if stop signs have intentional properties, what's the issue with ideas as physical objects having intentional properties?

&gt; Isn't this argument meant to help us select from these theories?

The argument about the Hard Problem? I believe that was the intent, yes, but I've attempted to show that it fails at that job.

&gt; I get your whole, 'no use preaching to the choir; no use preaching to the heretic' mentality

But it's more than that. I'm not just saying ""you don't need to convince the choir, and you won't convince the heretic, because he won't believe what you say"" I'm saying ""the choir's beliefs already rule out the argument, and the argument actually doesn't provide any evidence against the heretic's beliefs. Regardless of whether he's willing to accept a rational argument or not, this argument will not convince him.""

&gt; Assuming that the mind is identical to the brain is, again, just assuming physicalism is true.

Yes. I know. I still fail to see the problem with this. I've stated, I don't care about the actual position of the world, I'm just attempting to show that the Hard Problem does not guide our understanding on whether physicalism is true or not.

&gt; If our ideas had no intentional content, then they wouldn't relate to the world in a significant way

Ah, well, then I don't reject intentional content, because our ideas do relate to the world. They spawned from input from our various senses.

&gt; The very act of cognition implies engaging with a pair of glasses.

I believe the point still stands. Because if it were as simple as tinted glasses, we'd be able to find the correct color to cancel out your glasses, and add a new filter to match someone else's. Something that we simply don't have the technology to do with brains (or the willingness I'd assume, because that could fundamentally change who you are as a person. But unwillingness does not imply impossibility, so I don't know if that matters.)

&gt; What does a problem for physicalism look like if physicalism is always assumed to be true from go?

One that causes a contradiction. This is a ""proof by contradiction"": If an initial assumption causes a contradiction, the assumption must be false. It's a fairly standard form of proof.

My whole point has been that the Hard Problem does not present a contradiction with physicalism, and therefore is not a good proof against it, which was it's whole goal.

If they're in motion all the time (which, you know, doesn't make sense for spaghetti, but maybe fast moving worms?) it doesn't make sense to say they're still. But spaghetti (and worms) are clearly physical objects.

I only harped on the still thing, because you insisted they weren't in motion, so I'm a little confused. At any rate, regardless of the complexity of the relation, there must be a definite fact about things like relative position of ideas. If ideas don't occupy space, then they can't be physical. We should be able to sensibly say, ""My idea of red is to the right of blue, then to the right, and so on."" 

&gt;So if stop signs have intentional properties, what's the issue with ideas as physical objects having intentional properties?

Well, it comes down to how you explain this fact. I would appeal to non-physical facts, such as perspective-relative seemings, normative imperatives, and metaphysical assumptions that ground intelligibility. These explanations aren't counter-physical, but violate many of the precepts of physicalism: perspective-independence, being object oriented, and relying on physical observation respectively.

Using the 'Stop' sign example, I would explain the significance of the sign in terms of its apparent meaning to the observer, the intentions of the sign maker, and the running assumptions that ground the possibility of transferring information faithfully from one person to another. The physicalist can't use these some resources, since they reject agent-relative facts about the particular observer, teleological reasoning encoded in intentions, and unobservable postulates that metaphysical assumptions. It is up to you to come up with an alternative account that matches this level of explanatory adequacy.

&gt;The argument about the Hard Problem? I believe that was the intent, yes, but I've attempted to show that it fails at that job.

If it is meant to be used as a tool for evaluating the truth value of a variety of theories, what does fixing certain outcomes in advanced do to the significance of the results? In my mind, this seems like a case of cherry picking from a certain sub-set of the data, rather than evaluating the case in light of all significant results. It's a way to motivate a certain interpretation by excluding contrary results, or cropping the ends of a graph and distorting the axis to force a trend.

Truth proceeds from experience, right? Why should we assume the truth of physicalism without exploring the issue through an impartial consideration of the argument? I think you are dogmatically privileging certain results based on your expectations.

&gt;But it's more than that. I'm not just saying ""you don't need to convince the choir, and you won't convince the heretic, because he won't believe what you say"" I'm saying ""the choir's beliefs already rule out the argument, and the argument actually doesn't provide any evidence against the heretic's beliefs. Regardless of whether he's willing to accept a rational argument or not, this argument will not convince him.""

Then you are just mistaken, then. I provide three arguments to rule out certain possibilities in my argument, (Premises 5-7). You might disagree with my arguments, but I did offer evidence in the form of thought experiments and logical argumentation. If your only response to these arguments is that you will prefer the belief in physicalism to any contrary belief, then I don't feel the force of your objection.

&gt;Ah, well, then I don't reject intentional content, because our ideas do relate to the world. They spawned from input from our various senses.

Note that the question isn't, ""What are the causes of our experiences and the appearance of intentionality in the world?"" Obviously, the answer is the same for the physicalist and non-physicalist: ordinary objects that we encounter through the senses. The question is, ""What are our experiences; What is intentionality as we know it?"" Even an eliminativist would appeal to the input reply for the first question.

&gt;I believe the point still stands. Because if it were as simple as tinted glasses, we'd be able to find the correct color to cancel out your glasses, and add a new filter to match someone else's. Something that we simply don't have the technology to do with brains (or the willingness I'd assume, because that could fundamentally change who you are as a person. But unwillingness does not imply impossibility, so I don't know if that matters.)

I think determining what color I'm 'actually' seeing through intersubjective means to any degree of objective certainty is trickier than you think. I think exploring this in terms of a formal math problem might be fun and illuminating but maybe too much bite off.

That being said, the super-science simulation of my experiences is still a simulation of my experience. It doesn't literally become my experience once it clears a certain accuracy thresh-hold. They remain to separate tokens.

&gt;One that causes a contradiction. This is a ""proof by contradiction"": If an initial assumption causes a contradiction, the assumption must be false. It's a fairly standard form of proof.

Not all consistent ideas are true, though. Some ideas and beliefs are logically possible and consistent with other logically possible beliefs without actually reflecting reality. An idea does need to be absurd in order to be incorrect.

&gt; My whole point has been that the Hard Problem does not present a contradiction with physicalism, and therefore is not a good proof against it, which was it's whole goal.

I mean premise 5 seems like a fairly direct contradiction of the reductive physicalism your pushing. If questions about experience in itself cross-cut question about literal states of affairs or beliefs about literal states of affairs, then physicalism would be ill-equipt to model experience. Physicalist assumptions might be expedient when doing neurology or bio-chemistry, but it doesn't reflect the essential truth in this picture.

&gt; because you insisted they weren't in motion

I dunno when I insisted that. But I was probably wrong when I did.

&gt; ""My idea of red is to the right of blue, then to the right, and so on.""

I mean, I suppose you can do this. I just don't know why you would, I don't really know what benefit you'd get out of it.

&gt; It is up to you to come up with an alternative account that matches this level of explanatory adequacy.

Ok, sure. Our brain develops as a complex machine for processing inputs. It is able to mold itself in subtle ways to change how it will process future inputs. All this is done through very complex and minute interactions between particles, facilitated by cells (which are also made up of particles). By living (processing inputs) in our world, our brain is shaped in such a way that common signals get assigned with certain responses, be it something external, like picking up food when hungry, or internal, like setting of some thoughts when you hear the word ""red"". A set of particles arranged into a stop sign has no absolute properties as to meaning, but is instead interpreted by a brain that has learned what it's supposed to mean by rewiring around signals it receives, e.g. seeing your mother slow down the car when approaching such a sign.

&gt; If it is meant to be used as a tool for evaluating the truth value of a variety of theories,

I don't think it is. From what I've read from you, it seems to be a tool for evaluating the truth of one theory: physicalism.

&gt; Why should we assume the truth of physicalism without exploring the issue through an impartial consideration of the argument?

Because physicalism is the subject! If you're trying to disprove physicalism, but your argument shows no contradictions in the face of physicalism, what's the point? 

&gt; If your only response to these arguments is that you will prefer the belief in physicalism to any contrary belief, then I don't feel the force of your objection.

So you feel your arguments in premises 5-7 provide evidence against physicalism? Is that correct?

&gt; Note that the question isn't

Then I must be misunderstanding somewhere. Here, let me go back a little and look at this:

&gt; they cease to function as representations of the world and the like.

I don't think you'd assert that computers have ""ideas"" but we can put signals through them to produce 3d models on a screen. This is clearly some form of representation of the world, though I don't think the computer has any intentional content. Am I running afoul here?

&gt; I think determining what color I'm 'actually' seeing through intersubjective means to any degree of objective certainty is trickier than you think.

This may be tangential, but we understand a lot about light. Someone managed to make glasses that can correct colorblindness, which, if this statement was true, would be impossible, as they'd have to have seen from both the perspective of a colorblind person, and a non color blind person.

&gt; It doesn't literally become my experience once it clears a certain accuracy thresh-hold

Even at 100% accuracy? Why not?

&gt; Not all consistent ideas are true, though.

I never said they were, but your question was ""What does a problem for physicalism look like if physicalism is always assumed to be true from go?"". I gave a perfectly valid response that even shows that it's not impossible to disprove something if you assume it in the first place.

&gt; I mean premise 5 seems like a fairly direct contradiction of the reductive physicalism your pushing.

Does it? Illusions don't seem to cause a problem for me. If I can explain exactly what the bug in a program is doing, that doesn't mean it's now fixed, or even that I know how to fix it. I'm having this exact issue right now while working on an exercise for a class. As I explained above, the brain learns by subtly rewiring itself. If the corrections people give you don't trigger the required rewiring to actually make you perceive it differently, then you won't perceive it differently.

&gt; If questions about experience in itself cross-cut question about literal states of affairs or beliefs about literal states of affairs

I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble parsing this line. I don't quite understand what it means.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-06 19:28:35 :

&gt; I dunno when I insisted that. But I was probably wrong when I did.

Here's the quote:

&gt; That is to say, there is nothing fundamentally different about the blue and the hunger, so moving the hunger doesn't really make sense. If it moves, it stops being hunger, because the arrangement has changed.

It was about 6 messages back, so it might not have been important.

&gt; I mean, I suppose you can do this. I just don't know why you would, I don't really know what benefit you'd get out of it.

Rhetorically, I think it is a very strange thing to say. Outside the context of a high philosophical conversation, someone would probably be very confused by this kind of talk. They might even correct us or ask us to clarifying, assuming we were confused. I think this implies we've strayed off topic by talking about ideas as physical objects.

In reality, it is just a trivial truth. I'm not a neurologist so one fact isn't going to do much for my overall understanding.

&gt; Ok, sure. Our brain develops as a complex machine for processing inputs. It is able to mold itself in subtle ways to change how it will process future inputs... By living (processing inputs) in our world, our brain is shaped in such a way that common signals get assigned with certain responses, be it something external, like picking up food when hungry, or internal, like setting of some thoughts when you hear the word ""red"".

1. Before I say why I disagree, I got to say this is a pretty solid physicalist response. If soft physicalism is true, then appealing to causal relations to explain intentional relations is a natural way to establish a real connection between the world and ideas. This connects ideas to external phenomena, avoiding epiphenomena. It also establishes a natural mechanism for interaction between mind and body, avoiding parallelism.

2. Unfortunately, I have an objections. The brain does have inputs and outputs, but they aren't intentionally charged before they are processed through conscious understanding, presumably. Either intentional qualities, like taste, love, hate, colors, etc., only exist through interaction the conscious intentions or exist within the objects we perceive in a robust or substantial way.

Given that you don't want to defend the second option, This seems to neuter your account of intentionality. We take in inputs, which have an impression in our deep memory, which in turn effects future outputs. This seems like a fairly accurate account of general behavior, but isn't fine-grained enough to account for intentional relationships.

Take observing an apple as an example. Apples are discreet notions, (some apples are red, apples grow on tree, etc). All our inputs involving apples are indistinct, though. The particular impression made by experiencing an apple is a function of the apple plus all the background noise plus the previous state of the brain. This may be an adequate account of the causal connections, but it isn't fine grained enough.

&gt;I don't think it is. From what I've read from you, it seems to be a tool for evaluating the truth of one theory: physicalism.

That might be my bias seeping through, then. My main intention is to was to address theories of mind in general. In the end, there is even a physicalist position left standing. It's just an eliminativist position, rather than one that seeks to literally reduce ideas to physical things.

&gt;Because physicalism is the subject! If you're trying to disprove physicalism, but your argument shows no contradictions in the face of physicalism, what's the point?

Physicalism is a subject. I've mainly focused on that, because that what interests the people who reply on Reddit. That is typically how these questions break on here.

&gt; So you feel your arguments in premises 5-7 provide evidence against physicalism? Is that correct?

In combination with 1 and 2, yes. It isn't the final word clearly, but the argument implies non-physicalism or eliminativism.

&gt;&gt; Note that the question isn't, ""What are the causes of our experiences and the appearance of intentionality in the world?"" Obviously, the answer is the same for the physicalist and non-physicalist: ordinary objects that we encounter through the senses. The question is, ""What are our experiences; What is intentionality as we know it?"" Even an eliminativist would appeal to the input reply for the first question.

&gt; Then I must be misunderstanding somewhere. Here, let me go back a little and look at this: ""(T)hey cease to function as representations of the world and the like.""
I don't think you'd assert that computers have ""ideas"" but we can put signals through them to produce 3d models on a screen. This is clearly some form of representation of the world, though I don't think the computer has any intentional content. Am I running afoul here?

There is an ambiguity here. It is the same way that our ideas can be about Robinson Crusoe and the book is about Robinson Crusoe, but the book is clearly the source of the ideas and not identical with them. The computer is a human tool which we use to display information that is sensible to us. We put the intentionality in the computer. The problem is no one put intentionality in us, presumably.

&gt;This may be tangential, but we understand a lot about light. Someone managed to make glasses that can correct colorblindness, which, if this statement was true, would be impossible, as they'd have to have seen from both the perspective of a colorblind person, and a non color blind person.

I was thinking of some particular cases within finite numbers of people and certain starting conditions. It was just a tangent. The correcting glasses thing is cool, though.

&gt; Even at 100% accuracy? Why not?

Well, if you set my clone next to me, I would be the one thinking to the left of my clone and he would be the one thinking to the right of the original. We would be separate tokens.

&gt;I never said they were, but your question was ""What does a problem for physicalism look like if physicalism is always assumed to be true from go?"". I gave a perfectly valid response that even shows that it's not impossible to disprove something if you assume it in the first place.

I'll give you points for sophism, but I think you see my point. You can't say you've held an idea to adequate scrutiny, if you never seriously considered what it would be like for it to be false.

&gt;&gt; I mean premise 5 seems like a fairly direct contradiction of the reductive physicalism your pushing. If questions about experience in itself cross-cut question about literal states of affairs or beliefs about literal states of affairs, then physicalism would be ill-equipt to model experience.

The question is, ""What is experience?"" If it is just a matter of modeling actual states of affairs as information comes to us, then it should be incoherent to say, ""I knowingly experienced a falsehood/misrepresentation."" Note this isn't just a matter of the brain being slow to catch up. We taken the information to represent one thing but signify another.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-07 19:41:04 :

&gt; It was about 6 messages back, so it might not have been important.

Ah I see. Basically, I said they were in motion now, but not then because the idea could be given a position, but the thoughts in your head are always in flux, they're never really constant over time. That's why I've now said they are in motion. I think I just did a terrible job explaining that, but don't know how to fix it, so questions welcome.

&gt; Rhetorically, I think it is a very strange thing to say.

I said this because, to me, it seemed like asking what the metal composition of a stop sign is when trying to determine it's meaning. Sure, the composition may matter in certain circumstances, but it's not really relevant to it's meaning.

&gt; Either intentional qualities, like taste, love, hate, colors, etc., only exist through interaction the conscious intentions or exist within the objects we perceive in a robust or substantial way.

Well, for starters, things like taste and color do exist within the objects we perceive. As the chemicals that make up objects interact with our taste buds (in complex ways I don't quite understand, but I imagine the taste buds have bonding points that only allow certain chemicals to attach, and when they do it triggers a response), they produce inputs. The cones in our eyes perceive wavelengths of light, and most objects reflect some parts of light and absorb other parts, so when hit with white light (like that from the sun), they only reflect certain wavelengths. The wavelengths that are reflected are the colors we perceive them to be.

Now, about ""love and hate"". Are these intentional properties? At the very least, are they intentional properties in the same way that color and taste are? I'd expect I can explain why you might come to like something, or not like something, within the framework of physicalism, but I'm not certain that's what you'd wish for me to get at.

&gt; All our inputs involving apples are indistinct, though.

I'm not certain what this means.

&gt; This may be an adequate account of the causal connections, but it isn't fine grained enough.

I also don't know what you mean by it's not ""fine grained enough"".

&gt; The problem is no one put intentionality in us, presumably.

I have to admit, I get very confused by this ""intentionality"" concept. I don't really understand it. I'm trying to figure this out, but for the life of me, I don't understand.

 &gt; Well, if you set my clone next to me, I would be the one thinking to the left of my clone and he would be the one thinking to the right of the original. We would be separate tokens.

Ok, but what if we, say, dial both of you into the matrix? You are completely unaware of your literal position (or anything else around you) in the world, only your position and environment within the matrix. Upon dialing you both in, we make you in the exact same position and situation. Now the fact that he may be to your left isn't a factor.

&gt; You can't say you've held an idea to adequate scrutiny, if you never seriously considered what it would be like for it to be false.

Sure, but at the same time, I don't think it's necessary to consider what it would be like for it to be false, for it to be shown to be false. 

Actually, this is somewhat tangential, somewhat related, but it's something I just thought of. Physicalism is kind of a soft-unfalsifiable. By which I mean, it can't be shown to be false by anything we can observe. This lies mostly in the fact that ""physical things"" isn't really very well defined. Simply put, if we find that something other than ""physical things"" are working in our brains to produce our consciousness, then we will expand ""physical things"" to encompass this new thing. We've done this before, pretty much every time a new discovery was made. I thought about this after remembering [this](https://youtu.be/nQHBAdShgYI?t=52s), mainly the line ""After all, if it can't be measured, it can't affect anything."" This implies the contrapositive ""If it can affect something, it can be measured."" And generally, scientists will count it as part of the physical world if it can be measured. So therefore, nothing we can observe in any capacity could be used as evidence against physicalism. 

I don't know if this is a problem or not. After all, physicalism isn't *really* unfalsifiable, it just is under the banner of things we can observe. I don't know if that makes it any better though.

&gt; If it is just a matter of modeling actual states of affairs as information comes to us, then it should be incoherent to say, ""I knowingly experienced a falsehood/misrepresentation.""

Why would that be the case? You don't know whether you've experienced a falsehood unless other information tells you you have, so you simply make this statement if later information contradicts earlier information.

&gt; We taken the information to represent one thing but signify another.

I don't quite understand what you mean by this. Could you give an example? I think that might help.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-07 23:57:17 :

&gt; I said this because, to me, it seemed like asking what the metal composition of a stop sign is when trying to determine it's meaning. Sure, the composition may matter in certain circumstances, but it's not really relevant to it's meaning.

&gt; Well, for starters, things like taste and color do exist within the objects we perceive. As the chemicals that make up objects interact with our taste buds (in complex ways I don't quite understand, but I imagine the taste buds have bonding points that only allow certain chemicals to attach, and when they do it triggers a response), they produce inputs. The cones in our eyes perceive wavelengths of light, and most objects reflect some parts of light and absorb other parts, so when hit with white light (like that from the sun), they only reflect certain wavelengths. The wavelengths that are reflected are the colors we perceive them to be.

The problem with both of those definitions is the lack of constant conjuncture. There are cases where a given wavelength appears to be a different color, as in optical illusions. There are also cases where a given wavelength produces divergent divergent experiences, as when we compare color-blind experience to color-sighted experience.

For a simple case, we can consider that fruit that causes spur things to taste sweet. If the experience of 'sour' just was the detection of a certain molecules, then those particular molecules should never register as not-sour experiences.

&gt; Now, about ""love and hate"". Are these intentional properties? At the very least, are they intentional properties in the same way that color and taste are? I'd expect I can explain why you might come to like something, or not like something, within the framework of physicalism, but I'm not certain that's what you'd wish for me to get at.

If people can have vivid preferences and you believe people can be described completely in physics terms, the you have to explain vivid preferences in physical terms.

&gt;&gt; Apples are discreet notions, (some apples are red, apples grow on tree, etc). All our inputs involving apples are indistinct, though. The particular impression made by experiencing an apple is a function of the apple plus all the background noise plus the previous state of the brain. This may be an adequate account of the causal connections, but it isn't fine grained enough.

&gt; I'm not certain what this means.

It means our ideas about apples are specific to the apples we experience. Our idea of apples is the product of multiple abstractions. The source we abstract from is indifferent to our particular ideas. There is no line in the book of nature that mentions our notion of apple apart from us. We don't import anything wholesale from the essence of any particular apple.

&gt; I have to admit, I get very confused by this ""intentionality"" concept. I don't really understand it. I'm trying to figure this out, but for the life of me, I don't understand.

I don't think I'm helping at this point. You might want to check out the SEP [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/).

&gt; Ok, but what if we, say, dial both of you into the matrix? You are completely unaware of your literal position (or anything else around you) in the world, only your position and environment within the matrix. Upon dialing you both in, we make you in the exact same position and situation. Now the fact that he may be to your left isn't a factor.

Do you think this is possible? Couldn't I just say the origins and the clone went to sleep while a third AI was created at any rate?

&gt; I don't know if this is a problem or not. After all, physicalism isn't really unfalsifiable, it just is under the banner of things we can observe. I don't know if that makes it any better though.

It seems like you hit the nail on the head. If something can't be confirmed or falsified by observation, then it is an unobservable. If physicalism is unobservable, then it is dogma according to its own standards.

&gt; Why would that be the case? You don't know whether you've experienced a falsehood unless other information tells you you have, so you simply make this statement if later information contradicts earlier information.

Sure, but unlike other cases, illusion presents both states of mind simultaneously. We don't update our model here. There is a shift in the meaning of the same representation. The misrepresentation remains but its significance changes.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-08 01:54:10 :

&gt; Do you think ideas are more like the meaning of the sign or the signs composition?

I honestly don't know. That was meant as an example of something with irrelevant quantities than any sort of analogy for ideas. But I suppose if I had to give an answer, I'd say the term ""idea"" generally refers to something closer to the meaning, even if ultimately it is referring to some sort of collection of atoms. If that makes sense.

&gt; There are cases where a given wavelength appears to be a different color, as in optical illusions.

Except you have to remember that all of these observations must go through a brain. While both the dark square and the light square in that illusion (I assume [this](http://web.mit.edu/persci/people/adelson/images/checkershadow/checkershadow_illusion4med.jpg) is the illusion you meant, or something similar) register the same rods and cones in your mind, your pattern recognizing brain knows things like shadows exist, and tells you that one must be darker because of it.

Similarly, you can see things happening where your brain tries to correct out background noise and doesn't realize when that background noise goes away (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbraNFEHkA)) which is similar to how the sour sweet thing works, but with sight.

I mean, all the light that enters your eye actually enters upside down, due to the pinhole of your pupils. Your brain corrects it to be right side up. It also combines 2 separate images from your eyes into one. This sort of correction by your brain from raw inputs is where the capability for illusions come in.

&gt; the you have to explain vivid preferences in physical terms.

Not sure what makes a preference ""vivid"". But preferences are certainly explainable through physical phenomena. Essentially, we've linked certain responses to certain neurotransmitters. For example, dopamine being released tends to correlate to ""happy"" type responses. So this means that you've essentially learned that the things you like should trigger a release of dopamine in your mind. I'm sure it's more complex than that, but that's the general idea.

&gt; We don't import anything wholesale from the essence of any particular apple.

Well, yes. Our brains find patterns. Basically, our knowledge (and impression I suppose) of apples is gathered from the similarities of all of our experiences with apples. In fact, this is something that happens with the ""artificial brains"" we create (that's not a technical term, but it is the idea). They're called neural networks, and they're very good at pattern recognition, though not as good as our brains. If you give a neural network a bunch (we're talking hundreds, which is why I say they aren't as good) of pictures of apples, it will be able to tell you what is and isn't an apple from other pictures.

&gt; Do you think this is possible?

I don't see why not. I mean, not *now*, but I don't see why not in the future.

&gt; Couldn't I just say the origins and the clone went to sleep while a third AI was created at any rate?

I don't think so. The original and the clone are in control of their actions, as those in the matrix are.

Regardless, my point with this was this: You say no one can ever have your experience, but what if we were able to record your brain states super accurately during some arbitrary experience, and then we could rewire someone's brain to be like yours, then input the same inputs as you had during that experience, could they not then have your same experience?

&gt; If something can't be confirmed or falsified by observation, then it is an unobservable.

This seems like a very odd use of the word ""unobservable"". I think the one I used: ""unfalsifiable"" is a better fit.

&gt; it is dogma according to its own standards.

Yes. Though, I have to add, this may not be a problem. I had to look up the definition of dogma, just to make sure I knew what it meant, and it said: ""a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."" But I think half of my point was that this is kind of the point. We build physicalism (or at least science) as a set of those things that are ""incontrovertibly true"", and when we find something that is ""incontrovertibly true"" we add it to physicalism. So dogma it may be, but it's an informed dogma, and dogma isn't necessarily wrong.

&gt; There is a shift in the meaning of the same representation.

Yes. Over time. Not simultaneously. Remember how I said that the brain can rewire itself subtly? I'd expect that these subtle rewirings, as well as the constantly changing state of potentials in neurons (what we call thoughts), in your brain, are responsible for this. The same input is not actually the same input when we actually produce outputs based on inputs and prior inputs. Because of this, if you've been looking at the illusion for 1 second, that's different than if you've been looking at it for 2, or even 1.00000000000000000000000001 seconds.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-08 21:53:21 :

It also combines 2 separate images from your eyes into one. This sort of correction by your brain from raw inputs is where the capability for illusions come in.

Sure, but what does that tell us about what ideas are? Presumably, if sensible qualities are external properties that we passively receive, then all the effort the brain spends actively constructing our ideas is unnecessary. For example, if color is an external quality that we perceive fully within an object, then my brain doesn't need to flip any images, fix any continuity errors, etc. It would be enough to detect the external information and register an output without causing the particular experience we know as color, because the phenomena of color is purely external.

So, why do these brain tricks exist? They are either necessary or unnecessary. If they are necessary, then it is presumably because something determines whether or how a given experience exists. This is the task of psychology, (how psychology relates to other sciences is another question). If these tricks are unnecessary, or accidental, then nothing determines how or whether a given experience exists. Experiences are either pure one-off accidents or not rationally accountable non-sense or something like that.

Along one axis is the question of whether conscious experience is a determinable or indeterminable phenomena. Along the other is the question of whether experience as we know it has explanatory authority. If it does, then we need to tailor our account towards authenticity in some way; if it doesn't, then our accounts can be totally alienating.

All together, this leaves us with 4 possible approaches: a formal science that is tailored toward phenomenology, a formal science that seeks to fully reduce subject to object, loosely connect system of misrepresentations, or an unorganized body of facts about experience as we find it.

&gt; Not sure what makes a preference ""vivid"". But preferences are certainly explainable through physical phenomena. Essentially, we've linked certain responses to certain neurotransmitters. For example, dopamine being released tends to correlate to ""happy"" type responses. So this means that you've essentially learned that the things you like should trigger a release of dopamine in your mind. I'm sure it's more complex than that, but that's the general idea.

That is such a sketchy picture, though. I don't think a weak generalization is enough to completely characterize a complex phenomena like the human will. In this case, I don't think anyone knows enough to fill out the case completely, not even experts.

It would be unfair to hold you to an experts standard, though. Let's just look at one component of love and hate: the disgust part. We are repulsed by things we find disgusting and pulled in by the things we find attractive. Explaining this compulsion for or against something, not the frequency or likelihood of certain behaviors, is the challenge I was mostly harping on.

&gt;Well, yes. Our brains find patterns. Basically, our knowledge (and impression I suppose) of apples is gathered from the similarities of all of our experiences with apples. In fact, this is something that happens with the ""artificial brains"" we create (that's not a technical term, but it is the idea). They're called neural networks, and they're very good at pattern recognition, though not as good as our brains. If you give a neural network a bunch (we're talking hundreds, which is why I say they aren't as good) of pictures of apples, it will be able to tell you what is and isn't an apple from other pictures.

So, how exactly do neural nets do this task? Is it plausible to model human cognition the same way?

&gt; Regardless, my point with this was this: You say no one can ever have your experience, but what if we were able to record your brain states super accurately during some arbitrary experience, and then we could rewire someone's brain to be like yours, then input the same inputs as you had during that experience, could they not then have your same experience?

Same type, but not the same token. Token experiences happen to particular perspectives and particular observers. 

&gt;This seems like a very odd use of the word ""unobservable"". I think the one I used: ""unfalsifiable"" is a better fit.

What's the difference? If something is unfalsifiable, doesn't that imply that no observation can confirm or deny it; if something is unobservable, doesn't that imply that there is no direct means to falsify it?

&gt;Yes. Though, I have to add, this may not be a problem. I had to look up the definition of dogma, just to make sure I knew what it meant, and it said: ""a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true."" But I think half of my point was that this is kind of the point. We build physicalism (or at least science) as a set of those things that are ""incontrovertibly true"", and when we find something that is ""incontrovertibly true"" we add it to physicalism. So dogma it may be, but it's an informed dogma, and dogma isn't necessarily wrong.

What is your point here? You assume you are right, and often confirm you bias through a selective interpretation of new information: What does this add to the conversation? From an outside perspective, you seem like a missionary pointing to your catechism as evidence for your faith.

&gt;Yes. Over time. Not simultaneously. Remember how I said that the brain can rewire itself subtly? I'd expect that these subtle rewirings, as well as the constantly changing state of potentials in neurons (what we call thoughts), in your brain, are responsible for this. The same input is not actually the same input when we actually produce outputs based on inputs and prior inputs. Because of this, if you've been looking at the illusion for 1 second, that's different than if you've been looking at it for 2, or even 1.00000000000000000000000001 seconds.

Doesn't this imply no one else can have my experiences, since they only last for an instant? Doesn't this also imply it is impossible to think about the same thing over any duration?

awenonian @ 2016-11-09 03:37:17 :

&gt; Sure, but what does that tell us about what ideas are?

Ok, I think I see what you're saying. Ideas are our brains way of making sense of these inputs. combining them, or aggregating them, or whatever. But the source of these ideas are the raw inputs. 

Certain organisms have primitive ""brains"" that do end up simply as a linking of an input to an output of some sort, I believe flatworms are the example I'm thinking of. However, we have more complex brains that do some sort of processing, and/or combining, and/or otherwise ""mish-mashing"" the inputs that came in before pushing them to the output stage. This ""mish-mashing"" is what we refer to as ""ideas"" or ""thoughts""

&gt; I don't think a weak generalization is enough to completely characterize a complex phenomena like the human will.

I shouldn't think so either. But this is the best explanation *I* have. I'm sure an experts would be better, but I'd still expect it to be incomplete. Though this is because humanity has only been around so long, and has only been studying the brain so long, so our understanding is not complete.

&gt; Explaining this compulsion for or against something

Sure, this would happen because you've either learned that such a thing is dangerous, or beneficial, or it was hardwired into the starting wiring of your brain. For example, it was beneficial for our ancestors to be repulsed by fecal matter, because it could contain disease. Those whose brains had this repulsion were more likely to survive, so it became part of our initial brain development, what we call instinct. Certainly there's the possibility of an initial brain setup causing the same sort of repulsion for other things that may or may not be directly relevant to survival (or sexual selection or the like), by chance or something. And similarly, we could have such repulsion be learned behavior.

&gt; So, how exactly do neural nets do this task? Is it plausible to model human cognition the same way?

Neural nets are a complex thing, which I'll try to explain in simple terms, but they were generally developed as a machine learning solution, modeled after how a human brain works, so I would expect so. Essentially, the way a neural net works is it's built up of things called ""perceptrons"" which are like neurons. They have inputs and produce outputs. Because it's a computer, all of this is numbers, and essentially, each input gets a weight, which determines how much it affects the output. Each perceptron has some sort of ""activation function"" which says when it produces what outputs (this is where a lot of the complexity is, and is something I don't quite understand). A neural net is then built of several layers of these perceptrons, with one layer feeding its outputs into the inputs of the next layer. The net is trained by being given input, and told the correct output, which it then uses to update the weight of all its inputs. This is like a brain rewiring by making some connections between neurons stronger, and some weaker.

[Here](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/)'s a rather in depth look, but I think the most useful thing to you as, presumably, someone who isn't going to build these networks, is at the very bottom, where there's an animation of what a neural network might look like.

&gt; Token experiences happen to particular perspectives and particular observers.

Is this not the same sort of assuming your position you accused me of? You've assumed that there are certain things about our experience that could never ever be replicated, right?

&gt; if something is unobservable, doesn't that imply that there is no direct means to falsify it?

Ultimately, this is just a semantics point, but to me, unobservable means ""can't be observed"" not ""can't be disproven through observation."" And, yes, I'd probably concede that anything that can't be observed can't be disproven through observation, but I'd use unobservable when talking about ""things"" like God, or an invisible intangible ball, and not when talking about ""ideas"" like physicalism or feminism or something.

&gt; What is your point here?

To be completely honest, I'm not sure. I think for a while I've just been talking. But I suppose my point is that I'm not sure what the alternatives to physicalism are. Anything that asserts that there is some non-physical quantity that can affect the world seems off to me, because if it can affect the world we'd call it a physical quantity. If it can't affect the world, I don't know why we'd talk about it, since it has literally no effect. I mean, I did kind of say before this kind of makes physicalism something like the idea that ""true things are true"", but even if such a statement is dumb, it's not wrong.

&gt; Doesn't this imply no one else can have my experiences, since they only last for an instant? 

Not if your brain state at that exact instant could be recreated in some manner. Sure, they'd only have your experience for an instant (assuming we didn't control inputs through some matrix like contraption), but it would still be your experience.

&gt; Doesn't this also imply it is impossible to think about the same thing over any duration?

I suppose it does. Is that wrong? And I don't mean thinking the same thing like ""thinking about the President's tax plan"", I mean literally the same thing, like, your ideas don't progress, or change at all. Are your ideas not consistently in flux? Is that not what we call consciousness?

&gt; But this is the best explanation I have. I'm sure an experts would be better, but I'd still expect it to be incomplete. Though this is because humanity has only been around so long, and has only been studying the brain so long, so our understanding is not complete.

I would like to mote that, if this were any other subject, this would probably make you uncomfortable. Just because something is our best effort doesn't imply I is more likely to be right in the end. If reductive physicalism simply lacks support or evidence, I don't see why you are so adamant about it.

&gt;&gt; Let's just look at one component of love and hate: the disgust part. We are repulsed by things we find disgusting and pulled in by the things we find attractive. Explaining this compulsion for or against something, not the frequency or likelihood of certain behaviors, is the challenge I was mostly harping on.

&gt; Sure, this would happen because you've either learned that such a thing is dangerous, or beneficial, or it was hardwired into the starting wiring of your brain. For example, it was beneficial for our ancestors to be repulsed by fecal matter, because it could contain disease.

Certainly there's the possibility of an initial brain setup causing the same sort of repulsion for other things that may or may not be directly relevant to survival (or sexual selection or the like), by chance or something. And similarly, we could have such repulsion be learned behavior.

1. This only covers some kinds of disgust or attraction, and incompletely at that. Again, I don't expect you to be an expert, but we are looking for what disgust essentially is, not what it is sometimes.

2. This is definitely an account of why disgust is more likely: what the selective pressures are. I'm particularly interested with what disgust really is in the first place.

&gt; Is this not the same sort of assuming your position you accused me of? You've assumed that there are certain things about our experience that could never ever be replicated, right?

I think we drove towards this position together trough discussion, so I don't think it is just a matter of making convenient assumptions. Outside the context of this argument, you even seem to agree with me! Moreover, you are straight-up assuming your logical conclusion. If I am making an assumption, it is at least distinct from my conclusion.

&gt; And, yes, I'd probably concede that anything that can't be observed can't be disproven through observation, but...

I can't seriously think you are acting in good faith at this point. You are clearly just disagreeing to disagree, since you are fighting even where you would normal agree with me.

&gt; I suppose my point is that I'm not sure what the alternatives to physicalism are. Anything that asserts that there is some non-physical quantity that can affect the world seems off to me, because if it can affect the world we'd call it a physical quantity.

We could interpret cause in a more inclusive way. There probably isn't anything that violate causal closure, but that doesn't stop is from interpreting single events from the perspective of multiple kinds of causes. For a non-mind related example, look at having mass X vs being massive. There are some questions that work best when answered specifically, (""Why did this fall in x way in particular?""), while there are others that work better from a general perspective, (""Why do things fall out all in the first place?"").

&gt; If it can't affect the world, I don't know why we'd talk about it, since it has literally no effect.

I mean remember what we are talking about in the first place: your most intimate and personal experience. Even if epiphenomenalism was true, I'd still be interested in my personal experiences. I'm definitely stuck with them either way.

&gt; Not if your brain state at that exact instant could be recreated in some manner. Sure, they'd only have your experience for an instant (assuming we didn't control inputs through some matrix like contraption), but it would still be your experience.

If I eat your bag lunch and replace it with an identical recreation, are we going to eat a replacement lunch or the exact same lunch you packed that morning?

&gt; I suppose it does. Is that wrong? And I don't mean thinking the same thing like ""thinking about the President's tax plan"", I mean literally the same thing...

How are you making this distinction? I thought we were talking about ""thinking about..."" this entire time.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-09 18:53:09 :

&gt; If reductive physicalism simply lacks support or evidence, I don't see why you are so adamant about it.

Does anything else have better support or evidence? Expecting complete support and evidence is as irrational as expecting infinite knowledge. Sure, it can be a fine goal, but don't set conditions on what you'll do when it's achieved, because it won't ever be achieved.

&gt; I'm particularly interested with what disgust really is in the first place.

What do you mean? Like, ""disgust is an aversion to a certain action""? Or what?

&gt; Moreover, you are straight-up assuming your logical conclusion

I still don't think this is my conclusion. I got into this discussion to debate your statement, which was not ""physicalism is false"" but instead ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness is a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience"".

&gt; You are clearly just disagreeing to disagree, since you are fighting even where you would normal agree with me.

You're probably right. I think I tend to get caught up doing that. Sorry.

&gt; We could interpret cause in a more inclusive way. There probably isn't anything that violate causal closure, but that doesn't stop is from interpreting single events from the perspective of multiple kinds of causes.

Are you saying physicalism doesn't take into account that there are multiple causes of events?

&gt; There are some questions that work best when answered specifically, (""Why did this fall in x way in particular?""), while there are others that work better from a general perspective, (""Why do things fall out all in the first place?"").

Are these examples of questions ""working better"" or of just different questions? It seems like the latter to me.

&gt; your most intimate and personal experience.

Yes, which clearly affects the world. Because, if nothing else, it affects your actions, and you are part of the world. I'm not sure what your point is here.

&gt; If I eat your bag lunch and replace it with an identical recreation, are we going to eat a replacement lunch or the exact same lunch you packed that morning?

I'm not sure what the point in making a distinction is if there is no difference.

&gt; How are you making this distinction? I thought we were talking about ""thinking about..."" this entire time.

We were, but my response was spawned from you saying that you could never keep thinking about the same thing for any length of time, which spawned from me saying that looking at an illusion for 1 second is different from looking at it for 1.000000000001 seconds. Saying that that implies that you couldn't stay on a topic for any length of time is like saying you couldn't look at an object for any length of time. My point is that, even if you're on the same topic, your actual thoughts are different from time = 0 to time = 1 and every space in between.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-11 16:33:03 :

&gt; That is such a sketchy picture, though. I don't think a weak generalization is enough to completely characterize a complex phenomena like the human will.

&gt; If reductive physicalism simply lacks support or evidence, I don't see why you are so adamant about it.

&gt; Does anything else have better support or evidence?

That's the question, I guess. What do you think would be the best ways of answering the question of which theories have the most support?

&gt; Expecting complete support and evidence is as irrational as expecting infinite knowledge. Sure, it can be a fine goal, but don't set conditions on what you'll do when it's achieved, because it won't ever be achieved.

I don't need complete information. I just need it to be clear about what's going on; it needs to be evident.

&gt;&gt; I'm particularly interested with what disgust really is in the first place.

&gt; What do you mean? Like, ""disgust is an aversion to a certain action""? Or what?

Yeah! You can give me a dictionary definition of the word 'disgust', and you would be closer to the idea. We are looking for the essential conditions of consciousness: the thing that consciousness is in all instances. Unfortunately, a dictionary definition is the essential definition of the word, not the thing it represents.

&gt; I still don't think this is my conclusion. I got into this discussion to debate your statement, which was not ""physicalism is false"" but instead ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness is a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience"".

You're right that this isn't ultimately about physicalism. However, there have been explict points during this conversation when I asked you to justify the premise, ""Physicalism is true"", and you balked, saying you were free to assume what you liked.

&gt; You're probably right. I think I tend to get caught up doing that. Sorry.

No worries! Does this change your views?

&gt; Are you saying physicalism doesn't take into account that there are multiple causes of events?

That's tough. On one hand, I agree it doesn't seem strictly necessary as long as all the things or kinds of things are physical. On the other hand, introducing causal closure and a likely scientific assumption, determinism, does lead to this view.

If every state of affairs is determined by the previous state of affairs and no two causal chains interact, then there is only one determining factor in every state of affairs and exactly one determinate effect.

&gt; Are these examples of questions ""working better"" or of just different questions? It seems like the latter to me.

You can put it however you like as long as you catch my drift.

&gt; Yes, which clearly affects the world. Because, if nothing else, it affects your actions, and you are part of the world. I'm not sure what your point is here.

If eliminativism is true, which I'd argue is the only option given physicalism, then your experiences wouldn't necessarily affect your actions. You behavior would be totally determined by physical events. If actions just are behavior, then experiences don't cause actions. Rather, physical, unconscious events cause actions.

&gt; I'm not sure what the point in making a distinction is if there is no difference.

They are indistinguishable, but don't share the same history. One was made by you, and one was made by me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And I don't mean thinking the same thing like ""thinking about the President's tax plan"", I mean literally the same thing...

&gt;&gt; How are you making this distinction? I thought we were talking about ""thinking about..."" this entire time.

&gt; My point is that, even if you're on the same topic, your actual thoughts are different from time = 0 to time = 1 and every space in between.

How do you determine what a topic is from a physical account of what a thought is? If you are defining topics with heuristics aimed towards educating people about science and math, then you are smuggling subjective, perspective-relative reasoning in. These accounts appeal to working metaphors and community assumptions to ease the transition of practical information from teacher to student. They therefore depend on teachers and students.

If you want to come up with a physicalist approach to topics, you need to reduce intentional concepts, like perspective and learning, to physical states of affairs or give up on individual thoughts being about general topics.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-11 17:52:08 :

&gt; What do you think would be the best ways of answering the question of which theories have the most support?

Well, I'm not particularly educated on what theories there are, so I don't know. I mean, you can't really quantify evidence very easily: How many ""points"" is one observation worth relative to another? I expect the reality will be anything that hasn't been disproven is fair game, and you'd have to bring in razors to narrow it down past that. I don't really know.

I suppose the reason I'm so adamant about physicalism is the explanation I gave before. I can't imagine a world where physicalism isn't true, because to me that's like imagining a world where truth isn't true. Everything that happens in the world is physical, because we define physical by things that happen in the world. I mean, if we later found out that some magical force is responsible for giving us consciousness, we'd just say ""There's a pervasive ""consciousness field"" that all conscious beings draw from to make decisions"" and get to work explaining this consciousness field. Magic, in the real world, is called science. I understand that's a bit tautological, and so maybe it's not actually what ""physicalism"" is. I don't really know.

&gt;Unfortunately, a dictionary definition is the essential definition of the word, not the thing it represents.

Well, disgust as an aversion is a behavior. And I think I've given explanations for behavior, they're either learned, or instinctual (you're born with them), both of which I've given a physical explanation for.

&gt; I asked you to justify the premise, ""Physicalism is true"", and you balked, saying you were free to assume what you liked.

You're right, see above for why I believe this. I'd like to be open to believing non-physical claims, but I honestly just can't imagine it, at least not in my current state.

&gt; No worries! Does this change your views?

Not really, I think, it was a semantic point after all. We were just arguing on what words to use for things, right?

&gt; On the other hand, introducing causal closure and a likely scientific assumption, determinism, does lead to this view.

This view that physicalism doesn't take into account multiple causes? Or another view? Also, this may be tangential, but I think since quantum mechanics started being studied, determinism is no longer a scientific assumption. It seems God does in fact play with dice.

&gt; If every state of affairs is determined by the previous state of affairs and no two causal chains interact, then there is only one determining factor in every state of affairs and exactly one determinate effect.

So, yeah, this is how I think of it when you take the entire universe into account. When you examine a small subset of the universe, to see how it behaves, there can be ""multiple causes"" in a way. This is done in physics classes, when you calculate the ""net force"" there are multiple forces acting on an object (which I believe would be multiple causes? But at the same time, could be taken as the single cause of ""the previous state of affairs""), and they produce a single affect, an acceleration due to the ""net force""

&gt; (""Why did this fall in x way in particular?""), while there are others that work better from a general perspective, (""Why do things fall out all in the first place?"").

&gt; You can put it however you like as long as you catch my drift.

I'm not sure I do though. I mean, wouldn't the answer to both of those questions be the same? Explaining why gravity makes things fall would explain why gravity made something fall, right?

&gt; your experiences wouldn't necessarily affect your actions. You behavior would be totally determined by physical events.

If experiences are physical events, these are not mutually exclusive.

&gt; One was made by you, and one was made by me.

Is this a meaningful difference? Or a difference you've assigned meaning so you can hold onto the distinction?

&gt; How do you determine what a topic is from a physical account of what a thought is?

Thoughts under the same topics will fire neurons in similar ways. You remain on the same topic while the current firing of your neurons is part of a continuous pattern. Eventually, many of these neurons will reach paths where they diverge. This is the end of the pattern. Sure, there's no easy point where you can say ""Hey this is exactly when we changed topics"" but I don't think you can do that in conversation either, as one topic generally seamlessly transitions into the next.

&gt; you need to reduce intentional concepts, like perspective and learning, to physical states of affairs

I've done the learning side of that before, haven't I? Subtle rewiring of the brain. Perspective is simply different inputs being put into different wirings of brains.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-11 20:19:55 :

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is a problem or not. After all, physicalism isn't really unfalsifiable, it just is under the banner of things we can observe. I don't know if that makes it any better though.

&gt;&gt; It seems like you hit the nail on the head. If something can't be confirmed or falsified by observation, then it is an unobservable. If physicalism is unobservable, then it is dogma according to its own standards.

&gt; Not really, I think, it was a semantic point after all. We were just arguing on what words to use for things, right?

I thought this was a substantive point, actually. If physicalism is unfalsifiable and unobservable, the it is beyond the pale of science. Science can neither confirm nor deny its validity.

&gt; Well, I'm not particularly educated on what theories there are, so I don't know. I mean, you can't really quantify evidence very easily: How many ""points"" is one observation worth relative to another? I expect the reality will be anything that hasn't been disproven is fair game, and you'd have to bring in razors to narrow it down past that. I don't really know

You should give it some serious thought. I don't think we'll get anywhere, if we don't know where we'd like to go.

&gt; I suppose the reason I'm so adamant about physicalism is the explanation I gave before. I can't imagine a world where physicalism isn't true, because to me that's like imagining a world where truth isn't true. Everything that happens in the world is physical, because we define physical by things that happen in the world... Magic, in the real world, is called science. I understand that's a bit tautological, and so maybe it's not actually what ""physicalism"" is.

You should actually give some thought to what physical means too. If ""physical"" just means ""something that exists in our world"", then people must believe that ghost, Gods, and all kinds of spooky things are physical. That clearly isn't what people believe she they say, ""God exists"".

&gt; Also, this may be tangential, but I think since quantum mechanics started being studied, determinism is no longer a scientific assumption. It seems God does in fact play with dice.

Didn't you dismiss talking about QM earlier?

&gt; So, yeah, this is how I think of it when you take the entire universe into account. When you examine a small subset of the universe, to see how it behaves, there can be ""multiple causes"" in a way. This is done in physics classes, when you calculate the ""net force"" there are multiple forces acting on an object (which I believe would be multiple causes? But at the same time, could be taken as the single cause of ""the previous state of affairs""), and they produce a single affect, an acceleration due to the ""net force""

Didn't you dismiss the prospect of facts ever being relative to subsets of perspectives, individuals, or whatever?

&gt; I'm not sure I do though. I mean, wouldn't the answer to both of those questions be the same? Explaining why gravity makes things fall would explain why gravity made something fall, right?

The question of, 'Why does X object fall at Acceleration A?""is answered by ""It has M mass or is under F force."" The question of, ""Why do things fall?"" is answered by ""Things have mass or are under force.""

&gt; If experiences are physical events, these are not mutually exclusive.

I don't think this suggestion is coherent. Just saying.

&gt; Is this a meaningful difference? Or a difference you've assigned meaning so you can hold onto the distinction?

Sure it is! They don't share a common history. One has existed for longer. One was made last. Their parts are token-distinct, although they are type-similar. It seems meaningful to me.
 
&gt; Thoughts under the same topics will fire neurons in similar ways. You remain on the same topic while the current firing of your neurons is part of a continuous pattern. Eventually, many of these neurons will reach paths where they diverge. This is the end of the pattern. 

What makes groups of patterns similar, without appealing to them being of the same type?

&gt; Sure, there's no easy point where you can say ""Hey this is exactly when we changed topics"" but I don't think you can do that in conversation either, as one topic generally seamlessly transitions into the next.

This is cool by me. I won't take you to task on this.

&gt; I've done the learning side of that before, haven't I? Subtle rewiring of the brain. Perspective is simply different inputs being put into different wirings of brains.

Do you think this is a clear picture of what's going on? If you had to explain to an alien, what learning is on Earth, would this be enough for them to pick a parallel in their culture?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-12 03:29:32 :

&gt; Science can neither confirm nor deny its validity.

Wasn't that actually about using the word ""unobservable"" vs ""unfalsifiable""?

If it wasn't, then I'm still not sure it matters. I mean, science can't prove the universe exists either. But it's an assumption made.

&gt; You should actually give some thought to what physical means too.

I'd say they should tell me why those things aren't physical. I mean, the way I'm using ""physical"" it's like a basal assumption for everything, non-physical things are an exception, so that makes what they say the positive claim.

&gt; Didn't you dismiss talking about QM earlier?

Did I? Maybe. I did say it was a bit tangential, anyway, so I don't think it's terribly important.

&gt; Didn't you dismiss the prospect of facts ever being relative to subsets of perspectives, individuals, or whatever?

Depends on what you mean by relative. In one sense, if I face one way, the force could be to the left, and if I face the other way, it's to the right. But that's just because of how we define left and right. I don't see how this is an example of ""facts being relative to subsets of perspectives"", it's just acknowledging that we don't need to have the entire current state of the universe to start making predictions. But even if we did, we'd be able to address the behavior of every particle based on the effect every other particle has on it. If every other particle is affecting it, I'd call that multiple causes.

&gt; The question of, 'Why does X object fall at Acceleration A?""is answered by ""It has M mass or is under F force."" The question of, ""Why do things fall?"" is answered by ""Things have mass or are under force.""

Well, that's a very undescriptive explanation. I'd say ""Mass produces a force on other masses based on the equation G(m1m2/r^2)"" Which would explain both, you just need to plug in values for one. But it's still the same question.

&gt; I don't think this suggestion is coherent. Just saying.

Why not? Experiences are just the same as thoughts and ideas, they're neurons spurred to fire by various inputs.

&gt; One has existed for longer. One was made last. Their parts are token-distinct, although they are type-similar.

But if they don't affect future events, then are they meaningfully different from your experiences? It seems like saying ""Well, yeah, they aren't my experiences because they're not mine."" But this is circular, isn't it? You've assumed that no one can have your experiences, and then claim that because no one can have your experiences, their experiences must be different, so they aren't your experiences.

&gt; What makes groups of patterns similar, without appealing to them being of the same type?

Propinquity. If the same neurons fire, or neurons that are near, or connected, those are similar patterns.

&gt; If you had to explain to an alien, what learning is on Earth, would this be enough for them to pick a parallel in their culture?

Provided they had a parallel in their culture, and an understanding of the science involved. You may take contention with that last point, after all, if they had knowledge of the science involved, wouldn't that mean I'm not really doing the explaining? But trying to explain something like the intricacies of magnets to someone who's never seen them would run into the same issues, and we know for sure how those work.

&gt; If it wasn't, then I'm still not sure it matters. I mean, science can't prove the universe exists either. But it's an assumption made.

It might not be a necessary assumption. Finding out whether it is a necessary function is an interesting question in its own right. Drawing a line in the sand where you own personal curiosity ends does nothing to add to the conversation.

&gt;I'd say they should tell me why those things aren't physical. I mean, the way I'm using ""physical"" it's like a basal assumption for everything, non-physical things are an exception, so that makes what they say the positive claim.

You shouldn't define things in a way just to shift the burden of proof to the other side. It comes off as sophistry. At any rate, your assumed definition of 'physical' is vacuous. Again, if a priest must believe God is physical insofar as he exists, then your definition of physical is defective.

&gt; Depends on what you mean by relative. In one sense, if I face one way, the force could be to the left, and if I face the other way, it's to the right. But that's just because of how we define left and right. I don't see how this is an example of ""facts being relative to subsets of perspectives"", it's just acknowledging that we don't need to have the entire current state of the universe to start making predictions.

The fact that, ""This is to my left"", is defined relative to me is all the support I need to say ""facts are sometimes relative to perspectives or perceivers."" Do you have an argument that says otherwise?

&gt;Well, that's a very undescriptive explanation. I'd say ""Mass produces a force on other masses based on the equation G(m1m2/r2)"" Which would explain both, you just need to plug in values for one. But it's still the same question.

What if I don't care about specific values, though. What if I want to know how things behave a certain way in general, without appealing to any particular situation.

&gt;Why not? Experiences are just the same as thoughts and ideas, they're neurons spurred to fire by various inputs.

Yeah, you say this a lot, but you support seems to be, ""Well, that is just what the words mean the way I use them."" You have given me 0 reasons to believe that the physical arrangement of neurons alone is enough to explain the essential features of conscious experience: intentional content and the like. I don't think you even understand what I'm asking you to explain.

&gt;But if they don't affect future events, then are they meaningfully different from your experiences? It seems like saying ""Well, yeah, they aren't my experiences because they're not mine."" But this is circular, isn't it?

It would be circular, if I used the type-token distinction to justify my position about experiences and my position about experiences to justify the distinction. The type-token distinction is a very popular conceptual tool used in many fields, though. I think there is independent reasons to accept the distinction, which in turn justify using it in this specific case.

&gt; If the same neurons fire, or neurons that are near, or connected, those are similar patterns.

So the brain is split up into well-organized, (though overlapping) neighborhoods dedicated to distinct topics, (e.i. a part about colors, a part about fruit, a part about visible things, etc.)?

&gt; Provided they had a parallel in their culture, and an understanding of the science involved. You may take contention with that last point, after all, if they had knowledge of the science involved, wouldn't that mean I'm not really doing the explaining? But trying to explain something like the intricacies of magnets to someone who's never seen them would run into the same issues, and we know for sure how those work.

This isn't a gotcha; I'm not trying to trap you into admitting some mysterian position without you realizing it. I think this is a useful exercise for making our beliefs as clear as possible. If you had to explain how magnets worked to someone that was totally ignorant, you would need to think long and hard about how they really work vs the casual pop-science answers we are given to in other moments.

I think the same is true for experience. If we met aliens and we wanted to determine how similar their experiences are to ours, then we better have a good idea about what our experiences are in the first place. It doesn't do much good to begin a search, if you don't know what you are looking for in the first place.

&gt; It might not be a necessary assumption.

I think assuming the universe is made of only things we can observe is as necessary for science to work as assuming the universe exists.

&gt; Again, if a priest must believe God is physical insofar as he exists, then your definition of physical is defective.

Well, how would you define non-physical? I can't honestly think of a suitable definition, besides ""not physical"" where physical is things we can interact with. If we can't interact with it, then it can't affect the universe.

&gt; Do you have an argument that says otherwise?

Only that it doesn't actually end up mattering. If the particle is going to your left, and to my right, it's still going in the same direction. Furthermore, I could very easily say ""yeah, that is going to your left"", even from my position.

&gt; What if I want to know how things behave a certain way in general, without appealing to any particular situation.

Then you'd have a good start, but not a full explanation. Simply put, an explanation with values (like equations) added is a strictly better explanation. It doesn't lose anything, but does gain something.

&gt; I don't think you even understand what I'm asking you to explain.

I don't think I do either. But, you've given me no reason to think they're anything else. They're obviously something, so from there, it's not a positive versus a negative claim, it's two positive claims.

&gt; I think there is independent reasons to accept the distinction, which in turn justify using it in this specific case.

That makes some sense, but is there any reason why it's important for the experiences to be of the same token, and not just of the same type to say someone else can have your experience? I had to look up ""type-token distinction"" and Wikipedia gave an example of ""type of car"" vs ""instance of car"". But the same type of car will drive the same, so wouldn't it be similar with experience?

&gt; So the brain is split up into well-organized, (though overlapping) neighborhoods dedicated to distinct topics, (e.i. a part about colors, a part about fruit, a part about visible things, etc.)?

As far as I know, yes. Maybe not those exact topics, but yeah. As a side note, I'm not sure that ""*well* organized"" can match with ""overlapping"", but this ends up being the whole ""conversations glide seamlessly from topic to topic"" thing I said earlier.

&gt; If we met aliens and we wanted to determine how similar their experiences are to ours, then we better have a good idea about what our experiences are in the first place.

Sure, but I think we have a long way to go to really have a ""good idea"" of how the brain actually works. We'd have no way of explaining magnets if we didn't already understand them ourselves, and the truth is, there's a lot we don't yet understand about the brain.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-13 18:09:00 :

&gt; I think assuming the universe is made of only things we can observe is as necessary for science to work as assuming the universe exists.

Why? 

I think at this point, it is apparent that there is too much substantial disagreement between us to make debating this topics individually nearly impossible. Maybe getting to the heart of what we both think is necessary to explain, or even necessarily true, would help.

&gt; Well, how would you define non-physical? I can't honestly think of a suitable definition, besides ""not physical"" where physical is things we can interact with. If we can't interact with it, then it can't affect the universe.

Again, the problem is in your overly general definition of physical. If non-physical implies causally ineffective, then people that believe in hauntings must believe they saw physical ghosts. This is clearly not what they believe when they said, ""I've seen ghosts!"" These people are definitely mistaken about what they've seen, but it is clear that super-natural causes aren't logically impossible.

&gt; Only that it doesn't actually end up mattering. If the particle is going to your left, and to my right, it's still going in the same direction. Furthermore, I could very easily say ""yeah, that is going to your left"", even from my position.

Maybe it is just your age, but what you think will convince someone is totally strange. Retorting simply that what your opponent just doesn't matter anyways and that we can assume that you don't need to respond in anyway is not a way to win hearts and minds.

&gt; Then you'd have a good start, but not a full explanation. Simply put, an explanation with values (like equations) added is a strictly better explanation. It doesn't lose anything, but does gain something.

What if you had to choose between just the equation or just the results, though? That is the real contest here. You can't say that all useful methods are as specific as possible and then appeal to a general formula. You are assuming you can have your cake and eat it to. Sure, general theory supplemented be accurate information is the best, but we aren't comparing that to just general theory alone.

&gt; I don't think I do either. But, you've given me no reason to think they're anything else. They're obviously something, so from there, it's not a positive versus a negative claim, it's two positive claims.

Did you read that article I linked about intentionality? This is an excert I think will help:

&gt;&gt; Contemporary discussions of the nature of intentionality were launched and many of them were anticipated by Franz Brentano (1874, 88-89) in his book, Psychology From an Empirical Standpoint, from which I quote two famous paragraphs:
Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction toward an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not do so in the same way. In presentation, something is presented, in judgment something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on.
This intentional inexistence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We can, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves.

*********************************************

&gt; That makes some sense, but is there any reason why it's important for the experiences to be of the same token, and not just of the same type to say someone else can have your experience? I had to look up ""type-token distinction"" and Wikipedia gave an example of ""type of car"" vs ""instance of car"". But the same type of car will drive the same, so wouldn't it be similar with experience?

If experiences just are physical objects, as you claim, then that can't be the case. I can't replace your Toyota Camry with my Toyota Camry and say that you have the same car still. In contrast, We could play your copy of Stankonia or my copy of Stankonia and hear ""Ms. Jackson"" either way. Cars are individual objects while songs are patterns.

&gt; As far as I know, yes.

Do you know how things are generally lined out? Genuinely curious.

&gt; Sure, but I think we have a long way to go to really have a ""good idea"" of how the brain actually works. We'd have no way of explaining magnets if we didn't already understand them ourselves, and the truth is, there's a lot we don't yet understand about the brain.

Couldn't you just tell the aliens how you are feeling instead, though? If you could just talk about you state of mind from a first-person perspective, wouldn't that give them a window into your experience in a way science, as far as we know, cannot?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-13 22:40:56 :

&gt; &gt; I think assuming the universe is made of only things we can observe is as necessary for science to work as assuming the universe exists.
&gt; Why?

Because if there are things we can't observe that make up the universe, than science can't explain them. Science's entire job is to explain the universe, so if it can't do that, it can't ""work"".

&gt; If non-physical implies causally ineffective, then people that believe in hauntings must believe they saw physical ghosts.

What's wrong with physical ghosts? Yes, conventionally ghosts are ""intangible"" but that doesn't mean ""non-physical"". Magnetic fields are intangible, air is (kind of) intangible, but neither of those are non-physical. I can't think of another suitable definition to ""physical"" besides ""something we can interact with""

&gt; Maybe it is just your age, but what you think will convince someone is totally strange. Retorting simply that what your opponent just doesn't matter anyways and that we can assume that you don't need to respond in anyway is not a way to win hearts and minds.

I'm not certain what the problem with that statement was. We both agree which way the particle is moving, it's just you call it left, and I call it right. It's still the same direction. The fact that we agree on which way the particle is moving means it's not really perspective relative, is it? My perspective doesn't contradict your perspective in any way.

&gt; What if you had to choose between just the equation or just the results, though? That is the real contest here.

But the answer to why do things fall, and why did this object of mass X fall in Y way is the same answer. It's just whether you plug in values or not. I don't know when you'd have to pick between just the equation or just the results, the results should always be gotten to by the equation.

&gt; Did you read that article I linked about intentionality? This is an excert I think will help:

I've been avoiding responding to points where you bring up those articles, because I can't make much sense of them. I read them, and re read them, but maybe it's the language, or the phrasing, but I just don't understand what they're saying. I'm going to do my best to try to recite what I think that excerpt said, and you can tell me if I'm right. Though note, to get to this explanation, I feel like I had to jump around the paragraph and ignore parts of it to make sense of it.

Ok, so it says ""We can, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves."" Which is similar to, from a grammatical sense, having an indirect object? Like a mental phenomena has an object (implicitly) that has something being done to it. That something being done is the intentionality?

&gt; In contrast, We could play your copy of Stankonia or my copy of Stankonia and hear ""Ms. Jackson"" either way.

But it's not the same ""Ms. Jackson"", right? I mean if it were, what would be the problem with thoughts being like songs on a disk? And also, yes, you're right, I couldn't say I was driving my car still, but I could say that I was driving a Toyota Camry. Though I'm not sure this matters, because even if it is just a copy of your experience, if it's close enough, we could say that someone has had your experience in every meaningful way. It gets a bit caught up in language, by calling it ""your"" experience, when I could just say ""You both had an experience characterized by blah blah and blah"" (like saying you both drove a Toyota Camry). It's closer to the songs, while it may not be the same ""Ms. Jackson"" they're copies of each other, so it's close enough that neither of us would disagree that it was ""Ms. Jackson"" playing. Basically, if songs are patterns of sound, and experiences are patterns of firing neurons, then it works out.

&gt; Do you know how things are generally lined out? Genuinely curious.

Like, how things are laid out in the brain? Not off hand, no, and not really on hand either. We have charts that can show things like ""speech center"" and stuff, but I can't say ""Your childhood memories are at x position in your brain""

&gt; Couldn't you just tell the aliens how you are feeling instead, though? If you could just talk about you state of mind from a first-person perspective, wouldn't that give them a window into your experience in a way science, as far as we know, cannot?

I think this really highlights the difference between your view and mine. You say ""in a way science ... cannot"", but I think it could, it'd just be too complex to fit inside a brain. Basically, you say ""if you talk about how you feel, you're talking in different terms to how science would explain it"", and I say ""If you talk about how you feel, you're talking in broader terms than how science would explain it"". Like yes, it would be simpler to explain how you are feeling, instead of explain how the neurons in your head are firing. Just like it would be easier to explain to someone that halogens bond with alkali metals, instead of getting down to the particle physics that actually explain why that happens. But that doesn't mean that the particle physics explanation is wrong, or even really different, just that it's more complex, because it's more detailed.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-14 18:02:30 :

&gt; Because if there are things we can't observe that make up the universe, than science can't explain them. Science's entire job is to explain the universe, so if it can't do that, it can't ""work"".

This seems like a strange argument form to me:

1. X is made to perform P purpose.
2. Y would imply fulfilling P imperfectly.
3. Therefore, X rules out Y.

It's strange, because science is obviously imperfect. I have never seen and will never potentially see a ""perfect"" science, since science is a human quest for knowledge. It can never become a transcendent body of facts, or lose its anthropogenic perspective.

Additionally, if all we need to explain is why science seems to work, then we don't need to appeal to an 'outside' world. Instead, we could just talk about selective pressures on theories, such as the constraints of rationality, human belief patterns, large group dynamics, and so on. If we can predict and explain why certain theories are more likely to be adopted and applied, then we can predict when and why science 'works'.

&gt; What's wrong with physical ghosts? 

I just don't think that is how people conceive of ghosts. Maybe in some world people experience haunted house-type events and think, ""This must be those atomic entities I can't see!"" I just don't think psychics, seance-holders, and ghost hunters actually believe in physical ghosts. If you feel like you definition holds special weight over the standard use of the English language, then you'll have to convince me.

&gt; I'm not certain what the problem with that statement was.

Saying that what I said his doesn't matter seemed quixotic to me, if you are trying to win me over. It was a small thing; I thought I was funny.

&gt; We both agree which way the particle is moving, it's just you call it left, and I call it right. It's still the same direction. The fact that we agree on which way the particle is moving means it's not really perspective relative, is it? My perspective doesn't contradict your perspective in any way.

If you are right, then, ""Object O is to the right of me"", should have the same truth conditions as ""Object O moving with M motion."" They clearly don't mean the same thing though, since one can be true without the other and vice versa.

&gt; But the answer to why do things fall, and why did this object of mass X fall in Y way is the same answer. 

Give me a single statement that will satisfy both ""What speed does an Object of mass 22kg fall at on Earth after 4s?"" and ""Why do objects fall?"".

&gt; I've been avoiding responding to points where you bring up those articles, because I can't make much sense of them...

I don't blame you. Philosophy can be ultra-obscure. I'll try to translate when I can.

&gt; so it says ""We can, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves."" Which is similar to, from a grammatical sense, having an indirect object? Like a mental phenomena has an object (implicitly) that has something being done to it. That something being done is the intentionality?

Nearly right; Intentionality implies the given thing, (thought, idea, sign, book, etc.), takes an object that it is about. The thing is oriented towards or implicative of it's intentional object. Whether we are aware of the intentional objects directly or indirectly is an interesting question, but not the most salient issue.

Intentional relationships are two place. They include an observe/mental act and an intentional object. This relationship might be causal, so this ""doing something to"" talk might be where you start a naturalized account of intentionality. However, it isn't necessarily a causal relationship in itself.

&gt; But it's not the same ""Ms. Jackson"", right? I mean if it were, what would be the problem with thoughts being like songs on a disk?

You could. That's a very popular response in fact. Notice you'll have to say that thought are more like patterns than objects in that case, though. Songs are tonal and melodic relationships played out over time. They don't exist wholly at once in space or depend on a single underlying substance. They are physical patterns, but not physical objects.

&gt; Basically, if songs are patterns of sound, and experiences are patterns of firing neurons, then it works out.

It might, but this is a new approach, different from the one you've been pushing. Many, if not most, of my criticisms have been aimed at conception of experiences as token physical objects. Talking about physical patterns side steps many of these criticisms, but there are new questions to be asked now.

&gt; Like, how things are laid out in the brain? Not off hand, no, and not really on hand either. We have charts that can show things like ""speech center"" and stuff, but I can't say ""Your childhood memories are at x position in your brain""

Can we agree that, for the purpose of this discussion, this is the extent of the facts on the ground. Appealing to future facts as possible objects is fine, but I don't see any reason to write a blank check for actual justifications. If we don't know more than this currently, then we shouldn't pretend to have more justification tgan is currently available.

&gt; I think this really highlights the difference between your view and mine. You say ""in a way science ... cannot"", but I think it could, it'd just be too complex to fit inside a brain.

This is exhibit A; I am only speaking within the narrow world of best current theory. I can't extinguish your optimism, but I can note that you are depending on helpful unknowns. If this is a question of which theory makes the most sense given what we know, then I don't think we should appeal to unknown unknowns.

&gt; Basically, you say ""if you talk about how you feel, you're talking in different terms to how science would explain it"", and I say ""If you talk about how you feel, you're talking in broader terms than how science would explain it"". Like yes, it would be simpler to explain how you are feeling, instead of explain how the neurons in your head are firing.

I'm down with all of this. I think this is a fairly accurate depiction.

&gt; Just like it would be easier to explain to someone that halogens bond with alkali metals, instead of getting down to the particle physics that actually explain why that happens. But that doesn't mean that the particle physics explanation is wrong, or even really different, just that it's more complex, because it's more detailed.

That is the case only if individual experiences are like elements on the periodic table. It implies there are discreet determinate features that determine the micro- and macro- properties of the elements/experience and that consciousness/compounds are determined by their composition.

This seems promising, but let's bring things back to the alien case. If the aliens had very different neurology but very similar behavior, could this approach work? I'd say, ""No"", because we'd need to compare unlike elements. Their basic 'parts' would be different from ours; therefore, their compositions should be different, in theory. Is implies that either alien mental life must be incomparable with ours after all or that another approach is required to capture the similarities.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-14 19:31:17 :

&gt; It's strange, because science is obviously imperfect.

Because without that assumption, we can't explain the world. Why not just stop with ""Lightning just happens""? It's a working explanation, and appeals to some non-physical lightning thing that just makes lightning happen. We assume that there is an explanation, and we look for it. That assuming there is an explanation is this assuming we can explain the world. 

Also, the existence of science doesn't ""rule out"" the non-physical, but in order for science to ""work"" it needs to assume the non-physical doesn't exist. This is how we got here, is I claimed that science makes the assumption against the non-physical. If the non-physical is existent, then science is wrong, which could be the case, but doesn't seem to be.

&gt; If you feel like you definition holds special weight over the standard use of the English language, then you'll have to convince me.

What is the standard definition of physical in the English language? More specifically, you say ""that's not what people think of when they talk about ghosts"", but why not? What actually differentiates a ghost from a physical object? The fact that it goes through walls? So do radio signals, but they're physical. The fact that it doesn't seem to obey the laws of nature? Well, if ghosts did exist, we'd explain them, and in doing so, find new laws of nature.

&gt; If you are right, then, ""Object O is to the right of me"", should have the same truth conditions as ""Object O moving with M motion."" They clearly don't mean the same thing though, since one can be true without the other and vice versa.

Hmm, I don't see how what I said implies that. Could you explain it to me?

&gt; Give me a single statement that will satisfy both ""What speed does an Object of mass 22kg fall at on Earth after 4s?"" and ""Why do objects fall?"".

I don't see why ""Objects with mass experience a force towards other objects with mass given by the equation F=G(m1*m2)/r^2 where G is the gravitational constant of (don't know it off hand), m1 is the mass of the first object, m2 is the mass of the second object, and r is the distance between their centers of mass."" would fail to allow you to answer the first question, provided you knew the other laws of physics (like F=ma) and the mass of the earth. I mean, I think see what you're saying (kind of, you changed it from ""why did object O fall in X way"" to ""what is the resulting speed of object O""). Also, I've forgotten why we got onto this tangent, and have gone back several comments, coming up empty handed, why are we arguing this point?

&gt;  takes an object that it is about. 

So, like I can't just ""think"" I have to be thinking ""about"" something? Is that something the intentionality?

&gt; Songs are tonal and melodic relationships played out over time. They don't exist wholly at once in space or depend on a single underlying substance. They are physical patterns, but not physical objects.

Is the issue that it's over time that makes a song not an object? Because thoughts clearly last over time. I can have a pattern made up of objects, though, right?

&gt; Talking about physical patterns side steps many of these criticisms, but there are new questions to be asked now.

Cool. I'd like to hear those new questions, but I could understand this feeling like I'm pulling the rug out from under you or something. The truth is, I'm not a neuroscientist, so my understanding of the brain isn't that of an expert, and I'm sure it has many holes in it. What I'm saying is, I'm probably figuring things out about how the brain works as we have this discussion. If you want a delta for that, since my view on how the brain works has changed, I'd be happy to grant it, but it's not like you've convinced me to your side, just to a different position on mine.

&gt; If we don't know more than this currently, then we shouldn't pretend to have more justification tgan is currently available.

Ok, sure. But, I don't think we'll come to definite answers until we know more than we do currently, just as a heads up.

&gt; This is exhibit A; I am only speaking within the narrow world of best current theory. I can't extinguish your optimism, but I can note that you are depending on helpful unknowns. If this is a question of which theory makes the most sense given what we know, then I don't think we should appeal to unknown unknowns.

You're very correct. This optimism comes from the assumption I make of physicalism, and I'll grant you, I don't really have proof of it. But I don't think we will come to any definite conclusions while there are still unknown unknowns. And at least physicalism doesn't seem to falter on any of the knowns. I'm sure other theories don't either, though.

&gt; Is implies that either alien mental life must be incomparable with ours after all or that another approach is required to capture the similarities.

I mean, I don't think this is the point, but alien life probably is mostly incomparable, because it evolved in a wholly different environment from earth. Anyway, on what I think the point is, I think explaining the way our brains work would certainly be of use to them, even if it's different from theirs. If they had the computing power to simulate the brain (which we don't yet, but probably will soon with how fast computing power increases), they may be able to use that explanation to get some understanding. I honestly don't know where I'm trying to go with this though.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-15 18:02:50 :

&gt; Because without that assumption, we can't explain the world.

Again, it doesn't seem like you need to explain the world. It seems like all you need to explain is why science 'works'. Perhaps those go hand in hand, but they aren't necessarily connected. It may be possible to have one without the other and vice-versa. How do you rank the priority between the two?

&gt; Why not just stop with ""Lightning just happens""? It's a working explanation, and appeals to some non-physical lightning thing that just makes lightning happen. We assume that there is an explanation, and we look for it. That assuming there is an explanation is this assuming we can explain the world.

&gt; I agree I guess? It is foolish to expect that we can explain what the world truly is from our limited perspectives. We appeal to folk explanation, (gods, spirits, bodies, etc.), to make ourselves feel more in control of the unknown and appeal to fetishes, (pop-science, catechism, political doctrine, etc.), to bolster our power by proxy.

In truth, explanations aren't always given. A need isn't always fulfilled. Given the nature of our experience and the gulf between our current theory and the truth, I don't see any reason to be hopeful here.

&gt; Also, the existence of science doesn't ""rule out"" the non-physical, but in order for science to ""work"" it needs to assume the non-physical doesn't exist.

I just provided an argument above and in the previous post against this claim. I argued that science 'workin' is a matter of community-specific, internal metrics as opposed to universal, external metrics. No claim of any being is necessary. Therefore, 'working' tells us about physical or non-physical objects.

&gt; What is the standard definition of physical in the English language? More specifically, you say ""that's not what people think of when they talk about ghosts"", but why not?

It's something like, ""pertaining to the body as opposed to the mind"" or ""pertaining the concrete, tangible phenomenon"". The first definition isn't helpful in these discussions for reasons I stated all the way back in OP. The second makes sensible positions, like the formalism or functionalism, hard to square.

For a philosophical definition, I'd suggest a compromise between the two: Non-intentionally grounded objects that are nomologically fixed. This would include every public object whose essence is completely determined by natural laws.

&gt; What actually differentiates a ghost from a physical object? The fact that it goes through walls? So do radio signals, but they're physical. The fact that it doesn't seem to obey the laws of nature? Well, if ghosts did exist, we'd explain them, and in doing so, find new laws of nature.

Ghosts aren't physical under this definition because ghosts don't have bodies. They are pure will manifest in the world. They are self-determining without the constraints of a body and therefore not determined by the laws of nature. In contrast, radio waves only exist insofar as the natural generative conditions exist. They are determined by initial conditions plus natural laws. 

&gt; It's just you call it left, and I call it right. It's still the same direction...
Hmm, I don't see how what I said implies that. Could you explain it to me?

It is the sentence quoted above. If your ""right"" and my ""left"" are different names for the same thing, then why can't I use the names interchangeably?

***************

[Edit]

&gt; I don't see why ""Objects with mass experience a force towards other objects with mass given by the equation F=G(m1*m2)/r2 where G is the gravitational constant of (don't know it off hand), m1 is the mass of the first object, m2 is the mass of the second object, and r is the distance between their centers of mass."" would fail to allow you to answer the first question, provided you knew the other laws of physics (like F=ma) and the mass of the earth.

That is an excellent answer to the first question, but a poor answer to the second question. While this general picture applies to the specific case, it isn't equivalent and vice versa. If they were, the two claims would have identical truth conditions.

&gt; , I think see what you're saying (kind of, you changed it from ""why did object O fall in X way"" to ""what is the resulting speed of object O""). Also, I've forgotten why we got onto this tangent, and have gone back several comments, coming up empty handed, why are we arguing this point?

I changed the phrasing to make it easier to read, but they are meant to capture the same meaning. We started this thread because you said answers contain maximally specific information are strictly better. Since specific answers are helpful in the cases I highlighted, I'd say that specific answers are just better within their domain of applicability.

&gt; So, like I can't just ""think"" I have to be thinking ""about"" something? Is that something the intentionality?

You are always thinking about or relative to something. This constraint/essential fact is called intentionality. Our thought and ideas are in tension with or entangled with their intentional objects.

&gt; Is the issue that it's over time that makes a song not an object? Because thoughts clearly last over time. I can have a pattern made up of objects, though, right?

Yes; concrete objects are present all at once in space. The fact that the latter I instantiated by physical objects makes it a physical pattern.

&gt; . If you want a delta...

Nah! I was just making a point of clarification. I didn't want to pull the rug out on you later. It was best to say all that up front.

&gt; But I don't think we will come to any definite conclusions while there are still unknown unknowns. And at least physicalism doesn't seem to falter on any of the knowns. I'm sure other theories don't either, though.

I am trying to point out the ways I think physicalism falters given what we know so far. I think soft physicalism is the weakest theory out of the four options available, and eliminativism is unsavory to many people.

&gt; I mean, I don't think this is the point, but alien life probably is mostly incomparable, because it evolved in a wholly different environment from earth.

You're ultimately right. We are mostly accidents it would be exceedingly unlike for life to evolve to be like us, even given generally similar conditions. Some attributes seem more likely to be abundant, (a sense of duty, bravery maybe). Maybe we can stick to those.

&gt; Anyway, on what I think the point is, I think explaining the way our brains work would certainly be of use to them, even if it's different from theirs. If they had the computing power to simulate the brain (which we don't yet, but probably will soon with how fast computing power increases), they may be able to use that explanation to get some understanding.

How can they understand what a certain brain state means, if they don't know how stimulus relates to experience. Human researchers depend on the personal experience and a human public; the aliens haven't had either.

&gt; It may be possible to have one without the other and vice-versa. How do you rank the priority between the two?

I don't see how science, whose job is to explain the universe, can ""work"", under any sensible definition of work, without being able to explain the universe.

&gt; Given the nature of our experience and the gulf between our current theory and the truth, I don't see any reason to be hopeful here.

Even if we can't find the answer, why not assume the answer is out there? But even so, I do see reason to be hopeful. We have made a lot of headway understanding the brain, and even have work on simulating it. Sure, we may never actually explain it, but there doesn't currently seem to be any barriers to our doing so, besides time.

&gt; ""pertaining the concrete, tangible phenomenon""

If something can interact with the world, how is it not tangible?

&gt; Ghosts aren't physical under this definition because ghosts don't have bodies. They are pure will manifest in the world. They are self-determining without the constraints of a body and therefore not determined by the laws of nature. In contrast, radio waves only exist insofar as the natural generative conditions exist. They are determined by initial conditions plus natural laws.

So, non-physical things are things not made of matter, that still have a will? I mean, maybe that would hold more sway if we had any indication that any such thing could exist... But, even if it could, we could still try to explain it. The issue with defining anything as ""something that doesn't follow the laws of nature"" is the laws of nature we know aren't *the* laws of nature. They're our understanding. If they fail at explaining something (like ghosts), then we change them, we experiment, and discover new ones. I don't think anything that can interact with the world could violate the laws of nature for that reason, because we define laws of nature as things that can't be violated. The important note is we don't say ""if something violates these laws, it can't exist"" we say ""if something violates these laws, our description of the laws must be wrong."" After all, if they can be broken, they aren't really laws are they?

&gt; It is the sentence quoted above. If your ""right"" and my ""left"" are different names for the same thing, then why can't I use the names interchangeably?

You can, if you say ""your right"" and ""my left"". To this point, I'm not sure why any of this is a problem for me. I'll even grant you that some things could be considered perspective dependent, since we can measure things relatively (above me, below you, to my front, to your left, whatever). Why does this cause problems? Being able to do that, without changing the facts of the scene is the entire point of multiple perspectives.

&gt; I changed the phrasing to make it easier to read, but they are meant to capture the same meaning.

Changing the question from a ""why"" to a ""what"" does not capture the same meaning.

&gt; Since specific answers are helpful in the cases I highlighted, I'd say that specific answers are just better within their domain of applicability.

What I meant was: Say I grant you that. Where does that get you? I don't know, and I feel like we're arguing for the sake of it, instead of toward any point.

&gt; Our thought and ideas are in tension with or entangled with their intentional objects.

So, a physical thought can have intentionality if that thought can be traced back through a causal chain (or maybe more accurately, causal sub-chain?) to that object. For example, if the thought was spawned by photons hitting your retina after bouncing off of that object, or if the thought was spawned from your nose picking up particles that came off of that object. In a perhaps more complicated example, it could also be spawned from a memory of an object, though explaining that probably gets out of my depth again.

&gt; I am trying to point out the ways I think physicalism falters given what we know so far. I think soft physicalism is the weakest theory out of the four options available, and eliminativism is unsavory to many people.

Yeah, but I don't think you've convinced me on any of them. Maybe I'm just stubborn about it though. I'm still not fully sure I understand what soft physicalism and eliminativism mean, or which category what I think would fit into.

&gt; How can they understand what a certain brain state means, if they don't know how stimulus relates to experience.

I'm not sure that'd be important to understanding how humans think. If you simulate the brain, and find that putting sugar in the scene causes the brain to produce outputs toward acquiring the sugar, you can use that as understanding, even if you don't quite understand what happened at each individual time stamp. I expect, even if we simulate the brain, and get a complete understanding of how neurons work together and all that, we'll still work on psychology by trying to relate inputs to outputs, as that's something we'd be able to think about easier. Hell, I think even if we offloaded that work to computers, they'd do it this way, because it's easier to tabulate billions of datapoints and say ""patients with these values tend to show the largest increase in satisfaction when given this drug"", than it is to say ""lets simulate *your* specific brain, and see what effect each drug might have"".

KDJones @ 2016-11-17 17:42:48 :

&gt; I don't see how science, whose job is to explain the universe, can ""work"", under any sensible definition of work, without being able to explain the universe.

Because: ""the laws of nature we know aren't the laws of nature. They're our understanding."" We don't need to and can't appeal to extra-scientific sources to verify that science is working. Whatever your metric for determining working, I guarantee that it involves implicit values or perspectives.

&gt; Even if we can't find the answer, why not assume the answer is out there?

Because it is a baseless assumption motivated by the desire to preserve popular conceptions of science and learning in general.

&gt; I do see reason to be hopeful. We have made a lot of headway understanding the brain, and even have work on simulating it. Sure, we may never actually explain it, but there doesn't currently seem to be any barriers to our doing so, besides time.

Again, this smacks of messianic promise. Whether some proposal that you can't articulate will change the landscape in the topic given ideal conditions and infinite time seems irrelevant.

&gt; So, non-physical things are things not made of matter, that still have a will?

Some are, namely ghosts. I don't think all non-physical things are non-physical for the same reason. I don't think ghosts are real, so real non-physical things are probably different.

&gt; If [natural laws] fail at explaining something (like ghosts), then we change them, we experiment, and discover new ones. I don't think anything that can interact with the world could violate the laws of nature for that reason, because we define laws of nature as things that can't be violated. The important note is we don't say ""if something violates these laws, it can't exist"" we say ""if something violates these laws, our description of the laws must be wrong."" After all, if they can be broken, they aren't really laws are they?

The issue isn't whether anything can violate natural laws. I agree that this is hard to square by definition. Rather, the question is whether there are things that aren't determined by natural law. Of determinism isn't true, then some events are under-determined: they aren't guaranteed by the structure of laws alone. Something arbitrary or not like laws must ground the existence of these things. They are accidentally true, but objectively true.

&gt; You can, if you say ""your right"" and ""my left"". To this point, I'm not sure why any of this is a problem for me.

Let's test it then. 

1.""This object is to the right of me.""

This is true just when the object is oriented to the right of me.

2.""This object is to the left of you.""

This is true just when the object is oriented to the left of you.

Now, 1 is only true in worlds where I exist. 2 is only true in worlds where you exist. There are possible worlds where I exist, but you do not. Therefore, there is a possible world where 1 is true while 2 is false. Therefore, the two claims can't have equivalent meanings, since they don't have equivalent truth conditions.

&gt; I'll even grant you that some things could be considered perspective dependent, since we can measure things relatively (above me, below you, to my front, to your left, whatever). Why does this cause problems? Being able to do that, without changing the facts of the scene is the entire point of multiple perspectives.

The problem is that you've assimilated multiple perspectives into one perspective: the universal perspective. I don't think such a thing is possible or coherent, but it certainly can't account for perspective dependent facts, like subjective experience.

&gt; Changing the question from a ""why"" to a ""what"" does not capture the same meaning.

I guess I'm not perfect.

&gt;  Say I grant you that. Where does that get you? I don't know, and I feel like we're arguing for the sake of it, instead of toward any point.

For starters, it shows that you are harboring an unreasonable assumption. If you can muster some degree of open-mindedness, you can tell me how changing your mind affects the way you see things. More importantly, acknowledging general facts implies platonism over nominalism. If there are more than just objects in our ontology, there is room to change vulgar materialism.

&gt; So, a physical thought can have intentionality if that thought can be traced back through a causal chain (or maybe more accurately, causal sub-chain?) to that object.

This is one of the common proposals. I'd say it is the most promising path open to your position.

&gt; I'm not sure that'd be important to understanding how humans think. If you simulate the brain, and find that putting sugar in the scene causes the brain to produce outputs toward acquiring the sugar, you can use that as understanding, even if you don't quite understand what happened at each individual time stamp.

This would make you an eliminativist, worst still a behaviorist! If there is nothing more to explain than future behavior, then there is no subject experience in the picture.

&gt; I expect, even if we simulate the brain, and get a complete understanding of how neurons work together and all that, we'll still work on psychology by trying to relate inputs to outputs, as that's something we'd be able to think about easier. 

Is psychology really a proper science if it doesn't reflect the deeper reality of our mental life? If we do psychology only for expedience, then why think it is true?

&gt; Hell, I think even if we offloaded that work to computers, they'd do it this way, because it's easier to tabulate billions of datapoints and say ""patients with these values tend to show the largest increase in satisfaction when given this drug"", than it is to say ""lets simulate your specific brain, and see what effect each drug might have"".

Will these computers understand what it's like to be these people from an individual, lived perspective? This is the only question that really seems to matter here. If they can't give us that information, then they are talking past our question.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-17 22:40:29 :

&gt; We don't need to and can't appeal to extra-scientific sources to verify that science is working.

I still don't understand why we ""can't"" appeal to extra scientific sources to verify science is working.

&gt; Again, this smacks of messianic promise. Whether some proposal that you can't articulate will change the landscape in the topic given ideal conditions and infinite time seems irrelevant.

Alright, fine. I get it. When I say ""I see reason to"" I don't mean, this is definitely true and there is no way it is false. Yes, it's not taking a skeptical mindset, or whatever. Yes, it's appealing to an assumption (though baseless seems to be a bit odd. It's basis is that all previous things behaved this way, why would future things not? Sure, future things *may* not, but it'd not baseless to see a pattern there). Whatever. Isn't this just having a worldview? In my (limited) experience of philosophy, there's a lot of contentious opinions, some people believe one thing, some the other. The fact that there isn't consensus means, almost certainly, we can't determine who's right. But fine, I'll concede this point: we may never be able to explain the brain, I don't see any barriers to it, but you're right that not seeing any barriers doesn't mean it will definitely happen.

&gt; Some are, namely ghosts. I don't think all non-physical things are non-physical for the same reason. I don't think ghosts are real, so real non-physical things are probably different.

Ok, but they all have some commonality in that they are non-physical. What is that commonality? What about an object makes it non-physical? This is important, there has to be some general rule for it, otherwise, why are we grouping them at all?

&gt; Rather, the question is whether there are things that aren't determined by natural law.

Ah, I see. So, what is something that can't be determined by law like? From where I am, I can't imagine such a thing, so I'm curious, what do you think?

&gt; This is true just when the object is oriented to the left of you. Now, 1 is only true in worlds where I exist. 2 is only true in worlds where you exist. There are possible worlds where I exist, but you do not. Therefore, there is a possible world where 1 is true while 2 is false. Therefore, the two claims can't have equivalent meanings, since they don't have equivalent truth conditions.

You don't even have to go so far as to assert my non existence. Positioning me on the same side of the object as you would accomplish the same task, and much more simply. So why didn't you go for that one?

I mean, I thought I had earlier agreed with you that these are, in a way, perspective dependent, but that's a given based on multiple perspectives. It doesn't change the overall facts, just how you name them. If I face one way, or if I face the other, that may change whether object 1 is behind me or in front of me, but it won't change the distance between it and object 2, no matter where I look from. It won't change the angle between the vectors pointing from object 1 to objects 2 and 3. It won't change object 1's relative orientation to object 2. It won't change object 1's mass. etc.

&gt; The problem is that you've assimilated multiple perspectives into one perspective: the universal perspective.

Hmm. Maybe I've been unclear then? I don't know. There isn't a single ""right"" frame of reference, but all frames of reference will make the same (relative to them) predictions. So I guess that's what you mean by assimilating the multiple perspectives into one. 

&gt; but it certainly can't account for perspective dependent facts, like subjective experience.

Only if perspective dependent facts exist. These ""perspective dependent facts"" are clearly different from ""your right"" vs ""my left"", right? Because those facts are, as you (almost) said, ""assimilated into the universal perspective"". Am I mischaracterising you?

&gt; I guess I'm not perfect.

It's not just not being ""perfect"". It was borderline disingenuous. That was a different question, and trying to say ""These two questions must have a different answer. Here, I'll show you by asking you two different questions"" is not really the most honest thing.

&gt; More importantly, acknowledging general facts implies platonism over nominalism. If there are more than just objects in our ontology, there is room to change vulgar materialism.

Whew, ok. More philosophy words that I have to look through. As a heads up, I may misunderstand things, and also, I don't know where I stand on this divide, but, as this is CMV, I'll do what I've been doing, and take a position opposite you. Correct me if I get anything wrong here:

&gt; acknowledging general facts implies platonism over nominalism

Does it? From the reading I just did, platonism and nominalism disagree on whether there are ""abstract objects"", so I assume you're arguing something along the lines of ""general rules are not objects, so therefore, ~nominalism"". But if there were simply non-abstract objects, but they had similar behaviors in similar situations, would this contradict nominalism?

&gt; This would make you an eliminativist, worst still a behaviorist! If there is nothing more to explain than future behavior, then there is no subject experience in the picture.

Less that there is nothing to explain besides future behavior, and more that's all that's useful to us in most use cases. Just like if you were to play a video game, you care how your inputs relate to outputs: you press the button, you fire your gun. You don't really care how the computer senses that button press, and performs a raytrace forward, applying gravity to the projection of the ray to see if it hits an enemy, blah blah blah. Someone cared, because they had to make the game. But you don't.

&gt; Is psychology really a proper science if it doesn't reflect the deeper reality of our mental life? If we do psychology only for expedience, then why think it is true?

I may not have meant psychology. To be clear, my thoughts when I was saying this were along the lines of the people who would prescribe behavioral drugs, whoever those would be. So, from a medicinal perspective, it would be expedient to getting you the right drug to not actually worry about the actual happenings in your brain. 

&gt; Will these computers understand what it's like to be these people from an individual, lived perspective? This is the only question that really seems to matter here. If they can't give us that information, then they are talking past our question.

Well, I suppose that depends on your definition of understand. But I imagine that in the scenario I was envisioning, these computers would be talking past our question, so they aren't really important to the line of argument. To get back to the statement at hand, everything I've said probably doesn't pertain to psychology, but instead to mental health something or other. In psychology, where we actually do want to understand the nuances of the brain, we would use the heavy handed simulations and blah blah blah. Whether or not that simulation would ""reflect the deeper reality of our mental life"" is the question I believe we're trying to answer. I would say yes, you would say no.

You know, this interesting thing just came to mind. You say ""Will these computers understand what it's like to be these people"" and it makes me think: Do those people understand what it's like to be them? I'm going to link a video, but I'd like to give some context first. This video is talking about people who, as an (I hope archaic) epilepsy treatment, had the right and left hemispheres of their brain split. [Here](https://youtu.be/wfYbgdo8e-8?t=37s) is the video, and you'll need to watch it until 1:32 (though I recommend the whole video, because it's interesting). Essentially, brains will explain the current situation to itself, whether or not it's right. So these people may not actually understand why they act the way they do, but instead, just come up with plausible (though wrong) explanations for why they do.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-11-19 19:34:10 :

&gt; I still don't understand why we ""can't"" appeal to extra scientific sources to verify science is working.

Because there is nothing science can't observe and assimilate, right? If I could provide an extra-scientific resource, it would be redundant: science already covers the topic with a more essential treatment. Furthermore, if science has a blind spot, then it would be impossible to find it. By your reasoning, science assumes unobservables don't exist by definition, or something.

&gt; Yes, it's appealing to an assumption (though baseless seems to be a bit odd. It's basis is that all previous things behaved this way, why would future things not? Sure, future things may not, but it'd not baseless to see a pattern there).

I'm not just being a pessimist about induction. It isn't as if I think physicalism seems true now but that may turn out to be misleading. I think it seems false given what we know now and that this probably won't change.

&gt; Isn't this just having a worldview? In my (limited) experience of philosophy, there's a lot of contentious opinions, some people believe one thing, some the other. The fact that there isn't consensus means, almost certainly, we can't determine who's right.

Being respectful of other opinions and noting when disagreement in insoluble is important. Believing that two rational individuals seeking impartial truth can come to a deeper understanding through dialogue is far more important to philosophy, though. If you are completely comfortable with your current worldview, then you have less of a stake in exploring the issue.

&gt; Ok, but they all have some commonality in that they are non-physical. What is that commonality? What about an object makes it non-physical? This is important, there has to be some general rule for it, otherwise, why are we grouping them at all?

It's a completely negative definition. If you are fine with my definition of physical, then things are non-physical as long as they aren't: ""Non-intentionally grounded objects that are nomologically fixed."" There are multiple parts to this definition, so there are several ways to fail. They could fail as objects, fail as non-intentional, fail to be determined by natural law, or any combination there of.

&gt; Ah, I see. So, what is something that can't be determined by law like? From where I am, I can't imagine such a thing, so I'm curious, what do you think?

On one hand, I think stochastic practices in science point to some indeterminism in nature. It isn't at ""our level"", but it shows that explanation isn't incompatible with indeterminism. Even things that don't lend themselves to determinate laws can be predicted and understood.

Second, there are plenty of events that at least seem highly chaotic in our everyday experience. Things like elections, stock markets, the path of our own lives, ect seem to be determined by vagrant accidents. While there might be hidden determining variables in many of these events, many seem like genuine accidents. I think this indicates that the universe genuinely presents itself as accidental and irrational. The world might have a rational skeleton, but it's flesh is unaccountable assertion.

&gt; You don't even have to go so far as to assert my non existence. Positioning me on the same side of the object as you would accomplish the same task, and much more simply. So why didn't you go for that one?

Because that would change the case. You seem to want to say that this very arrangement of the universe just means, ""You are to the left"" and ""I am to the right."" In an obvious sense, you are right. Just as the shape of bench depends on the shape of it's material parts, this particular arrangement depends on physical composition.

However, the two claims pick out particular facts that are independent from each other. Logically, the meaning of these sentences picks out separate sets of conditions. This kind of distinction seems strange to me, something we don't get from extension facts about common conjuncture. This is a way to.extend the challenge of intentionality. How do we represent any event is a good question. How do we represent counter-factual events using only facts is a still deeper mystery.

&gt; Only if perspective dependent facts exist. These ""perspective dependent facts"" are clearly different from ""your right"" vs ""my left"", right? Because those facts are, as you (almost) said, ""assimilated into the universal perspective"". Am I mischaracterising you?

It cuts both ways. The practical facts about right/left and perspective facts are things we have external access to. After all, we talk about other minds and other positions all the time. I believe the grounding facts are similar in both cases. They both depend on accidents as the essential ground of being. You can only experience things as yourself: a particular accident that may or may not have existed across many kinds of laws. Orientation also depends on this raw accident of being. Regardless of the wider natural laws, ""This is to the right"", only depends on there being two things: me and the thing.

&gt; It's not just not being ""perfect"". It was borderline disingenuous.

I'm sorry. It really was a mistaken. I was just searching for the words.

&gt; Whew, ok. More philosophy words that I have to look through...

It isn't terribly important. I thought those words were more commonly used, but my non-philosophy people tell me I'm crazy. It wasn't a new point, just a new way to emphasize the point given (assumed-to-be) common vocabulary. It isn't though, so.we can drop it.

&gt; Just like if you were to play a video game, you care how your inputs relate to outputs: you press the button, you fire your gun. You don't really care how the computer senses that button press, and performs a raytrace forward, applying gravity to the projection of the ray to see if it hits an enemy, blah blah blah. Someone cared, because they had to make the game. But you don't.

If life is the game, then I do care about the code. The pretense of philosophy, for better or worse, is that curiosity about essential questions of being pays off in dialogue. I'm aware of appearances as such and think they are important to.pay attention to here. I also want to know what appearances are on a deeper level.

&gt; To be clear, my thoughts when I was saying this were along the lines of the people who would prescribe behavioral drugs, whoever those would be. So, from a medicinal perspective, it would be expedient to getting you the right drug to not actually worry about the actual happenings in your brain.

Ah! I think this would be an incredibly productive line of reasoning then. Maybe consciousness is like the term health. Both describe an incredibly complicated body of facts that depend on physical affairs plus certain attitudes. Do you have more to say here? You should definitely go first, because you found a pet project of mine!

&gt; Do those people understand what it's like to be them? I'm going to link a video... Essentially, brains will explain the current situation to itself, whether or not it's right. So these people may not actually understand why they act the way they do, but instead, just come up with plausible (though wrong) explanations for why they do.

Split brain cases are the realest. If you want another famous case, check out Phineas Gage. These cases are definitely good arguments against a clean kind of dualism. The human mind might seem unified, but it is pretty weird. I don't think acknowledging multiple 'under-minds' dissolves the problem of apparently unified experience though. Even if we are lying to ourselves, there is a way the lie seems. We believe something when we believe our lies. The fact that this is a whole-cloth invention is even stranger, IMO.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-11-20 04:02:27 :

&gt; Because there is nothing science can't observe and assimilate, right?

Well, yeah, but you can talk about the same topic from a scientific or non-scientific perspective. Just because science can address everything doesn't mean that you can't address anything from a non-scientific perspective. Anything that doesn't follow the scientific method would be extra-scientific, right?

&gt; By your reasoning, science assumes unobservables don't exist by definition, or something.

Well, more like they're Occam's razored away (I think I'm using that right?). Unobservables, by definition, can't affect anything. If they could, we could observe them in some capacity. If they can't affect anything, we can remove them as superfluous to the explanation.

&gt; Believing that two rational individuals seeking impartial truth can come to a deeper understanding through dialogue is far more important to philosophy, though. If you are completely comfortable with your current worldview, then you have less of a stake in exploring the issue.

Cool. I'm fine with all this. Though I do think I am fairly comfortable with my current worldview, just as a point of record.

&gt; They could fail as objects, fail as non-intentional, fail to be determined by natural law, or any combination there of.

Ok, cool, I'm fine with this too, but before we continue on this line, I'd like to acknowledge I more or less skipped over this definition as the terms confused me. So, at risk of asking the impossible, is there an example you could give of each of these failures, and a, if possible, more detailed explanation of them? Whether or not such an example does exist is unimportant, I just want a hypothetical example, because I don't really understand what ""failing as an object"" means, or ""failing as non-intentional"".

&gt; While there might be hidden determining variables in many of these events, many seem like genuine accidents.

It's not just a matter of hidden, it's a matter of quantity. If there are 100,000 interwoven causes, you won't be able to determine the outcome even if you know 90,000 of them, and that's already asking a lot. The three examples you gave are huge, mass user, things. Elections are determined by (in America) upwards of 100 million people. Who knows how many people engage in the stock market. And how many events happen in a single hour of your life, let alone days, or years! Of course you can't predict these things with certainty.

&gt; Because that would change the case.

And me not existing wouldn't?

&gt; How do we represent counter-factual events using only facts is a still deeper mystery.

As a side note, I feel like I skip over a lot of your responses, because there's a lot of language I don't understand. I end up quoting sentences I think I understand, and responding to them, so, if something I say is addressed earlier, it probably means I didn't understand what you meant.

I'm not sure what a ""counter-factual"" event is. Is it an event that can't be represented by facts (counter factual), or one represented by contradiction facts (counter-fact ual)? Or something else entirely?

&gt; It cuts both ways. The practical facts about right/left and perspective facts are things we have external access to. After all, we talk about other minds and other positions all the time. I believe the grounding facts are similar in both cases.

I'm having a bit of trouble parsing what you mean, but I don't find anything to disagree with here, so what does that mean?

&gt; If life is the game, then I do care about the code.

Only in certain scenarios. In life, you may care about the essential truths of the universe, but you don't really care about the essential truths of your morning toast. You eat it, and are on your way. Yes, there are interesting interactions to pay attention to there, if you care about them, like a biologist might care how your body breaks down the toast and stores it as energy. You don't though, all you need to know is that eating the toast makes you less hungry. I think this point was about the aliens who we wanted to explain humans to, and I'd say they'd be more like the you, and less like the biologist. Sure, a deeper understanding would be good, but the essentials can be gleaned from this superficial view: Eat toast, feel less hungry.

&gt; Do you have more to say here? You should definitely go first, because you found a pet project of mine!

Well, I hadn't planned on it, but it sounds like an interesting topic. I think that consciousness is a lot like health in that manner (Though it's a bit odd, because presumably, consciousness, being part of you, is part of your health, so you're relating something to a subset of itself, but I digress.). I believe this idea popped into my head when thinking about IBM's Watson. You may have heard of him doing Jeopardy, but apparently his actual job is to be a doctor robot (learned that from another video by that CGP grey guy I keep linking.). And, I've worked with machine learning before, and understand the gist of it, so I understand that when working with Big Data, you don't generally look for the causes, just correlations. i.e. in advertising, you may find that ads with purple featured, led to a higher increase in sales. Who knows why, who cares, let's make the ad purple. This is how businesses deal with machine learning, and presumably, it's how a doctor bot would. That was a bit of a ramble, so if this topic is interesting to you, don't feel like you have to respond to any of it, I was just trying to put thoughts out there for you to see. Sort of shooting in the dark.

&gt; Even if we are lying to ourselves, there is a way the lie seems. We believe something when we believe our lies. The fact that this is a whole-cloth invention is even stranger, IMO.

I don't know what you mean by ""whole-cloth invention"" but I agreed with most of this paragraph, or at least, didn't disagree, so I don't have much to say.

Completely off to the side, I just wanted to say I think this time around I was in a better mood, and, I think I'm trying (maybe not succeeding...) to do better about keeping an open mind. I know last time I responded I felt rather angry (not sure if that came across, sorry if it did.) Just, hope I don't annoy you or something, and I felt like I should say that for some reason.

KDJones @ 2016-11-20 17:34:19 :

&gt; Well, yeah, but you can talk about the same topic from a scientific or non-scientific perspective. Just because science can address everything doesn't mean that you can't address anything from a non-scientific perspective. Anything that doesn't follow the scientific method would be extra-scientific, right?

Sure, what if there is an incongruence though? In the case of differing reports, the edge goes to science; And, if science doesn't report something, it is safe to assume it isn't there, right?

&gt; Unobservables, by definition, can't affect anything. If they could, we could observe them in some capacity. If they can't affect anything, we can remove them as superfluous to the explanation.

Just so we are in agreement, are unobservables things that can't be observed in any capacity or things that can't be observed directly? Either definition is fine.

&gt; It's not just a matter of hidden, it's a matter of quantity. If there are 100,000 interwoven causes, you won't be able to determine the outcome even if you know 90,000 of them, and that's already asking a lot.

That's why people don't use deterministic models for these phenomena. They are super-complex and super chaotic.

&gt; The three examples you gave are huge, mass user, things. Elections are determined by (in America) upwards of 100 million people. Who knows how many people engage in the stock market. And how many events happen in a single hour of your life, let alone days, or years! Of course you can't predict these things with certainty.

I want to push this point beyond a question of knowledge. Of course the difficulty of this task makes this kind of knowledge exceedingly unlikely. I would also like to push past the knowledge claim though. As far as we can tell, these things really are the way they seem. Maybe determinism isn't true.

&gt; And me not existing wouldn't?

The idea is to re-describe the case in a way that only excludes you. This implies setting the same scene with the same relative sequence of events expect the events involving you. In philosophy, this kind of reasoning, changing a small detail in a case and noting the change in truth conditions, is known as modal logic.

In modal logic, one considers parallel sets of events, known as possible worlds. Considering all the possible worlds that include me without you allows us to see how given truth values vary. For example, when we consider how you not existing affects this case, all things being equal, we need to consider a state of affairs as close to the actual one as we can: same non-relational properties, same objects, same natural laws, etc.

&gt; I'm not sure what a ""counter-factual"" event is. Is it an event that can't be represented by facts (counter factual), or one represented by contradiction facts (counter-fact ual)? Or something else entirely?

Counter-factual is another word for modal. I thought it would make more sense to a lay audience. This is a huge topic, (like 70 papers a year huge). There is a lot I'm leaving out, so feel free to ask lots of questions 

&gt; I'm having a bit of trouble parsing what you mean, but I don't find anything to disagree with here, so what does that mean?

I was mostly agreeing with you on the first half. The second half is where the action is at. If you tell me what you think that means, I can give you some feedback about whether you are on the right track.

****************

&gt; Ok, cool, I'm fine with this too, but before we continue on this line, I'd like to acknowledge I more or less skipped over this definition as the terms confused me. So, at risk of asking the impossible, is there an example you could give of each of these failures, and a, if possible, more detailed explanation of them? Whether or not such an example does exist is unimportant, I just want a hypothetical example, because I don't really understand what ""failing as an object"" means, or ""failing as non-intentional"".

Here goes nothing:

Intentional objects (Not non-intentional objects): Imaginary constructs such as unicorns, Projected outcomes such as my plan for today, or perhaps colors and other qualitative properties.

Non-objects: formal patterns as opposed to the matter they are composed of, things that unfold over time as opposed to being wholy present in one moment, things that can't be captured within a single within any single mental act (e.i. seeing a particular baseball, smelling particular flowers, tasting particular mushrooms, etc.)

Non-determinate things: Things that behave according to stocastic models, the apparent freedom of human choice, things that are grounded in accidents rather than the determination of natural laws.

&gt; In life, you may care about the essential truths of the universe, but you don't really care about the essential truths of your morning toast... Sure, a deeper understanding would be good, but the essentials can be gleaned from this superficial view: Eat toast, feel less hungry.

I think this is the difference between the philosophers temperment and the scientists. I tend to question every event big or small, systematic or frivolous, for some obscured meaning. It is slightly unfair to pick on your example, but we could ask why we buy this particular brand of bread, why we adopted the practice of toasting, why society has tended to lend itself to these two conditions, etc. Unreflectively eating what you are given marks the end of inquiry. If you are curious, then you'll always be hungry.

&gt;  I think that consciousness is a lot like health in that manner (Though it's a bit odd, because presumably, consciousness, being part of you, is part of your health, so you're relating something to a subset of itself, but I digress.)

They are clearly related and understanding one a certain way affects our understanding of the other. However, I figured you'd say something like, ""health/consciousness is a part of..."" I think this is a weird thing to say, since their is no given part of your body that is the healthy. Health is a property of a system, not a part of a system. In this sense, I think consciousness and health are similair.

Health isn't a mystical property, but it isn't reducible to a uniform body of laws applicable across all cases. Medicine as a practice spends a great deal of effort caring for individual patients; this individual emphasis means that many prescriptions for health are based on accidental facts about particular people. Consciousness also depends of the very particular circumstances we find ourselves in. A particular experience is the result of innumerable accidents being presented as a cohesive picture. No laws can account for this radical contingency without becoming non-generalizable.

&gt;  I believe this idea popped into my head when thinking about IBM's Watson. You may have heard of him doing Jeopardy, but apparently his actual job is to be a doctor robot (learned that from another video by that CGP grey guy I keep linking.). And, I've worked with machine learning before, and understand the gist of it, so I understand that when working with Big Data, you don't generally look for the causes, just correlations. i.e. in advertising, you may find that ads with purple featured, led to a higher increase in sales.

That was a bit of a ramble, so if this topic is interesting to you, don't feel like you have to respond to any of it, I was just trying to put thoughts out there for you to see. Sort of shooting in the dark.

I think you are right. Machines care about correlations in data over the very complex and nuanced conception of cause that humans are attatched to. By just caring about correlations, the machine presents us with all the potentially real relationships for us to comb through for meaningful causes. 

If society ever gets its act together, people might collect personal medical data about themselves all the time. With all of this data, we might discover hidden laws of health that our limited perspective missed due to the complexity of the topic. I guess this is also the analogy you would like to draw with experience. However, it is still 'up to us' as humans to give meaning to the machines answers. If we comb through the correlations and pick out everything we find relevant to health/consciousness, then we already know what we are looking for. If we are discussing which theories are best supported prima facie, then we need to examine the assumptions we would use to make this choice.

&gt; Completely off to the side, I just wanted to say I think this time around I was in a better mood, and, I think I'm trying (maybe not succeeding...) to do better about keeping an open mind. I know last time I responded I felt rather angry (not sure if that came across, sorry if it did.) Just, hope I don't annoy you or something, and I felt like I should say that for some reason.

Don't sweat it; I've been frustrated plenty of times during this discussion. That is the best part of a dialogue: we get to explore issues through a rational lens and an emotional one. Frankly, there have been times where I goaded you into a response with the expectation that it would shake you up. Changing minds doesn't happen without an emotional connection.

awenonian @ 2016-11-27 04:23:09 :

&gt; In the case of differing reports, the edge goes to science; 

Hmm, I see your point, and don't have an appropriate response. But I think the next sentence provides a bit of insight.

&gt; And, if science doesn't report something, it is safe to assume it isn't there, right?

If something fails to show up while following the scientific method, but does show up when not, then I'd argue that your experiment is flawed to some degree. Though, I will grant, science is given precedence still. If a claim is given, but under scientific inquiry we fail to show it (or, if we're doing it right, do our best to not just fail to show it, but succeed to show it is absent), then it is, yes assumed it isn't there.

&gt; Just so we are in agreement, are unobservables things that can't be observed in any capacity or things that can't be observed directly? Either definition is fine.

Any capacity.

&gt; As far as we can tell, these things really are the way they seem. Maybe determinism isn't true.

The issue is that these things only seem non-deterministic from a macroscopic perspective. Once you start narrowing down, and examining singular events with small amounts of causes, the world seems exceedingly deterministic.

&gt; The idea is to re-describe the case in a way that only excludes you. This implies setting the same scene with the same relative sequence of events expect the events involving you. In philosophy, this kind of reasoning, changing a small detail in a case and noting the change in truth conditions, is known as modal logic.

The only thing is I fail to see how removing me entirely changes less than moving my position slightly. Surely it's more of a change to change everything about me from existing to non-existing than it is to simply change my position from point A to point B. At the very least, it's only as many changes (if you would argue that I'd have to change all my decisions up to that point to end up at a different point.)

&gt; Counter-factual is another word for modal. I thought it would make more sense to a lay audience. This is a huge topic, (like 70 papers a year huge). There is a lot I'm leaving out, so feel free to ask lots of questions

I think I understand enough for now, but I may come up with more later.

&gt; Intentional objects (Not non-intentional objects): Imaginary constructs such as unicorns, Projected outcomes such as my plan for today, or perhaps colors and other qualitative properties.

&gt; Non-objects: formal patterns as opposed to the matter they are composed of, things that unfold over time as opposed to being wholy present in one moment, things that can't be captured within a single within any single mental act (e.i. seeing a particular baseball, smelling particular flowers, tasting particular mushrooms, etc.)

&gt; Non-determinate things: Things that behave according to stocastic models, the apparent freedom of human choice, things that are grounded in accidents rather than the determination of natural laws.

Ok, cool, I think I understand. So, with this, I'd have to argue the definition of physical. 

Intentional objects: I'd say that if these intentional objects are made of physical objects (which has been the subject of our argument numerous times, and I think we've come to the conclusion that we can't really know one way or the other.) then calling this non-physical would be odd.

Non-objects: What about a pattern, like those you'd find in elementary school. Circle, square, circle, square. Now, this would, by this definition be non-physical, despite being made of nothing but physical objects the whole time. Right? That seems silly to me.

Non-determinant: So, I think I talked of quantum mechanics before, and you said I've also said to ignore quantum mechanics before. But, I'd like to bring them up here. It seems that there is some randomness to the universe, which I think would be non-deterministic, but calling electrons non-physical, because they're quantum seems odd. Though then we have the issue in that we can quantify the statistical likelihood of one outcome or another (accurately), so how does that square on the deterministic front? If other things can be quantified in such a way, would they count as deterministic or not? I'm not certain that there's anything we couldn't quantify in such a way.

&gt; Unreflectively eating what you are given marks the end of inquiry. If you are curious, then you'll always be hungry.

While I admire this to a degree, I can't imagine you're actually being genuine. This sounds positively exhausting. Every second of your life is a new unique scenario, and you can't possibly question every single one of them, not least because that would cause a feedback loop of questioning your questions. I get that you question a lot of things, but there have to be some things you just accept, lest you question yourself into complete inaction. Which was kind of my point, at some point, you just have to pragmatically say, let's stop questioning, and start doing.

&gt; Health is a property of a system, not a part of a system. In this sense, I think consciousness and health are similair.

Sure, I agree on this point. I suppose I misspoke.

&gt; Health isn't a mystical property, but it isn't reducible to a uniform body of laws applicable across all cases. Medicine as a practice spends a great deal of effort caring for individual patients;

Only because everyone's specific body is different, just as everyone's specific brain is different.

&gt; No laws can account for this radical contingency without becoming non-generalizable.

I don't think this is true. For example, your stomach is not identical to mine, but they both digest food in a similar manner. We have an understanding of the processes our bodies undergoes, even if they aren't exactly identical.

Maybe you mean that no laws could fully encompass all eventualities, but I still think this is false. I think no set of laws could *pragmatically* encompass all eventualities, but if you had enough processing, you could gather all the necessary variables to fully define an individual in a way that could be useful for determining ""health"".

Actually, thinking about what I just said, I may have conceded your point, in that I said that you could fully define an *individual* (which would lose generality). So, I suppose, I should be arguing that only the variables change from individual to individual, not the laws themselves. I would argue this would be accurate (still not within the grasp of human processing capability, probably not even current computer processing capability, but still possible)

&gt; Machines care about correlations in data over the very complex and nuanced conception of cause that humans are attatched to.

Not a real disagreement, but it's not just machines. People don't care either in business situations, as it's simply not as cost effective to spend the effort to find the causes when just the correlations will do.

&gt; If society ever gets its act together, people might collect personal medical data about themselves all the time.

Again, not a real disagreement, but it'd really be an ethics argument about whether that's society ""getting it's act together"" or becoming more like 1984... That data would only be useful in the large volumes of individuals, there wouldn't be much you could glean from yourself (or at least, there'd be less you could glean from yourself only). But I digress.

&gt; I guess this is also the analogy you would like to draw with experience.

Yes, exactly.

&gt; However, it is still 'up to us' as humans to give meaning to the machines answers. If we comb through the correlations and pick out everything we find relevant to health/consciousness, then we already know what we are looking for. 

Yeah, but this isn't necessarily a problem. I'm not certain your feelings on the matter, but this is part of the scientific method. It generally goes (at least in a simplified manner) ""If this is the case, then this is what I'd expect to see under these circumstances"" You test those circumstances, and see if you confirm your hypothesis. It seems to me what you've said has confused known unknowns with knowns, if that makes sense.

&gt; If we are discussing which theories are best supported prima facie, then we need to examine the assumptions we would use to make this choice.

Yeah, I don't have anything to disagree with there.

&gt; Don't sweat it;

Cool, glad to know no hard feelings.

This is curiosly close to my position. I think science is just one part of the wider human project of knowledge acquisition. Scientific knowledge isn't necessarily foundational to knowledge in general and scientific descriptions aren't essential descriptions. That is why I think first-person experience can push against scientific materialism in the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, more like they're Occam's razored away... Unobservables, by definition, can't affect anything. If they could, we could observe them in some capacity. If they can't affect anything, we can remove them as superfluous to the explanation.

&gt;&gt; Just so we are in agreement, are unobservables things that can't be observed in any capacity or things that can't be observed directly? Either definition is fine.

&gt; Any capacity

That's fine; I don't know if I have much to say here then. I would include things like cause or being, perhaps even force and mass, as unobservables, since a given body of observations can support multiple interpretations with respect to these things. Oberservation can determine things like relative velocity, relative distance, relative brightness, etc, since they are exhausted by the contents of the observation. The observation that my car is moving, for example, gives definite evidence for just one thing, (The car is moving at X m/s), but it leaves the cause of the motion open to debate, (Motion is caused by the motor, by someone pushing, by gravity, ect.)

This isn't too important though, so I don't want to beat you over the head with it.

&gt; The issue is that these things only seem non-deterministic from a macroscopic perspective. Once you start narrowing down, and examining singular events with small amounts of causes, the world seems exceedingly deterministic.

What perspective should we trust, then? At the widest perspective, things seem chaotic. At an intermediate perspective, things seem like clockwork. Smaller still though, things seem chaotic again. If the book ends are chaotic, then I tend to think that the middle stuff just seems deterministic.

&gt; The only thing is I fail to see how removing me entirely changes less than moving my position slightly. Surely it's more of a change to change everything about me from existing to non-existing than it is to simply change my position from point A to point B. At the very least, it's only as many changes (if you would argue that I'd have to change all my decisions up to that point to end up at a different point.)

The changes are smaller with regards to the truth condition we are most interested in testing, ""How you existing affects to truth value of specific claims."" We were interested in whether the truth conditions of two agent relative claims, or an agent relative claim and an objective claim, directly depend on each other. 

Direct truth dependence is necesarry for reducing the truth of one claim to another. You claimed that, 'This is to the left of me' is equivalent to some objective claim like, 'Thing has position P, momentum M, velocity V, ect.' You also claimed that one agent relative claim can be reduced to another agent relative claim, 'This is to the right of me just means it is to the left of you.' By worrying about just whether you exist, everything else being equal, we can test these claims.

&gt; Intentional objects: I'd say that if these intentional objects are made of physical objects (which has been the subject of our argument numerous times, and I think we've come to the conclusion that we can't really know one way or the other.) then calling this non-physical would be odd.

I definitely don't think this is a jump ball. There are major inconsistencies between intentional descriptions and physical, objective descriptions, including perspective relativity. There may be a way to square these inconsistencies, but I haven't seen it yet. I would say the burden is on you to prove that you can reduce one category to another. We both agree that there are physical things and that there are ideas. It is up to you to provide proof for a thrid claim: these two things are reducible to one another.

&gt; Non-objects: What about a pattern, like those you'd find in elementary school. Circle, square, circle, square. Now, this would, by this definition be non-physical, despite being made of nothing but physical objects the whole time. Right? That seems silly to me.

I agree it would be silly to say that the series of wooden blocks that go through kindergarten peg-holes isn't physical. It is traditional in philosophy to distinguish the form of something from its matter. So, the pattern, 'Circle, square, circle, square', is physical where it is substantiated but non-physical when considered as an abstraction or as a mathematical description or something. I don't know how much I buy this either, but I was the clearest example I could give.

&gt; Non-determinant: So, I think I talked of quantum mechanics before, and you said I've also said to ignore quantum mechanics before. But, I'd like to bring them up here. It seems that there is some randomness to the universe, which I think would be non-deterministic, but calling electrons non-physical, because they're quantum seems odd. Though then we have the issue in that we can quantify the statistical likelihood of one outcome or another (accurately), so how does that square on the deterministic front? If other things can be quantified in such a way, would they count as deterministic or not? I'm not certain that there's anything we couldn't quantify in such a way.

1. QM is creepy. Many people, physicists included, have suggested that QM leads to a kind of idealism. In this regard, maybe electrons are just ideas, not physical at all. I think this is undesireable, but it is worth saying.

2. Determinism is a logical condition, ""Every thing is determined by some thing."" If there is one event that isn't determinately attributable to another event, then determinism is false. This isn't a matter of knowledge of every determining factor, though. In theory, you could prove determinism by definition or through a set proof without checking every individual chain.

&gt; While I admire this to a degree, I can't imagine you're actually being genuine. This sounds positively exhausting. Every second of your life is a new unique scenario, and you can't possibly question every single one of them, not least because that would cause a feedback loop of questioning your questions. I get that you question a lot of things, but there have to be some things you just accept, lest you question yourself into complete inaction. Which was kind of my point, at some point, you just have to pragmatically say, let's stop questioning, and start doing.

Welcome to philosophy, kid. I do agree that the standards are insane; if you want to see some truly insane attempts at this kind of life, I suggest you look up Sextus Empiricus. However, this is also just what it means to be a human being faced with the responsibility of living. We can't abdicate our responsibility to act under our own conscience. If we find ourselves questioning why we make certain assumptions and why certain assumption should be believed, then we can't just satisfy these questions with busy work. This isn't a matter of principle; It is a matter of psychology. Doubt can only be tamed head on. Work arounds leave doubt untouched.

&gt;&gt; No laws can account for this radical contingency without becoming non-generalizable.

&gt; I don't think this is true. For example, your stomach is not identical to mine, but they both digest food in a similar manner. We have an understanding of the processes our bodies undergoes, even if they aren't exactly identical.

Perhaps the functional similarities between our stomachs are more basic than the health of either individual, though. Our stomachs and a pig's stomach are also very similar. This doesn't necessarily mean my health or your health is like the pig's health. These anatomic similarities are attributable to bottom-up causes like evolutionary pressure and shared ancestry rather than similar top-down metrics like health or intention.

&gt; Maybe you mean that no laws could fully encompass all eventualities, but I still think this is false. I think no set of laws could pragmatically encompass all eventualities, but if you had enough processing, you could gather all the necessary variables to fully define an individual in a way that could be useful for determining ""health"".
Actually, thinking about what I just said, I may have conceded your point, in that I said that you could fully define an individual (which would lose generality). So, I suppose, I should be arguing that only the variables change from individual to individual, not the laws themselves. I would argue this would be accurate (still not within the grasp of human processing capability, probably not even current computer processing capability, but still possible).

What you're saying isn't impossible, but it is a toss-up. Unlike the previous point about reducibility and intentionality, I genuinely can't tell which way this will break. I don't know how similar we are or how radically different individuals are. It is a genuine mystery, but very interesting.

&gt; Cool, glad to know no hard feelings.

Good to hear. I've really enjoyed our conversation so far. I hope you are getting what you want out of it. I definitely appreciate your time and patience. I know these discussion take a lot of effort just to type out, let alone offer a serious reply.

awenonian @ 2016-12-01 22:49:56 :

&gt; I would include things like cause or being, perhaps even force and mass, as unobservables, since a given body of observations can support multiple interpretations with respect to these things.

It seems odd to me that you'd include force or mass as unobservables, given we have tools that measure those quantities. I can certainly see a reason for you saying cause is unobservable, as, presumably, when you start observing you've already ""missed"" the causes (they had to happen before), though if you're willing to extrapolate a bit, you could potentially recreate a similar scenario to find out what the causes likely were. I'm not quite sure what you mean by being. Do you mean existence, or something else? Because it seems odd to me that you'd say we couldn't observe whether things existed, but I can't think of what else it might refer to.

&gt; What perspective should we trust, then? At the widest perspective, things seem chaotic. At an intermediate perspective, things seem like clockwork. Smaller still though, things seem chaotic again.

I would probably say the narrowest, as a ""wider"" perspective is pretty much defined as a group of narrower perspectives, if that makes sense. And while at the smallest perspective, things seem chaotic, they're consistently chaotic. That is, we can determine the probability of outcomes to a very specific degree. Maybe the intermediate perspective does just ""seem"" deterministic, but the consistency in the probability of outcomes lends itself to things acting, mostly, how we expect them to from a deterministic perspective. I feel like that makes the narrowest perspective not really ""non-deterministic"" but some sort of ""partially-deterministic"" for lack of better verbiage.

&gt; We were interested in whether the truth conditions of two agent relative claims, or an agent relative claim and an objective claim, directly depend on each other.

Can you evaluate an agent relative claim without the agent existing?

&gt; You claimed that, 'This is to the left of me' is equivalent to some objective claim like, 'Thing has position P, momentum M, velocity V, ect.'

Well, isn't saying ""This is to the left of me"" basically the same as saying ""This object's x coordinate is greater than mine""? That seems like an objective claim similar to ""This thing has position P"" to me.

&gt; You also claimed that one agent relative claim can be reduced to another agent relative claim, 'This is to the right of me just means it is to the left of you.'

Oh, did I actually say that? I'd have to rescind that then. The claim ""This is to the right of me means it is to the left of you"" isn't for certain true under any circumstances. Like if I say ""X is less than 12"" that doesn't tell you anything about X's position relative to 5. There are other, similar, statements where this could be accurate: ""This is to the right of me means it is to the right of you"" is true if I am to the right of you, which is similar to ""X is less than 12"" telling you that X must also be less than 15.

&gt; I would say the burden is on you to prove that you can reduce one category to another. We both agree that there are physical things and that there are ideas. It is up to you to provide proof for a thrid claim: these two things are reducible to one another.

Sure, I think my main point here was that this was the subject of our discussion, and we hadn't yet come to a conclusion (we're still discussing).

&gt; is physical where it is substantiated but non-physical when considered as an abstraction or as a mathematical description or something

This really seems to be just a continuation of the first one (intentional objects). If ideas did happen to be physical (which is what I'm trying to reduce these claims down to really), then there would be no way for a pattern to exist without being substantiated. Either it's an abstraction made of physical ideas, or it's written down somewhere, or whatever. (again, assuming ideas are physical)

&gt; This isn't a matter of knowledge of every determining factor, though.

Like you said, QM is weird, but this actually doesn't provide an excuse. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden_variable_theory) is, admittedly, a Wikipedia article talking about ""local hidden variable theory"". The main line I want to draw attention to is this: ""Bell's 1964 paper (see Bell's theorem) showed that local hidden variables cannot reproduce the quantum measurement correlations that quantum mechanics predicts."" Essentially, without faster than light interactions, there aren't actually determining factors: it is truly random. This, as far as I know, disproves determinism, but I don't think that calling particles non-physical because of it is a reasonable thing to do.

&gt; These anatomic similarities are attributable to bottom-up causes like evolutionary pressure and shared ancestry rather than similar top-down metrics like health or intention.

Admittedly, I find this comparison to be a bit silly. Clearly there are a lot more differences between me and a pig than me and you.

But regardless, I don't know how you could definitively make the claim that things like health (if we had an agreed upon definition of health), could not be determined by a set of laws. I suppose, like you said, this is still the disconnect between us, I assume it is just a difference of variables between us, and you assume there's something more. I don't know what more you imagine to be different between us though.

&gt; I don't know how similar we are or how radically different individuals are. It is a genuine mystery, but very interesting.

Well, humans in general are very similar. We all have similar anatomy, and if you go to DNA, we share more than 99% (I want to say more than 99.9%) with every other human. The bits that make you not-me are very small in comparison to the entire make up of you.

On a somewhat unrelated note: here's a question that just came to mind: If ideas are not physical, where do they come from? Restated, when did they start? You were put together by cellular processes in your mother's womb, and some of those cells became neurons, but where would non-physical thoughts have come from?

&gt; Good to hear. I've really enjoyed our conversation so far. I hope you are getting what you want out of it. I definitely appreciate your time and patience. I know these discussion take a lot of effort just to type out, let alone offer a serious reply.

Yeah, it's been good.

KDJones @ 2016-12-02 17:06:28 :

&gt; It seems odd to me that you'd include force or mass as unobservables, given we have tools that measure those quantities.

We interpret the results of these measurements against a background of existing theories. For example, we assume that the deflection of the needle on a super-market produce scale corresponds to a certain mass, because of assumptions about the compression of springs, the distribution of Forces on the spring, and the relationship Mass and the force of Gravity. All these assumption are validated every single day, but we don't get these assumption from the raw observation. We read these things into the case through our models.

&gt;  I can certainly see a reason for you saying cause is unobservable, as, presumably, when you start observing you've already ""missed"" the causes (they had to happen before), though if you're willing to extrapolate a bit, you could potentially recreate a similar scenario to find out what the causes likely were.

I'm really not trying to play the skeptic here. I'm fine with knowledge about causes, even with we aren't directly acquainted with essential causal chains in themselves. You seem to agree that causation is only know through inference, or something like that.

&gt;  I'm not quite sure what you mean by being. Do you mean existence, or something else? Because it seems odd to me that you'd say we couldn't observe whether things existed, but I can't think of what else it might refer to.

Existence works. The same is true here as was true in causation. We can't tell just from an impression whether something is real or an illusion. It isn't until we are able to make multiple observation to test against one another that we are able to verify whether our observations represent the actual state of affairs, (""It exists""), or whether it is a misrepresentation, (""It isn't actually there."").

&gt; I would probably say the narrowest, as a ""wider"" perspective is pretty much defined as a group of narrower perspectives, if that makes sense.

It makes sense; I just disagree. I think the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

&gt; And while at the smallest perspective, things seem chaotic, they're consistently chaotic. That is, we can determine the probability of outcomes to a very specific degree. Maybe the intermediate perspective does just ""seem"" deterministic, but the consistency in the probability of outcomes lends itself to things acting, mostly, how we expect them to from a deterministic perspective. I feel like that makes the narrowest perspective not really ""non-deterministic"" but some sort of ""partially-deterministic"" for lack of better verbiage.

I agree that if we make our job easier and just limit ourselves to the problems that we can reliably make predictions on, then we can make reliable predictions. However, I don't assert that the world must be arranged in convenient moduals for my understanding. There is a domain that I have understanding of as a human being and as someone that's read up on some of our science. I assume that the things I don't understand are radically different from the things I do understand.

&gt; Can you evaluate an agent relative claim without the agent existing?

I was evaluating them as false, because there isn't a relationship that would make, ""That is to the left of you"", true. There doesn't exist a relationship such that, That is to the left of you, is true.

&gt; Well, isn't saying ""This is to the left of me"" basically the same as saying ""This object's x coordinate is greater than mine""? That seems like an objective claim similar to ""This thing has position P"" to me.

You're right! I shouldn't have mentioned relative measurements. That was kind of my whole point. We were talking about objective descriptions vs relative descriptions. Oops...

&gt; Oh, did I actually say that? I'd have to rescind that then. The claim ""This is to the right of me means it is to the left of you"" isn't for certain true under any circumstances. Like if I say ""X is less than 12"" that doesn't tell you anything about X's position relative to 5. There are other, similar, statements where this could be accurate: ""This is to the right of me means it is to the right of you"" is true if I am to the right of you, which is similar to ""X is less than 12"" telling you that X must also be less than 15.

You might not have realized what I was asking. I am not the easiest person to parse. We're on the same page here.

&gt; This really seems to be just a continuation of the first one (intentional objects). If ideas did happen to be physical (which is what I'm trying to reduce these claims down to really), then there would be no way for a pattern to exist without being substantiated. 

What about abstract objects that aren't in our minds, though? Many Mathematicians would say that the things they study are mind independent objects that they discover through mathematical tools. It is a fairly popular view within the philosophy of math, (nearly the majority view according to philpapers).

&gt; The main line I want to draw attention to is this: ""Bell's 1964 paper (see Bell's theorem) showed that local hidden variables cannot reproduce the quantum measurement correlations that quantum mechanics predicts."" Essentially, without faster than light interactions, there aren't actually determining factors: it is truly random. This, as far as I know, disproves determinism, but I don't think that calling particles non-physical because of it is a reasonable thing to do.

Certainly not, I don't think the issue just hinges on determinism here. Non-local hidden vairable theories are still viable, even considering Bell's theorem, so determinism is still possible. I think things like to observer effect and the lack of definite position and/or velocity also make the case for some real spooky stuff.

&gt; Admittedly, I find this comparison to be a bit silly. Clearly there are a lot more differences between me and a pig than me and you.

It's a matter of degree though, not kind. My body is the same as your body in the same way as my body is the same as a pig's body. It's just not similar to the degree that our bodies are similar to one another. Anatomical comparisons are mostly phylogenic comparisons between the structure in two bodies and the structures in a shared ancestor. Functional properties come with epidemiology.

&gt; But regardless, I don't know how you could definitively make the claim that things like health (if we had an agreed upon definition of health), could not be determined by a set of laws. I suppose, like you said, this is still the disconnect between us, I assume it is just a difference of variables between us, and you assume there's something more. I don't know what more you imagine to be different between us though.

It has to do with the paranthetical there. If we just agreed on an arbitrary but adequate definition, then this could be a trivial task. We could just pick a definition that works well for our tools and get to work. Helping some sick people is better than none, and helping more is better than helping less.

However, if we want to predict what health is without a complete definition or using a definition that is incredibly complex, then settling an abitrary artificial definition would defeat the purpose of the exercise. Given that we are exploring what health is and what consciousness is rather than testing for what things are healthy or what things are conscious, the second kind of exercise seems called for.

&gt; Well, humans in general are very similar. We all have similar anatomy, and if you go to DNA, we share more than 99% (I want to say more than 99.9%) with every other human. The bits that make you not-me are very small in comparison to the entire make up of you.

On the other hand, we don't share any actual parts. No physical part of me has ever been part of you. We've never experienced the same events or objects, (presumably). We have many functional similarities, like two cars of the same year, model, and make. But, we don't share 99.9% of our actual histories.

&gt; On a somewhat unrelated note: here's a question that just came to mind: If ideas are not physical, where do they come from? Restated, when did they start? You were put together by cellular processes in your mother's womb, and some of those cells became neurons, but where would non-physical thoughts have come from?

Excellent questions! I would say that ideas are a kind of assertive action. We accomplish these action through behavior using our physical bodies and mutual recognition from outside subjects. The physical behavior without the expectation of mutual recognition isn't enough to produce an idea and vice versa. In this repsect, ideas have two 'sources': anatomical fact and our sociological history. However, only one thing causes ideas: the accidental union of the two.

Example
Let's say you stub your toe. Special neurons fire causing a cascade of reflexive physiological reactions. Your awareness of these reflexive reactions coincides with your awareness of your comportment towards others. The act of reorienting your comportment in light of these reflexive reaction is the idea of pain. If it really hurts, you might cry out, you might curse, you might tell youself to 'man-up'. This is what it means to be in pain; Pain is what makes you want to act in a certain way.

You need a body to have an idea, (EI. a brain), but you also need to be conditioned to communicate complicated states of affairs to others. In this sense, ideas are relational. My experience of pain is conditioned by my particular history, my performative ability, my societial relations- my general ability to be recognized by others. The context sensetivity and contingency of these factors makes ideas impossible to generalize into determinate rules or objectify into a physical mechanism.

awenonian @ 2016-12-02 19:33:30 :

&gt; All these assumption are validated every single day, but we don't get these assumption from the raw observation. We read these things into the case through our models.

I mean, there's some truth in that, but those assumptions came from somewhere. We didn't just start using springs to measure mass, until we understood how springs work. I'm not well versed in the history of springs, and how we figured out gravity, and whatnot, but they did come from somewhere, right? We didn't just strap a spring suspended platform to a dial and say, ""yeah, that'll do to measure mass, I'm sure it's good enough.""

&gt; We can't tell just from an impression whether something is real or an illusion.

Oh, that makes sense.

&gt; It isn't until we are able to make multiple observation to test against one another that we are able to verify whether our observations represent the actual state of affairs,

But weren't we talking about sets of observations? So, we'd have multiple observations, yeah? Regardless, this does make sense to me.

&gt; It makes sense; I just disagree. I think the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

So, I've heard that as a saying before, but I have trouble thinking of what it might mean literally. What more could the whole be than the sum of it's parts? If anything more is added, wouldn't that just be another part?

&gt; I assume that the things I don't understand are radically different from the things I do understand.

Is that a reasonable assumption to make? It seems odd to me, as if the things you do understand are similar, and the only difference between things you do and don't understand is that you do or don't understand them, why would that change how similar they are?

&gt; I was evaluating them as false,

But there's a third option: I'd think that evaluating them as nonsense would make more sense. Evaluating whether something is to my left in a world where I don't exist makes as much sense as ""this sentence is false"". Just because there's no situation in which ""this sentence is false"" is true, doesn't mean it's false.

&gt; What about abstract objects that aren't in our minds, though?

If it's not represented in a mind, or written on paper, or something, where is it?

&gt; Many Mathematicians would say that the things they study are mind independent objects that they discover through mathematical tools.

This seems odd to me. Isn't math pretty much an entirely human concept? Math is useful for defining things, but it's much like language, it's definitions and stuff are created by us. How could that be mind independent?

&gt; Non-local hidden vairable theories are still viable, even considering Bell's theorem, so determinism is still possible.

I suppose that's true, but we don't want to assume determinism, right? And if particles are non-deterministic, then using non-determinant as a category for non-physical seems odd.

&gt; It's a matter of degree though, not kind. My body is the same as your body in the same way as my body is the same as a pig's body.

Is it? I mean, our bodies have the same organs, a pigs doesn't (I assume, I'm not greatly familiar with either human or pig anatomy, but I know that something like a cow has 4 stomachs, so, I assume there are differences between us an pigs).

&gt; It has to do with the paranthetical there. If we just agreed on an arbitrary but adequate definition, then this could be a trivial task.

Without that agreed definition, it's not a matter of ""no laws could do it without losing generality"", it's just a matter of ""no laws could do it"". You can't interpret what to do with results if you don't know what you're trying to do.

&gt; However, if we want to predict what health is without a complete definition or using a definition that is incredibly complex, then settling an abitrary artificial definition would defeat the purpose of the exercise. 

To start, I'd like to say I'm not sure there will be a definition that isn't incredibly complex.

&gt; Given that we are exploring what health is and what consciousness is rather than testing for what things are healthy or what things are conscious, the second kind of exercise seems called for.

Sure, but I don't think we'd get far without a definition.

&gt; We have many functional similarities, like two cars of the same year, model, and make. But, we don't share 99.9% of our actual histories.

That make a lot of sense. I don't have anything to say in response to that.

&gt; In this repsect, ideas have two 'sources': anatomical fact and our sociological history. However, only one thing causes ideas: the accidental union of the two.

I'm gonna jump around the following paragraphs to deal with this.

&gt; You need a body to have an idea, (EI. a brain), but you also need to be conditioned to communicate complicated states of affairs to others.

That latter condition seems suspect to me. Would someone raised without human contact not still have ideas?

&gt; The act of reorienting your comportment in light of these reflexive reaction is the idea of pain.

So, do babies have ideas? They certainly can feel pain, and will do things like cry when they feel it. But I don't think they do this reorienting, as far as I know.

&gt; The context sensetivity and contingency of these factors makes ideas impossible to generalize into determinate rules or objectify into a physical mechanism.

Well, I gave an explanation for how a brain might encompass these factors in a physical manner a while back (neural connections rewire), that if I remember you didn't have too much problem with, just said we aren't sure this is how it works. My point with that is ""impossible"" seems a bit harsh

&gt; In this repsect, ideas have two 'sources': anatomical fact and our sociological history.

So, coming back to this, at what point does non-physical enter the equation? When in your sociological history did something non-physical happen?

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-09 17:17:06 :

The context sensetivity and contingency of these factors makes ideas impossible to generalize into determinate rules or objectify into a physical mechanism.[4]

I know this seems self-indulgent, but I really didn't want to lose the kern of this. It is probably my best positive account of non-physicalism with regard to the mind, so I wanted to focus on the response as a whole

1. At what point does non-physical enter the equation? When in your sociological history did something non-physical happen?
2. That latter condition seems suspect to me. Would someone raised without human contact not still have ideas?
3. So, do babies have ideas? They certainly can feel pain, and will do things like cry when they feel it. But I don't think they do this reorienting, as far as I know.

My point with that is ""impossible"" seems a bit harsh.

I'm going to anwer 1 and 4 as a pair and 2 and 3 as a pair, beginning with 2 and 3.

2&amp;3: I understand your skepticism here. On one hand, I'm suggesting that ideas that seem engrained in our natures are learned, (e.g. that pain is a social construct), or that ideas that we seem to learn are innate, (e.g. babies having a theory of other minds). However, I don't think either assumption is necessary for what I'm saying to ring true.

I am attempting to give an account of what a non-physial idea would be like in general. I don't want to make any claims about how ideas actually function or exist. I'm not a psychologist and don't have the relevant data, even if I understood the theories. I don't know whether purely feral children or newborns do or do not experience pain as we do. I lean towards yes, but that is independent of the main claim.

I say yes, because certain modes of behavior have been shown to be somewhat innate. Chomsky's generative grammar combined with contemporary research in linguistics gives support to the idea that language is a singular capacity accross all humans. Perhaps primitive, visceral pain is like the basal capacity for language.

1&amp;4: Unfortunately, this goes back to our discussion about intentionality. There isn't a single experience of a non-physical thing during our sociological history. Rather, our entire sociological landscape is defined in terms of higher-order intentional relationships among groups of people. Every experience exhibits intentionality; it is impossible to transcend this intentional framework and experience things as they 'really' are.

If the sociological explanation is true, and not a convenient fiction that matches with practical accuracy with the essentially physical descriptions, then we must account for our sociological encounters just as we must acount for our physical encounters. If this accounting requires us to speak in intentional terms, then we should take this as an indication that intetionality exists robustly.

Your description of the brain was a sufficient account of the physical side of all this. It might even be the beginnings of a reliable extensional account that will allow us to predict someones mental states based on their current state plus their history plus a baseline population. It doesn't do a very good job of describing intentional relationships though. It characterizes experiences in purely extentional and nomological terms while intentional relationships are often seem essentially intensional and counter-factual.

&gt; Is it? I mean, our bodies have the same organs, a pigs doesn't (I assume, I'm not greatly familiar with either human or pig anatomy, but I know that something like a cow has 4 stomachs, so, I assume there are differences between us an pigs).

Pigs are actually scary similar to people on the inside. Their intestines are somewhat different, but pig fetuses are extremely popular in high school anatomy labs.

&gt; Without that agreed definition, it's not a matter of ""no laws could do it without losing generality"", it's just a matter of ""no laws could do it"". You can't interpret what to do with results if you don't know what you're trying to do.

It's a genuine problem. So is life; We live awash with ambiguity. I would say that most of the truly interesting problems in life begin like this, with a grasp towards the truly unknown.

In all seriousness, the most interesting problems in life don't come with instruction manuals. In science, we select definitions and theories based on public criteria and deference to experiment whenever possible. Over time, this leads to certain definitions accreting into public consciousness through education and common knowledge. Though we might have discovered them personally, they are not natural. How and why the definitions were crafted should be of foremost interest to us.

&gt; To start, I'd like to say I'm not sure there will be a definition that isn't incredibly complex.

That's true, but there is a difference between something being too complicated to acquire practical master over and being complicated but managible. I would say introducing a complicated concept like intentionality makes the task more managible, since we all have access to intentionality as a phenomena through experience.

&gt;&gt; It makes sense; I just disagree. I think the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

&gt;So, I've heard that as a saying before, but I have trouble thinking of what it might mean literally. What more could the whole be than the sum of it's parts? If anything more is added, wouldn't that just be another part?

It is really a matter of what you privilege. If you think parts are the fundamental things in the universe, then parts are discrete and wholes are definable in terms of discrete of sums of parts. If you think wholes are the fundamental things in the universe, then parts are arbitrary. If parts are arbitrary, then there is no sum(s) of parts that essentially describes a given whole. Therefore, wholes wouldn't be definable in terms of the discrete sums of parts.

&gt;&gt; I assume that the things I don't understand are radically different from the things I do understand.

&gt; Is that a reasonable assumption to make? It seems odd to me, as if the things you do understand are similar, and the only difference between things you do and don't understand is that you do or don't understand them, why would that change how similar they are?

If you understand something about it, (namely that it is just like the things you already know), then you at least understand it partially.

&gt; But there's a third option: I'd think that evaluating them as nonsense would make more sense...

Different strokes, I guess. I think that the law if excluded middle is more important than this minor sub-point, but we both have our preferences.

&gt; If it's not represented in a mind, or written on paper, or something, where is it?

It's non-spacial; It doesn't exist anywhere. Believing that all things are spacially located in a particular place is the same as assuming materialism.

&gt; This seems odd to me. Isn't math pretty much an entirely human concept? Math is useful for defining things, but it's much like language, it's definitions and stuff are created by us. How could that be mind independent?

1. I'm not a Mathematician. They are the math experts. You'll have to ask them why ~60% of working proffesionals prefer that view.

2. Some animals can do things like count and recognize propertie like shape and volume. Crows can't do your taxes, but they do primative math. Arguably, this means math isn't just a human thing.

&gt; I suppose that's true, but we don't want to assume determinism, right? And if particles are non-deterministic, then using non-determinant as a category for non-physical seems odd.

I really don't know. I personally feel fine about it, since plenty of people seem to be spinning idealist conclusions from QM. I don't believe them, but enough serious minds seem to.

&gt; I mean, there's some truth in that, but those assumptions came from somewhere.... We didn't just strap a spring suspended platform to a dial and say, ""yeah, that'll do to measure mass, I'm sure it's good enough.""

It was a long and complicated process. It required advancements in both abstract theory and manufacturing capability simulatneously 100+ years. There was a lot of contingency that converged to make our knowledge what it is today. It wasn't a natural evolution from found facts to scales at the super-market.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-09 21:17:17 :

&gt; However, I don't think either assumption is necessary for what I'm saying to ring true.

Yeah, that's fine. The question about babies was actually a genuine question, not a dig at your theory.

&gt; I am attempting to give an account of what a non-physial idea would be like in general. I don't want to make any claims about how ideas actually function or exist.

Sure, I get this, but I was simply trying to bring up edge cases where it might seem like your system would fail. While, without the full answers, we're both bound to be able to do this to each other's ideas, I don't think it's necessarily a useless exercise.

&gt; 1&amp;4: Unfortunately, this goes back to our discussion about intentionality.

Alright, that's fine, but before I begin, I just have to say this intentionality stuff really hurts my brain. It just seems very odd, and I don't think I understand it as well as I should.

&gt;  If this accounting requires us to speak in intentional terms, then we should take this as an indication that intetionality exists robustly.

So I can't remember what you said when I suggested that intentionality could be physically accounted for by tracing the causal chain backward to an originating thing (i.e. the photon that hit my retina last bounced off of the pear, so that's where the ""aboutness"" of me thinking about the pear comes from), but it seems to me that intentionality isn't necessarily a strictly non-physical thing.

&gt; will allow us to predict someones mental states based on their current state plus their history plus a baseline population.

So, this may be my physicalist mindset holding me back a bit, but here I'd like to ask, if sociological history is part of ideas, where is it stored so it could be referenced? In my physicalist account, since the neurons have rewired, they're placement acts as the storage mechanism for this history, but a non-physical history seems to be not present.

&gt; Their intestines are somewhat different, but pig fetuses are extremely popular in high school anatomy labs.

I think fetuses are a different thing, though I only say that because I remember a biology lesson where we looked at fetuses from various animals and how they develop similarly as a means of checking evolutionary relationships. Basically, I'm not surprised pig fetuses are similar, because if I remember, at some stage even chicken fetuses are similar, and they aren't even a mammal.

&gt; How and why the definitions were crafted should be of foremost interest to us.

Sure, but I think you are sort of missing something by just suggesting that it's ambiguous. Sure, it is now, but it shouldn't be. ""Health"" and ""Consciousness"" aren't really some sort of thing that exists outside of human minds. We won't *find* the definition of health, because it's not a definite concept. The importance of a definition is really to make sure we're on the same page. If we're trying to prioritize ""health"" we should come up with a constant definition, so that I'm not trying to increase human happiness, at the expense of lifespan, while you do the opposite, both in the pursuit of ""health"". That's a simplified concept, but it's better for me to say ""I'm trying to increase wellbeing"" and you to say ""I'm trying to increase lifespan"" than for both of us to say ""I'm trying to increase health"" when clearly our goals are at odds. Did that make sense? It seems a bit rambly to me.

&gt; I would say introducing a complicated concept like intentionality makes the task more managible

I think we started with talking about stuff like this. Abstractions vs. precision. I was talking about using ""acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/s^2"" instead of modeling all the particle interactions, but it seems like we've come back to this. Yes, introducing a complex concept, instead of the underlying mechanisms can greatly ease computation, but it also decreases accuracy. In most cases, this is worth it, as it doesn't matter if you're off by a tiny amount if you can calculate it a billion times faster. But nowadays, we have computers, and they're only getting faster (sorta, we're starting to run up on the limit (at least of electronics), but that's a story for another day), which can take those billions of times harder calculations, and do them anyway. And yeah, it'll take it 1 second instead of a billionth of a second, but that's not really consequential. In short, we can deal with the less manageable but more right models.

&gt;  If you think wholes are the fundamental things in the universe, then parts are arbitrary.

So you think wholes are the fundamental things in the universe? Even though we can break things down into their constituent atoms, and recombine them into entirely new forms? In such a scenario, the parts don't change, but the wholes are constantly in a sort of state of flux.

&gt; If you understand something about it, (namely that it is just like the things you already know), then you at least understand it partially.

Hmm. OK, not to argue semantics, but I think understand may have been the wrong word then. I struggle to think of a better one, but to me, it sounds more like you're saying ""know"" vs ""don't know"", whereas understand vs not understand would be like 8th grade me with algebra vs calculus. If that makes sense (Hmm. it makes sense in my head, but I think I'm having trouble writing it down.).

&gt; It's non-spacial; It doesn't exist anywhere. Believing that all things are spacially located in a particular place is the same as assuming materialism.

I think my point was less ""give me its coordinates"" and more ""account for its existence"". What does existence look like if it doesn't affect anything?

&gt; Some animals can do things like count and recognize propertie like shape and volume. Crows can't do your taxes, but they do primative math. Arguably, this means math isn't just a human thing.

Well, I didn't mean to discount this. I mean, it's true that 2 apples is more apples than 1 apple no matter what you call it. But math is like a language, and while birds communicate, I would find that difficult to accept as evidence against the idea that English was human created.

&gt; I really don't know. I personally feel fine about it, since plenty of people seem to be spinning idealist conclusions from QM. I don't believe them, but enough serious minds seem to.

I don't think I have anything to argue here, but just a point of clarification, what do you mean by ""idealist"" conclusions?

&gt; It required advancements in both abstract theory and manufacturing capability simulatneously 100+ years.

&gt; It wasn't a natural evolution from found facts to scales at the super-market.

I'll be honest, that sounds like as close to a natural evolution as I can think of.

But I think a better way to state my point here might be that we can directly measure mass, either by determining how hard it is to accelerate something (inertia), or by determining how much it attracts other things (gravity). Which isn't really ""read[ing] these things into the case through our models.""

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-12 16:13:21 :

&gt; Yeah, that's fine. The question about babies was actually a genuine question, not a dig at your theory.

I thought it was a good question, don't get me wrong. It's even a potentially important objection to address in general, (whether non-physical theories make sense in light of actual ideas). I just thought it was a tangent.

&gt; Sure, I get this, but I was simply trying to bring up edge cases where it might seem like your system would fail. While, without the full answers, we're both bound to be able to do this to each other's ideas, I don't think it's necessarily a useless exercise.

I totally agree. I may have hedge my bets too much here; Boundary conditions are definitely what we want to investigate. I think you get what I was saying from your previous response, so if you'd like for me to expand on my brief defense, I'd be happy to.

&gt; Alright, that's fine, but before I begin, I just have to say this intentionality stuff really hurts my brain. It just seems very odd, and I don't think I understand it as well as I should.

It's uncanny! I wish I had magic words to get my point across, but it might be easier for you to discover it partly on your own. Try just sitting quietly in a spare room for 30 mins. Once your mind is settled, focus your attention on something specific. That moment of change from an unengaged to an engaged mind is the heart of intentionality. It is the tension that contrasts engagement from non-engagement.

This sounds super new agey, but words have seemed to fail me here.

&gt; So I can't remember what you said when I suggested that intentionality could be physically accounted for by tracing the causal chain backward to an originating thing (i.e. the photon that hit my retina last bounced off of the pear, so that's where the ""aboutness"" of me thinking about the pear comes from), but it seems to me that intentionality isn't necessarily a strictly non-physical thing.

I think that's when we started talking about modal logic. My response was something like, ""Individual causal chains aren't fine-grained enough to account for the intentional content of individual ideas."" Examples include:

The mismatch between strictly actual causes and counter-factual constructs.

The mismatch between the general, universal character of causation vs the specific, accidental character of ideas.

The mismatch between the indifferential causes and the apparent haecceties (this-ness) within ideas.

These are all inter-related ways of saying the same thing: that causation doesn't function like intentionality. Tracing the causal history of an idea may or may not lead you to the right conclusions, since analyzing this history is different than analyzing how intentional experience is present to us.

&gt; So, this may be my physicalist mindset holding me back a bit, but here I'd like to ask, if sociological history is part of ideas, where is it stored so it could be referenced? In my physicalist account, since the neurons have rewired, they're placement acts as the storage mechanism for this history, but a non-physical history seems to be not present.

This is a tough question, but I think we can draw some parallels among sociological constructs. For example, nations have jurisdictional borders on a map, but they aren't strictly at a place or identical with a place. Italy didn't cease to exist after the fall of Rome and reappear in the 1800's. The nation was destroyed without destroying the place. Another useful example here would be religions. Christianity isn't identical with a nation; it is an international phenomena. Taking into account conversions and apostates, it isn't necessarily identical to any set of people either.

So, common, well-accepted social constructs are associated with places and peoples, but not identical with them. It might not makes sense to ask where they are located, since their identity conditions aren't related to particular place or particular objects. Instead of relating to things within space, sociological constructs help us relate to things across time. They are chronological features rather than topological.

&gt; I think fetuses are a different thing, though I only say that because I remember a biology lesson where we looked at fetuses from various animals and how they develop similarly as a means of checking evolutionary relationships. Basically, I'm not surprised pig fetuses are similar, because if I remember, at some stage even chicken fetuses are similar, and they aren't even a mammal.

Forget embryology; I'm talking about full grown adults. They only use fetuses in school labs for space and storage reasons. I'll find a link.

&gt; So you think wholes are the fundamental things in the universe? Even though we can break things down into their constituent atoms, and recombine them into entirely new forms? In such a scenario, the parts don't change, but the wholes are constantly in a sort of state of flux.

Gun to my head, I'd say there is one fundamental whole that contains everything that exists. Apparent atomic parts are aspects of this whole considered under the conditions of our understanding. QM should probably given us pause for thought about parts being fundamental anyways, since the smallest parts depend on contextual properties within a broader system for definite attributes.

&gt; Hmm. OK, not to argue semantics, but I think understand may have been the wrong word then. I struggle to think of a better one, but to me, it sounds more like you're saying ""know"" vs ""don't know"", whereas understand vs not understand would be like 8th grade me with algebra vs calculus. If that makes sense...

All I know is that sometimes I'm ignorant about claims and sometimes I can provide useful information. There may be 100 intermediate levels between ignorance and enlightenment, but I can only be certain about one. I think it's best, therefore, to evaluate knowledge claims or understanding claims using only one predicate, whatever you call it.

&gt; I think my point was less ""give me its coordinates"" and more ""account for its existence"". What does existence look like if it doesn't affect anything?

It does affect the truth values of claims about abstract objects, if that counts. Platonism isn't a bed of roses, but the alternatives have problems even getting off the ground. Try explaining imaginary numbers using physical objects.

&gt; Well, I didn't mean to discount this. I mean, it's true that 2 apples is more apples than 1 apple no matter what you call it. But math is like a language, and while birds communicate, I would find that difficult to accept as evidence against the idea that English was human created.

English is to Universal Generative Grammar as Leibniz's Notation is to Calculus. English was clearly instantiated by some people: the English. However, the general capacities and regularities that make language possible in the first place aren't human inventions. It's the other way around: we are inventions of our natures.

&gt; what do you mean by ""idealist"" conclusions?

As in anti-materialists who believe ideas are fundamental in forming reality.

&gt; I'll be honest, that sounds like as close to a natural evolution as I can think of.

Artificial selection maybe; I didn't even mention selective pressures. I just mentioned change over a long period of time.

&gt; But I think a better way to state my point here might be that we can directly measure mass, either by determining how hard it is to accelerate something (inertia), or by determining how much it attracts other things (gravity). Which isn't really ""read[ing] these things into the case through our models.""

How can you say that while appealing to models of gravity and models of inertia?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-12 19:38:21 :

&gt; so if you'd like for me to expand on my brief defense, I'd be happy to.

Well, I think more words generally aides understanding, so if you'd like to, go ahead.

&gt; It is the tension that contrasts engagement from non-engagement.

May have to rescind what I just said. That might've confused me more. Regardless, I think I understand how it works, but it's just a foreign way for me to think about thoughts.

&gt; Tracing the causal history of an idea may or may not lead you to the right conclusion

Ok, what about tying intentionality to a certain area of the brain, like a set of neurons? Like there might be a set of neurons that fire any time you think of apples. This is essentially your brain accessing the data it has stored about apples, and their characteristics, so in one way, if you think about apples, these areas fire, and in the other, these areas firing is the only way you can think of apples (otherwise you wouldn't have the data on what an apple is).

&gt; Instead of relating to things within space, sociological constructs help us relate to things across time. They are chronological features rather than topological.

I think this misses the heart of what I meant to ask. I can't blame you, I didn't word it well. The question I meant was less ""where is it?"" and more ""how is it accessed?"" Even though you can't point to a location for Christianity, you can access information on it through the Bible. Similarly with nations and history books, or whatever. I think what I'm really asking is ""How does the non-physical sociological history, affect the physical world?"" And, perhaps from a scientific standpoint, why do we only see this effect in human behavior, while it doesn't affect anything inanimate? If it has an effect on the world, is it possible to isolate this effect from a human mind? And if not, why not?

This really sums up the issue I have with understanding non-physical accounts of, well, most things.

&gt; Forget embryology; I'm talking about full grown adults. They only use fetuses in school labs for space and storage reasons. I'll find a link.

I mean sure. I think this is all tangential though, simply because we wouldn't be talking about it had I picked a cow instead of a pig for my example.

&gt; QM should probably given us pause for thought about parts being fundamental anyways, since the smallest parts depend on contextual properties within a broader system for definite attributes.

Perhaps, but why should definite attributes even be something that's necessary? From my (admittedly simplistic) understanding of QM, it's possible for you to suddenly be at a position 3 feet to your left. This doesn't happen because the chances of it are tiny (like, mind bogglingly so). The only time that particles don't basically have definite coordinates is when you set your margin of error to basically 0, and at that point, nothing really has definite coordinates.

&gt; I think it's best, therefore, to evaluate knowledge claims or understanding claims using only one predicate, whatever you call it.

Fair enough. It seems, though, that you're ignoring a trend. If things seem to go one way, it seems odd to assume the things you haven't yet understood would not continue to. It's like if I gave you the pattern 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Sure, the next number *may* not be 11, but I'd be concerned if that wasn't your guess.

&gt; Try explaining imaginary numbers using physical objects.

I've never really understood imaginary numbers' application other than ""well, what if we *did* take the square roots of negative numbers?"".

&gt; However, the general capacities and regularities that make language possible in the first place aren't human inventions. It's the other way around: we are inventions of our natures.

Yeah, I think I see your point on this one.

&gt; As in anti-materialists who believe ideas are fundamental in forming reality.

Hmm. I feel like I've heard of this. I can't say its something I've agreed with.

&gt; Artificial selection maybe; I didn't even mention selective pressures. 

Artificial selection is a type of selective pressure that gives rise to natural evolution.

&gt; I just mentioned change over a long period of time.

Which is the definition of evolution.

&gt; How can you say that while appealing to models of gravity and models of inertia?

I suppose you have a point, but at the same time, gravity and inertia are what mass *is*. Mass doesn't give rise to inertia, mass is just the word we use for the measurement of inertia. Looking at how hard something is to accelerate, and then saying it has X mass because of it, is just using definitions. It's like showing that 1+1=2: the only way you can justify it is ""because we defined it that way"". I wouldn't say that 1+1=2 is a model.

&gt; Are you saying I'm wrong because I think the definition is or isn't amibiguous/indefinite here?

I think I'm agreeing with you, that the definition of health is indefinite. But, the important part is what I get to later:

&gt; This made sense. In short, you're asking why we should use a catch-all definition where several definition could apply, right?

Basically. It's like, if you replace a word with it's definition, it shouldn't change the meaning of the sentence. If you use a word with multiple definitions, and you can't glean which one is meant from context clues, then you are hurting communication, and it would likely be aided by simply using the definition you intend.

&gt; If my health and your health aren't similar in any way, then we shouldn't bother saying the same thing.

Hmm. I feel like this isn't exactly what I meant. I don't mean my health vs your health, I mean what do we mean by health. I think this is better explained later:

&gt; However, I think most everyone would narrow-in on the well-being model in the end.

That's fine, but I only used ""well-being"" as a simplistic way to differentiate from lifespan. This only pushes the problem back one step. What do we mean by ""well-being""? Happiness? Lack of disease? Lack of discomfort? Presence of comfort? Certainly the definition likely includes many of those, but for example, is it better for one's ""well-being"" to go through a treatment for disease that causes them discomfort (e.g. chemotherapy)? How much discomfort is OK? 

So again, when we talk of ""improving health"" do we mean ""eliminating disease"" or ""improving longevity"" or ""increasing happiness""? Do we mean something else? To bring the parallel back to consciousness, do we mean the human kind? the animal kind? Are we talking the kind of consciousness you lose when you sleep? If not, do people in comas have consciousness? It's harder to come up with a definition of consciousness because there's much we don't understand, but I think we can clarify a definition by examining the boundary cases and whatnot.

&gt; Even with the (literal) best computers, calculating the functional behavior of a system involving billions of neurons and billions of moments can easily over run computation time limits. We might have talked about this before; a model is only testable given ~1 trillion years isn't testable.

I mean, here's the problem I see with this, but I understand that it's coming from my physicalist mindset, and doesn't work with your non-physical representation of ideas: The brain does this. You say ""a model that is only testable given ~1 trillion years isn't testable"" but the brain does this in seconds. Given that, we can model the brain. And to this you said ""billions of neurons"" and I say ""[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqMpGrM5ECo)"". As they say there, we don't have the power yet, but we've made leaps and bounds in computing power in not too long.

Obviously, this simulation won't work if we have some sort of non-physical part that isn't simulated. But many seem to think that we can do it without that.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-14 18:35:10 :

&gt; That might've confused me more. Regardless, I think I understand how it works, but it's just a foreign way for me to think about thoughts.

That was my equivalent to turning it off and turning on again, (literally). We'll just make it work as we go. Haha.

&gt; Ok, what about tying intentionality to a certain area of the brain, like a set of neurons? Like there might be a set of neurons that fire any time you think of apples...

This depends on their being enough regions and sub-regions to account for all our ideas. The brain is enormously complicated, but I think just the semantic and syntactical dimensions of language(s) would outstrip the complexity of the brain. I'll have to do the math on that, though. (I'm on my phone right now).

&gt; This is essentially your brain accessing the data it has stored about apples, and their characteristics, so in one way, if you think about apples, these areas fire, and in the other, these areas firing is the only way you can think of apples (otherwise you wouldn't have the data on what an apple is).

Even according to many physical accounts, this isn't how the brain works. Very little space in the brain is dedicated to actively storing things for later use. We don't just have the idea of an apple we saw this morning sitting around waiting to be recalled in there. Rather, our brain reconstructs ideas at later dates based on our squishy human memory. Our memories are much lower fidelity than a computer's memory.

&gt; The question I meant was less ""where is it?"" and more ""how is it accessed?"" Even though you can't point to a location for Christianity, you can access information on it through the Bible. Similarly with nations and history books, or whatever.

As far as access goes, I'd say it works similarly to objects. One needs to be in contact with the thing being studies, preferably directly. For objects, that implies being within observation distance; for events, that implies being within a epoch, (events connect to one another), or directly experiencing an event itself.

We can learn about Christianity through it's artifacts, but we can also study what Christians are up to, what going to church is like, and so on. For ideas, we can learn some things through the artifact of the mind, (brains, tools, etc.), but we also have access through living events.

&gt; I think what I'm really asking is [1] ""How does the non-physical sociological history, affect the physical world?"" And, perhaps from a scientific standpoint, [2] why do we only see this effect in human behavior, while it doesn't affect anything inanimate? If it has an effect on the world, [3] is it possible to isolate this effect from a human mind? [4] And if not, why not?

There's a lot here and some of it overlaps with what I have to say later, so I'll keep these answers brief.

1. There are lots of ways that sociological events affect physical outcomes. In recent events, Trump's election will have a huge environmental impact. If Trump hadn't been elected, the results would be different. This isn't typical of all vases, just an example.

2. Ideas do affect inanimate objects through us, so I might challenge the question. Regardless, inanimate objects are just those defined as, 'things without animus.' Will is important to forming intentional attitudes. Therefore, inanimate objects are excluded categorically from interacting with ideas.

3. &amp;4: Ideas are a product of minds in the sense that the mind causes ideas. The only way to eliminate mind for an independent experiment would be to exclude their existence. However, without minds, there are no ideas, (counter-factual definition of cause). Therefore, the experiment is impossible.

&gt; Perhaps, but why should definite attributes even be something that's necessary? From my (admittedly simplistic) understanding of QM, it's possible for you to suddenly be at a position 3 feet to your left... The only time that particles don't basically have definite coordinates is when you set your margin of error to basically 0, and at that point, nothing really has definite coordinates.

I mean you're not wrong. It's just that we don't think of a mechanistic, determinate structure as being ambiguous and indeterminate. Definite attributes aren't necessary for existence writ large, but they are necessary for determinism, materialism, and arguably your claim that parts determine attributes. If parts don't have definite attributes while wholes do have definite attributes, then attributes only emerge at the level of wholes.

&gt; If things seem to go one way, it seems odd to assume the things you haven't yet understood would not continue to. It's like if I gave you the pattern 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Sure, the next number may not be 11, but I'd be concerned if that wasn't your guess.

Have you ever read about or heard of the problem of induction? If not, you should just look up David Hume on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. No shade intended.

&gt; I've never really understood imaginary numbers' application other than ""well, what if we did take the square roots of negative numbers?"".

It comes up in AC engineering problems quite a bit. It has some other applications in solving topological structures that could be generalized to most multivariable problems, but that is basically what you just said. More importantly, there are definitely claims in math that are true in virtue of i. If physical accounts can't touch i, then math can't be just a language for describing physical things.

&gt; Hmm. I feel like I've heard of this. I can't say its something I've agreed with.

I'm with you on this. I just wanted to give the lay of the land, so to speak. The conversion goes beyond what we would find reasonable on both sides.

&gt; Artificial selection is a type of selective pressure that gives rise to natural evolution.

&gt;&gt; I just mentioned change over a long period of time.

&gt; Which is the definition of evolution.

It is the colloquial definition of evolution, but not what we mean by natural selection. Natural selection replies change within a population in response to selective pressure. Artificial selection implies that human intention is the selective pressure, I'll grant you that.

However, I didn't mean to imply that our theories undergo a survival of the fittest type scenario in typical cases. There are some examples of completion among theories, but most science is cooperative. It is a matter of synthesizing as much useful data as possible. Theories are folded into one another in a way competing species can't be.

&gt; I suppose you have a point, but at the same time, gravity and inertia are what mass is. Mass doesn't give rise to inertia, mass is just the word we use for the measurement of inertia. Looking at how hard something is to accelerate, and then saying it has X mass because of it, is just using definitions. It's like showing that 1+1=2: the only way you can justify it is ""because we defined it that way"". I wouldn't say that 1+1=2 is a model.

I would say ""1+1=2"" is a model. Maybe it isn't used as a model by most lay people, but there are proofs for it in more basic logical terms, (see Russell's proof of '1+1=2). As far as definitions go, what would you call a definition, if definitions aren't models for the use of a term?

&gt; Basically. It's like, if you replace a word with it's definition, it shouldn't change the meaning of the sentence. If you use a word with multiple definitions, and you can't glean which one is meant from context clues, then you are hurting communication, and it would likely be aided by simply using the definition you intend.

Makes sense.

&gt; This only pushes the problem back one step. What do we mean by ""well-being""? Happiness? Lack of disease? Lack of discomfort? Presence of comfort? Certainly the definition likely includes many of those, but for example, is it better for one's ""well-being"" to go through a treatment for disease that causes them discomfort (e.g. chemotherapy)? How much discomfort is OK?

All great questions! I'm not going to chase too many rabbits here, since there is an entire 3,000 year tradition dedicated to this question, (Aristotelian ethics). I see your point though and will try to tell in the next section.

&gt; To bring the parallel back to consciousness, do we mean the human kind? the animal kind?.. It's harder to come up with a definition of consciousness because there's much we don't understand.

I don't think an ambiguous definition is our biggest problem here. It seems like we just genuinely don't know the answer to these questions under most reasonable definitions of consciousness. I'm sure no definition I've heard answers all of this while remaining non-trivial. I don't think a non-physical definition would add to the problems or is the cause of them here.

&gt;  The brain does this. You say ""a model that is only testable given ~1 trillion years isn't testable"" but the brain does this in seconds.

Yeah, you're totally assuming that the brain works like a computer. This goes beyond the physical/non-physical question. It's true that the brain can do things that are onerously complex to model, but that doesn't imply that the brain is doing onerously complex modeling. The brain does some modeling, but the brain isn't a model itself. I'm not claiming an answer either way, but assuming the brain is like a computer isn't a safe bet.

&gt; As they say there, we don't have the power yet, but we've made leaps and bounds in computing power in not too long.

I think you should temper your optimism to match the goal of this project. They seem to be interested in applying our best model of the brain to practice application in computer science. They don't claim to have a perfect model of the brain or a complete model or even a functions model.

Just to make my objection more clear, I'm talking about computational complexity. Some problems are theoretically impossible to solve even with machine assistance."	"KDJones @ 2016-12-15 18:24:14 :

&gt; I must say, I'd love to see how you'd do that. I'm not even sure what numbers you'd be doing math on.

Alright, this isn't going to be a very  formal proof, but I'll do my best.

Suppose there is a number C/S, where C is the number of distinct connections within the brain while S is the number of distinct units of meaning within a language. If N&lt;1, then I'm clearly right; If N&gt;1 or N=1, then you're clearly right. If S stands for words, you got your bases covered. There are, at absoulte most, a few million words in English and 100 trillion connections in the brain. Case closed. 

However, if meaning is sentential, as nearly all people that study language do, then I have a much better case. Take a sentence to be a combination of two words within the rule of syntax. Given a very conservative estimate of the number of words in English (200,000), the sum of all possible sentences looks like:

[200,000!/(199,998!*2!)]+[200,000!/(199,997!*3!)]+...

This number is already on the order of 10^20 by the third item in the sum. This is much larger than 10^12 in the case of neural connections. Even if we multiply by an arbitrary constant to account for the percentage of syntactically correct constructs, we are still looking at an order of magnitude of difference.

&gt; Yeah, but we do have the idea of an apple.

We have ideas like we have moments, not like we have appendixes.

&gt; Which is exactly what you'd expect if memory was build by strengthening or weakening connections between neurons. This is evident from the Neural Networks I talked about before. They don't come to the right answer, but they come to a close enough answer (e.g. can identify standard images very well, but show it a leopard print sofa, and it will think it's a leopard).

Let's bring this back to the discussion about ideas. What ideas does the Neural Network have of the sofa? Is it that they have a mistaken idea that the couch is a leopard, or that they have no idea what a couch or a leopard are at all?

&gt; I get the classification of tools, but I don't get why you classify a brain as an ""artifact of mind"". Isn't a brain more of an active account (at least while it's still in a head)?

I don't see any reason to privlege to brain as a special seat of consciousness. That gives the mistaken impression of a homunculus-like mind. The brain certainly has a special role in being a neceaary condition for the survival and regular function of our minds, but it isn't a sufficient condition. Minds only exist when the information processing feautres of the brain are engaged with an environment.

&gt; But what in Trump's election was non-physical? Where did something non-physical affect something physical?

Trump's election is non-physical in the sense that is non-spacial, non-concrete, and agent-relative; It fails as a physical thing under all three common criteria. Insofar as it has an affect on the world, it is an example of a non-physical thing having real-world affects.

&gt; Ok, let me ask another question. In my model, ideas are electrical signals in your brain. What they ""do"" (for lack of a better word) is transmit from neuron to neuron. In your non-physical model, what do ideas ""do""? Do they exist when we aren't thinking of them? Do they float around in the ether, waiting to ping into a mind? I just don't understand what they are in your model.

Ideas aren't little men that do things to us or do things behind the scenes. People have ideas or more accurately ideas are our performative acts. They don't exist until we create them and they exist as long as we entertain them. Our creative ability grounded in our general ways of life, though. This is way we don't have impossible ideas or the ability to transcend culture or language at will. This is also how we get common sense: by sharing our lives with others in a community.

&gt; I can see determinism easily, but materialism? Only if you define materials as things with definite parts I guess.

That would be the only way to distinguish modern materialism from something like Aristotelian science. Materialists are usual cast as atomists in contrast with Aristotle's infinitely divisible substance.

&gt; My point was that wholes don't have definite attributes either. For example, you know that wave particle duality stuff? Well, this is weird, but even something like a golf ball has a wavelength. It's just tiny compared to the actual ball.

I'm not a QM genuis, but I think the interaction between several particles systems would cause a wave function collapse. If that is the case, then the wave function of a golf ball would be definite, insofar as the golfball is the interaction of all it's parts.

&gt;  The Stanford place says induction is basically assuming that ""instances of which we have had no experience resemble those of which we have had experience"". This cannot be demonstrated or implied without begging the question. But you said that instances of which we've had no experience do not resemble those of which we have. Where are you getting this from? Is it not fallacious to assume the opposite just because I can't prove it?

Good point! You can take what I said earlier as just a personal preference, I suppose. I tend to be skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of knowledge, I guess.

&gt; If it comes up in AC engineering, how can physical accounts not touch i?

I'm not an electrical engineer, and I'm certainly not about to make your argument for you ;).

&gt; But they kind of do. Isn't that what a hypothesis is? You find an explanation that is most fit for the observations of reality. Reject it if it fails, and accept it if it succeeds.

This isn't how it works most of the time, though. Most working scientists would rather publish a moderate claim to incrementally increase knowledge in order to secure more reliable funding. Publishing a few quaility, falsified claims doesn't pay the bills like publishing a bunch of low-stakes, verified claims. In the end, science is mostly about accretion these days. Falsifiaction and old-school scientific method are just ideals.

&gt; A definition relates a thing to a meaning, a model relates a thing to a thing (or multiple things, depending). A model would be like F=ma. It tells you how a force relates to an object. A definition would be like what a force is (a push or a pull), it doesn't relate two or more things.

It seems like the defintion relates the meaning of the first word to the meaning of the other terms through some kind of equivalency relation to me. That seems like a relation between two or more things to me.

&gt; Essentially, a model describes how the world works, and so can either be right or wrong. A definition describes how our language works, and so can't really be wrong.

Better call up the people at Merriam-Webster and tell them to print whatever! They are wasting a bunch of money on researching and editing that stupid book. They could just print whatever they like.

&gt; This is a silly thing to say. Everything is a model. It's a model of itself. I may have misspoke, but I didn't mean to suggest that the brain doing modeling means we can model the brain. I meant to say the brain does stuff, which means we can simulate it.

Are you sure about that? So, actual trees are also models of themselves and so on? This seems to really stretch the definition of what it means to be a model. If literally everything is a model, then 'being a model' is equivalent to 'just being'. Through you replacment principle you cited earlier, 'That is a model' would have a equivalent meaning to 'That is'. Seems pretty extreme to me.

On a related pompous note, I think Godel's incompleteness theorem will also give you trouble here. The whole universe would be your formal system and every individual things would be your models. The universe is axiomizable since the basic laws are finite, it is complete since everything (model) can be verified as true or false, it's consistent since law of excluded middle, and it contains the necessary axioms for arithmetic since look around. The union of these four things is impossible. Therefore, you have to lose one.

&gt; Do you mean that this isn't impossible, but is complex? Because something being complex (takes a long time to return) and something being impossible (never returns) are very separate in computer science, and this seems oddly worded with that in mind.

If the time it takes to return would require the entire entropy of the universe to be several order of magnitude low in order to create the extra time, then I'd say you're never getting a return. I read a really interesting article on the subject [here](http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf). That's enormous though, so here is the [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-complexity/#ConLog)

awenonian @ 2016-12-16 06:01:06 :

&gt; Suppose there is a number C/S, where C is the number of distinct connections within the brain while S is the number of distinct units of meaning within a language.

This is exactly why I said what I said. These numbers don't seem like the one's you should be using. First of all, I'd suspect memories (or whatever a unit of idea would be) are made of multiple connections, and, more importantly, they can overlap. For example, you might think of blue when you think of the sky, which clearly implies some overlap in the connections. So you can't just compare between distinct connections, you'd have to look at series of connections, which is a much harder thing to estimate.

&gt; We have ideas like we have moments, not like we have appendixes.

I'm not really sure what you mean by that.

&gt; Let's bring this back to the discussion about ideas. What ideas does the Neural Network have of the sofa? Is it that they have a mistaken idea that the couch is a leopard, or that they have no idea what a couch or a leopard are at all?

This may not be a satisfying answer, because in all honesty I should say ""I don't know"". The point of a neural network is basically to outsource the thinking work to the computer, so the programmer necessarily doesn't really understand what's (specifically) going on under the hood. But, if I had to guess, it's idea of a leopard is something with a golden spotted pattern. It recognizes the golden spotted pattern, and identifies the picture as a leopard. Now, I may be adding some human characteristics to something that doesn't have them, which I think is your point, but even outside of this discussion, I'd still use words like ""recognizes"" to describe the behavior of a Neural Network. I don't think it would be indisputably unreasonable to classify it as having an idea of a leopard.

&gt; Minds only exist when the information processing feautres of the brain are engaged with an environment.

I'm not sure this really disputes the point I made. I argued against your classification of brains as an ""artifact of mind"", mostly because, while I wasn't sure your exact meaning, the other example you gave (tools) seems to be an example of something produced by minds. In this case, another example would be writing. It's a result of a mind, but doesn't directly relate to a mind itself. A brain, to me, doesn't seem to fall into that category.

&gt; Trump's election is non-physical in the sense that is non-spacial, non-concrete, and agent-relative;

This just confuses me. Trump's election was in America, more specifically at multiple polling places (so, it's spacial), I don't know what about it is non-concrete (really I don't know what you mean by that), and the results are the same however you look at it, so I also don't know what about it is agent-relative.

&gt; Ideas aren't little men that do things to us or do things behind the scenes.

Just to perhaps better explain what I meant: neither is a ball, but it still rolls around.

&gt; They don't exist until we create them and they exist as long as we entertain them.

So, I'm still stuck in this spot: If it's created by physical things, and affects physical things, how can it be non-physical? If we create ideas, then, since we are physical, there must be definite rules to idea creation. So, ideas, in this case, are as determinate as the rest of the universe, so what about them is non-physical?

While I don't think this is how it works, if brains, through some mechanism, created a sort of ""idea field"", I don't know how that would be any less physical than magnets producing a magnetic field would be.

&gt; Materialists are usual cast as atomists in contrast with Aristotle's infinitely divisible substance.

Well atoms don't need to have definite positions to be indivisible, so I'm not really sure why this is relevant.

&gt; I'm not a QM genuis, but I think the interaction between several particles systems would cause a wave function collapse.

Neither am I, so this is probably not the most satisfying answer, but [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave)'s a thing, and I'll just say that I remember in physics classes being asked to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a golf ball.

&gt; Falsifiaction and old-school scientific method are just ideals.

Well, maybe we're just doing science wrong nowadays then. But even so, today's scientific landscape doesn't really matter when we were talking about the development of, for example, a scale at a supermarket, which was developed long before today.

&gt; It seems like the defintion relates the meaning of the first word to the meaning of the other terms through some kind of equivalency relation to me. That seems like a relation between two or more things to me.

Yes, but they're all meanings. I think we can both agree that a meaning is different from an object. You're right, but only because we have the weird recursive problem of defining words with words.

&gt; Better call up the people at Merriam-Webster and tell them to print whatever! They are wasting a bunch of money on researching and editing that stupid book. They could just print whatever they like.

This isn't what I meant, and I think you know it. To better explain, lets say that we use Merriam-Webster for our definitions. Then, whatever they say a word means is right. You can't just say Force=mass*sqrt(velocity)+time and have it be right, because that's demonstrably wrong, but you can say ""the word fluslerhl means a kitten in a hat"", and have it arbitrarily be right, as long as you are in charge of definitions. Am I not making sense?

&gt; Are you sure about that? So, actual trees are also models of themselves and so on?

Yes. A model of something is something that acts like the original in enough ways to be useful for a purpose. I'm not sure how you could say that a tree doesn't act enough like itself.

Just gonna take a break here and ask: Are we using the same definition of model? I'm using model as in ""a model of our solar system"". Are you, perhaps, using in the sense of ""Force = mass * acceleration""? (Actually, genuinely not sure, are those the same definition of model?)

&gt; If literally everything is a model, then 'being a model' is equivalent to 'just being'.

It is, but generally we define something not as ""a model"" but as ""a model of something"". ""being a model"" may be equivalent to ""being"" but ""being a model of a tree"" is not. A tree is a good model of a tree, but a basketball is not.

&gt; it is complete since everything (model) can be verified as true or false,

I think this one might give. Comes back to the different definitions of model. I don't know if you can call a model of our solar system ""true"" or ""false"".

&gt; If the time it takes to return would require the entire entropy of the universe to be several order of magnitude low in order to create the extra time, then I'd say you're never getting a return.

I asked the question I did because formally, there is a distinction here. Some things are ""undecidable"", which means they will never return, and some things are not, but may take a long time. When categorizing these things, we don't, and shouldn't, put them into the undecidable category just because they'd take longer than the universe. We mostly don't do this, because when proving whether something is undecidable or not, we don't want to have to appeal to things that we don't have definite numbers for like the entropy in the universe.

But I think your claim that it would take longer than the universe to run a model of the human brain is shaky at best. We have had about 100 billion brains exist in the world, and haven't really made significant progress towards heat death. So, it seems possible that we could make a model that could do the job, without running the universe out of energy.

Really, I think your comment about the model taking a trillion years was pulled from nowhere in particular.

KDJones @ 2016-12-16 18:34:35 :

&gt; This is exactly why I said what I said. These numbers don't seem like the one's you should be using. First of all, I'd suspect memories (or whatever a unit of idea would be) are made of multiple connections, and, more importantly, they can overlap...

We are just talking about a particular sub-case: that of competent natural language use. If the idea behind a sentence, (e.i. it's meaning), is a part of our brain and a competent english user is able to process some arbitrary percentages of sentences, then a competent user must dedicate some minimum amount of space for meanings. If the number of distinct meanings is prohibitively large, then even a percentage of this set could be enough.

As far as overlap goes, I'd say there are two options. First, it is possible that the meaning of a sentence is reducible to the meaning of more basic components put together. Again, this is a very unpopular view among the scientists and philosophers that study language and has been unpopular for several decades. Second, it could be possible that distinct ideas can be co-located in the brain. I take the second option, since I don't need a functional correspondence between a given brain state and a distinct idea.

&gt; I'm not really sure what you mean by that.

I'm sayimg we don't possess ideas as if they were objects. We have ideas that same way we have bad days or have the glory all to ourselves.

&gt; The point of a neural network is basically to outsource the thinking work to the computer, so the programmer necessarily doesn't really understand what's (specifically) going on under the hood. [I]f I had to guess, it's idea of a leopard is something with a golden spotted pattern... I don't think it would be indisputably unreasonable to classify it as having an idea of a leopard.

I definitely don't want to rule out future androids. However, it is important to note how the neural networks we know do and do not line up with our expectations of thinking things. They certainly seem to model many of the logical properties of brains: like how their memories work and like how they are comprised of modual connective bits.

However, their 'ideas' are clearly deficient compared to in-the-flesh examples of consciousness. Unlike the thinking things we know, neural nets don't seem to have an embodied sense of self or a personal sense of self. Animals and people respectively have these capacities, and they seem to radically change the way we interpret the same stimulous.

Going back to the couch, the neural net 'recognizes' it as a leopard because of visual cues about pattern, texture, size, etc. A pig wouldn't make the same mistake, because their idea of a leopard includes these cues plus categories like animate, dangerous, etc. These all derive from having for and caring about our bodies. Humans do even better than pigs though, because our idea includes our temporal consciousness and our scientific knowledge about leopards. We are able to relate to ourselves accross time and to different individuals as individuals within a community. Our selfhood enables us to process ideas that neural nets don't seem able to yet.

&gt; I'm not sure this really disputes the point I made. I argued against your classification of brains as an ""artifact of mind"", mostly because, while I wasn't sure your exact meaning, the other example you gave (tools) seems to be an example of something produced by minds... A brain, to me, doesn't seem to fall into that category.

Why should the brain be different than any other physical object? In theory, we can use any physical object as a tool. Tools are just physical bodies being used to accomplish actions. We use our brain as a tool to remember things when we can't make a physical note, to inform when we tell people something we know, and so on. It's certainly true that not all brains are being used as tools, (dead brains, the brains of the mental impaired, etc), but we certainly use our brains all the time.

Furthermore, we can presumably use things to replce the brain if we really needed to. Isn't that the premise that lays behind the plausibility of robot clones, transfering our consciousness into computers, and the like? In short, the brain does a job in producing our consciousnesses, but it isn't an essential job. We could do the same thing with different equiptment.

&gt; This just confuses me. Trump's election...

Are you saying that physical places in America are identical with or part of something identical with the Election of Donald Trump? I would say that the American elections are an abstract (non-concrete) political institution that exist do to the will of the American people. If everyone in Amerca died except Trump, then Trump wouldn't be president of the United States anymore. In that sense, it is relative to American citizens.

&gt; So, I'm still stuck in this spot: If it's created by physical things, and affects physical things, how can it be non-physical? If we create ideas, then, since we are physical, there must be definite rules to idea creation...

We don't create ideas in isolation though. It isn't as if the human brain alone is an idea factory. We are only able to produce ideas within the context of a wider world of possible actions and a wider community of fellow individuals doing the same. Ideas aren't the collective emissions of people. Rather, the basic unit of thought is super-personal.

We are physical bodies: a sufficient condition for the possession of attributes over time. One enduring attribute we possess is 'having ideas'. We are substantial grounds for this attribute but we aren't the generative grounds. It wouldn't exist without us, but we don't create the attribute in ourselves.

&gt; Well atoms don't need to have definite positions to be indivisible, so I'm not really sure why this is relevant.

Better be discrete, though. If you can't count them, then they can't be discrete. If something is bi-located or co-located with another object, I don't know how you'd objectively count them.

&gt; I'll just say that I remember in physics classes being asked to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a golf ball.

I don't doubt you. It's just that you found a particular value. You didn't find a bunch of super-imposed possible values like you do with the parts of the golf ball.

&gt; today's scientific landscape doesn't really matter when we were talking about the development of, for example, a scale at a supermarket, which was developed long before today.

I don't know if science even operated according to the ideal, but you're right to bring us back to the crux of the matter. The scale isn't a total accident, but it isn't a necessary feature of the universe by any means. Whatever analogy we draw between the functioning of the scale and the wider universe is a cosmological claim that requires decades of actual research. We, as students, receive the clean finished high-theory, giving us a false impression of mastery and transcendence.

&gt; Yes, but they're all meanings. I think we can both agree that a meaning is different from an object. You're right, but only because we have the weird recursive problem of defining words with words.

For what it is worth, I've never seen a meaning apart from words. Words are physical tokens, (written or spoken), so defintions seem to relate the use of physical things to me.

&gt; This isn't what I meant, and I think you know it...

Yeah, I was just messing with you. I do partly disagree with your characterization of definition, though. We also never induct a word like this. We name things sometimes, but in that case we are tagging a physical object with a word. We almost never just make up a sound for an arbitrary meaning. We invent defintions in light of practical activities. This implies the link between a coined term's success and failure is somewhat determinable. We could just see how well it captures the meaning while easing communication.

&gt; Just gonna take a break here and ask: Are we using the same definition of model?

Right you are; they are one in the same from a general mathematics standpoint. A model is any body of claims inferable from a given body of axioms. In the case of observational models, the axioms are taken to be the observations and the model of a description of behavior consistent with and inferable from the observations.

In the solar system. The relative placement of the planets is consistent with they're relative distance from one another plus some facts about when they can be observed throught the year.  

&gt; It is, but generally we define something not as ""a model"" but as ""a model of something"". ""being a model"" may be equivalent to ""being"" but ""being a model of a tree"" is not. A tree is a good model of a tree, but a basketball is not.

Very good point! Sophistry retracted.

&gt; It is complete since everything (model) can be verified as true or false,

I think this one might give. Comes back to the different definitions of model. I don't know if you can call a model of our solar system ""true"" or ""false"".

You can call a model true or false, depending on whether it coheres with axioms it's set upon. If the universe is reducible to a set of axiomatic laws, then the models that exist are true and those that don't exist are false.

&gt; I asked the question I did because formally, there is a distinction here. Some things are ""undecidable"", which means they will never return, and some things are not, but may take a long time.

How are we supposed to tell the difference without a return result?

&gt;  When categorizing these things, we don't, and shouldn't, put them into the undecidable category just because they'd take longer than the universe...

How do you decide the difference then?

&gt; Really, I think your comment about the model taking a trillion years was pulled from nowhere in particular.

That exact number? Clearly. Is there a known polynomial time algorithm for doing that kind of thing? Clearly not. Otherwise, we would just use that and be done with it.

awenonian @ 2016-12-16 21:25:30 :

&gt; Second, it could be possible that distinct ideas can be co-located in the brain. I take the second option, since I don't need a functional correspondence between a given brain state and a distinct idea.

If I'm parsing you correctly, then this is what I meant. This co-location allows multiple ideas to use the same neurons, so you can't say ""you don't have enough neurons"" because you should look at different permutations of neurons.

Furthermore, I'd argue that issue could be taken with this statement as well:

&gt; If the number of distinct meanings is prohibitively large, then even a percentage of this set could be enough.

I'd personally (at least with the knowledge I currently have) see it as more reasonable to define the numbers as permutations of neurons, and singular meanings of words. Whereas you defined it as singular neural connections, and permutations of words. To give an example of how it would work with that, you'd get context built because if A and C fire, that leads to a different end result than if B and C fire. In this, A B and C are all sets of neurons that represent different meanings (like the meaning of ""sky"" or ""run"" or whatever). For example, if A was ""man"" and B was ""nose"" and C was ""run"" when you have A and C fire, and they get ""added together"" (in some sense. Basically, when the neural paths collide or something like that), you get an image of a man running, where as if it were B and C, that ""adding"" would result in an image of a runny nose.

&gt; I'm sayimg we don't possess ideas as if they were objects. We have ideas that same way we have bad days or have the glory all to ourselves.

Ok, this makes sense, but ""bad days"" are still ""things"", right?

&gt; Unlike the thinking things we know, neural nets don't seem to have an embodied sense of self or a personal sense of self. Animals and people respectively have these capacities, and they seem to radically change the way we interpret the same stimulous.

Sure, but I'd see it as rather unfair to expect this. A neural network is built of a number of connections that pales in comparison to that of any quadruped (or biped). Compare it more to the brain (if you want to call it that) of a flatworm. All a flatworm has for a brain is a clump of nerve cells, and I think it'd be hard to determine whether it has a sense of self (I feel like there are even more complex animals that don't, like gorillas, failing that mirror experiment I can't think of the name of (they put a dot of paint on the forehead, and see if a creature touches it's own forehead after seeing that in the mirror). I'm not sure that's really about sense of self though).

&gt; A pig wouldn't make the same mistake, because their idea of a leopard includes these cues plus categories like animate, dangerous, etc.

A pig wouldn't make the same mistake because it wasn't trained in the same way. A pig cares whether the thing will eat them, a neural net cares about getting the right answer. They're looking for different things. I've not tried, and don't have a neural net on hand to check, but I'd imagine if you gave it similar testing requirements (here's some images, sort them into ""predator"" and ""not""), it'd probably better be able to differentiate a leopard from a sofa, because it's not looking at the coat patterns anymore.

&gt; Our selfhood enables us to process ideas that neural nets don't seem able to yet.

This isn't a one way gap though. It seems, at least to me, that you have the idea that neural networks aren't as good as humans yet. I could understand that based on the examples I've been getting, but here's another example: A neural net can distinguish between a leopard, a jaguar and a cheetah based simply on the spot patterns. Easily. Most people can't do that.

&gt; Why should the brain be different than any other physical object?

Simply put, because minds don't build brains.

&gt;  In theory, we can use any physical object as a tool. Tools are just physical bodies being used to accomplish actions. 

I see your point, but I also think there's some equivocation around the word ""tool"" here. When we study old civilizations, we look at their bows, and their hammers, and their writing, we don't look at their brains. These ""artifacts"" are the results of a mind in action. I don't think it's unreasonable to put the products of a machine into a different category from the machine itself.

&gt; Furthermore, we can presumably use things to replce the brain if we really needed to. Isn't that the premise that lays behind the plausibility of robot clones, transferring our consciousness into computers, and the like?

I'd question the plausibility of such things. ""transferring consciousness"" almost certainly ends up being less a transfer and more a copy (i.e. take your brain state, and transcribe it into a machine. This doesn't require destroying the original.)

&gt; Are you saying that physical places in America are identical with or part of something identical with the Election of Donald Trump?

Well, not the places themselves, but only because the location of a basketball isn't identical to the basketball. The polling places across America are parts of something identical with the election.

&gt; I would say that the American elections are an abstract (non-concrete) political institution that exist do to the will of the American people.

I'd say they're a process that happens to do the will of the people. I don't know why that would make it abstract.

&gt; If everyone in Amerca died except Trump, then Trump wouldn't be president of the United States anymore.

Why not? He doesn't stop being president if any specific person (save himself) dies, so why would he stop being president if every specific person did? You might be saying there wouldn't be an America anymore, but if you could in any way justify that there still was, Trump would be president of it. And I'd say the fact that the location still exists is reason enough to say it's still America (probably not for long, with other countries wanting to vie for that now undefended land, but that's not really important.)

&gt; We are only able to produce ideas within the context of a wider world of possible actions and a wider community of fellow individuals doing the same.

People still think things in solitary confinement, so how can this possibly be the case?

&gt; It wouldn't exist without us, but we don't create the attribute in ourselves.

This whole paragraph confused me a bit, so this question may sound dumb, but if it doesn't exist without us, how can we not be the creators? And, on a related note, if we don't create it, what does?

&gt; If something is bi-located or co-located with another object, I don't know how you'd objectively count them.

Well, if we know the amount of excitation in the electron field that represents an electron (which we find by observing solitary electrons), then you can easily count them. If the peak is X times as high, then there are X electrons in the area.

&gt; I don't know if science even operated according to the ideal

Sure it did, just off the top of my head: take Louis Pasteur's experiment that disproved spontaneous generation for example. And, though these results are all about psychology for some reason (I suppose that is what's hot right now): [Google search](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=results%20couldn%27t%20be%20replicated)

&gt; We, as students, receive the clean finished high-theory, giving us a false impression of mastery and transcendence.

Ok, just to make sure I understand you, I'm going to rephrase this and you can tell me if I'm right: We, having not done the research ourselves, are simply taking the word of our predecessors. If this is basically what you meant, I'd say that it's often an exercise in physics classrooms to do some of the more simple experiments (simple meaning the school can afford it), to show their validity. Sure this isn't true for everything, and a lot of things don't get this verification, because it's tedious, and the only reason we've made it as far as we have is because we didn't try to start from scratch every generation, but instead built off the knowledge of previous generations.

&gt; We invent defintions in light of practical activities. This implies the link between a coined term's success and failure is somewhat determinable. We could just see how well it captures the meaning while easing communication.

But whoever the arbitrator of definitions is (even if it's the collective speakers of the language), what they say goes. Definitions are right because we say they are, models are right or wrong regardless of what we say. It's like the difference between an axiom and a theorem.

&gt; You can call a model true or false, depending on whether it coheres with axioms it's set upon. If the universe is reducible to a set of axiomatic laws, then the models that exist are true and those that don't exist are false.

So reading the Wikipedia article on Godel's incompleteness theorem, to try to understand this, I came across this sentence: ""For any such formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system."" Now, I don't know which ""parts"" (axiomatic, complete, etc.) this statement is talking about, but it seems to be accurate to the universe. Things about the universe are true, but we don't really know why: The speed of light and the gravitational constant, to name a couple. I think these just come down to ""that's how the universe is"".

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-16 21:25:48 :

Sorry, ran over, here's the rest:

&gt; How are we supposed to tell the difference without a return result?

Take two programs for example:

    i = 0
    while (true):
        i = i + 1
    return i

and

    i = 0
    while (i &lt; X)
        i = i + 1
    return i

As long as X is not infinity, then program 2 will return at some point, but program 1 will never return. This is fairly plain to see.

&gt; How do you decide the difference then?

Proofs, generally. There must be some where you can't decide the difference, as proved by Alan Turing. But the general problem is called ""The Halting Problem""

&gt; That exact number? Clearly. Is there a known polynomial time algorithm for doing that kind of thing? Clearly not. Otherwise, we would just use that and be done with it.

Yeah, but where did the idea that it'd take an obscenely long amount of time come from? Maybe I misunderstood your statement, but you seemed to be implying that that would be the best it would get, and I don't know where that idea came from. It's true we don't have a ""known polynomial time algorithm"" for it, but that's because we don't have a known algorithm, period, for it.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-19 03:28:25 :

&gt; If I'm parsing you correctly, then this is what I meant. This co-location allows multiple ideas to use the same neurons, so you can't say ""you don't have enough neurons"" because you should look at different permutations of neurons.

Aside from the very last line, I think we are in agreement. Ideas aren't simply regions in the brain, since two distinct ideas can share one-in-the-same region. This implies there is no function that will take you from an area of excitation within the brain and an single idea produced.

&gt;&gt; (I)t is possible that the meaning of a sentence is reducible to the meaning of more basic components put together. Again, this is a very unpopular view among the scientists and philosophers that study language and has been unpopular for several decades.

&gt; I'd personally (at least with the knowledge I currently have) see it as more reasonable to define the numbers as permutations of neurons, and singular meanings of words...

I tried to head off this tangent before it started, but it might be unavoidable. Your intuitions are supremely common and prima facie reasonable. I can't fault you for being partial to this view, since this is closest to our self-narrative when we compose sentences. 

However, there are some serious criticisms of this view, known as logical atomism. According to logical atomists, the semantic properties, (e.i. meaning), of an expression are reducible to the analysis of the meaning of its parts. The Vienna circle, including Russell, were famous for this view. I don't want to open a whole can of worms, because we are simply don't have room for another discussion on that level of complexity. If you'd like to explore this route, I'd recommend looking up 'logical atomism' or 'logical positivism' on Wikipedia or the SEP. There is a lot of background information necessary to start.

&gt; Ok, this makes sense, but ""bad days"" are still ""things"", right?

Sure, they just aren't physical objects. At they very least, a day is the complex union of several cosmic and local events with high regularity.

&gt;Sure, but I'd see it as rather unfair to expect this. A neural network is built of a number of connections that pales in comparison to that of any quadruped (or biped). Compare it more to the brain (if you want to call it that) of a flatworm...A pig wouldn't make the same mistake because it wasn't trained in the same way. A pig cares whether the thing will eat them, a neural net cares about getting the right answer.

I'm not trying to judge the theoretical limits of neural nets by current standards. That would be obviously uncharitable. I'm also not making a claim about the possibility of Strong AI. No doubt, there could be a perfect pig, (maybe even a human), emulator theoretically. 

I'm just trying to pin-point our intuitions about what is an isn't conscious. Despite having many, (all?), of the computational properties you'd expect from a brain, neural nets seem to obviously miss the mark. Once we include semantic properties from outside the neural net, (e.i. embodied perceptions), then the case isn't as clear cut. This, to my mind, casts serious don't on computationalism: the idea that the essential features of consciousness are computations.

&gt;All a flatworm has for a brain is a clump of nerve cells, and I think it'd be hard to determine whether it has a sense of self (I feel like there are even more complex animals that don't, like gorillas, failing that mirror experiment...

As you said at the end, there is an intuitive difference between self-consciousness and having a self. The flatworm doesn't know it is one, it is a worm, etc. But, it does have a primitive sense of closer, further, left, right: orientations relative to a body.

&gt; This isn't a one way gap though... A neural net can distinguish between a leopard, a jaguar and a cheetah based simply on the spot patterns. Easily. Most people can't do that.

What's your point? How is this relevant to consciousness?

&gt; Well, not the places themselves, but only because the location of a basketball isn't identical to the basketball. The polling places across America are parts of something identical with the election.

So, like all the buildings where the election is held plus all the ballots cast and un-cast plus all the voting equipment? That's what the election is?

&gt;I'd say they're a process that happens to do the will of the people. I don't know why that would make it abstract.

Well, the collective will of the people doesn't physically exist anywhere. It isn't just the sum of our individual preferences. Otherwise, controversial issues would 'cancel out' at the political level, since peoples extreme preference rankings would 'sum to zero'. The opposite is clearly true though.

&gt;I see your point, but I also think there's some equivocation around the word ""tool"" here...

If we had the brains and the capability, we would study them though, right? If the brain was the only physical remanent, then we should be able to study the wiring of the brain to learn about their ideas, right? Human being also 'make themselves', so we are the product and the machine.

&gt;Why not? He doesn't stop being president if any specific person (save himself) dies, so why would he stop being president if every specific person did?

Because America wouldn't have any citizens. It would be like being crowned Byzantine Emperor in 2016.

&gt; People still think things in solitary confinement, so how can this possibly be the case?

1. Solitary confinement is really bad for people's mental health. I would say that's a sign that isolation is indeed hostile to regular mental functioning.

2. Solitary confinement victims still have memories and an identity connected to the wider world. Therefore, they aren't completely isolated.

&gt;This whole paragraph confused me a bit, so this question may sound dumb, but if it doesn't exist without us, how can we not be the creators? And, on a related note, if we don't create it, what does?

Imagine a ball of clay and a stamp. If we stamp the clay, an impression will by left. The clay houses the image, but it wasn't the cause of the image: stamping it was. When we experience something, the world is 'stamping' us.

&gt;Well, if we know the amount of excitation in the electron field that represents an electron (which we find by observing solitary electrons), then you can easily count them. If the peak is X times as high, then there are X electrons in the area.

So, we count the electrons by observing them, and this allows us to make inferences about the number of electrons while their are unobserved? Isn't exact location, (being only one here), only a property while we observe?

&gt;But whoever the arbitrator of definitions is (even if it's the collective speakers of the language), what they say goes. Definitions are right because we say they are, models are right or wrong regardless of what we say. It's like the difference between an axiom and a theorem.

There is only an arbitrator, if it is something that is arbitrary. I'd say that there is a more natural relation between correct use and meaning. Meaning isn't something that requires arbitration from a language users. Users subordinate themselves to the rules of the language.

~~

Edit:

&gt; Sure it did, just off the top of my head: take Louis Pasteur's experiment that disproved spontaneous generation for example... (A) lot of things don't get this verification, because it's tedious, and the only reason we've made it as far as we have is because we didn't try to start from scratch every generation, but instead built off the knowledge of previous generations.

I feel like you may have left something off of the second sentence, but it's worth noting that Pasteur's experiments were aimed at a particular set of beliefs inherited from medieval times.  He clearly didn't disprove abiogenesis outright, as life on this planet must have arisen from non-animate life at some point in the past, (even if that was on another planet altogether). Pasteur's experiment also book-ends research programs dating back to the 17th century. In short, falsification applies to specific beliefs rather than world-views, (models?), and usually the end result rather than the driving force. The building of inter-generational knowledge is more important than falsifying any particular belief.

&gt;Take two programs for example...

I know absolutely nothing about computer programing notation. I can't read any of this. Sorry...

&gt;Proofs, generally. There must be some where you can't decide the difference, as proved by Alan Turing. But the general problem is called ""The Halting Problem""

Fun fact, the Halting Problem is a related sub-case of the Incompleteness theorem. Do you think there is a relationship between the ones that can't be decided? Just like the is NP and NP-complete, are there P and P-undecidable where P-undecidable is the set of equivalent problems that are undecided under the Halting problem? Just spit-balling here.

&gt;Yeah, but where did the idea that it'd take an obscenely long amount of time come from..? It's true we don't have a ""known polynomial time algorithm"" for it, but that's because we don't have a known algorithm, period, for it.

We do have a polynomial-time model of the brain on your account, (e.i. actual brains). I totally reject this, though. I'd say we do have a non-polynomial time algorithm for modeling brains: a simple route look-up table. We could just record every single neuron at a given moment using an absurd amount of computing power, convert that into a look-up table, and then have a computer search through to whole thing. I pulled this from Psychology Today: ""Mapping the brain will mean that if every switch in every synaptic end at every neuron is identified by a second of time then it will take 4,000,000,000 years to complete. The brain is that complex."" If they are right, then that implies brute force searching requires ~10^18 steps. That's where I'm coming from.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-19 16:12:16 :

&gt; So reading the Wikipedia article on Godel's incompleteness theorem, to try to understand this, I came across this sentence: ""For any such formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system."" Now, I don't know which ""parts"" (axiomatic, complete, etc.) this statement is talking about, but it seems to be accurate to the universe. Things about the universe are true, but we don't really know why: The speed of light and the gravitational constant, to name a couple. I think these just come down to ""that's how the universe is"".

That's an option, but that seems way spookier and anthropomorphized than rejecting physicalism. Let's consider how we can know about these truths without appealing to formal proof. Numbers aren't something we learn about through direct observation. Observing that you have 4 apples isn't proof of '2+2=4', despite 4 apples including 2 proper sub-sets of two. Rather, the justification seems to flow the other way, and the more general claim justifies our beliefs in particular cases here.

How, then, is this a priori knowledge possible? We can't know this by proof, if we are living in a world described by the incompleteness theorem. Could we know this by intuition? I say no, as it would require us to just have the correct belief by chance. These intuitions can't be expressed in terms of a formalized system and deliver us the truth, as per the conversation so far. If the system doesn't deliver formal results, then it can't make determinable answers in all cases. Since justification requires determinable reasons for determinable claims, intuitions can't justify anything. They are inclinations of indeterminable justification.

This leaves us with two options: skepticism and fictionalism. Skeptics would simply deny that mathematics achieves the level of certainty need for knowledge. This is bad, since science is grounded by mathematics; Without mathematical knowledge, there is no scientific knowledge. Fictionalism is the view that Mathematics is just a story we make up, and that it is 'true' as far as it is consistent. This requires giving up real-world reference for mathematic constructs and trivializes the meaning of 'true' to a syntactical definition.

So, either we don't conform one or more of the conditions for the incompleteness theorem, we know about numbers through occult, oracle-like intuitions, we don't know about numbers, or truth is relative to arbitrary rules and definitions. The easiest pill to swallow for me is the first option. I don't have global knowledge, so any of the global statements described by 1 are live options as far as I know. 2 is highly dubious for the brief reasons outlined, 3 strains credulity, and 4 is too po-mo for me to take seriously. You can make the choice as you see it.

awenonian @ 2016-12-20 22:16:45 :

&gt; Ideas aren't simply regions in the brain, since two distinct ideas can share one-in-the-same region. This implies there is no function that will take you from an area of excitation within the brain and an single idea produced.

I don't think this is cut and dry. If each idea was a region of 100 neurons, ideas could often share most of that region and you still have a function to get you from an area to an idea. It's just whether your area includes this neuron with those 99 others, or that one. Though, and maybe you meant this as well, I'd hesitate to say ideas are simply regions of the brain because it matters the make up as well. These 100 neurons in my brain don't map perfectly to a set of neurons in your brain simply because we're different people, and so our brains are different. To sum up, the point I'm arguing here is ""two distinct ideas can share one-in-the-same region"" this is, as far as I'm aware, a baseless claim taken at face value. Ideas could share regions, but I have no indication that two distinct ideas can share the exact same region.

&gt; I tried to head off this tangent before it started, but it might be unavoidable.

Yeah, I didn't notice when writing, but putting those statements near each other, I see that I more or less ignored what you said. Though I don't think it fully destroys my point to say, instead: ""I'd personally (at least with the knowledge I currently have) see it as more reasonable to define the numbers as permutations of neurons, *and permutations of words*..."". If we look at permutations of neuronal connections, then we still would have the numbers necessary to capture meanings.

&gt; Sure, they just aren't physical objects.

So, two things: 1, does physicalism balance on the idea that the world is made of nothing but objects, and it makes no sense to talk about collections thereof, or patterns thereof, as entities themselves?

&gt; At they very least, a day is the complex union of several cosmic and local events with high regularity.

and 2, what do you mean by ""high regularity""? What I'd imagine that to mean doesn't seem to apply well here.

&gt; I'm just trying to pin-point our intuitions about what is an isn't conscious. Despite having many, (all?), of the computational properties you'd expect from a brain, neural nets seem to obviously miss the mark.

My point, which may have got lost in tangents, was that they only miss the mark because they're aiming at a different target.

&gt; Once we include semantic properties from outside the neural net, (e.i. embodied perceptions), then the case isn't as clear cut.

If this is talking about the ""a pig can tell the difference between a leopard and a couch, because of survival instinct"" I'd just have to say it seems rather ridiculous to claim that the only way one could differentiate between something which has the capability to destroy a body and something which does not is if one had a body that it wished to preserve.

&gt; What's your point? How is this relevant to consciousness?

You seemed to be arguing against a neural net having capability of consciousness because it fails in certain regards. But why are those the regards it must pass in? Why are the regards we fail in less relevant, and the ones it fails in more?

&gt; So, like all the buildings where the election is held plus all the ballots cast and un-cast plus all the voting equipment? That's what the election is?

Yes. This is related to that question I posed of physicalism above. If I had to describe it, I'd say an election is a process (series of events, events being objects interacting), that includes all you said above (plus some extras, like, the whole Electoral College shtick). If describing it as such would be un-physicalist, then I suppose I'm not a physicalist. However, I don't think any of that requires anything non-physical to exist.

&gt; It isn't just the sum of our individual preferences. Otherwise, controversial issues would 'cancel out' at the political level, since peoples extreme preference rankings would 'sum to zero'. The opposite is clearly true though.

Only if they get summed at the political level, which they don't, really.

&gt; Human being also 'make themselves', so we are the product and the machine.

But not consciously. Humans make themselves through cellular processes, you don't decide to grow, you just do. So, there's still that difference between that which is produced by the machine, and the machine itself. If we had a machine that makes some product, even if that machine was capable of self repair, I think we'd still differentiate the things the machine produced from the machine itself. Right?

&gt; Because America wouldn't have any citizens. It would be like being crowned Byzantine Emperor in 2016.

It'd have Trump. And it'd have the land and the resources. Generally, once founded, you are a country until someone takes it from you. Normally countries employ armies to stop this from happening, and without one, someone could take it easily, but until someone did it'd still be America.

&gt; We are only able to produce ideas within the context of a wider world of possible actions and a wider community of fellow individuals doing the same.

Ok, going away from solitary confinement. What about the first person (creature?) to have ideas? How'd they do it?

&gt; The clay houses the image, but it wasn't the cause of the image: stamping it was. 

It certainly was an integral part of the cause. I think if you asked someone ""what created this mark"" they'd say ""that stamp there"". In other words, the stamp is the creator. What you're saying just, to my mind, simply doesn't seem to be true.

&gt; So, we count the electrons by observing them, and this allows us to make inferences about the number of electrons while their are unobserved? Isn't exact location, (being only one here), only a property while we observe?

Yes? I think? There is more than one way to observe an electron, and they will give different results (for example: the more you know about an particles location, the less you know about it's velocity, and vice versa. I believe this is the Uncertainty Principle, though I may have the wrong name). For example, if you measure something like the charge of an electron, then you can start to figure out how many electrons are in an area by measuring electric field near there and whatnot, without knowing where said electrons are.

&gt; There is only an arbitrator, if it is something that is arbitrary.

It has to be arbitrary. How else do you explain how we have so many different working languages in the world?

&gt; He clearly didn't disprove abiogenesis outright, as life on this planet must have arisen from non-animate life at some point in the past

That's why I didn't say abiogenesis. ;P

&gt; In short, falsification applies to specific beliefs

Yes, you use falsification to disprove a hypothesis.

&gt; usually the end result rather than the driving force

Not exactly sure what you meant here, but of course it is. If your goal is to learn, then you'll never get anywhere just disproving things.

&gt; I know absolutely nothing about computer programing notation. I can't read any of this. Sorry...

That's fine. Most of that I'd hoped would be self explanatory, but I'll just read them quick. This first says ""while true is true, add one to i. When you finish that loop, return i"". Clearly, this never returns, because true is never not true. The second one says ""while i is less than some value, add one to i. When you finish that loop, return i."" Here, as long as ""some value"" is not infinity, adding 1 to i will eventually reach and surpass it, at which point the loop will end, and return. My point was, we can see the first one will never stop, even though we don't have a return value (which was the answer to a question you had asked).

&gt; Do you think there is a relationship between the ones that can't be decided?

Possibly, but I wouldn't be certain. I'm not terribly deep into this theory stuff, yet, so the only undecidable problem I have is the one from Alan Turing's proof, which, if it helps, goes something like this: H is an algorithm that, given an algorithm, and a set of inputs, will determine if the algorithm halts on those inputs. We could devise an algorithm that processed H, and, if H said the program would halt, would enter an infinite loop, and if H said it wouldn't halt, would return. Then, feeding this new algorithm into itself (as both the algorithm and the input), either result (halting or not) would be a contradiction. Therefore, H cannot exist.

I have to wonder, if there is a relationship between those that can't be decided, couldn't we then use that relationship to decide them? This would lead to a contradiction.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-20 22:17:28 :

And some more, because these things are really long winded now... Any good ideas on how to solve that?



&gt; We do have a polynomial-time model of the brain on your account, (e.i. actual brains).

Ok, sure, but calling that ""known"" seems a bit of a stretch.

&gt; I pulled this from Psychology Today: ""Mapping the brain will mean that if every switch in every synaptic end at every neuron is identified by a second of time then it will take 4,000,000,000 years to complete. The brain is that complex."" If they are right, then that implies brute force searching requires ~10^18 steps. That's where I'm coming from.

A couple things: To start, saying that is like saying ""Taking a picture will mean that if every pixel in a 4k photo is identified in a second of time, it will take 70 days."" Well, yeah, but that's clearly not the case.

Second, if you were just using that as an estimate for the number of neural connections or whatever, that's fine. But no one uses brute force searches. Put all those things into a hash table and you can stop caring how many connections there are, as long as you have space to store them. A look up in a hash table is dependent on how full the table is, not how large the table is. (That is to say, a lookup on a hash table that can hold 100 elements, but is holding 90 will be the same speed as one that can hold 10,000 elements, but is holding 9,000. You can extrapolate that as you wish.)

&gt; That's an option, but that seems way spookier and anthropomorphized than rejecting physicalism.

I don't really know what you mean by spookier and anthropomorphized. I don't see how that is either of those things. It's not clear to me.

&gt; Observing that you have 4 apples isn't proof of '2+2=4', despite 4 apples including 2 proper sub-sets of two.

Hang on, observing 4 apples may not be proof 2+2=4, but isn't observing that that set of 4 apples includes 2 proper subsets of 2 proof of that?

&gt; Could we know this by intuition? I say no, as it would require us to just have the correct belief by chance.

This may be entirely incorrect to say, but: By chance, or by evolution? I mean, a bacterium certainly doesn't count. More simplistic animals may not either, so maybe it's an intuition we developed? I'm not really sure if this solves the issue, just trying to play devil's advocate a bit here.

&gt; So, either we don't conform one or more of the conditions for the incompleteness theorem, we know about numbers through occult, oracle-like intuitions, we don't know about numbers, or truth is relative to arbitrary rules and definitions.

I think I'd agree with you on 1, but isn't that what I said? With bringing up the speed of light and gravitational constant as things that are unprovable about the universe, didn't I say we don't conform one of the conditions? I may have just misunderstood your entire thing there, sorry if so, I'll need some more explaining to see what you meant.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-21 15:57:41 :

&gt; And some more, because these things are really long winded now... Any good ideas on how to solve that?

I propose we sort the sub-topics into two categories: Serious and non-serious. We'll wrap up the non-serious topic up with a reply and a counter-reply. The serious topic will take longer to settle. I'll reply under this format, but feel free to move things around in your reply. We'll stick to your convention thereafter. There goes non-serious:

&gt; Does physicalism balance on the idea that the world is made of nothing but objects, and it makes no sense to talk about collections thereof, or patterns thereof, as entities themselves?

This is a tough question with a lot of controversy on all sides. There are critics of physicalism that would agree and disagree; There are also proponents of physicalism that would agree and disagree. The issue is probably deeper than this particular topic: the mind's relation to the rest of the world.

&gt; what do you mean by ""high regularity""? What I'd imagine that to mean doesn't seem to apply well here.

Well, if the Earth was hurdling through space, rotating at some much higher and more irregular speed, then I'd say day and night wouldn't exist. If we only had light every 2-7 weeks for 1-29 hours, I don't think we'd call those periods days. Part of 'day' encodes a regular passage of time.

&gt; My point, which may have got lost in tangents, was that they only miss the mark because they're aiming at a different target.

I think we are on the same page then.

&gt; I'd just have to say it seems rather ridiculous to claim that the only way one could differentiate between something which has the capability to destroy a body and something which does not is if one had a body that it wished to preserve.

Why exactly? Is something seeming dangerous a matter of having a mode of thinking relative to the survival of a particular object? Wouldn't that constitute the hidden 'goal' that you mention above?

&gt; You seemed to be arguing against a neural net having capability of consciousness because it fails in certain regards. But why are those the regards it must pass in? Why are the regards we fail in less relevant, and the ones it fails in more?

The neural nets we have fail our tests for consciousness and the humans we pass our tests for consciousness. That is the only reason I brought it up. I actually think machines could support some kind of consciousness in the future, given sufficient modeling and emulation of ourselves. The problem isn't whether neural nets could possibly be conscious. It's about what we could add, at minimum, to close the qualitative gap between them and us. Machines are clearly better at performing every computational task already, so the missing thing must be non-computational.

&gt; If I had to describe it, I'd say an election is a process (series of events, events being objects interacting)...

It all comes down to how complex this interaction is, I suppose. If it is a direct relation of two wholly internal attributes, (two properties), then events could probably be physical. For example, the event 'cooling', could be described as the change of relative heat from concentrated to diffuse or something. 'Being American' is going to be much harder to define this way, since there isn't one relation that defines being American across all pairings.

&gt; It'd have Trump. And it'd have the land and the resources. Generally, once founded, you are a country until someone takes it from you. Normally countries employ armies to stop this from happening, and without one, someone could take it easily, but until someone did it'd still be America.

Different strokes, I guess. I've always thought that a nation was a collection of people united by shared political interest, and the Constitution, (the literal constituent of America), defines the people as the foundational element of government: a nation for the people, by the people, and of the people.

&gt; I think if you asked someone ""what created this mark"" they'd say ""that stamp there"". In other words, the stamp is the creator.

That's exactly what I said. The stamp created the image and the clay is the substantial grounds. The image wouldn't exist without the clay, but the clay didn't create the image.

&gt; What about the first person (creature?) to have ideas? How'd they do it?

This is one of those remarkable questions that no one knows the answer to. It is an empirical question at that, so we better leave it to the scientists.

&gt; For example, if you measure something like the charge of an electron, then you can start to figure out how many electrons are in an area by measuring electric field near there and whatnot, without knowing where said electrons are.

I think there are hidden complications that are going to make it hard to get a definite fix on the amount of charge in an area to the necessary level of precision. We are starting to creep into quantum electro-dynamics though, and I know neither of us know anything about that.

&gt; It has to be arbitrary. How else do you explain how we have so many different working languages in the world?

Through an iterative process of gradual drift in phonetics between people punctuated by the random appearance of novel elements plus interaction between populations. It's all about following the rules. The rules change over time, but the changes are step-wise and accountable within the resources of the language.

&gt; Not exactly sure what you meant here, but of course it is. If your goal is to learn, then you'll never get anywhere just disproving things.

Science must have more to do with the confirmation and transition of hypothesis than the falsification of hypothesis then, right?

&gt; My point was, we can see the first one will never stop, even though we don't have a return value (which was the answer to a question you had asked).

I guess this is why it threw me. I'm used to thinking about these things as a black box. If we could specify or describe the process of the mind like this, I don't think we'd have the problems we do. Testing whether an unspecified program will return or not seem more analogous to the problem before us.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-21 16:38:16 :

&gt; This is a tough question with a lot of controversy on all sides.

Then I'd like to define my brand of physicalism as allowing these collections. It makes sense to me to talk about this group of basket balls as the ""sports equipment"", without the sports equipment itself existing as anything other than a collection of objects.

&gt; Part of 'day' encodes a regular passage of time.

That's kind of what I figured, but really that's the only regular part of a day, isn't it? So, ""high"" regularity doesn't seem to apply exactly.

&gt; Why exactly?

Because I don't have to care about an object's survival to know when it'd be in jeopardy. I can tell you that a hammer can break a vase, without ""wish[ing] to preserve"" the vase.

&gt; Machines are clearly better at performing every computational task already, so the missing thing must be non-computational.

Only tasks for which they have an algorithm. So, the missing thing could be an unknown algorithm.

&gt; 'Being American' is going to be much harder to define this way, since there isn't one relation that defines being American across all pairings.

Much harder, but not impossible. We have rules for what makes one American, so if the events of your life contain the events necessary to be a citizen, then you are an American.

&gt; a nation for the people, by the people, and of the people.

Yeah, but ""the people"" includes Trump, and so ""the people"" isn't completely destroyed.

&gt; That's exactly what I said. The stamp created the image and the clay is the substantial grounds. The image wouldn't exist without the clay, but the clay didn't create the image.

Yeah, rereading that, I realized my mistake.

&gt; This is one of those remarkable questions that no one knows the answer to.

But, you've stated that ideas need a set of others with ideas as well. If this is the case, wouldn't the first thing with ideas be an impossible concept?

&gt; but the changes are step-wise and accountable within the resources of the language.

So what made the English call it an apple, but Russians call it a (Google translate don't fail me now) ""яблоко""? How is that not arbitrary?

&gt; Science must have more to do with the confirmation and transition of hypothesis than the falsification of hypothesis then, right?

More to, yes, but your point was that the falsification largely doesn't happen. Happening less, and happening nearly never, are different things.

&gt; If we could specify or describe the process of the mind like this, I don't think we'd have the problems we do.

And I take it that while I think we could do that, you don't?

&gt; Testing whether an unspecified program will return or not seem more analogous to the problem before us.

If the program is unspecified, then you can't really know. There are algorithms that could take trillions of years to return (people try to create these, see [Busy Beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver)), so you can't just run it and see, and if the program is unspecified, you can't know if it will return if you just give it another trillion years, or if it's stuck in a loop.

&gt;&gt; Ideas aren't simply regions in the brain, since two distinct ideas can share one-in-the-same region. This implies there is no function that will take you from an area of excitation within the brain and an single idea produced.

&gt; I don't think this is cut and dry. If each idea was a region of 100 neurons, ideas could often share most of that region and you still have a function to get you from an area to an idea. It's just whether your area includes this neuron with those 99 others, or that one. Though, and maybe you meant this as well, I'd hesitate to say ideas are simply regions of the brain because it matters the make up as well.

Yes, I was including the scenario you outlined here. One difference in overlap implies a difference, even if that difference is relatively small. This strains credulity, (what other bodily function do we definite one cell at a time?), but it is the most charitable logical interpretation available. What other factors would you like to add?

&gt; These 100 neurons in my brain don't map perfectly to a set of neurons in your brain simply because we're different people, and so our brains are different. To sum up, the point I'm arguing here is ""two distinct ideas can share one-in-the-same region"" this is, as far as I'm aware, a baseless claim taken at face value. Ideas could share regions, but I have no indication that two distinct ideas can share the exact same region.

Supporting that claim isn't really the thrust of the argument. Rather, it is one of the option available given what I argued with respect to the complexity of language. Language use implies either that ideas are physically indistinct within the brain or sentence meaning is determinable through atomistic analysis. #1 isn't support in itself. Rather, it is the only available option after rejecting #2 by the disjunctive principle.

&gt;  I don't think it fully destroys my point to say, instead: ""I'd personally (at least with the knowledge I currently have) see it as more reasonable to define the numbers as permutations of neurons, and permutations of words..."". If we look at permutations of neuronal connections, then we still would have the numbers necessary to capture meanings.

The numbers come out better for you; There is no denying that. Unfortunately, it goes against the best science and the best theory we have. A good theory can still turn out to be wrong in the end. If you'd like to test your theory, start by telling me how words get their meanings according to this view.

&gt; Possibly, but I wouldn't be certain. I'm not terribly deep into this theory stuff, yet, so the only undecidable problem I have is the one from Alan Turing's proof...
I have to wonder, if there is a relationship between those that can't be decided, couldn't we then use that relationship to decide them? This would lead to a contradiction.

&gt; A couple things: To start, saying that is like saying ""Taking a picture will mean that if every pixel in a 4k photo is identified in a second of time, it will take 70 days."" Well, yeah, but that's clearly not the case.

Don't worry about their time estimate. It was clearly a hokey, pop-science schtick used to stupify the audience. I was just using the number to calculate the number of steps. I agree that 1 second per step isn't necessarily significant.

&gt; Second, if you were just using that as an estimate for the number of neural connections or whatever, that's fine. But no one uses brute force searches. Put all those things into a hash table and you can stop caring how many connections there are, as long as you have space to store them. A look up in a hash table is dependent on how full the table is, not how large the table is.

Yes, I went full Chinese Room with the brute search, but I can't get behind the idea of a hash table, since we'd need a function to generate such a table in the first place. Whether the brain is functionally ordered in the first place is part of what we are debating.

I think an excellent way the capture our overall disagreement has to do with our interpretation of the cosmological principle: as without as within. We both agree that the mind, (brain), functions like the wider universe, and that the microcosm of the mind resembles the cosmos itself. The disagreement comes in at the level of the cosmos: you think the universe is well-ordered and determinable while I think the universe isn't well-ordered and ultimately indeterminable.

&gt; I don't really know what you mean by spookier and anthropomorphized. I don't see how that is either of those things. It's not clear to me.

Well, people usually say substance dualism, the view that human beings have immaterial thinking souls, is a spooky anthropomorphized view. It is spooky because it posits strange entities that don't much impinge on day-to-day life; it is anthropomorphized because it posits human behavior as a fundamental feature of natural phenomena.

While physicalism doesn't seem spooky or human-centered on its face, it has unsavory implications:

&gt; I think I'd agree with you on 1, but isn't that what I said? With bringing up the speed of light and gravitational constant as things that are unprovable about the universe, didn't I say we don't conform one of the conditions? I may have just misunderstood your entire thing there, sorry if so, I'll need some more explaining to see what you meant.

The things that are just true but unproven under Godel's theorem are truths about numbers. Stating that we just know empirical facts doesn't really help, since this is a problem with mathematical knowledge. 

I suppose you could fit these same givens into the original problem: Either empirical knowledge fails as a complete system, or empirical knowledge is gained intuitively, or empirical knowledge is impossible, or empirical knowledge is relative.

&gt; Hang on, observing 4 apples may not be proof 2+2=4, but isn't observing that that set of 4 apples includes 2 proper subsets of 2 proof of that?

I didn't mean anything special with my phrasing there. I meant to say the first thing. I just didn't want to repeat myself ('observing 2 apples+2 apples= 4 apples doesn't prove 2+2=4').

&gt; This may be entirely incorrect to say, but: By chance, or by evolution? I mean, a bacterium certainly doesn't count. More simplistic animals may not either, so maybe it's an intuition we developed? I'm not really sure if this solves the issue, just trying to play devil's advocate a bit here.

It doesn't really matter what the origin of the intuition is. What matters is the chain of justification. If something can't be rationally justified, (e.i. having distinct reasons with direct functional relations to it), then it is chancy. Whether or not there is a chain of justification is all that really matters, frankly.

Evolution might be a source of faculties that give us knowledge by intuition. It all depends on how you define your selection pressures and the empirical facts that neither of us are familiar with. There are lots of ways to 'smuggle in' an answer to the questions above.

&gt; Ok, sure, but calling that ""known"" seems a bit of a stretch.

If you had a little black box with an algorithm that could solve problem-X, would you say you have the algorithm? Does being unable to describe the process change that? Genuine questions; I don't have strong feelings either way.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-22 16:35:04 :

I'm going to cut a lot out here. Let me know if I skip over anything good.

&gt; Then I'd like to define my brand of physicalism as allowing these collections. It makes sense to me to talk about this group of basket balls as the ""sports equipment"", without the sports equipment itself existing as anything other than a collection of objects.

That's cool with me. I think I laid down pretty clear conditions as far as that goes. We can test for that in the future.

&gt; That's kind of what I figured, but really that's the only regular part of a day, isn't it? So, ""high"" regularity doesn't seem to apply exactly.

Because days happen every day. They are regular events. The sunrise rises in the morning and sets on every day. That's what I means. A day isn't an arbitrary 24 units.

&gt; Because I don't have to care about an object's survival to know when it'd be in jeopardy. I can tell you that a hammer can break a vase, without ""wish[ing] to preserve"" the vase.

You are capable of caring about survival though. Neural nets can't and probably can't answer ""Is this hammer dangerous to this vase?"" as a practical question yet. Just saying.

&gt; Only tasks for which they have an algorithm. So, the missing thing could be an unknown algorithm.

This seems like it's part of a wider debate with us. I don't see any reason to think we are going to find the Great Algorithm; you seem indepressibly certain that it is only a matter of time.

&gt; Much harder, but not impossible. We have rules for what makes one American, so if the events of your life contain the events necessary to be a citizen, then you are an American.

Not all Americans are legal citizens. There is a cultural dimension to American that this totally misses out on.

&gt; Yeah, but ""the people"" includes Trump, and so ""the people"" isn't completely destroyed.

It's We the people, not Me the person.

&gt; But, you've stated that ideas need a set of others with ideas as well. If this is the case, wouldn't the first thing with ideas be an impossible concept?

It would probably be the first set of ideas or the first community of thinkers. You are right that there wouldn't be a proper first.

&gt; So what made the English call it an apple, but Russians call it a (Google translate don't fail me now) ""яблоко""? How is that not arbitrary?

They are both variation on the proto-indo-european root (abel). Over time, ours became 'apple' and theirs became 'y-abl-oko'.

&gt; More to, yes, but your point was that the falsification largely doesn't happen. Happening less, and happening nearly never, are different things.

I also said that Pasteur's experiment was the end product of science, not the animating force of discovery. That is a pretty substantial rebuke. Not only does it happen less often in my view, but it also is far less significant.

&gt; And I take it that while I think we could do that, you don't?

I don't. If we ever create thinking machines, we are going to need to program them to learn for themselves. After a certain threshold of autonomy is acheived, then the machine will start 'making itself' like people do. We will never program a mind in directly.

&gt; If the program is unspecified, then you can't really know. There are algorithms that could take trillions of years to return (people try to create these, see Busy Beaver), so you can't just run it and see, and if the program is unspecified, you can't know if it will return if you just give it another trillion years, or if it's stuck in a loop.

I thought this was significant, so I'm bumping it over to serious. I'll let you have the last word on everything else. I'm switching to the serious thread from here out.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-22 18:05:53 :

&gt; This strains credulity, (what other bodily function do we definite one cell at a time?)

Not many (I only refrain from saying ""any"" because I don't know about anatomy) other bodily functions matter at the cellular level. It doesn't matter which aiolus in the lung absorbs the oxygen, but the brain is a different matter. Like if it were a road, we don't define every small stretch of a highway, but we do define every intersection in a neighborhood. 

&gt; What other factors would you like to add?

I've talked previously of neural connections, and how bonds strengthen or weaken. This is a factor, and I'll have different strengths of bonds in my brain than you will in yours, making the same regions dissimilar.

&gt; Supporting that claim isn't really the thrust of the argument.

I was arguing that point mostly to push against the ""there is no function to take you from an idea to a region in the brain"".

&gt; If you'd like to test your theory, start by telling me how words get their meanings according to this view.

Do you mean how we connect words to meanings: Same way you learn anything. Or how words got their meaning in the first place: We collectively agreed that it meant that.

&gt; Yes, I went full Chinese Room with the brute search, but I can't get behind the idea of a hash table, since we'd need a function to generate such a table in the first place

Yeah, but that can take as long as we want really, as it only needs to be done once.

&gt; The disagreement comes in at the level of the cosmos: you think the universe is well-ordered and determinable while I think the universe isn't well-ordered and ultimately indeterminable.

Yeah, I think this is a good way to phrase it. And I think that the fact that we've been able to make predictions that hold on all but the quantum level (and we're working on those ones too) stands as evidence of my view.

&gt; The things that are just true but unproven under Godel's theorem are truths about numbers. Stating that we just know empirical facts doesn't really help, since this is a problem with mathematical knowledge.

Yes. I figured these truths were things like 2 is 1 greater than 1, and 3 is one greater than 2. Your argument, if I'm not misrepresenting it, was that the *universe*, under my model, would be inconsistent with the Incompleteness theorem. However, I stated that it wouldn't, because there are things that are just true, but you can't prove: The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, and no laws of the universe will show that, it's just a constant that has to be there. Just like 2 is a constant that has to be 1 greater than 1 for math to work.

&gt; I suppose you could fit these same givens into the original problem: Either empirical knowledge fails as a complete system, or empirical knowledge is gained intuitively, or empirical knowledge is impossible, or empirical knowledge is relative.

I think I'm getting lost in language a bit here, because I don't know which of those seems most likely to me. I don't know what problems any of those statements would cause, and that's generally how I evaluate these things: if it causes problems (as in contradictions, not just difficult to explain things), it's not true. I'm not sure I can continue here.

&gt; 'observing 2 apples+2 apples= 4 apples doesn't prove 2+2=4'

But why not? Unless you think apples are different from everything else, why would observing that 2 things, and 2 more things gives you 4 things not be proof of 2+2=4?

&gt; If you had a little black box with an algorithm that could solve problem-X, would you say you have the algorithm? 

No. If I had a dog, and the dog had a collar, but I couldn't take the collar from the dog, I don't really have a collar. So, in this case, I'd have a black box, and the box would have an algorithm, but since I can't access the algorithm, I don't have an algorithm.

&gt; Does being unable to describe the process change that?

Oh, I kinda assumed this from it being a black box.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-22 18:29:01 :

&gt; Because days happen every day. They are regular events. The sunrise rises in the morning and sets on every day. That's what I means. A day isn't an arbitrary 24 units.

Ok. I think, since we talked about ""bad days"" I assumed the events of the day were important, and I don't think those are regular. But yes, a day as a rotation of the earth is fairly regular. Though I think a day as in ""How was your day"" is not. This was my point of confusion.

&gt; You are capable of caring about survival though. Neural nets can't and probably can't answer ""Is this hammer dangerous to this vase?"" as a practical question yet. Just saying.

I think you're wrong about that. Given the necessary inputs and training, I think they could sort things into a ""capable of breaking vases"" pile and a ""not capable of breaking vases"" pile. That's what machine learning algorithms do, is sort things into piles.

&gt; This seems like it's part of a wider debate with us.

Hence why I said ""could"". I was mostly pushing against your statement ""the missing thing must be non-computational."" It *could* be non-computational, but it doesn't *have* to be.

&gt; Not all Americans are legal citizens. There is a cultural dimension to American that this totally misses out on.

Well, it depends on what you mean by American. If what you mean has a definition, then you can see if any individual matches that definition. If it doesn't, then on what basis are they American?

&gt; It's We the people, not Me the person.

The set of ""We the people"" contains everyone, including Trump. If everyone but Trump is removed, the set is still not empty. Furthermore, basing America on this seems odd. If America were to be invaded and taken over by a foreign country (suspend disbelief for a bit), The People would still largely exist, but America would not.

&gt; It would probably be the first set of ideas or the first community of thinkers. You are right that there wouldn't be a proper first.

But how could there be a first thought? Without any other thoughts, under your model, the first thought couldn't exist. And without a first thought, how would there be any thoughts?

&gt; They are both variation on the proto-indo-european root (abel). Over time, ours became 'apple' and theirs became 'y-abl-oko'.

2 things: Why'd they pick ""abel"" to start? And 2: this is good for this case, but what about things that arose independently: English's ""air"" to Japanese's ""空気"" (apparently: Kūki). It still seems largely arbitrary to me. Sure, the changes from the initial conditions may be non-arbitrary, but the initial conditions were still arbitrary.

&gt; I also said that Pasteur's experiment was the end product of science, not the animating force of discovery.

Sure. But I don't know how an experiment used to *falsify* something could ever be the animating force of *discovery*.

&gt; Not only does it happen less often in my view, but it also is far less significant.

Sure. I think I'm willing to grant you that science is more about learning things than falsifying things. If I remember correctly, you brought this up as a point to say ""the scientific method is mostly an ideal"", which was against my claim that there was a sort of ""survival of the fittest"" in science. I think as long as there is *some* falsification, then my claim of it being a ""survival of the fittest"" stands.

&gt; We will never program a mind in directly.

Why is making something with ""a certain threshold of autonomy"" not programming a mind directly? Just because it hasn't learned, it's not a mind yet?

Edit:

I didn't initially write anything for this, since I didn't have much to say, but I figured it'd be good to at least acknowledge I read it:

&gt; I thought this was significant, so I'm bumping it over to serious. I'll let you have the last word on everything else. I'm switching to the serious thread from here out.

So, cool, sounds good.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-23 16:17:02 :

&gt; It doesn't matter which aiolus in the lung absorbs the oxygen, but the brain is a different matter...

Why so confident? Specifying intersections rather than neurons individually doesn't seem to change that much.

&gt; I've talked previously of neural connections, and how bonds strengthen or weaken. This is a factor, and I'll have different strengths of bonds in my brain than you will in yours, making the same regions dissimilar

How does this challenge the argument?

&gt;  I was arguing that point mostly to push against the ""there is no function to take you from an idea to a region in the brain"".

Then you need to address the argument I used to support that premise. I didn't just pull the premise out of thin air. It is the end result of a deduction. I might be wrong, but you should argue to that effect.

&gt; Do you mean how we connect words to meanings: Same way you learn anything. Or how words got their meaning in the first place: We collectively agreed that it meant that.

OK, let's examine the second response. It's closest to what we are interested in. There are a few ways people can collectively agree on something. I'd like to pick up on the two most common ways people come to agree on things: through collective political action and through wide spread adoption. Through political action, a select few may act on behalf of a wider community to make a discreet choice. This requires legitimate authority, however you define it. While there may be a case for this kind of term formation within modern languages, through the formation of dictionaries and formal academies, but is a poor model for all language formation.

Through collective adoption, ordinary members of the community make individual choices about the adoption of a practice until a threshold is met. After the threshold is cleared, the practice is held in common. This would require meanings to either predate their words or it would require individuals have the capacity to create meanings as they coin terms. I know you aren't keen on the first, so let's examine the second.

Let's say I decide to coin multiple terms at once. This should be possible, if we have the capacity to count a single term. After all, coining meanings is supposed to be a wholly internal capacity of the human brain here. Given any minimum sized collection of terms and the common rules of syntax, we should able to compose a language.

In theory, the composer of such a language is the only person capable of understanding it. How does one interpret the truth conditions of a sentence in this language? The only arbitrator here is the user/inventor, so we must default to their usage to define correct usage. Unfortunately, this implies every use is self-authorizing. Therefore, falsehood is impossible to encode in such a language, and, by extension, so is truth.

This is known as the private language argument. It was invented by the famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.

&gt; Yeah, but that can take as long as we want really, as it only needs to be done once.

You can't possibly test whether your table works though. Saying it only needs to work once implies you know it will work, or you know that something would work.

&gt; Yes. I figured these truths were things like 2 is 1 greater than 1, and 3 is one greater than 2. Your argument, if I'm not misrepresenting it, was that the universe, under my model, would be inconsistent with the Incompleteness theorem. 

Facts about numbers seem like facts about the world we live in to me.

&gt; However, I stated that it wouldn't, because there are things that are just true, but you can't prove: The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, and no laws of the universe will show that, it's just a constant that has to be there. Just like 2 is a constant that has to be 1 greater than 1 for math to work.

The speed of light I a very bad candidate, since we already know of a complete, consistent models that describe the speed to light: Special and General Relativity. The fact that it is a constant allows us to us axioms of arithmetic to 'work with it'. It isn't an assumed value like the truth of mathematical axioms.

&gt; But why not? Unless you think apples are different from everything else, why would observing that 2 things, and 2 more things gives you 4 things not be proof of 2+2=4?

Because apples are different from non-apples. This differential fact makes them distinct things to be counted. It's what makes the claim, ""Sometime '2+2=4'"" much easier to prove than, ""For all things, '2+2=4'"".

&gt; No. If I had a dog, and the dog had a collar, but I couldn't take the collar from the dog, I don't really have a collar. So, in this case, I'd have a black box, and the box would have an algorithm, but since I can't access the algorithm, I don't have an algorithm.

Why do you need a dog collar other than to walk the dog? Why do you need an algorithm outside of using it as a solution?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2016-12-23 19:18:45 :

&gt; Why so confident? Specifying intersections rather than neurons individually doesn't seem to change that much.

I thought this was kinda given based on the structure of the brain. But let's see. We don't define blood vessels cell by cell because the important part of a vessel is the path it takes. This is very similar to the brain, except the paths it takes are, instead of tubes made up of multiple cells, single cell wide paths that are very branching (i.e. one neuron leads to or comes from multiple others, it's not often a straight path with no offshoots.). So, the reason we define the brain cell by cell is because that's the units where it matters. If we were talking the road analogy, while we define roads in a neighborhood by very short bits, we don't define highways by the same distance, because there isn't anything ""interesting"" (for lack of a better word) going on in that short of a stretch on a highway. Does that make sense?

&gt; How does this challenge the argument?

I don't think it does, it was meant an answer to your question ""what other factors would you like to add?"" Was that an argument? The challenge is mostly above.

&gt; Then you need to address the argument I used to support that premise. I didn't just pull the premise out of thin air. It is the end result of a deduction. I might be wrong, but you should argue to that effect.

The argument you used is that since two ideas can be in the same space, you can't have a function that relates them (as then you'd have two results for the same input). I argued this premise by saying that there is no evidence that two ideas can be in the same space. How does this not address your argument?

If you mean to imply that you had an argument for why you said two distinct ideas could share the same region, then I don't know what that was, since, as far as I can tell, you just said ""since two distinct ideas can share one in the same region.""

&gt; This would require meanings to either predate their words or it would require individuals have the capacity to create meanings as they coin terms. I know you aren't keen on the first

Hang on. I don't know where you got this. Have I said somewhere something that would be in contention with that? It seems to me that apples existed before we had the word for them, which seems like a clear cut example of a meaning existing before the word. Unless you meant something else?

&gt; In theory, the composer of such a language is the only person capable of understanding it. How does one interpret the truth conditions of a sentence in this language? The only arbitrator here is the user/inventor, so we must default to their usage to define correct usage. Unfortunately, this implies every use is self-authorizing. Therefore, falsehood is impossible to encode in such a language, and, by extension, so is truth.

Alright, I can't say I fully understood that. But, the first thing that came to mind when reading this is: What language was only created by one guy? I'm not sure this addresses the problem, since I don't think changing it from one person to a set of people changes the problem that it's self authorizing, it's just who the self refers to. I'm not sure why self-authorizing means you can't say true things though. I'll look more into it but I don't want to halt the rest of the conversation on that.

&gt; You can't possibly test whether your table works though. Saying it only needs to work once implies you know it will work, or you know that something would work.

You could easily test it with smaller data sets. This is common practice.

&gt; Facts about numbers seem like facts about the world we live in to me.

I don't quite know what you mean by that. It sounds like you agreed with me, but I sense that that's not what you meant to mean.

&gt; consistent models that describe the speed to light: Special and General Relativity.

Do they? I was unaware of this, and thought that they more or less rested on the (seemingly correct) assumption that the speed of light was constant, regardless of observer. Not that they showed that.

&gt; The fact that it is a constant allows us to us axioms of arithmetic to 'work with it'.

If we have to use arithmetic axioms to ""work with it"" then those would be the things that are true but you can't prove.

&gt; Because apples are different from non-apples. This differential fact makes them distinct things to be counted. It's what makes the claim, ""Sometime '2+2=4'"" much easier to prove than, ""For all things, '2+2=4'"".

Alright. I suppose that's true. I'll grant you that.

&gt; Why do you need a dog collar other than to walk the dog? Why do you need an algorithm outside of using it as a solution?

To understand it. To recreate it. Numerous things. Do you think there's no point in learning basic maths because we have calculators that can do it for us?

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-28 16:37:54 :

Hey, Merry Late Christmas!

&gt; So, the reason we define the brain cell by cell is because that's the units where it matters. If we were talking the road analogy, while we define roads in a neighborhood by very short bits, we don't define highways by the same distance, because there isn't anything ""interesting"" (for lack of a better word) going on in that short of a stretch on a highway. Does that make sense?

This all makes perfect sense. I was questioning your confidence in this making a difference relative to our discussion. I don't see how defining a structure in terms of its connective nodes rather than the individual connections makes consciousness happen. You seemed to think it was very much so relevant.

&gt; I don't think it does, it was meant an answer to your question ""what other factors would you like to add?"" Was that an argument? The challenge is mostly above.

I was mostly curious as to what this fact does to differentiate what I've been talking about from our best characterizations of the brain. You seemed to be saying that I was leaving out crucial details: details that would help your case presumably. I don't see how this helps your case in particular. Furthermore, it seems like I could edit me claim to include area of excitation+previous traffic saturation and represent the exact same argument.

&gt; The argument you used is that since two ideas can be in the same space, you can't have a function that relates them (as then you'd have two results for the same input). I argued this premise by saying that there is no evidence that two ideas can be in the same space. How does this not address your argument?

That does address a sub-argument, so you aren't totally off base. This is the argument in premise form:

1. OvA (Argued for in write-up)
2.~A (Private Language Argument or any Anti-atomist argument)
3.O (Disjunctive Principle)
4.O&gt;~F (Definition of Function)
C. ~F (Modes ponens)

Where O stands for the overlap junk, A stands for logical atomism, and F stands for functionalism. You can't reject 5 without challenging at least one premise between 1-4. You can't reject 4 in good faith, since it is just the definition of a function reworked to match what we're talking about. You can't reject 3 without rejecting either 1 or 2. That means you either need to challenge the validity of my disjunction or argue for logical atomism.

&gt; Hang on. I don't know where you got this. Have I said somewhere something that would be in contention with that? 

Well, if we assign meaning to things only by coining terms arbitrarily, then meanings are artificial. No artifact predates it's own creation. Therefore, on this view, meanings only exist when we create them. No meaning can be just discovered laying around.

&gt;  It seems to me that apples existed before we had the word for them, which seems like a clear cut example of a meaning existing before the word. Unless you meant something else?

You are confusing mental content for first-order meaning. Our sentences are about something. This something is sometimes what a sentence means. However, it isn't identical to meaning. Rather, the meaning of a sentence is its overall significance: the affect of the sentence as a sign.

For example, 'Apples are red' has clear content, (Apples being red). However, the significance of 'Apples are red' is more complicated. If someone asked me what kind of red to paint their room, I could say 'Apples are red.' Here, the signification isn't the bare state of affairs, but the fact plus a suggestion. It means painting your room like an apple would get the job done.

&gt; the first thing that came to mind when reading this is: What language was only created by one guy?

Short answer: None. I'm saying such a thing is impossible. It is a logical consequence of logical atomism though. If logical.atomism is true, then we are able to define terms in total isolation from other users and other terms. If a language is just a minimum-sized collection of terms plus rules of syntax, then it should be be able to construct a language with these atomistic terms. Since this is impossible, however, logical atomism must be false.

&gt; I'm not sure why self-authorizing means you can't say true things though. I'll look more into it but I don't want to halt the rest of the conversation on that.

Gotcha! It might help to think of this in terms of objective truth conditions. What makes something true or false should depend on the state of affairs in reality, not the fact that someone is present to remark on those states of affairs. A self-authorizing statement only depends on itself, and therefore can only coincide with state of affairs by accident.

&gt; You could easily test it with smaller data sets. This is common practice.

There's the other shoe! This, I think, is what I'm looking for. Regardless of whether a problem is P or NP, working with less complex sets of data will reduce computation time. My initial reaction is that this changes the subject, since the brain isn't simple or composed of simple modular units, (e.i. connective properties aren't strictly regional). What do you think though?

&gt; I don't quite know what you mean by that. It sounds like you agreed with me, but I sense that that's not what you meant to mean.

I'd include some non-physical things in the universe, since I'm not a physicalist. However, I'm sure you aren't down for that.

&gt; Do they? I was unaware of this, and thought that they more or less rested on the (seemingly correct) assumption that the speed of light was constant, regardless of observer. Not that they showed that.

Regardless of the level of proof, you can re-arrange E=mc^2 to get c=(E/m)^1/2. This is a definition of c in terms of discoverable properties. If a thing is equivalent to a relation between two known things, then it isn't unknown. If we have justified true belief about something, then it exceeds the conditions Gödel puts on the axioms of arithmetic. It would have to fail to be justified or fail to be wholly true or fail to be a belief in order to satisfy the conditions Gödel sets out.

&gt; To understand it. To recreate it. Numerous things. Do you think there's no point in learning basic maths because we have calculators that can do it for us?

You're making a good point here. I should have sharpened my distinction between unknown and known here. It seems like knowledge by acquaintance, (knowing that something exists), isn't the same as knowledge by description, (knowing how something exists). You're right.

awenonian @ 2016-12-30 21:57:01 :

&gt; Hey, Merry Late Christmas!

And to you as well!

&gt; I don't see how defining a structure in terms of its connective nodes rather than the individual connections makes consciousness happen.

Hmm. I may have been mistaken then. I don't think I'm confident in knowing how consciousness happens, I just don't see anything else that could be making it happen besides the physical components that are demonstrably there. I'm trying to offer ideas as to how it might work, but, as I am not a neuroscientist or any such thing, I don't really know. As a side note, I'm not certain what the difference between ""connections"" and ""connective nodes"" is.

&gt; You seemed to be saying that I was leaving out crucial details: details that would help your case presumably.

Ah, I don't think was actually my intention, I just wanted to reiterate what I said earlier, because, while I had said it earlier, it seemed like a relevant answer to your question.

&gt; Furthermore, it seems like I could edit me claim to include area of excitation+previous traffic saturation and represent the exact same argument.

I'm not sure what claim you're referring to. I keep getting lost going back in the comment chain.

&gt; That does address a sub-argument, so you aren't totally off base. This is the argument in premise form:

Alright, I'm just going to put my arguments against each part I draw issue with individually, in no particular order:

&gt; 2.~A (Private Language Argument or any Anti-atomist argument)

I'll likely address this again later, and when I get to that part of the comment, I'll either say see here or I'll add anything else, but looking back at where you brought up the private language argument, I'd like to challenge this point (made in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/56e4ey/cmv_the_hard_problem_of_consciousness_is_a/dbjrgwy/):

&gt; In theory, the composer of such a language is the only person capable of understanding it.

This seems like a wholly different scenario to what you were describing before. You were talking about coining terms in a language. If you coin new terms that are to be collectively adopted, a basic requirement is that people other than you be able to understand it. 

From my reading of the private language argument (I looked on SEP, though I'd like to note it stated things like ""there has been fundamental and widespread disagreement over its details, its significance and even its intended conclusion, let alone over its soundness.""), it seemed that it was intended to say that a language that only the composer could understand is impossible. This is entirely fine: we're looking to build a language that many people could understand.

&gt; OvA (Argued for in write-up)

I'm sorry, I really hate to ask this of you, but could you perhaps provide a link to the comment where this write-up is? I'm not great with navigating the comment chain, and clicking ""context"" on this comment doesn't seem to go back far enough.

&gt; Where O stands for the overlap junk,

What do you mean by ""overlap junk""? Is that the statement: ""two disparate ideas can inhabit the same space"" (or something similar) that we were talking about before? It seems you've used it as a shorthand, but I've not quite caught your meaning.

&gt; If someone asked me what kind of red to paint their room, I could say 'Apples are red.' Here, the signification isn't the bare state of affairs, but the fact plus a suggestion. It means painting your room like an apple would get the job done.

I think I understand what you mean. This sounds like implication to me. Like in the movies if a crime boss says ""Maybe I'll pay your wife a visit."" there's more meaning there than just the words: He's implying that he'll do something horrible to her. Is this accurate to what you mean? Does logical atomism not allow for ""extra-verbal"" (for lack of a better word) ""atoms"" (also, for lack of a better word)?

&gt; Short answer: None. I'm saying such a thing is impossible.

I think it's more accurate to say that you are saying that a language only created *for* one guy is impossible. Part of your arugment rests on the assumption that the language could only be understood by the creator.

&gt; My initial reaction is that this changes the subject, since the brain isn't simple or composed of simple modular units, (e.i. connective properties aren't strictly regional). What do you think though?

Well, to start, I agree the brain isn't simple, but I do think it'd be accurate to say that it is composed of simple modular units: neurons. I think based on what you've said (""connective properties aren't strictly regional""), that you don't mean neurons, though. 

However, I don't think this is relevant. We aren't talking about testing the brain on smaller data sets, we're talking about testing the table on smaller datasets. Hash tables can easily be made generic, and you can then test them using wholly different data to what you intend to store in them. All you then would need to test is that the hash function works for whatever data you use to represent the nerual paths (something that need not be tested on every single object). Given this, you can then be confident that data will load into, and be recalled out of your table accurately, and you can then use it for stupidly large datasets, that you couldn't have feasibly tested before.

&gt; Regardless of the level of proof, you can re-arrange E=mc^2 to get c=(E/m)^1/2. This is a definition of c in terms of discoverable properties.

Now, I could be wrong, but this to me seems somewhat circular to me. Forgive me for this slight tangent, but I think it'll help explain. In geometry, we learned about various postulates and theorems, and, particularly, in the case of a line crossing two parallel lines, the various angles could be determined, if you had a starting angle. There were a few postulates and theorems here that were necessary to do so, but it became apparent to me that, while the one we called a theorem was proven using the postulates, you could easily prove the postulates using a theorem. How we determined which were postulates, and which were theorems was simply the one that left with the least postulates. My point is that using E=mc^2 to prove c seems folly because E=mc^2 uses c to prove itself. One is a postulate, one is a theorem, if you want to call c  the theorem, that's fine, but then E=mc^2 becomes the postulate we can't prove.

&gt; If a thing is equivalent to a relation between two known things, then it isn't unknown. If we have justified true belief about something, then it exceeds the conditions Gödel puts on the axioms of arithmetic.

Tracing back our justification for these things will lead you to the axioms then. I may have been incorrect in my choice of axioms, but let me just talk for a second. The speed of light is, of course, not an unknown. We have long since had a value that we've measured for it. But measuring that value, as you've said before, rested on certain beliefs we had before. Even if those are all justified (and I'd argue they are), you still reach some basal assumptions that we have no way of justifying: The universe exists, and our perception of it is accurate (there may be more, I'm not sure).

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2016-12-31 18:23:05 :

&gt; I'm not certain what the difference between ""connections"" and ""connective nodes"" is.

Connections would be your individual neurons. The nodes would be your intersections.

&gt; Ah, I don't think was actually my intention, I just wanted to reiterate what I said earlier, because, while I had said it earlier, it seemed like a relevant answer to your question.

I don't see the relevance. It seems like a total non-sequitur to me. I'm trying to ask you why you think it is important enough to bring up here.

&gt; I'm not sure what claim you're referring to. I keep getting lost going back in the comment chain.

No worries; this is basically the same complaint. I don't see what including previous areas of excitation adds to the discussion over and above what we were already talking about.

&gt; This seems like a wholly different scenario to what you were describing before. You were talking about coining terms in a language. If you coin new terms that are to be collectively adopted, a basic requirement is that people other than you be able to understand it.

You hit the nail on the head. This is exactly what we are looking to explain: how terms are actually coined. The end result of this process implies public mutual intelligibility. You suggested that the process is arbitrary: that people make-up definition and fix them to strings of phonemes. I'm saying that this picture implies private languages are possible. Since each term has a discreet meaning, as the result of someone's distinct idea, they can be constructed independently of one another and assembled under correct syntax.

This could be a private language in the case where a single person does all the coinage alone. As you pointed out, it isn't necessarily private in different cases. However, the problem is that the model is compatible with or implies the possibility of impossible things. I think this points to something deficient with the theory.

&gt; I'm sorry, I really hate to ask this of you, but could you perhaps provide a link to the comment where this write-up is?

Sure, I referring to the language complexity argument I made before the big edit. In short, the number of distinct meaningful sentences in a language is incredibly large; the size of this complexity either implies that the complexity can be broken down into computable parts or that the computational resources of the brain aren't the sole determining factor for meaning. The second option implies that it is possible for two distinct ideas to be expressed with one in the same brain pattern, since factors outside the brain provide the differentiating property in some cases.

&gt; What do you mean by ""overlap junk""? Is that the statement: ""two disparate ideas can inhabit the same space"" (or something similar) that we were talking about before? It seems you've used it as a shorthand, but I've not quite caught your meaning.

Bingo! That's what I was referring to.

&gt; Is this accurate to what you mean? Does logical atomism not allow for ""extra-verbal"" (for lack of a better word) ""atoms"" (also, for lack of a better word)?

I don't think every case of implication will work, but that's close enough. I don't know what these extra parts would be. Sentences are supposed to be terms assembled under legal syntax. I don't know where the extra part would come in, if all the parts are terms.

&gt; I think it's more accurate to say that you are saying that a language only created for one guy is impossible. Part of your arugment rests on the assumption that the language could only be understood by the creator.

I think the second thing is impossible for the same reason the first thing is, though. I don't think either thing is possible, but I think logical atomism implies both things are possible, (perhaps even commonplace).

&gt; Well, to start, I agree the brain isn't simple, but I do think it'd be accurate to say that it is composed of simple modular units: neurons. I think based on what you've said (""connective properties aren't strictly regional""), that you don't mean neurons, though.

I'm trying to say that there is no simpler way to model a conscious brain; there are no analyzable parts that can be discreetly reproduced and reassembled. Reproducing something piece by piece is different from assembling a scale model of something or an artistic interpretation of something. The first case plays on identity conditions and equivalency, while the other two play on functional analogical conditions and substitutability.

I know that was just a scree of words, so here's an example. Consider a simple clock radio. The radio itself is composed of a particular set of actualities, (its history, substance, etc.). We could reproduce an indistinguishable copy of this radio, if we had god-powers and unlimited resources. The original radio and the perfect copy are the exact same type of radio, but aren't one-in-the-same. With our limited ability, we can reproduce the effects of the radio by simulating its function with different parts. The original radio and our functional reproduction are substitutable for a given job, but aren't necessarily the same thing in type or token. On an even cruder level, we can take our primal impression of the radio and produce an effigy, (a drawing, a sculpture, etc.). These creations are identifiable with their subject through some tortured metaphoror bare analogy, but aren't literally identical in almost any way.

Out of these 4 kinds of similarity, consciousness is only guaranteed for the first case: self-same identity with a known conscious thing. The second kind of identity is only known to be necessary and sufficient for consciousness under the persistent conditions of our particular universe. The third kind shouldn't be assumed to guarantee consciousness and should be judged on a case by case basis. The fourth category is the most spurious resemblance for grounding consciousness, as there are obvious cases of us reading consciousness into unconscious things, (anthropomorphizing anatomically accurate statues, for example).

&gt; However, I don't think this is relevant. We aren't talking about testing the brain on smaller data sets, we're talking about testing the table on smaller datasets.

Aren't we interested in a particular claim, though? We are interested in whether conscious content can be represented in a well-ordered, deterministic function. Choosing a smaller sub-set of data that is unconscious doesn't tell us what we need to know: whether such a thing is possible for the conscious thing. If you assume the smaller set is sufficient, then you must believe that there is sufficient similarity between the test case and the case we are interested in.

I've made it pretty clear that the only direct evidence for consciousness we have is our personal experiences. As such, self-same identity would work. Unfortunately, this excludes simplifying our data table. Indiscernible identity works given assumptions about what types of things are conscious, but only provides equally intractable datasets as alternative, (e.i. other humans). Functional similarity implies knowledge about how the brain functions to produce consciousness. However, since the table is meant to *provide* this information, we can't use this to construct the table itself. Finally, analogical similarity is clear insufficient for grounding consciousness, since cases like the Chinese Room point to problems with Turing test-style definitions for consciousness.

Even dropping this entire classification scheme, hash functions, (according to Wikipedia), must be deterministic, well-ordered, and one-way. You would have to assume that there already was a deterministic reduction between brain states and conscious states going in. You would need to define the function along these parameters, and therefore couldn't use it as an independent test. Furthermore, the grouping would only take you from a brain state to a conscious state; it doesn't work backwards. I'm fine with this kind of relation, since it isn't an essential reduction, (e.i. an equivalency relation).

Edit:

&gt;   In geometry, we learned about various postulates and theorems... but it became apparent to me that, while the one we called a theorem was proven using the postulates, you could easily prove the postulates using a theorem. How we determined which were postulates, and which were theorems was simply the one that left with the least postulates.

The exact order things are proven is a red herring here. We could spend another two months talking about all the ways the topic could break across foundationalism vs coherentism, externalism vs internalism, falliblism vs infalliblism, and so on. Unfortunately, none of it would tell us much about the mind. The important thing here is that E= mc^2 and the speed of light are part of a complete model. The model is the ultimate bearer of justification here.

To put this in terms of Geometry, a given geometric model is a minimum number of claims plus all the claims derivable from them. This given model is justified given certain criteria: things like internal coherence, being true, and so on. When we assess claims, we do so in light of a model that are highly justified. If the claim agrees with the model, we transfer the justification from the model to the claim. When we talk about E=mc^2 in whatever form, we are talking about a well-ordered, consistent model. That's enough to fail Gödel's conditions.

&gt;  Tracing back our justification for these things will lead you to the axioms then. I may have been incorrect in my choice of axioms, but let me just talk for a second. The speed of light is, of course, not an unknown. We have long since had a value that we've measured for it. But measuring that value, as you've said before, rested on certain beliefs we had before... you still reach some basal assumptions that we have no way of justifying: The universe exists, and our perception of it is accurate.

Nothing is stoping this proposal from working in principle, but we should serious consider which claims are applicable here. If by universe you mean physical universe, then positing a physical universe won't work for Gödel's conditions. Physical objects are discreet and definite, then collections of physical objects must be orderable and determinate. Insofar as the physical universe is the complete collection of physical things, then positing the physical universe won't get us around the incompleteness theorem. After all, such a thing would be a complete, well-order, consistent system.

As for perception, I suspect that there is either a full-fledge theory of perception underlying the claim or you are just helping yourself to bare consciousness of some kind. If this theory of perception can ground knowledge claims, it must be able to transfer justifications. This implies failing our incompleteness conditions. I'm not sure your theory of mind will allow you to take the second option, as consciousness just is the product of brain activity for you. This implies the same problem outlined above

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-01-03 21:16:57 :

&gt; Connections would be your individual neurons. The nodes would be your intersections.

This wasn't the dichotomy. I brought this up in response to you saying ""this strains credulity (what other bodily process do we define cell by cell)"" it doesn't matter whether it's by neuron or neural connection, just that it's defined cell by cell, and there's a justification for it.

&gt; This could be a private language in the case where a single person does all the coinage alone. As you pointed out, it isn't necessarily private in different cases. However, the problem is that the model is compatible with or implies the possibility of impossible things. I think this points to something deficient with the theory.

From my reading of your construction of the Private Language Argument, it seemed to not say ""it's impossible for someone to create a set of words privately"" but instead that ""a private language doesn't work as a language"". Once the coined term is shared with someone, it ceases to be self-authorizing. It seems ridiculous to say that I couldn't make up terms, when I can clearly make up some phonemes and attach an arbitrary meaning to them: I want to use the word ""kithan"" to be a synonym for rabbit.

I mean, look at it this way. If I just came up with a random set of phonemes, and went through the dictionary, and assigned each word in the dictionary to a set of set of phonemes, then reused English syntax, I could create a fully functional language that someone could use. I don't see what's logically inconsistent with that. To me, I could do the same, but instead of going through the dictionary, assigning a set of phonemes to everything I saw in the world, and it would be the same deal.

&gt; the size of this complexity either implies that the complexity can be broken down into computable parts or that the computational resources of the brain aren't the sole determining factor for meaning.

I'm not even sure this is a realistic picture of the brain. I don't know if it actually stores stuff in a location as a group of neurons, instead I think ""storage"" is determined by the strength of connections. You may still think that this wouldn't leave enough connections for it to work, but let me go back to a Neural Net for a second, as I believe it'll be useful for the description. A Neural Net can identify pictures, as we've established. It can categorize them into thousands of different categories, without necessarily having a way to store each category. How does it do this? Well, lets just make a hypothetical one, of 27 neurons, in 3 layers. Some input data is fed into layer 1, which propogates to layer 2, and is output on layer 3, we therefore have (9*9) connections on each layer (since each node connects to each node in the next layer): this is 162 connections. The output, in this case, is a bit code, where each output node outputs either a 1 or a 0, and this code represents something. With 9 bits, we have 2^9 output codes, or 512 output codes. This is a large degree more than connections we have, without actually having a ""place"" to store them all. Therefore, in the brain, we need not have a neural connection per word, in order to know what is meant, just a way of relating sound data into meanings, like our hypothetical neural net does with pictures and words.

&gt; I don't know what these extra parts would be. Sentences are supposed to be terms assembled under legal syntax. I don't know where the extra part would come in, if all the parts are terms.

Extra parts would be things like context: The fact that your friend just asked what color red to paint their room, for example.

&gt; I think the second thing is impossible for the same reason the first thing is, though. I don't think either thing is possible, but I think logical atomism implies both things are possible, (perhaps even commonplace).

So, I've mostly done all the addressing I have for this above, but I'd just like to restate that, as the private language arugment requires it only be understood by one person, these are different scenarios. One person can easily create a language: Tolkien created Elvish, and various others for his fantasy world.

&gt; I'm trying to say that there is no simpler way to model a conscious brain;

Before I go on, I'd like to say a couple things. One, there are other reasons to model something besides simplicity. Reproducability comes to mind for me. Two, this is only true in the same sense as ""there is no simpler way to model human anatomy."" But we do drug tests on mice, as a good model for it (and, in the vein of brains, we do behavioral experiments on mice as well).

&gt; We could reproduce an indistinguishable copy of this radio, if we had god-powers and unlimited resources. The original radio and the perfect copy are the exact same type of radio, but aren't one-in-the-same

I'm not certain if this is a semantic nitpick or not, but, we actually can't. There's even a proof for it: it's called the No Cloning Theorem. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owPC60Ue0BE)'s a video for it.

&gt;  The second kind of identity is only known to be necessary and sufficient for consciousness under the persistent conditions of our particular universe.

The second kind is the perfect copy, right? The way you laid it out, I only see 3: perfect copy, model, effigy. But you said 4 categories, and the first I think you said is the thing itself. Is this all correct?

On this as well, maybe I'm misunderstanding the philosophy terminology, but I thought if something was neessary and sufficient, then you had an iff (two fs) relationship: i.e. if X is necessary and sufficient for Y, then X implies Y and Y implies X. Would this not guarantee consciousness as well?

&gt; The third kind shouldn't be assumed to guarantee consciousness and should be judged on a case by case basis.

Here you admit that it's perfectly possible the 3rd kind (model? see above) *could* have consciousness. This seems contradictory with your statement above that ""there is no simpler way to model a conscious brain"".

&gt; Aren't we interested in a particular claim, though?

Yes, but not here. This part was spawned when you said that you based your claim that the simulation of the brain would take trillions of years to run on brute force lookup times. I offered a hash table as a solution that drops that trillions of years down to more manageable times. All of this had already assumed that you could model the brain based on looking up neural paths or something. Whether that claim holds water (probably not) wasn't really part of the point.

&gt; We are interested in whether conscious content can be represented in a well-ordered, deterministic function.

Yes, but determining whether you could use a hash table in the way we were discussing in this part (you can) isn't really going to give us that answer.

&gt; As such, self-same identity would work. Unfortunately, this excludes simplifying our data table.

In order to continue with this line of discussion, we need to clear something up: What is our data table? What data is it storing? What are we doing with it?

&gt;  since cases like the Chinese Room point to problems with Turing test-style definitions for consciousness.

I didn't know what this is, so I looked it up. It seems very interesting, but I drew one issue with it: Claiming that ""since I could run the program myself, and don't understand chinese, the AI wouldn't either"" seems to me to not quite follow. You, in this scenario, are much more like the wires (and transistors, and whatever else) in the computer. I don't believe any of my neurons understand English, but I clearly do.

&gt; Even dropping this entire classification scheme, hash functions, (according to Wikipedia), must be deterministic, well-ordered, and one-way.

This is definitely a nitpick, but that's not the kind of hash function I'm talking about. That's for hashing passwords, not hashing for tables. It's a nitpick, because a hash function for tables still needs to be deterministic and well ordered, just not one way (though it might be). Anyway:

&gt; You would have to assume that there already was a deterministic reduction between brain states and conscious states going in.

Yes, this all goes back to what I was saying above. This was spawned from a discussion on how long a table lookup would take, and I said it could be very small. I was never offering this as evidence that the brain behaved this way. Basically, I don't think this line of discussion will bring the answers we're looking for.

&gt; When we talk about E=mc2 in whatever form, we are talking about a well-ordered, consistent model. That's enough to fail Gödel's conditions.

So, I feel at this point I've misunderstood something fundamental to this argument. I'm not sure if it's something simple I'm missing, or something complex, or really anything, but I don't really see how you got to this conclusion, somehow. 

I've done some looking around to see if I could get the theory explained to me in more understandable terms, and I found [this](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/453503/can-someone-explain-g%C3%B6dels-incompleteness-theorems-in-layman-terms) description of it: ""[I]f our axioms are consistent, then in every model of the axioms there is a statement which is true, but not provable"". Let me try to work with that.

Something you brought up earlier was the problem with induction. I think this will help my case tremendously. Nothing in science is proven, because every model we have that was built by science relies on induction. For example: Yes, the last 10,000 times I dropped something, it fell. That's all the proof I have that if I drop something, it will fall, but that's not deductive, it's inductive. We perform an experiment with controlled variables here, and assume that means it works there. Given that, you can't say that the speed of light is provable with E=mc^2, because E=mc^2 relies on induction, and induction isn't provable.

KDJones @ 2017-01-04 15:54:23 :

&gt; This wasn't the dichotomy. I brought this up in response to you saying ""this strains credulity (what other bodily process do we define cell by cell)"" it doesn't matter whether it's by neuron or neural connection, just that it's defined cell by cell, and there's a justification for it.

That was kind of a throw-away comment. I know that defining consciousness on a cell by cell basis is your game, and that it isn't necessarily impossible. It seems unnecessary given the way we define other bodily processes to me. Things like breathing, bleeding, ruminating, and so on are all tied to continuous processes, and this regularity seems more important than cellular minutiae. I don't think there is no hay to make here, though. The disagreement will have to be settled elsewhere.

&gt; From my reading of your construction of the Private Language Argument, it seemed to not say ""it's impossible for someone to create a set of words privately"" but instead that ""a private language doesn't work as a language"".

A wholly private set of words is the same thing as a wholly private language. What is a language over and above a sufficient set of terms plus syntax?

&gt; Once the coined term is shared with someone, it ceases to be self-authorizing. It seems ridiculous to say that I couldn't make up terms, when I can clearly make up some phonemes and attach an arbitrary meaning to them: I want to use the word ""kithan"" to be a synonym for rabbit.

Those cases aren't ridiculous, but they are also not cases of private coinage. The first case is an explicitly public coinage. The term acquires its meaning through the social act of sharing it with others. The second case also appeals to publicity from the start by appealing to synonymous public terms. 'Kithan' is only meaningful here because 'rabbit' has a public significance.

&gt; I mean, look at it this way. If I just came up with a random set of phonemes, and went through the dictionary, and assigned each word in the dictionary to a set of set of phonemes, then reused English syntax, I could create a fully functional language that someone could use. I don't see what's logically inconsistent with that. To me, I could do the same, but instead of going through the dictionary, assigning a set of phonemes to everything I saw in the world, and it would be the same deal.

This case is also logically possible, but notice that you've completely drop the arbitrariness out of this process. In the case of the dictionary, the meanings of terms are 'discovered', not invented. The meanings predate the invention of any of your terms. This is clearly a parasitic case that depends on some other source of semantic content.

Likewise, assigning terms to physical objects and events supposes that objects and events carry preformed meanings around with them. This isn't necessarily absurd, but it obviously makes the process objective rather than arbitrary. Your original proposals all appealed to arbitrary assignment and significance. That's why I brought out the PLA in the first place.

&gt; This is a large degree more than connections we have, without actually having a ""place"" to store them all. Therefore, in the brain, we need not have a neural connection per word, in order to know what is meant, just a way of relating sound data into meanings, like our hypothetical neural net does with pictures and words.

This was very informative and drives towards the real take away here. Language probably doesn't work as we've been describing it. The meaning, (significance), of a terms doesn't need to be determined by internal factors with the brain. Rather, the brain only needs to be capable of producing a sufficient number of outputs, (an expressive range). The real brain power doesn't go towards manufacturing meaning, but interpretation and signaling.

In practice, the significance of words shrinks and grows with time. Meanings aren't confined to the internal procedures we use to evoke them. The mind clearly doesn't need to store individual meanings to use terms, because utterances acquire meanings on their own. So long as the brain is capable of producing some minimum number of expressions, the external part of meaning tales on a life of its own.

&gt; Extra parts would be things like context: The fact that your friend just asked what color red to paint their room, for example.

Running with what you said here: if context is part of semantic content, then how do we know what we're saying? Sometimes, we clearly don't. We misspeak or put our foot in our mouth or say things without up-to-date information. Sometimes, we clearly do, though. These are cases where we have sufficient information about the external world. Do you agree with what I'm saying? Do you think what we are saying about semantic content is related to conscious contents or mental contents?

&gt; One person can easily create a language: Tolkien created Elvish, and various others for his fantasy world.

I think this would be best classified as another Frankenstein case along with 'kithan' and the dictionary case. Tolkien took a bunch of old languages and smashed the together. It is a less than arbitrary process.

&gt; this is only true in the same sense as ""there is no simpler way to model human anatomy."" But we do drug tests on mice, as a good model for it (and, in the vein of brains, we do behavioral experiments on mice as well).

The entire point of this subsection is to test which kinds of similarity are sufficient for testing/modeling for consciousness. Clinical trials on mice clearly contain deviations from clinical trials on people. That's why we run both. They aren't similar enough to use interchangeably.

&gt; I'm not certain if this is a semantic nitpick or not, but, we actually can't. There's even a proof for it: it's called the No Cloning Theorem.

That's really cool, actually, I'd never heard of this. It makes the Trekkie in me happy to hear transporting is a better option tgan quantum cloning and murder. He does say copies are possible in theory, just not possible to create or generalize. I still need to change my example to accommodate that, though.

&gt; The second kind is the perfect copy, right? The way you laid it out, I only see 3: perfect copy, model, effigy. But you said 4 categories, and the first I think you said is the thing itself. Is this all correct?

Bingo! That's it.

&gt; On this as well, maybe I'm misunderstanding the philosophy terminology, but I thought if something was neessary and sufficient, then you had an iff (two fs) relationship: i.e. if X is necessary and sufficient for Y, then X implies Y and Y implies X. Would this not guarantee consciousness as well?

Yes, I'm granting that within our nomological constraints. The natural laws of our universe clear link mental events with physical events to a sufficiently high degree of regularity, even if the connection doesn't hold necessarily across all possible laws of nature.

&gt; Here you admit that it's perfectly possible the 3rd kind (model? see above) could have consciousness. This seems contradictory with your statement above that ""there is no simpler way to model a conscious brain"".

I'm leaving room for reasonable doubt. I don't think it is possible, but it isn't obviously impossible. I'm leaving this provisional possibility open for the sake of argument. Judging whether something actually satisfies the conditions in question comes up later with the Turing test and the Chinese Room.

&gt; All of this had already assumed that you could model the brain based on looking up neural paths or something. Whether that claim holds water (probably not) wasn't really part of the point.

This part totally throws me. Are you saying you doubt our capacity to model the brain? I thought that was your whole shtick. I'm interpreting '...or something' very inclusively, as in some brain fact.

&gt; Yes, but determining whether you could use a hash table in the way we were discussing in this part (you can) isn't really going to give us that answer.

I think it's relevant, because hash table implied a functional sorting. If the mind isn't a function, if intentional contents aren't things that admit well-ordered models, then whatever your hash table is doing with the data is different than modeling consciousness. You're up to something else, like modeling the brain or modeling syntactic relations. That's my point.

&gt; In order to continue with this line of discussion, we need to clear something up: What is our data table? What data is it storing? What are we doing with it?

The data table is a blank check for you to fill in whatever information you think you need for your hypothetical brain model. If understanding consciousness is just a matter of filling the blanks, then you should be able to imagine the information you'd like to have. You should also be able to imagine what you'd do with it in some hypothetical sense, (no concrete details needed).

&gt; I said [computation time] could be very small. I was never offering this as evidence that the brain behaved this way. Basically, I don't think this line of discussion will bring the answers we're looking for.

So you have been arguing in bad faith, without evidence or conviction in your side of the argument? What answer are you looking for besides whether the mind could be modeled by our best science.

&gt; ""[I]f our axioms are consistent, then in every model of the axioms there is a statement which is true, but not provable"". Let me try to work with that.
Something you brought up earlier was the problem with induction. I think this will help my case tremendously. Nothing in science is proven, because every model we have that was built by science relies on induction.

I thought this link was really solid, although I really liked to second explanation. Sticking with the first explanation: I think handling induction as unproven knowledge is tricky. We would like some inductions to hold determinately to the things they relate. For example, 'Where there's smoke, there's fire' is an inductive claim; it is also an unqualified claim about the way things just are in general. The naked grammar of the claim implies that certainty and induction aren't obvious opposites. Despite the problem of induction, we still act as if it weren't ultimately a problem. You can chalk this up to taking induction for granted: I'm sure some people do. Or, you can point to this as evidence that induction isn't like faith. There is some accountability in induction that isn't like God's accountability. We expect thing from the world while we have faith in God.

I suspect that these expectations of the world can be more reasonable or less reasonable. Among some of the most reasonable expectations are reached by studying our best science. Linking back to your link, if nothing in science makes it demonstrably more reasonable, then isn't a terribly rational exercise. If you think science is about knowledge production, this is bad news. Induction might be something with variable certainty, but saying it is an article of faith seems a little extreme. It seems like you are cutting off your nose to spite your face. For other options about where to put induction, it might be better to make it an axiom, (something with provisional credence), and sacrifice consistency, (sometimes inductive rules are 'false axioms'). Or, perhaps we can make science in itself incomplete, (not decidable in every case), and supplement science with lay induction.

&gt; A wholly private set of words is the same thing as a wholly private language.

Not in the way you were using ""private language."" In the private language argument you put forth, a private language is one that can only be understood by its creator. A language that hasn't been shared is not necessarily equivalent to a language that can't be shared.

&gt; The first case is an explicitly public coinage. The term acquires its meaning through the social act of sharing it with others.

Yes, but someone was the originator. Some**one** coined the term.

&gt; The second case also appeals to publicity from the start by appealing to synonymous public terms. 'Kithan' is only meaningful here because 'rabbit' has a public significance.

I think this hits the case, but not the point. Had we been in person, with a rabbit in the area, I could have defined it by pointing to the rabbit, and saying ""kithan"" (or if other parts of the language are already established, ""that is a kithan"" or the equivalent). There need not be any understanding of the word ""rabbit"" in this case.

&gt; This case is also logically possible, but notice that you've completely drop the arbitrariness out of this process.

I don't think I ever had arbitrariness in meanings, just in the words that have those meanings. For example, I don't think it's an accident that no language on earth defines the top and bottom of an apple as different things, instead of two parts of the same thing.

&gt; Likewise, assigning terms to physical objects and events supposes that objects and events carry preformed meanings around with them. This isn't necessarily absurd, but it obviously makes the process objective rather than arbitrary. 

If ""preformed meanings"" means what I think, then, yeah, they do. Why does that make it arbitrary?

&gt; Your original proposals all appealed to arbitrary assignment and significance. That's why I brought out the PLA in the first place.

As far as I remember, my original proposals said that the words we assigned to any meaning are fully arbitrary. I don't think anything you've said here disproves that.

&gt; In practice, the significance of words shrinks and grows with time. Meanings aren't confined to the internal procedures we use to evoke them. The mind clearly doesn't need to store individual meanings to use terms, because utterances acquire meanings on their own. So long as the brain is capable of producing some minimum number of expressions, the external part of meaning tales on a life of its own.

Yeah, that all sounds accurate to my mind.

&gt; Running with what you said here: if context is part of semantic content, then how do we know what we're saying? Sometimes, we clearly don't. We misspeak or put our foot in our mouth or say things without up-to-date information. Sometimes, we clearly do, though.

So, how is misspeaking, or putting our foot in our mouth ""not knowing what we're saying""? I think it's important to know that my meaning of the same words in the same context doesn't necessarily equal your meaning. We all create and interpret words in our own way, because our brains are different. If you know something I don't, you may interpret my words with a different meaning than I meant. 

I'd say we misspeak for the same reason a neural net won't say ""that's a leopard"" but instead ""I'm 95% confident that's a leopard, 55% confident it's a jaguar, etc."" Basically, our brains, while way more accurate than our neural nets, are still not exact, and sometimes pick the wrong words for our meaning.

&gt; They aren't similar enough to use interchangeably.

Nor do they need to be for a model. We needn't only observe people to understand consciousness, in the same way we needn't only test drugs on people to get a decent understanding of how they'll work. We do human trials because we have standards we need to meet, but the mice trials have lots of merit.

&gt; He does say copies are possible in theory, just not possible to create or generalize.

Yeah, but that's just saying that there's no reason an arbitrary set of particles couldn't arrange themselves into the same order twice. I don't know how you'd go about showing they're copies, as if you had enough information about their makeups to determine whether one is fully a copy, you'd have enough information to create a copy out of arbitrary matter.

&gt; This part totally throws me. Are you saying you doubt our capacity to model the brain?

No, I'm saying I doubt our capacity to model the brain using a lookup table. I think we can model it, but that won't be how. I think more likely it will be like some sort of neural net, or perhaps something that's not a normal computer (like a machine with specially designed circuits that can remodel themselves somehow).

&gt; If the mind isn't a function, if intentional contents aren't things that admit well-ordered models, then whatever your hash table is doing with the data is different than modeling consciousness.

This sounds accurate. I just doubt the mind's non-functionalism. It seems to me, if the mind isn't a function, then that would change a whole lot of our understanding of the universe. The fact that things can exist that don't follow the normal laws of physics would up end a lot of things. It'd be very interesting, possibly allowing tons of new innovations exploiting that fact, but I don't think it's likely.

&gt; The data table is a blank check for you to fill in whatever information you think you need for your hypothetical brain model.

I don't think I'd use a data table. What information I'd need would be dependent on the fidelity of the model. If I wanted to simulate it down to the molecule, well, that sounds difficult for our current (and far into the future) technology. If I wanted to simulate it down to the neuron (still a bit much for us now), then I'd want to know how the neurons are connected. Given that that's probably difficult to answer, I'd settle for an approximation, and use genetic programming with a neural net to find a best fit for the approximation. If I had to simulate less, well, I think we've done as much in certain areas, but it doesn't seem convincing when the parts are separate.

&gt; So you have been arguing in bad faith, without evidence or conviction in your side of the argument?

No. This was just a tangential argument, spawned when you said that it would take trillions of years to run a simulation of the brain based off of the time to process a brute force lookup table. All that I did was say that of course a brute force lookup would take forever, but we've developed methods to sort through obscene amounts of data already.

&gt; Despite the problem of induction, we still act as if it weren't ultimately a problem. You can chalk this up to taking induction for granted: I'm sure some people do. Or, you can point to this as evidence that induction isn't like faith.

Personally, I'd say most people take induction on faith. It's just our brains evolved to rely on induction, and so we assume it because our brains are wired that way.

&gt; Induction might be something with variable certainty, but saying it is an article of faith seems a little extreme.

Only as extreme as admitting that I take the existence of the universe on faith.

&gt; For other options about where to put induction, it might be better to make it an axiom, (something with provisional credence), and sacrifice consistency, (sometimes inductive rules are 'false axioms'). Or, perhaps we can make science in itself incomplete, (not decidable in every case), and supplement science with lay induction.

I think either of these are reasonable. I like the idea of sacrificing consistency to make induction an axiom, because I think that that's the only way to account for it, is to assume it works.

I'm not really sure what science being incomplete nets us. I think, in some cases (back to QM, again...) it is already. Science can't tell you where the particle will fall on the waveform. There's the whole uncertainty principle thing. Do these qualify as ""incomplete"", or have I misunderstood, once again?

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-10 17:49:45 :

&gt; Not in the way you were using ""private language."" In the private language argument you put forth, a private language is one that can only be understood by its creator. A language that hasn't been shared is not necessarily equivalent to a language that can't be shared.

OK, there are two claims floating around here:

1. That a language can't transition from being private to being public.

2. That a private language is impossible in principle.

I'm really pushing for #2 in this argument. If we have rules that can be publicized but we withold the rules from a wider audience, then we don't have a truly private language. Publicity here isn't just a matter of the number of people that happen to have access to information; It's the number of peopel that have access to the information in principle.

You are right that something that somethings just happen to be private for now; They aren't private in principle. If inner experiences are the things only I have conscious access to, and I can fix arbitrary terms to things to construct a vocabulary, then I should be able to construct a language to talk about experience by fixing terms to my private experiences. If this isn't possible, what hope do we have of studying the essential properties of experience scientifically?

&gt; Some*one* coined the term.

Maybe term coinage is a product of a whole team of language users working together. Strained analogy: even is Tom Brady throws the winning touchdown, the Patriots win the game.

&gt; I think this hits the case, but not the point. Had we been in person, with a rabbit in the area, I could have defined it by pointing to the rabbit...

I'm sure this is the last thing you wanted to read, but I'm going to bring one more philosopher into the discussion. [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscrutability_of_reference#Illustration_by_the_use_of_gavagai), a 20th-century logician and philosopher of science, actually talks about an identical case. He disagrees with what you are saying in a substantial way.

&gt; I don't think I ever had arbitrariness in meanings, just in the words that have those meanings. For example, I don't think it's an accident that no language on earth defines the top and bottom of an apple as different things, instead of two parts of the same thing.

What exactly stops such a language from forming? Is it a logical property of systems, or just an arbitrary constraint for being human? I'm also a little confused on what you mean by 'meaning' here. To my ear, meanings are properties of signs, (words, symbols, etc.). For a meaning to exist without any sign attatched to it seems like a misnomer. Words have contents, states of affairs that are reflected by the sign. However, the actual state of affairs the content reflects isn't identical with the meaning.

&gt; So, how is misspeaking, or putting our foot in our mouth ""not knowing what we're saying""?

When you misspeak, your words don't come out the way you intend. I'm not interested in this case of failure. When you put your foot in your mouth, you say things that you wouldn't have meant to say with full faculty. For example, when you ask a fat woman when the baby is due, you typically aren't intending to insult. I'm not interested in this variant either.

&gt;  I think it's important to know that my meaning of the same words in the same context doesn't necessarily equal your meaning. We all create and interpret words in our own way, because our brains are different. If you know something I don't, you may interpret my words with a different meaning than I meant.

So, we all have our own individualized set of meaning that are specific to only us? That sounds an aweful lot like a bunch of private languages to me.

&gt; I'd say we misspeak for the same reason a neural net won't say ""that's a leopard"" but instead ""I'm 95% confident that's a leopard, 55% confident it's a jaguar, etc."" Basically, our brains, while way more accurate than our neural nets, are still not exact, and sometimes pick the wrong words for our meaning.

I agree with this 100%, except that sometimes we mean what we say and say what we mean. In cases of sincere accurate speech, we do speak with a godly amount of certainty; We speak with conviciton. In legitimate cases of speaking the truth, what exactly is going on?

&gt; Nor do they need to be for a model. We needn't only observe people to understand consciousness, in the same way we needn't only test drugs on people to get a decent understanding of how they'll work. We do human trials because we have standards we need to meet, but the mice trials have lots of merit.

Either human trials are necessary because trials with mice aren't sufficient, or trials with mice are sufficient because the phenomena being studied is functionally the same. I'm not trying to denegrate science. I think trials with mice are a well-spring of important information. It's just not the information we are talking about here.

&gt; Yeah, but that's just saying that there's no reason an arbitrary set of particles couldn't arrange themselves into the same order twice. I don't know how you'd go about showing they're copies, as if you had enough information about their makeups to determine whether one is fully a copy, you'd have enough information to create a copy out of arbitrary matter.

This is all totally beside the point. The point is that this kind of similarity is metaphysically possible. It is, of course, impossible from a pratical stand-point. However, I only proposed the this kind of similarity for clarification and classification purposes. It's a theorhetical possibility, and that's all I meant to say.

&gt; No, I'm saying I doubt our capacity to model the brain using a lookup table. I think we can model it, but that won't be how. I think more likely it will be like some sort of neural net, or perhaps something that's not a normal computer (like a machine with specially designed circuits that can remodel themselves somehow).

I don't think models are possible, but I only have knock-down arguments against computational theories of mind. While I'm deeply skeptical of models, I do think Strong AI might be achievable with neural nets of some exotic non-Turing kind of computer. Though, I don't think such things would constitute well understood models of consciousness, even if they exhibit consciousness.

&gt; This sounds accurate. I just doubt the mind's non-functionalism. It seems to me, if the mind isn't a function, then that would change a whole lot of our understanding of the universe...

You don't need to propose new laws for the universe just because the mind is non-functional. There are plenty of relationships in nature that aren't functions. There are indeterminate phenomena on a quantum and non-qunatum level, there are chaotic systems at every level of complexity, and there are levels of randomness and pseudo-randomness that seem to be expressed in nature. Sure, these relevations required new techniques and major shifts in perspective, but they weren't totally destructive to science as we know it.

&gt; I don't think I'd use a data table. What information I'd need would be dependent on the fidelity of the model...

If you don't know what you are looking for and don't know what information would help you find out what you are looking for, then I don't think you have a rational position hear. You don't seem to believe anything in particular about the mind; You just get the feeling that it must not be that much of a push for someone to figure something out eventually. I don't know how to argue against that other than to point out that your theory is massively underdeveloped.

&gt;  If I had to simulate less, well, I think we've done as much in certain areas, but it doesn't seem convincing when the parts are separate.

I didn't really understand what this meant.

&gt; All that I did was say that of course a brute force lookup would take forever, but we've developed methods to sort through obscene amounts of data already.

I'm really pretty ignorant about the nitty-gritty when it comes to computers. I know some of the theorhetical stuff, but almost nothing in practical terms. Let's say I had an algorithm for multiplying integers. Could I meaningfully use this program for another purpose without substantially adding to or subtracting from the program? For example, could I use the unaltered program to recieve arbitrary inputs and ouput stock predictions.

To my mind, something seems fishy about this; Whatever repurposing we are doing must involve some interpretation on the part of us the programer. This is basically the waterfall argument. So, even if we manipulated a hash table to take unsorted brain inputs such that we could interpret the data, I would suspect that this manipulation constitutes substatial revision by the programmer. If it 'works', it will 'work' because certain people want to believe it will work. People will find what they are looking for, if they try hard enough.

&gt; Personally, I'd say most people take induction on faith. It's just our brains evolved to rely on induction, and so we assume it because our brains are wired that way.

Their are academics that work on various levels of proof for inducition, though. Some people spend years refining their understading of the way that induction can and cannot be proven or justified. If it is a simple matter of faith, then how is it possible to have a better or worse understanding of induction.

&gt; Only as extreme as admitting that I take the existence of the universe on faith.

This might be a case of different axioms, I guess. I would say that I know the external world exists in the same way that people have better or worse understandings of induction. People with solipsistic delusions know less about the world than I do, since they are mentally ill and I am, partly, sane.

&gt; If inner experiences are the things only I have conscious access to, and I can fix arbitrary terms to things to construct a vocabulary, then I should be able to construct a language to talk about experience by fixing terms to my private experiences.

Sure. Is this not what we do?

&gt; Maybe term coinage is a product of a whole team of language users working together.

Yes, this is generally what I think is the case. Someone comes up with a term (perhaps after something like a group brainstorming session (key word: like)), and a group collectively agrees to use it.

&gt; He disagrees with what you are saying in a substantial way.

He doesn't disagree that I could try to define it by pointing to the rabbit, or even that that doesn't work as a way of defining it. He essentially says that'd be as good as telling you ""it means rabbit"". He just says that neither work as a foolproof method of meaning transferance. He says nothing does.

&gt; What exactly stops such a language from forming?

Nothing fundamental, it just doesn't fit common sense. That is, people, no matter how different, tend to see the world in similar enough ways, and not distinguishing the top and bottom of an apple as wholly different things is one of those similarities.

&gt; For a meaning to exist without any sign attatched to it seems like a misnomer.

I can see this, I suppose. Basically, I was using meanings as what your meanings mean, if that makes sense. As in, words have meanings, and meanings attach to things. That second attachment is what I meant, that first attachment is what you meant, I think.

&gt; So, we all have our own individualized set of meaning that are specific to only us? That sounds an aweful lot like a bunch of private languages to me.

And to me, it sounds a lot like what you showed me [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscrutability_of_reference#Illustration_by_the_use_of_gavagai) described: ""This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like German and Dutch, and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit.""

&gt; In cases of sincere accurate speech, we do speak with a godly amount of certainty; We speak with conviciton. In legitimate cases of speaking the truth, what exactly is going on?

The same exact thing.  Your brain does the same thing: While a neural net relates images to text, you relate meaning to words. It's just, while a neural net says ""I'm 95% confident"" people's brains say ""I'm 99.999% confident"". This means, most of the time, the words are the right ones. I'd say the fact that you rarely see 1 word out of place, and often see a wrong sentence is evidence that that's how your brain constructs things.

&gt; Either human trials are necessary because trials with mice aren't sufficient, or trials with mice are sufficient because the phenomena being studied is functionally the same.

Human trials are necessary (i.e. mice are not sufficient), but mice trials are still a model. You brought this up, actually, with your self-same, exact copy, model, and effigy. These are all models, just different types. Types can be different strengths, that is, it can match in more attributes. Types can also be different in what attributes they model: [This](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c5/6b/a9/c56ba971d2b83f98430cf15cddae00cf.jpg) solar system, versus [this](https://youtu.be/MTY1Kje0yLg?t=2m22s) one. The important thing I said was ""We needn't only"", meaning, there is stuff we can learn from mice, even if it isn't everything. They aren't functionally the *same* but they are functionally *similar*.

&gt; I don't think models are possible, but I only have knock-down arguments against computational theories of mind. 

To be clear, those are both computational, just not with either our current processing power, or the current average hardware, respectively.

&gt; Though, I don't think such things would constitute well understood models of consciousness, even if they exhibit consciousness.

If we made them, how would they not? We'd have to understand them to make them right?

&gt; If you don't know what you are looking for and don't know what information would help you find out what you are looking for, then I don't think you have a rational position hear.

Did I not give information that I'd need based on the fidelity of model? 

&gt; You don't seem to believe anything in particular about the mind;

I believe it's some sort of biological computer (so, computational), on account of it's being wholly physical. If it is, we can model it. To be more specific, a computer (in my definition) is something that, given inputs, produces outputs. Given the same inputs, produces the same outputs.

&gt; I didn't really understand what this meant.

Well, we've made robots that (walk)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3ZLyX4Bjs] fine, (talk)[http://www.cleverbot.com/] fine (at least, I thought so when I first checked it out, it seems a bit over-trained now), and perform (various other tasks)[http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/] fine. These model parts of a conscious mind. But, those models all are low fidelity, as they only model parts of a conscious mind.

&gt; If it 'works', it will 'work' because certain people want to believe it will work. 

If it demonstrably produces reliable results, then how can it be said not to be working? If it doesn't, how can it be said to be?

&gt; If it is a simple matter of faith, then how is it possible to have a better or worse understanding of induction.

I actually don't have an answer to that. I'm not certain what ""various levels of proof for induction"" looks like though, so maybe that's why I don't have an answer for it.

&gt; This might be a case of different axioms, I guess. I would say that I know the external world exists in the same way that people have better or worse understandings of induction.

I don't really know what you mean by this.

&gt; People with solipsistic delusions know less about the world than I do, since they are mentally ill and I am, partly, sane.

Yes, but only because it's socially accepted for sane people to not be solipsist. Not because we can rationally show that the world exists.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-12 15:51:46 :

&gt; Sure. Is this not what we do?

I don't think it is. To run this scenario through the PLA, let's say I have a bare experience: one that isn't obviously or immediately tied to an external object. Upon having this experience, I note that, 'This is really strange. I'll call this experience X.' Later, you feel compelled to say, 'I'm feeling in an X way again'. Under what circumstances would this claim be true. The only way to analyze the truth conditions would be to say the claim is true when you feel like saying it. As noted earlier, this isn't sufficient grounds for delineating true claims from false claims. Therefore, this procedure can't be the one we use to say true or false things about our own experiences.

&gt; Someone comes up with a term (perhaps after something like a group brainstorming session (key word: like)), and a group collectively agrees to use it.

This is pretty much the exact scenario I've been running with all along. A singular person notes the use of terms privately and then delivers a finished product to other individuals with the same term making capacities. I think this runs afoul of my PLA because this is essentially models language as a collection of individual languages, (idiolects). Rather, I'd say all language users within a language participate in a single language. This language isn't the abstract principles that parsimoniously describe a standardized language, (idealect), but a running 'game' we've been continuously playing: language is a dialogue and actual languages are dialects.

&gt; He doesn't disagree that I could try to define it by pointing to the rabbit, or even that that doesn't work as a way of defining it. He essentially says that'd be as good as telling you ""it means rabbit"". He just says that neither work as a foolproof method of meaning transferance. He says nothing does.

Right, he is hostile to any definition. There is no single definition or set of definitions can be given for a term, because terms are indefinite. For any given referential or analytic definition, there will be additional novel interpretations that are unaccounted for. Therefore, fixing meaning by pointing to things and giving them names won't work.

As an aside, I really respect Quine's work, but I don't follow him on everything. I just brought it up because of the obvious relevance. Same goes for Hume.

&gt; The same exact thing. Your brain does the same thing: While a neural net relates images to text, you relate meaning to words. It's just, while a neural net says ""I'm 95% confident"" people's brains say ""I'm 99.999% confident"".

To my mind, my convicted statements are about my own convictions: they are about something else which I am very confident about. When I say, 'That apple is red', I'm not talking about myself or my certainty about apples. Rather, I'm talking about apparent things in the world.

&gt; The important thing I said was ""We needn't only"", meaning, there is stuff we can learn from mice, even if it isn't everything. They aren't functionally the same but they are functionally similar.

This was an excellent reply; it gets to the heart of the issue. There are clearly differences between mice and people. The question is whether these differences are relevant to the questions at hand. How would you like to determine whether mice are functionally similar to us?

&gt; To be clear, those are both computational, just not with either our current processing power, or the current average hardware, respectively.

You can gloss computational as, 'a system describable by a classic, deterministic Turing machine', if it's bothering you. My strong arguments revolve around functionalism, and by extension, determinate computable models. It isn't clear to anyone exactly what a neural net is doing or what the consequences of Quantum computing really are. Therefore, I hesitate to class them in the same group as well-ordered, well understood things.

&gt; If we made them, how would they not? We'd have to understand them to make them right?

Maybe not; if we create the ""seed"" and it develops autonomously through learning and interaction in ways that we can't specify in detail, then we might not understand every step along the way. To my mind, it would be similar to the black box algorithm we mentioned earlier, (where an obscure program provide oracle-like solutions.)

&gt; Did I not give information that I'd need based on the fidelity of model?

That didn't give me any new information, though. You basically just rolled out the definition of context sensitivity: that relevancy is determined by domain of application. Of course the things you would say to me will depend on the context in which you say them. I want to know which context is the most relevant to mental happenings: what level of generality are the essential facts located on?

&gt; These model parts of a conscious mind. But, those models all are low fidelity, as they only model parts of a conscious mind.

Are they proper modular parts of the mind, like the individual wheels on car, or are they metaphorical parts, as in imperfect copies that get some likenesses right?

&gt; If it demonstrably produces reliable results, then how can it be said not to be working? If it doesn't, how can it be said to be?

Producing consistent results isn't a sufficient condition for truth. When someone engages in wishful thinking, their answers are after very consistent with what they think they'll find. This is what I meant by 'work'. If we think we are beautiful, then we will find beauty in the mirror. If we think we are determinate physical automata, then that's what we'll see in the mirror of science.

&gt; I actually don't have an answer to that. I'm not certain what ""various levels of proof for induction"" looks like though, so maybe that's why I don't have an answer for it.

If you're curious, you can check out answers to the Raven paradox, the new riddle of induction, or proofs for the validity of induction. There are some on Wikipedia. I've even seen attempts to use computer science to ground induction. 

&gt; I don't really know what you mean by this.

I was just trying to say that belief in the external world is less basic than people make it out to be. There are better and worse answers to the question.

&gt; Yes, but only because it's socially accepted for sane people to not be solipsist. Not because we can rationally show that the world exists.

There is no social pressure on me to believe in the external world. If I was really convicted in a solipsistic belief, then I could still act as if the external world existed to avoid the bother of people thinking I'm strange. My point was that there are apparent cases where my non-solipsistic beliefs are more rational than someone's solipsistic beliefs. This is clearly the case here, since insane people can't participate in rational exchanges.

This might seem like a straw man, but I'm not setting up a deductive argument with insanity taking the opposing position. Rather, I'm merely pointing out that a comparison is possible at all. Non-rational faith claims aren't comparable in this way. The true faith of a Muslim isn't more or less reasonable than the true faith of a Christian. They are both bare motivations to belief, while the case I mentioned does support a pros and cons list.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-01-12 22:51:01 :

&gt; The only way to analyze the truth conditions would be to say the claim is true when you feel like saying it.

I mean, this may sound pedantic, but I think it has some merit: Yes, that's how feelings work. You feel them when you feel them. And so:

&gt; As noted earlier, this isn't sufficient grounds for delineating true claims from false claims.

It is when it's your feelings.

&gt; I think this runs afoul of my PLA because this is essentially models language as a collection of individual languages, (idiolects). 

A collection of individual languages, that are being shared. That last part makes it not a private language, as it is capable of being understood by people other than the creator.

&gt; Therefore, fixing meaning by pointing to things and giving them names won't work.

His point was fixing meaning by anything won't work. Words can't really be connected to a meaning, at least, not a non-personal one.

&gt; When I say, 'That apple is red', I'm not talking about myself or my certainty about apples. Rather, I'm talking about apparent things in the world.

What's the difference between you saying ""That apple is red"" and ""I'm certain that apple is red"" besides the actual words used? You're really saying something like ""That apple is red to me."" I know, because I've had people say ""That thing is orange"", and when I look, it's clearly red. One of us is wrong, both of us could say ""that thing is ____.""

&gt; How would you like to determine whether mice are functionally similar to us?

Well, they act similar to us in some regards, which, to my mind, is basically what ""functionally similar"" means. They act dissimilar to us in some regards, which is why they aren't ""functionally the same"".

&gt; You can gloss computational as, 'a system describable by a classic, deterministic Turing machine', if it's bothering you. 

I was. And my statement still stands. Neural nets are built on computers, in languages, which, as far as I know, are Turing complete. The specialized hardware I was imagining was essentially a mechanical(?) neural net. That is, specialized hardware that is built to run the processes of a neural net very fast, in the same way a graphics card is built to run graphics calculations very fast. By removing the layer of virtualization present in current neural nets, you can improve performance. That just requires an engineering challenge of building such a system.

&gt; It isn't clear to anyone exactly what a neural net is doing or what the consequences of Quantum computing really are.

I don't think this is correct. We know how a neural net works, we built them, and there are papers on how they work. The goal is to abstract the actual process from the engineer, so that the computer can do it, but we could report on the state of the neural net to see how it works. We could even run something through it by hand once we have that report.

&gt; Maybe not; if we create the ""seed"" and it develops autonomously through learning and interaction in ways that we can't specify in detail, then we might not understand every step along the way.

So, if we develop it by accident? If we managed to make something like that by accident, it's not really anything new: they're called babies. If we did so deliberately, I think we'd have to know how it worked on some level.

&gt; I want to know which context is the most relevant to mental happenings: what level of generality are the essential facts located on?

What do you mean by essential facts? I don't think we know the ""essential facts"" about anything, if you mean the absolute truth. If you mean close enough that it can be said to be understood, that's not a question I feel I know enough to answer.

&gt; as in imperfect copies that get some likenesses right?

This is very nearly the definition of a model (i.e. it doesn't necessarily need to be imperfect, but other than that). But yes, they are this.

&gt; Producing consistent results isn't a sufficient condition for truth.

Isn't this how induction works? And it's as close to truth as we'll get in any system like science. In math, you have rules, and you find the consequences of them. In science, you have the consequences, and you try to find the rules. This isn't really possible, beyond finding rules that produce consistent results. (Aside, I mean consistent as in accuracy, not precision.)

&gt; If we think we are determinate physical automata, then that's what we'll see in the mirror of science.

If we think the world is classical, we won't find it's quantum? This seems like an obvious counterexample.

&gt; to avoid the bother of people thinking I'm strange.

Unless I'm mistaken, this is social pressure. The fact that you know people would think you're strange means there's social pressure.

&gt; My point was that there are apparent cases where my non-solipsistic beliefs **appear to be** more rational than someone's solipsistic beliefs.

Only by our definition of rational:

&gt; This is clearly the case here, since insane people can't participate in rational exchanges.

You seem to be saying that solipsists are insane. That's fine, but recognize that insanity is just a thing we made up. We defined it. So, we defined solipsism as something irrational. We didn't prove it to be, we defined it to be.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-13 21:12:45 :

&gt; I mean, this may sound pedantic, but I think it has some merit: Yes, that's how feelings work. You feel them when you feel them.

Regardless of how feelings work, this isn't how truth telling works. If something can be said to be true or false, there is something independent that makes it so. If claims about emotions are as subjective as our claims about which flavor of ice cream is best, then it isn't territory for science.

&gt; It is when it's your feelings.

It's true that, 'I am happy' when I am happy. This isn't an analysis though; we are taking the claim for what it is. If science can analyze our emotional claims into more basic physical claims, then some analysis clearly needs to happen.

&gt; A collection of individual languages, that are being shared. That last part makes it not a private language, as it is capable of being understood by people other than the creator.

If none of the terms in my language are identical with any of the terms in your language, what exactly do we share?

&gt; His point was fixing meaning by anything won't work. Words can't really be connected to a meaning, at least, not a non-personal one.

You're right. It doesn't change the fact that he claims your propsal won't work though. The fact that he makes an even stronger claim doesn't make this less of a challenge for you.

&gt; What's the difference between you saying ""That apple is red"" and ""I'm certain that apple is red"" besides the actual words used?

The first one is about the world while the second one is about the way the world appears to an individual. They mean different things, since they have different truth conditions. The first one is true whenever states of affairs are such that apples are actually red. The second one is true whenever someone has certainty that apples are red, independent of apples being that way.

&gt; Well, they act similar to us in some regards, which, to my mind, is basically what ""functionally similar"" means.

I mean yeah, duh. But what are the actual things that make us similar that can also be modeled? What are the things that can be modeled but aren't similar? Are there anything's that are similar or dissimilar that can't be or aren't modeled?

&gt; I was. And my statement still stands. Neural nets are built on computers, in languages, which, as far as I know, are Turing complete. The specialized hardware I was imagining was essentially a mechanical(?) neural net.

I seem to recall you saying that the exact actions taken by a neural net may or may not be apparent to an engineer: that every step can't be accounted for perfectly. In fact, I seem to remember a advancement in recent mathematics that validated machine proofs without having to go to the trouble of checking steps tediously. If I misunderstood, that's fine. I'd just like some clarification.

&gt; I don't think this is correct. We know how a neural net works, we built them, and there are papers on how they work.

I found the relevant quote I was referring to above:

The point of a neural network is basically to outsource the thinking work to the computer, so the programmer necessarily doesn't really understand what's (specifically) going on under the hood. 
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/56e4ey/cmv_the_hard_problem_of_consciousness_is_a/db8ipji/

I don't doubt that people much smarter than me have practical mastery over neural nets, but my objection stands, based on what you said previously. The exact determinate steps aren't necessarily accountable, even if the results and applicable benefits are obvious.

&gt; The goal is to abstract the actual process from the engineer, so that the computer can do it, but we could report on the state of the neural net to see how it works. We could even run something through it by hand once we have that report.

Which states would be necessary to carry out this kind of work?

&gt;  So, if we develop it by accident? If we managed to make something like that by accident, it's not really anything new: they're called babies. If we did so deliberately, I think we'd have to know how it worked on some level.

To be fair, it isn't just any kind of accident that makes babies: it's the baby making kind. Likewise, perhaps certain creative accidents are more likely to yield AI.

&gt; What do you mean by essential facts? I don't think we know the ""essential facts"" about anything, if you mean the absolute truth. If you mean close enough that it can be said to be understood, that's not a question I feel I know enough to answer.

So, if I ask you what you know for sure, then you know nothing. And, if I ask you what you know with less confidence, you'd say nothing. But, if I asked you if physicalism is more likely than non-physicalism, you'd know exactly what to say.

&gt;  This is very nearly the definition of a model (i.e. it doesn't necessarily need to be imperfect, but other than that). But yes, they are this.

We've talked about this already; I'm using a mathematically rigorous definition of model. You seem to be evoking a lay definition that appeal to primitive resemblance. I can look for the exact link, but I'll have to include it as an edit.

&gt;  Isn't this how induction works? And it's as close to truth as we'll get in any system like science... (Aside, I mean consistent as in accuracy, not precision.)

Accuracy is a necessary condition for valid induction and truth. Accuracy is a sufficient condition for truth. I'm talking about answers precisely falling close to where we expected to find them. If we model the brain in a way that assumes mental import for given arrangements, then we'll find that our conclusions almost always confirm our expectations. What needs to be explained in this just-so case is the presence of precision, not the presumed presence of accuracy.

&gt; If we think the world is classical, we won't find it's quantum? This seems like an obvious counterexample.

On the other hand, it took revolutionary reconceptions in physics to get relativity and Quantum mechanics. Physics 1900-1935 is one of the most complicated and revolutionary times in human thought. We weren't looking for the classical after the formative years, because minds were changed.

&gt; Unless I'm mistaken, this is social pressure. The fact that you know people would think you're strange means there's social pressure.

On behavior, it might be a pressure. On belief, I'd feel no urge to change. What do other people know that I don't? Everyone is me in a sock puppet.

&gt; Only by our definition of rational...
You seem to be saying that solipsists are insane. That's fine, but recognize that insanity is just a thing we made up. We defined it. So, we defined solipsism as something irrational. We didn't prove it to be, we defined it to be.

Some solipsists are insane; they have certified mental diseases that impede their ability to function within human society. Some of this is clearly due to arbitrary demands to be a practically useful tool for others. I've heard that schizophrenia is less debilitating in societies that accomodate and validate 'hearing' voices, for example. Some people are barred from participating in rational conversation by less contingent reasons, though. Classifying their disease as ""made-up"" makes as much sense as saying broken legs are ""made-up"".

My modest claim is that I, as a mostly rational individual, have a better chance of being right about something compared to a person with limitations we can both see clearly. This is, presumably, due to my rationality: my ability to participate in the exchange of reasons.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-01-14 00:22:23 :

&gt; If something can be said to be true or false, there is something independent that makes it so.

So, how do you reconcile the Private Language Argument with what you just gave me from Quine, which kinda implied that all languages are private.

&gt; If claims about emotions are as subjective as our claims about which flavor of ice cream is best, then it isn't territory for science.

I'd actually like to argue this point. We have people who design flavors to be the ""best"" (like people who design Pringles to be addictive). There is actually a science to it.

&gt; If none of the terms in my language are identical with any of the terms in your language, what exactly do we share?

They needn't be identical to be somewhat shared. If they are similar, they clearly share something.

&gt; The first one is about the world while the second one is about the way the world appears to an individual.

This statement isn't in a vacuum, though. The fact that it's you saying it implies that it's about how it appears to you.

&gt; But what are the actual things that make us similar that can also be modeled?

While I think this question seems oddly worded to me based on previous statements (i.e. I was going to say ""The fact that there are similarities makes them a model to us""), I do have an answer. The behaviour of a mouse (or other animals) can be modeled by a neural net. You can train a neural net to guide the behavior of a creature in a simulation. If you make it want to seek food and not die to predators, and find emergent behaviour that seems similar to that of animals.

&gt; Are there anything's that are similar or dissimilar that can't be or aren't modeled?

That's the big question, isn't it? I'd say no, because they follow laws like everything else, but you disagree.

&gt; The point of a neural network is basically to outsource the thinking work to the computer, so the programmer necessarily doesn't really understand what's (specifically) going on under the hood.

So, ""necessarily"" was a slightly inaccurate term. Depending on implementation the only part that even uses pseudo-random number generation (which isn't even impossible to understand) would be the starting point. After that, it's following specific rules: produce output, compare to the training output, retrain the connections based on the amount of error. I said necessarily, because if you understood every step along the way, it would likely defeat the purpose of using a neural net in the first place, not because it's impossible to understand.

&gt; Which states would be necessary to carry out this kind of work?

Though the terms probably don't mean much to you (because they don't mean much to me, since I haven't worked with neural nets all that much), the state would be the final state, consisting of the strength of connection between each node, and each node's activation function.

&gt; Likewise, perhaps certain creative accidents are more likely to yield AI.

Perhaps, but this wouldn't add anything to our understanding, and so, I think, is kinda tangential.

&gt; So, if I ask you what you know for sure, then you know nothing. 

Yes.

&gt;And, if I ask you what you know with less confidence, you'd say nothing.

No. I'd just say nothing relevant to the question you asked: ""On what level are the essential facts of consciousness located""

&gt; But, if I asked you if physicalism is more likely than non-physicalism, you'd know exactly what to say.

Yes, because my confidence in physicalism is higher than that in non-physicalism. 

&gt; We've talked about this already; I'm using a mathematically rigorous definition of model.

Ah. Well, then we again have a problem. The Hard Problem isn't what's standing in the way of science creating such a model of the mind. The fact that science doesn't make such models is the problem.

&gt; I'm talking about answers precisely falling close to where we expected to find them.

It doesn't matter what we expect to find if the results don't match up with the real world. 

&gt; On the other hand, it took revolutionary reconceptions in physics to get relativity and Quantum mechanics.

I don't think this is relevant. The fact that it happened means that it could happen again. You never put a timescale on the understanding of consciousness, and I'd find it ridiculous to claim that such a revolution couldn't happen again.

&gt; On behavior, it might be a pressure. On belief, I'd feel no urge to change.

I'd hesitate to unlink pressure on behaviour from pressure on belief so quickly. But to each his own.

&gt; Classifying their disease as ""made-up"" makes as much sense as saying broken legs are ""made-up"".

Well, I think, as this discussion shows, we understand femurs better than brains. So, I think this statement is easily dismissed by saying that our classification as non-normal functioning of a mind is much more shaky than our classification as non-normal functioning femurs.

&gt; My modest claim is that I, as a mostly rational individual, have a better chance of being right about something compared to a person with limitations we can both see clearly.

Sure, I can agree with that then. I don't really know if this is staying a relevant point of the conversation, so I'm fine dropping my contention.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-14 16:57:03 :

&gt; So, how do you reconcile the Private Language Argument with what you just gave me from Quine, which kinda implied that all languages are private.

To briefly review each argument, PLA states that a language comprised of self-authorized terms is unable to support conditions of truth and falsity. Quine's is that, for any given demonstrative statement, there are multiple ways to interpret it's reference. I'd like a proposal that models language use and acquisition in a way that grants both arguments while accounting for how terms are meaningful: how terms acquire the semantic properties that are apparently useful to us.

To this end, I propose the inroduction of an infinitesimal mental operation. Just as in calculus, infinitesimals provide us a way to define differentials in a standard way. Let 's ds be an infinitesimal mental operation and dø be another infinitesimal mental operation. The ratio of ds/dø represents a dynamic moment of thought, with the continuous development of this ratio over time representing evolving states of consciousness.

This works with PLA insofar as it is compatible with either the truth of falsity of its claims. Infinitesimal mental operations allow us to sneak privacy in through the back by making the infinitesimal components of terms private, while keeping terms themselves public. Likewise, this allows us to accept what Quine says about terms by sidestepping terms all together. If terms are indeterminate in themselves, perhaps this can be alleviated by carrying out additional iteration of the process that brought us the terms until meaning is sufficiently apparent.

I know this section is long, but I would like to run through a hypothetical process to make the proposal clear. Let's say you ask me how I'm feeling. This begins the process by which my mind juxtaposes my sense of self vs my background mental operations. This juxaposition evolves until the mind has ""enough"" to produce a public statement: something sufficiently complicated for supporting truth or falsity. Upon receiving this information, your mind sets up juxapositions between your infinitesimal interpretive processes and your background mental operations. This require multiple simulateous interpretations to crop up, which are synthesized into your overall import.

&gt; I'd actually like to argue this point. We have people who design flavors to be the ""best"" (like people who design Pringles to be addictive). There is actually a science to it.

Which is objectively best then, chocolate or vanilla?

&gt; They needn't be identical to be somewhat shared. If they are similar, they clearly share something.

Ok, how exactly are you defining simular, then?

&gt; This statement isn't in a vacuum, though. The fact that it's you saying it implies that it's about how it appears to you.

You might be able to infer that from my statement, but it doesn't strictly say anything about me. If you said, 'Apples are red' the statement would cease to be relevant to.me in any way. That is what makes it an objective statement; it's meaning is invariant with respect to speaker and audience.

&gt; I do have an answer. The behaviour of a mouse (or other animals) can be modeled by a neural net... 

I can't disagree with this, since this is one of the mathematical features of neural nets. Neural nets are able to act as a universal function simulator for given sufficiently-sized yet definite intervals. This is way I introduced the 4 kinds of similarity we talked about earlier. Functional adequacy isn't necessarily going to get us what we want. 

Absolute similarity requires self-same relations, so it lack explanatory power. Perfect-copy similarity requires perfect overlap in procedure, which neural nets engineers are agnostic about. Functional similarity is probably what we are talking about here, but that isn't adequate for conforming or denying the presence of experience. Finally, primitive resemblance can't ground any claims about further similarity in themselves.

If mice are only demonstrated to be functionally similar to humans, then no conclusions about consciousness immediately follow. We would need to supplement these claims with claims about the types shared by mice and humans that makes them both conscious.

&gt; [Neural nets follow] specific rules: produce output, compare to the training output, retrain the connections based on the amount of error. I said necessarily, because if you understood every step along the way, it would likely defeat the purpose of using a neural net in the first place, not because it's impossible to understand.

This procedure is very different from how biological neural nets work. Our natural neural nets don't have an external authority giving it rules for what is true and correcting our perception with the unfiltered truth. We have to accomplish these tasks by feeding the entire system back into itself and linking up with external systems in a similar manner.

This is the long and short of my argument in any case: Neural nets either match us on a type level or merely reproduce some of our functionality. When I thought neural nets were like us, I assumed the first. With this new info, I suspect the second.

&gt; the state would be the final state, consisting of the strength of connection between each node, and each node's activation function.

I think they entire analogy between our mind and a given neural net is going to rely on our interpretation of the activation function. Of the output of the activation function is given in terms of neural activity, then you won't get much argument from me. That seems like a fairly straightforward model that we could check against observation. If the activation function takes you from a system state to a state of mind, then you've smuggled in identity theory about the mind. If you are just defining mental states as physical states, then it should be surprising when the system returns the result that, 'Some physical state is equivalent to some mental state.'

&gt; Ah. Well, then we again have a problem. The Hard Problem isn't what's standing in the way of science creating such a model of the mind. The fact that science doesn't make such models is the problem.

This is what I said to your response last time:

""[Our uses of 'model'] are one in the same from a general mathematics standpoint. A model is any body of claims inferable from a given body of axioms. In the case of observational models, the axioms are taken to be the observations and the model of a description of behavior consistent with and inferable from the observations.""

I couldn't find a reply from you. I think this is a fairly accurate depiction of our use of models in science. If you disagree, do you have an alternative proposal in mind?

&gt; It doesn't matter what we expect to find if the results don't match up with the real world.

I agree, which is why I'm spending so much time trying to establish conditions where we can agree on what the real world is in the first place.

&gt; I don't think this is relevant. The fact that it happened means that it could happen again. You never put a timescale on the understanding of consciousness, and I'd find it ridiculous to claim that such a revolution couldn't happen again.

I never claimed the revolution wasn't coming. I am claiming that the revolution won't be what you think it is. I'm saying that a revolutionary understanding of the mind won't comprise of magic machines giving us new information. It will come from radically changing our preconceptions.

&gt; Well, I think, as this discussion shows, we understand femurs better than brains. So, I think this statement is easily dismissed by saying that our classification as non-normal functioning of a mind is much more shaky than our classification as non-normal functioning femurs.

Are you doubting the current classification of some obvious forms of insanity as detrimental to human flourishing?

&gt; Sure, I can agree with that then. I don't really know if this is staying a relevant point of the conversation, so I'm fine dropping my contention.

I think it's still relevant. We were talking about starting axioms. You seemed to be resigned to accepting somethings as unavoidable axioms. I think these things aren't unanalyzable and that It might be better to pick different axioms so we can carry out these analysis.

&gt; I know this section is long, but I would like to run through a hypothetical process to make the proposal clear...

So, I can't say I understand exactly how this resolves the issues, but I just want to say this sounds very similar (in fact, I needn't change anything to reconcile the two) to how I described it working in my physical description of the mind.

&gt; Which is objectively best then, chocolate or vanilla?

This is not a question for me. Someone could tell you which people are more likely to buy, though. Or could design a flavor designed to make people buy it.

&gt; Ok, how exactly are you defining simular, then?

Having some shared characteristics.

&gt; You might be able to infer that from my statement, but it doesn't strictly say anything about me. If you said, 'Apples are red' the statement would cease to be relevant to.me in any way.

In the vacuum of logic, sure. But we talk in the real world, and context matters. The fact that you said it says something about you. To give an example, the apple isn't red to someone who is red/green colorblind.

&gt; This is way I introduced the 4 kinds of similarity we talked about earlier. Functional adequacy isn't necessarily going to get us what we want.

It seems to me, if I could create a system that acts the same in all situations as another system, then Occam's Razor would suggest that there isn't a magical quality one has but the other doesn't.

&gt; If mice are only demonstrated to be functionally similar to humans, then no conclusions about consciousness immediately follow.

Yes, but inferences about consciousness could. Do you think science has any answers for us? Not even just about consciousness, but anything?

&gt; This procedure is very different from how biological neural nets work. Our natural neural nets don't have an external authority giving it rules for what is true and correcting our perception with the unfiltered truth.

Different? Yes. Very? No. You're right, but we do this with neural nets because we use them for a purpose. This is very similar to the process that happens when, say, someone teaches you how to do a job. They do, in fact, act as an external authority giving rules for what is right, and correcting our actions.

The design of neural nets actually comes from our best understanding of how the brain works. That's where the inspiration for the idea came from: neurons in our brains and how they strengthened and weakened connections.

&gt;  I think they entire analogy between our mind and a given neural net is going to rely on our interpretation of the activation function.

So, going to be honest, ""activation function"" was a term I threw in there, because I know it's accurate, but don't know what it means. I was basically regurgitating what I'd heard before. To my understanding, an activation function determins what data a neuron will send forward in the net. I believe it's often non-linear, which I assume means that, since each neuron has an input from each neuron in the previous layer, inputs will contribute to the data in a non-linear fashion. Basically, if we used x^2 and had 3 inputs, the first gives 1, the second gives .5 and the third gives 2, then the number we'd output would not be 3.5, but instead be 5.25.

&gt; I couldn't find a reply from you. I think this is a fairly accurate depiction of our use of models in science. If you disagree, do you have an alternative proposal in mind?

Mostly, let me just pick one part here though:

&gt; In the case of observational models, the axioms are taken to be the observations and the model of a description of behavior consistent with and inferable from the observations

This is a different case of inferences. Say, for example, you have the axiom ""All ravens are black"" (because that Raven Paradox thing is on my mind). From this, you can infer that ""This raven is black"". However, say you have the observation, ""This raven is black"" you cannot use this to infer, in the same way, that ""All ravens are black"". One way is certain, and undeniable (without attacking the axiom), the other is evidence, and the inference need not be true even if the axiom is accepted. In math, we have the first way: We have rules, and we find what follows, using proofs. In science, we have the second way: You cannot use proofs to go from our evidence to our laws.

&gt; I agree, which is why I'm spending so much time trying to establish conditions where we can agree on what the real world is in the first place.

I think this would be very relevant if we were trying to figure out how the brain actually works. But it doesn't seem to be the case if we are trying to figure out if we can figure out how the brain works. I dunno, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

&gt; It will come from radically changing our preconceptions.

So, what, if not science, will find these answers, then?

&gt; Are you doubting the current classification of some obvious forms of insanity as detrimental to human flourishing?

I'm acknowledging that these classifications are ours, not the universes.

&gt; I think these things aren't unanalyzable and that It might be better to pick different axioms so we can carry out these analysis.

Regardless, I think my point was there would be axioms. And, even if we pick different ones, there would still be ones. This was to dissolve the ""consistent"" to get past Godel's theorem, if I remember correctly.

&gt; So, I can't say I understand exactly how this resolves the issues, but I just want to say this sounds very similar (in fact, I needn't change anything to reconcile the two) to how I described it working in my physical description of the mind.

The difference is I'm not making a physical description. I'm talking about things in terms of ""point-like"" mental events. If you are literally saying the same thing while substituting 'mental operation' for 'physical operation', then you need to explain the emergence of mental properties from physical operations. Since I bake the bare essential mental properties from the begining, I don't have a similar problem.

&gt; This is not a question for me. Someone could tell you which people are more likely to buy, though. Or could design a flavor designed to make people buy it.

So best is being decided by market share research? Value is just a popularity contest, or something?

&gt;  Having some shared characteristics.

Such as?

&gt;  In the vacuum of logic, sure. But we talk in the real world, and context matters. The fact that you said it says something about you. To give an example, the apple isn't red to someone who is red/green colorblind.

I thought this last sentence was really weird. It isn't as if being color blind implies that some doesn't believe in color. It's that things don't appear in (specific) color to them. If there are apples that are red in reality, then 'apples are red' is still true, though.

Maybe it would help the to separate 'This apples is red' as a fact from 'This apple is red' as an utterance. The fact says something about the states of affairs because of its semantic features. The utterance says something about a state of affairs, too. It is also supports inference about things apart from the sentences explicit content.

&gt;  It seems to me, if I could create a system that acts the same in all situations as another system, then Occam's Razor would suggest that there isn't a magical quality one has but the other doesn't.

I agree, which is why I grant that perfect copies are adequately similar. If two things are absolutely functionally equivalent, then you are right. Functional adequacy isn't the same as being completely indiscernable, though. This is the third kind of similarity we discussed: being functionally interchangable within a pre-defined context. These are things that are identical for the purpose of something or other.

&gt; Yes, but inferences about consciousness could. Do you think science has any answers for us? Not even just about consciousness, but anything?

Of course! I think science is a great source of information about the things we can make justified inferences about. 'H2O is water' is a kind of inference that is iron-clad. It is an identity staement that is well-justified through our best research into chemical composition, chemical properties, and what we understand chemicals to be in the first place.

I'm not trying to say that you would need something like and identity inference necessarily, but it would need to be a justified inference. Do you have any suggestions about which inferences would be rigorous in this way?

&gt; Different? Yes. Very? No. You're right, but we do this with neural nets because we use them for a purpose. This is very similar to the process that happens when, say, someone teaches you how to do a job. They do, in fact, act as an external authority giving rules for what is right, and correcting our actions.

Sure, but that isn't the typical use of a language. We use language in order to instruct people, but language isn't a set of instructions in itself. Languages we consciously use aren't necessarily the language of thought, but it seems like modeling language-use authentically is an important step in understanding interpretation and intention. Of artifficial neural nets are off-loading all of their interpretive-semantic work into engineers, then the process is very different. People never have that kind of luxury.

&gt; The design of neural nets actually comes from our best understanding of how the brain works. That's where the inspiration for the idea came from: neurons in our brains and how they strengthened and weakened connections.

They are inspired by nature, but we clearly changed some things in the artificial nets for the sake of getting specific things done. We didn't find well-formed hardware that we simply repurposed.

&gt; So, going to be honest, ""activation function"" was a term I threw in there, because I know it's accurate, but don't know what it means.

That's alright. I think I confused activation function with learning algorithm anyways. I'm reading about this stuff as we go.

&gt; One way is certain, and undeniable (without attacking the axiom), the other is evidence, and the inference need not be true even if the axiom is accepted. In math, we have the first way: We have rules, and we find what follows, using proofs. In science, we have the second way: You cannot use proofs to go from our evidence to our laws.

This seems like bad news for science then. You basically seem to be saying that the laws of science aren't evidenced based- that evidence doesn't and can't determine laws. This is fine from a logical standpoint, but it is incompatible with nearly every version of scientific realism. 

To my ear, evidence sounds a lot like something being evident. It is the way things are manifest to us. When we are presented with an empirical fact face-to-face, then I think there is more certainty than you let on.

&gt; I dunno, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

I think we are trying to do both, in a way. We aren't scientists, so we can't study the actual brain seriously. I want to aim a little higher than skepticism though, so we need to get out of our armchairs. I suppose the question is, 'What must the mind be like, if it can be studied or known about in the first place?""

&gt; So, what, if not science, will find these answers, then?

Maybe science using a non-physical model of the mind, like they do in some kinds of social science.

&gt; I'm acknowledging that these classifications are ours, not the universes.

Of course, the universe as a whole doesn't classify anything. That doesn't mean our classifications aren't objective.

&gt; Regardless, I think my point was there would be axioms. And, even if we pick different ones, there would still be ones. This was to dissolve the ""consistent"" to get past Godel's theorem, if I remember correctly.

True, but our choice of starting axioms matters. If all our axioms are physical brute fact plus something about determinism, then all your models will be physical. After all, all effects that can be grounded in physical facts through a determinate process are also physical. However, if we start with neutral ontologies, then we can generate models of all stripes.

I think this descriptive range is a good thing. I also think that other things could lead us to prefer other axioms over axioms like, 'Induction is unalayzably true', 'There exists a world such that it is like our perceptions', and so on.

awenonian @ 2017-01-15 22:27:48 :

&gt; Since I bake the bare essential mental properties from the begining, I don't have a similar problem.

My ""point-like"" mental events are the transfer of neurotransmitters between neurons, I think. This evidently causes mental events, because when we examine simpler creatures (such as flatworms) we can see how this informs behavior. Behavior is clearly part of mental activity, so, it seems that these physical events cause mental events.

&gt; So best is being decided by market share research? Value is just a popularity contest, or something?

Well, that's how we assign dollar values to things, so ""Value is a popularity contest"" seems accurate.

&gt; Such as?

They seek pleasure and avoid pain.

&gt; It's that things don't appear in (specific) color to them.

While it's true that the object still reflects the same wavelengths of light, ""red"" isn't exactly synonymous with that. At what wavelength does ""red"" become ""orange""?

&gt; The utterance says something about a state of affairs, too. It is also supports inference about things apart from the sentences explicit content.

QED. You said it doesn't say anything about you when you say ""the apple is red."" I said it does. You seem to admit that here.

&gt; 'H2O is water' is a kind of inference that is iron-clad.

This isn't an inference, this is a definition.

&gt; Do you have any suggestions about which inferences would be rigorous in this way?

I'm not certain what you're asking here. I don't know what set of inferences to pick from. 

&gt; Of artifficial neural nets are off-loading all of their interpretive-semantic work into engineers, then the process is very different.

They don't need to. You can train a neural net with genetic programming without training data. Perhaps you give it the goal of reproducing before it dies. You introduce conditions that make it die if it doesn't eat, and die if it gets eaten by a predator (also controlled by a neural net). Give it the ability to output data to be received by nearby creatures (like a bird call). It will develop into a reasonable ecosystem. We just don't do this often.

&gt; People never have that kind of luxury.

Do they not? What's a teacher's job then?

&gt; They are inspired by nature, but we clearly changed some things in the artificial nets for the sake of getting specific things done. We didn't find well-formed hardware that we simply repurposed.

True, but we formed the software as close as we could. 

&gt; You basically seem to be saying that the laws of science aren't evidenced based- that evidence doesn't and can't determine laws. 

No to the first, yes to the second. Seeing a black raven is certainly evidence that ""All raven's are black"" but it's not proof.

What I meant by ""You cannot use proofs to go from our evidence to our laws"" was that our evidence doesn't prove our laws. It may ""prove beyond a reasonable doubt"" but it doesn't prove it. Just because the last 10,000 things I dropped fell doesn't prove this one will.

&gt; I suppose the question is, 'What must the mind be like, if it can be studied or known about in the first place?""

This is a tough question, because while I can think of conditions in which it could be studied, I don't know which of their conditions are the ""must"" and which are the ""nice to have"". I'd say something along the line of it must be physical. Or it must be made of observable parts.

&gt; Maybe science using a non-physical model of the mind, like they do in some kinds of social science.

If it could, would ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness [not be] a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience""?

&gt; Of course, the universe as a whole doesn't classify anything. That doesn't mean our classifications aren't objective.

I think just because mental illnesses are detrimental to thriving in our society doesn't mean that they are inherently detrimental. I don't think anything fundamental restricts a society existing where people with those mental illnesses could thrive.

&gt; However, if we start with neutral ontologies, then we can generate models of all stripes.

Sure. While I think I'm still convinced of the physicalism of the world (which, actually thinking about it may not clearly describe my beliefs. Just, as a quick explanation, I'd say ""The laws of physics (discovered and undiscovered) govern the behavior of the world"" is closest to what I believe), I don't know if it's necessary for science to understand the mind.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-17 18:53:23 :

&gt; My ""point-like"" mental events are the transfer of neurotransmitters between neurons, I think. This evidently causes mental events, because when we examine simpler creatures (such as flatworms) we can see how this informs behavior. Behavior is clearly part of mental activity, so, it seems that these physical events cause mental events.

Very good reply! This is about as clear is it's going to get, I think. I have two topics in response: The relationship between things and their causes and between behavior and thought.

First, the fact that two things, A and B, are in a causal relationship doesn't imply that those two things are of the same type. ""A lack of confidence in major investors caused the markets to drop"", is a ostensibly causal statement. However, 'A' here is a mental attitude and 'B' is a statement of public value. Likewise, the fact that neurons are the efficient cause of mental events doesn't imply that neurons are mental events.

Second, behavior is caused by mental events; this seems like the most reasonable line to tow. However, as above, this connection isn't iron-clad. If we don't allow bracketing, the mere appearance of behavior-like physical events doesn't guarantee that a given think has a mental cause. For example, speech mimicking neural nets today can trick people for limited stretches so causing apparent behavior. However, neural nets today don't have mental lives. Therefore, not all apparent behavior indicates mental causes.

I'm trying to set up a system, by bracketing knowledge questions and making fine intension distinctions, which makes these connections more reliable. This would require an account of the relationship between types and a mote rigorous definition of behavior.

&gt; Well, that's how we assign dollar values to things, so ""Value is a popularity contest"" seems accurate.

That makes sense, because currency value is almost another way of saying market value. This is the same domain of application; it doesn't imply it's the only domain of application.

&gt; They seek pleasure and avoid pain.

This is as good of a place as any. How do humans and mice express this similarity? Can you think of a plausible, (incomplete is fine), route by which neural nets will not only express similar actions, but express those actions as the result of being in pleasure/pain?

&gt; While it's true that the object still reflects the same wavelengths of light, ""red"" isn't exactly synonymous with that. At what wavelength does ""red"" become ""orange""?

I wasn't even going to gloss this in terms of wavelengths. What colorblind people believe about red is just what we believe about red. The only difference I that colorblind people have poor success at coming to these beliefs through first-hand judgement.

&gt; QED. You said it doesn't say anything about you when you say ""the apple is red."" I said it does. You seem to admit that here.

Only she we obscure the distinction between the formal structure of a sentence and the physical object of an utterance. To give this an unhelpful allegorical gloss, sentences are software while utterences are hardware. It doesn't always make sense to talk about software in terms of physical operations in the machine, because the software has formal logical properties hardware lacks and hardware supports external inferences that the software doesn't.

&gt; This isn't an inference, this is a definition.

What's the difference exactly. Don't definitions allow us to infer the meaning of a terms through examples of it's most conspicuous uses?

&gt; I'm not certain what you're asking here. I don't know what set of inferences to pick from.

It's whatever you think is most relevant. I agree it is an open question and a big question at that, but I'm trying to give you the chance to put your most ambitious argument forward.

&gt; They don't need to. You can train a neural net with genetic programming without training data. Perhaps you give it the goal of reproducing before it dies. You introduce conditions that make it die if it doesn't eat, and die if it gets eaten by a predator (also controlled by a neural net). Give it the ability to output data to be received by nearby creatures (like a bird call).

OK, let's note the differences between this scenario and our evolutionary past. You are explicitly saddling something with a directive for success, giving explicit conditions for success and failure, and providing a context to connect individuals unambiguously. We arose from an environment without a purpose, without clear conditions for determining success, and without unambiguous relations to back is up. 

We had to provide our own semantics in order to establish a definite reality for ourselves. The neural net here seems to be getting all that automatically. This important, if what we are supposed to be investigating is the emergence of meaning from pre-representive existence.

&gt; Do they not? What's a teacher's job then?

A teachers job is to present useful information in order to induce the student into learning. Teachers can't make people learn, or manually do the learning activity for the student. The point is to set conditions where learning is self-directed and spontaneous.
Source: Two years as an entry-level educator.

&gt; True, but we formed the software as close as we could.

This is more or less my point: That we are doing our best to reverse engineer functionally adequate behavior rather than reverse engineering properties of a state itself or a type of system.

&gt; What I meant by ""You cannot use proofs to go from our evidence to our laws"" was that our evidence doesn't prove our laws. It may ""prove beyond a reasonable doubt"" but it doesn't prove it. Just because the last 10,000 things I dropped fell doesn't prove this one will.

There are two uses of the terms reasonable: practical within limits and bounded by reasons. I suspect these definitions aren't distinct, but you are definitely using the more informal notion: the first one. What I suspect is that you are defining the first notion in terms of a paraphrase of a claim plus a statement of the second kind of rationality.

For example, 'All ravens are black' gets glossed as, 'Iterative application of Bayes' theorem combined with my current apparent observations implies 'All ravens are black.'' This is something we can determine, and therefore an example of reasons determining the claim. This claim is compatible with 'The next raven I find will be non-black' being true or false, but doesn't depend on an extra-rational, indeterminate mode of knowledge acquisition.

&gt; This is a tough question, because while I can think of conditions in which it could be studied, I don't know which of their conditions are the ""must"" and which are the ""nice to have"". I'd say something along the line of it must be physical. Or it must be made of observable parts.

Why must the mind be physical in order to be studied or known about in the first place? We discussed examples of things that are studied which being explicitly physical earlier, (mathematics, ethics, etc). I know you weren't keen on this notion then, so I guess we can hammer this out now.

&gt; If it could, would ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness [not be] a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience""?

The social sciences treat the Hard Problem as a genuine obstacle, (sometimes). There is a lot of literature on subjectivity, inter-subjectivity, and communal experience. These are all attempts of 'going around' the Hard Problem rather than proceeding as if nothing were there.

&gt; I think just because mental illnesses are detrimental to thriving in our society doesn't mean that they are inherently detrimental. I don't think anything fundamental restricts a society existing where people with those mental illnesses could thrive.

I already mentioned cases like this because I understand this, (see: schizophrenia). There are people that are profoundly handicapped, though. These people don't just struggle to fit in. These people lack the basic social skills to report their beliefs honestly, form objective opinions, and react to conflicts through non-violent means. These are important for societies function in principle.

&gt; Sure. While I think I'm still convinced of the physicalism of the world (which, actually thinking about it may not clearly describe my beliefs. Just, as a quick explanation, I'd say ""The laws of physics (discovered and undiscovered) govern the behavior of the world"" is closest to what I believe), I don't know if it's necessary for science to understand the mind.

This sounds like accepting that physical science isn't in the mind discovering game. This isn't necessarily the same as rejecting the existence of mind, but it might be an example of conceding the Hard Problem.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-01-18 04:48:03 :

&gt; Likewise, the fact that neurons are the efficient cause of mental events doesn't imply that neurons are mental events.

Sure. I'm not sure how this is an issue for me, as, if you agree with what I've said, I've accounted for the existence of mental events: they are the effect of neurons doing stuff.

&gt; However, neural nets today don't have mental lives.

What brings this conclusion? It seems to me that neural nets have mental lives as much as any animal.

&gt; How do humans and mice express this similarity?

I'm not certain what you're looking for here. Does ""Humans and mice, alike, put effort into gathering things like food, and into avoiding things like electric shocks"" work?

&gt; Can you think of a plausible, (incomplete is fine), route by which neural nets will not only express similar actions, but express those actions as the result of being in pleasure/pain?

Here we have a conundrum, which, I suspect is the heart of the matter. Let me just talk this out for a bit. To start, you can create (either through training, or some form of genetic programming) a neural net that will perform these actions as a result of something like pleasure and pain. If given the goal of maximizing some variables (""pleasure"") and minimizing others (""pain"") these behaviors will be displayed. I suspect your response would be something along the lines of saying how we dictated what is pleasureable and what is painful for the neural net. A luxury we don't have. But I suspect that if you refrained from giving a goal, just gave some rules (hunger will kill you, but can be reduced by picking up food, etc.), and used genetic programming, which works similarly to evolution (that is, the most successful survive, with, in this case ""successful"" being determined by how many were able to find a mate), certain parameters would become maximized (e.g. number of mates met) and minimized (e.g. hunger level), simply on virtue of the fact that those that meet the most mates and starve the least will produce the most offspring, and thus represent a larger part of the gene pool. These would take the same goal as ""pleasure"" and ""pain"" without us having to dictate them. Did that make sense?

&gt; The only difference I that colorblind people have poor success at coming to these beliefs through first-hand judgement.

I think something fundamental changes when you have a belief because someone told you, instead of because you experienced it. If this wasn't the case, then your arguments in other areas about the problem of us having dictated rules to neural nets would cease to hold water, would they not?

&gt; Only she we obscure the distinction between the formal structure of a sentence and the physical object of an utterance.

My point was never that the sentence itself says something about you. Instead, my point was that, in the real world, sentences don't exist without context, and that context says something about you.

&gt; What's the difference exactly. 

I would say a definition is dictated, an inference is discovered. But, past that, I may have made a mistake in characterization. I think ""water is H2O"" isn't quite a definition, as we knew things about water before we discovered it was made up of constituent Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms.

&gt; Don't definitions allow us to infer the meaning of a terms through examples of it's most conspicuous uses?

Clearly this is beside the point. As you said above: ""the fact that two things, A and B, are in a causal relationship doesn't imply that those two things are of the same type.""

&gt; I agree it is an open question and a big question at that, but I'm trying to give you the chance to put your most ambitious argument forward.

I'm sorry, but I still don't think I really understand the question you are asking.

&gt; You are explicitly saddling something with a directive for success, giving explicit conditions for success and failure, and providing a context to connect individuals unambiguously. We arose from an environment without a purpose, without clear conditions for determining success, and without unambiguous relations to back is up.

In my reimagining of this scenario above, this goal need not actually be stated as a directive. Simply allowing reproduction would set this as the goal, as those best suited for it would quickly begin to represent a larger portion of the gene pool. The exact same way evolution works.

&gt; A teachers job is to present useful information in order to induce the student into learning.

So they ""act as an external authority giving rules for what is right, and correcting our actions""?

&gt; That we are doing our best to reverse engineer functionally adequate behavior rather than reverse engineering properties of a state itself or a type of system.

I'm not sure this is entirely accurate. We didn't design neural nets to act like people (adequate behavior), we designed them to act like brains (type of system). The result is they do, somewhat, act like people. The issue isn't that we've unfaithfully designed the system, just that, you know, the brain is hardware, and we're representing a neural net as software.

&gt; What I suspect is that you are defining the first notion in terms of a paraphrase of a claim plus a statement of the second kind of rationality.

My goal with the use ""reasonable"" was to invoke the phrase ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" used in legal settings. I didn't mean to equivocate on any other definition of the term reasonable.

&gt; For example, 'All ravens are black' gets glossed as, ... This claim is compatible with 'The next raven I find will be non-black' being true or false

Which was my point. If our beliefs are compatible with them being true or false, then they aren't proven. Regardless of how you parse the rules, the point is, the theorems we derive in math are not like this. They are not compatible with being false in some cases.

&gt; Why must the mind be physical in order to be studied or known about in the first place?

Good question. I don't know. This is why I put the ""I don't know which are ... 'nice to have'"" and ""Or it must be made of observable parts."" I think I've previously tried to define physical as ""observable"" which, while clearly not the normal definition, is the definition I've been running under. That is to say, if something affects the world, it's observable, and we can figure out how it affects the world (even if it does so in a non-consistent manner, see quantum mechanics). If we find rules for how it affects the world, it enters our laws of physics, which, to my mind, would make it physical. Sorry if this causes confusion.

&gt; The social sciences treat the Hard Problem as a genuine obstacle, (sometimes).

So, the revolution is not coming?

&gt; These people lack the basic social skills to report their beliefs honestly, form objective opinions, and react to conflicts through non-violent means.

Sure, but these are not the symptoms of a solipsist. I never meant to suggest that no mental illness is detrimental. I mean, taking that claim to the extreme, it could support an argument that dead people are able to pose rational arguments.

&gt; This sounds like accepting that physical science isn't in the mind discovering game.

To me it sounds like accepting that it doesn't need to be to solve the problem. This is independent of whether it is or isn't. Rephrased, I said that even if physical science isn't in the game of discovering the mind, I'm not sure that procludes the mind being discovered. If, as I said I believe, ""The laws of physics (discovered and undiscovered) govern the behavior of the world"" then physical science *is* in the game. But, even if I'm wrong, I don't think that immediately concedes the Hard Problem.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-18 17:13:57 :

&gt; Sure. I'm not sure how this is an issue for me, as, if you agree with what I've said, I've accounted for the existence of mental events: they are the effect of neurons doing stuff.

It has to do with how much you are accounting for vs how much is a given for any reasonable theory. Substance dualism is well-dead, so 'Some mental event is caused by some physical event' is part of the common facts we all need to explain. Saying 'Some mental event is caused by some physical event', because 'Some physical events cause mental events' doesn't explain why or how this occurs. You need to give a reason why it is that physical events cause mental events, or how types of things relate to one another.

&gt; What brings this conclusion? It seems to me that neural nets have mental lives as much as any animal.

Any animal? I find that to be incredibly dubious, even excluding gorillas or whales or even dogs. I don't think we have anything that even reaches the level of complexity of a toad, ignoring the fact that this is strictly a question of state rather than complexity. What makes you say this?

&gt; I'm not certain what you're looking for here. Does ""Humans and mice, alike, put effort into gathering things like food, and into avoiding things like electric shocks"" work?

You're on the right track, but I don't think this behavior alone accounts for what creatures that feel pain are like. A drone in an Amazon warehouse might have, 'Collect Food' and 'Avoid catastrophic damage' as part of its programing. That doesn't imply those machines feel pain, though.

&gt; To start, you can create (either through training, or some form of genetic programming) a neural net that will perform these actions as a result of something like pleasure and pain. If given the goal of maximizing some variables (""pleasure"") and minimizing others (""pain"") these behaviors will be displayed. 

This is a really weird way to define pleasure and pain. Pleasure and pain aren't optimization conditions; they are complex attitudes. When we examine a case to determine what the 'points and troughs' are going to be, sometimes we do experience pleasure or pain. This can be seen vividly on the floor of any stock exchange weekdays between 9-5. However, we can also consider these things from a detached perspective and experience only neutral feelings.

&gt; I suspect your response would be something along the lines of saying how we dictated what is pleasureable and what is painful for the neural net. A luxury we don't have. But I suspect that if you refrained from giving a goal, just gave some rules... and used genetic programming... certain parameters would become maximized (e.g. number of mates met) and minimized (e.g. hunger level), simply on virtue of the fact that those that meet the most mates and starve the least will produce the most offspring, and thus represent a larger part of the gene pool. These would take the same goal as ""pleasure"" and ""pain"" without us having to dictate them.

This is all true by proof essentially. Neural nets can simulate any function to a given degree of accuracy given finite parameters and sufficient complexity. The question is whether this function is the same thing as our experience of pleasure and pain. In terms of modeling selection pressures, I don't think there is much to add. In terms of modeling a given experience, it isn't clear we've even begun to speak to the issue on this approach. It's hard to even pick out what is supposed to be experiencing pain or pleasure here, since the neural net represents whole populations evolving over time, or something.

&gt; I think something fundamental changes when you have a belief because someone told you, instead of because you experienced it. If this wasn't the case, then your arguments in other areas about the problem of us having dictated rules to neural nets would cease to hold water, would they not?

My argument against neural nets isn't that they appeal to authority. It's rather that their apparent behavior is parasitic. It wholly depends on our semantic renderings for existence and continued survival. In the case of two people, both have the same basic capacities. My telling you to do something is different from telling a machine, because I need to unpack things for a machine while I can count on people to do their own unpacking.

Back to the colorblind example, when we tell a colorblind person about red, they use their imagination and inference to piece together a concept even if they don't fully get it. A colorblind neural net won't be able to form an idea of color unless we actively take part in shaping it towards that goal, through selective pressure or active definition.

&gt; My point was never that the sentence itself says something about you. Instead, my point was that, in the real world, sentences don't exist without context, and that context says something about you.

That seems about right. Notice two different claims here: what a sentence says vs what can be implied given an utterance. There are two distinct claims here. 'Apples are red' means apples are red, while someone saying 'apples are red' may or may not imply something about beliefs or something about the existence of apples.

&gt; I think ""water is H2O"" isn't quite a definition, as we knew things about water before we discovered it was made up of constituent Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms.

That was my thinking when I brought it up. It is kind of like a definition in that it equates things. However, it I something we discovered and is true in terms of natural laws. Presumably, you want the mind to work like this, right? You want the mind the equate to something physical, and you want to know this through discovery rather than positing it as a formal fact.

&gt; Clearly this is beside the point. As you said above: ""the fact that two things, A and B, are in a causal relationship doesn't imply that those two things are of the same type.""

I don't see what you mean. What are the two things here?

&gt; I'm sorry, but I still don't think I really understand the question you are asking.

As I've said, I'm just trying to give you a platform for putting your absolute best theory forward. I've pushed you a lot on the difficulty and complexity of this project. I wanted to given you the chance to push back against this by showing me the grand narrative all at once. If you don't have a clear picture of what your 'win' scenario is like, then you aren't in the persuasion game; you don't have a position to persuade me with.

&gt; So they ""act as an external authority giving rules for what is right, and correcting our actions""?

I don't see myself as an authority like a king has authority. I have expertise that will make my student's lives easier. They have to choose to follow through on this advice though. The neural net, in contrast, doesn't have a choice between obedience and rebellion. It only has the capacity to do as it is told.

&gt; We didn't design neural nets to act like people (adequate behavior), we designed them to act like brains (type of system). The result is they do, somewhat, act like people. The issue isn't that we've unfaithfully designed the system, just that, you know, the brain is hardware, and we're representing a neural net as software.

I'm sure the last part is important, but the adequate behavior I was referring to was the whole brain-body system. We engineer the state to match an input, (neural excitation) ,with an output, (behavior/experience). Creating these correlations isn't necessarily going to tell us about consciousness though because:

1. We are either leaving parts unanalyzed that we intuitively interpret to have experiential features 
2. Or we are inventing artificial mechanisms for correlating definite physical states to one another in order to match things we take to be conscious.

&gt; My goal with the use ""reasonable"" was to invoke the phrase ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" used in legal settings. I didn't mean to equivocate on any other definition of the term reasonable.

I picked up on that, which I why I included the less formal definition. I think the less formal definition matches this reasonable doubt line. I think this can be analyzed in terms of a more logically rigorous definition, though. It seems particularly ironic that you aren't in favor of reducing thing for the sake of parsimony in theory here.

&gt; Which was my point. If our beliefs are compatible with them being true or false, then they aren't proven. Regardless of how you parse the rules, the point is, the theorems we derive in math are not like this. They are not compatible with being false in some cases.

Some theorems in math have indeterminate or paraconsistent truth values. Math isn't just a list of deduced true statements. There are shades of grey, transcendental truths, and the like.

&gt; I think I've previously tried to define physical as ""observable"" which, while clearly not the normal definition, is the definition I've been running under. That is to say, if something affects the world, it's observable, and we can figure out how it affects the world (even if it does so in a non-consistent manner, see quantum mechanics). If we find rules for how it affects the world, it enters our laws of physics, which, to my mind, would make it physical. Sorry if this causes confusion.

No need to be sorry! This is an exciting proposal that move that ball forward quite a bit. It makes a bunch of implicit assumptions very clear. Have you ever read anything by Berkeley?

&gt; So, the revolution is not coming?

I hope so. Social science is still only social science. If there was a revolution in method that made social science more rigorous, I think we'd all benefit.

&gt; Sure, but these are not the symptoms of a solipsist...

I don't know the associated epidemiology of solipsistic delusions, but I'm sure we can find cases that exhibit some of this behavior.

awenonian @ 2017-01-18 23:00:28 :

&gt; You need to give a reason why it is that physical events cause mental events, or how types of things relate to one another.

To start: No, I don't. We can be said to have an understanding of how gravity works, despite the fact that we have next to no clue *why* it works. This is no different. Regardless, the explanation I would give is to reiterate that ""[mental events] *are* the effect of neurons doing stuff"". As in, that's just what we call a mental event.

&gt; I don't think we have anything that even reaches the level of complexity of a toad

I think this misses the point. I said ""neural nets have mental lives as much as any animal."" If ""having a mental life"" is something that can exist on a spectrum, then you should've clarified that (NB: not the *complexity* of a mental life but simply *having* one, seems to be a rather binary thing).

&gt; That doesn't imply those machines feel pain, though.

Depends on how you define pain, I think. A, simple, definition might be ""something to be avoided"". Under this definition, avoiding catastrophic damage, regardless of how the desire to avoid it was obtained, could fit ""feeling pain"". Though, even with this definition, you can still argue that drones don't feel pain, because they don't actually avoid catastrophic damage, at least not directly. That is to say, they avoid catastrophic damage as a consequence of the rules put into them, whereas you might argue that humans avoid it because it is a rule unto itself.

&gt; This is a really weird way to define pleasure and pain. Pleasure and pain aren't optimization conditions; they are complex attitudes.

Is it? Are they? I'd say it seems vastly more accurate to say that these ""complex attitudes"" are actually just our thoughts about the optimization conditions of pleasure and pain. In fact, there's very reasonable explanations for why you might feel something when experiencing pain. In the following scenario, the brain rewires itself in ways that minimize certain things (pain), and maximize others (but we won't worry about that). Say you lose a loved one. This doesn't actually cause you any physical pain. So your brain doesn't change, doesn't learn. However, over the course of many generations, those that are better at saving their loved ones will have more protected tribes, and thus thrive more. They evolve sadness. Sadness is a response that amplifies the pain received when an event such as a loved one dying occurs, thus increasing the amount your brain will rewire, and therefore decreasing the chance of it happening again. These ""complex attitudes"" may simply be some form of feedback loop to amplify the rewiring of the brain, resulting in learning quicker.

This is actually a challenge in any sort of hill climbing algorithm (evolution is an example, training a neural net is another, etc.): How much do you move by each step? If it's small, training is slow but accurate, if it's large, training is fast, but it's easy to overstep your goal. To achieve a good value for this, since the biological functions may only be able to rewire by a certain amount with a given structure, it may be necessary to take several passes. To reiterate, lets say that a neuron rewires itself by 1, uh, neuron rewiring unit or something. Anyway, if the optimal step is actually about 3 times that, without vastly changing the structure so that its steps are more units, it may be much simpler to just pass the retraining over 3 times. These passes could be the ""complex attitudes"" we experience.

&gt; The question is whether this function is the same thing as our experience of pleasure and pain

The problem I continue to have here is I feel like if this were any other thing, you'd be fine saying that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it's a duck. I feel like if things are functionally similar, that's good evidence (though not proof) that they perform similar processes. That is, if they closely resemble each other in outputs based on inputs, that to me suggests that, under the hood, they are doing something similar as well.

&gt; It's hard to even pick out what is supposed to be experiencing pain or pleasure here, since the neural net represents whole populations evolving over time, or something.

Sorry if this wasn't clear. There is no one neural net. It's a bunch of neural nets being run in parallel to produce the behaviors of each actor in the simulated environment. So, it would be each neural net experiencing pleasure/pain.

&gt; My telling you to do something is different from telling a machine, because I need to unpack things for a machine while I can count on people to do their own unpacking.

It's not that different. In order to tell a dog something, you have to unpack things as well. Not to mention the fact that we're working on things to solve this problem anyway (see: Siri, or a number of other programs like her). Just because you have to change your language to accommodate your audience doesn't seem to indicate that they do things fundamentally different from us.

&gt; when we tell a colorblind person about red, they use their imagination and inference to piece together a concept even if they don't fully get it. A colorblind neural net won't be able to form an idea of color unless we actively take part in shaping it towards that goal, through selective pressure or active definition.

I'm not certain what the real difference is between telling a colorblind person about red, and actively taking part in shaping a neural net towards that goal. These seem like the same task on a fundamental level, just, again, you change your language to accommodate your audience.

&gt; Notice two different claims here: what a sentence says vs what can be implied given an utterance. There are two distinct claims here.

Maybe this wasn't your goal with bringing up logical atomism, but the conclusion I drew was that language is never interpreted as the bare words being said. In order to account for this, I basically took on the belief that a sentence's meaning very much depends on the environment in which it is placed.

&gt; You want the mind the equate to something physical, and you want to know this through discovery rather than positing it as a formal fact.

Yes, I think this sounds accurate.

&gt; I don't see what you mean. What are the two things here?

Definitions and inferences. Definitions being tools for inference does not imply they are inferences themselves.

&gt; If you don't have a clear picture of what your 'win' scenario is like, then you aren't in the persuasion game; you don't have a position to persuade me with.

Well, to start, I entered this discussion not with the goal of persuading you to any specific stance, just away from your current one (i.e. to ""change your view""). Regardless, are you asking me to give how I think the brain works as a whole (something that, while I've attempted to do so in part in many places during this discussion, I don't feel I'm actually up to the task of)? Or are you asking me to put forward what I'd need to be true about the brain for my position to hold? Or something else entirely? I'll try to abide once I understand.

&gt; I don't see myself as an authority like a king has authority.

I think you are though. You've put yourself (or they've put you) in the position of teacher. That carries some authority. Not the law making kind, but the teaching kind. The kind of authority where the students expect they can trust what you say as true, unless you say otherwise. This is authority that random people in their lives don't have.

&gt; The neural net, in contrast, doesn't have a choice between obedience and rebellion. It only has the capacity to do as it is told.

These are on different axes though. Your students are in the ""training"" stage, but the neural net, in where it doesn't have choice, is in the ""setting goals"" stage. Once it's also in the training stage, it does have choice, I'd imagine: What if it was given 2 different images and told they mean the same thing? Which aspects does it prioritize from one or the other? Well, whichever one gets it closer to the answer, but that's only because, as we established, it didn't have a choice in the ""setting goals"" stage. Even better, what does it do if given the same image, but told it means 2 different things? Which does it chose? The answer to either likely depends on the initial conditions: if you started off the connections with random weights, you'd get different results in the end. I think this is what you're calling ""choice"".

&gt; Creating these correlations isn't necessarily going to tell us about consciousness though because:

Regardless of whether or not we leave bits unanalyzed, if our model, designed based on the structure, displays behavior similar to the original structure, I believe it's safe to assume our model isn't leaving anything crucial out. If it were, then the behavior would not mimic the original. The important part of this is that the structure wasn't designed to mimic behavior of the original, but to mimic the design of the original.

&gt; I think this can be analyzed in terms of a more logically rigorous definition, though.

My statement? Or the situation? How so?

&gt; It seems particularly ironic that you aren't in favor of reducing thing for the sake of parsimony in theory here.

I'm not entirely sure what this means, but from my understanding: I'd not say I'm against reducing it, I just stated this response (""My goal with the use..."") to hopefully become clearer in my meaning.

&gt; Math isn't just a list of deduced true statements. There are shades of grey, transcendental truths, and the like.

Really? This is news to me. Anything I should look up to read more on this?

&gt; Have you ever read anything by Berkeley?

I have not. 

&gt; but I'm sure we can find cases that exhibit some of this behavior.

Would they exhibit it *because* they're solipsists? Or just in parallel with being solipsists? I certainly think it's possible for someone to be (reasonably) sane and be a solipsist.

KDJones @ 2017-01-22 21:08:52 :

&gt;To start: No, I don't. We can be said to have an understanding of how gravity works, despite the fact that we have next to no clue why it works. This is no different. Regardless, the explanation I would give is to reiterate that ""[mental events] are the effect of neurons doing stuff"". As in, that's just what we call a mental event.

The difference between gravity and mental events is the Hard Problem. I think we might have gone through this song and dance, but I'll reiterate. We define gravity only by it's effects in the world. Experiences are defined by outer behaviors just like gravity, but it is also defined by intuitive inner states. The outer behavior doesn't reliably indicated inner state in every case, as when someone is acting deceptively or capriciously. In short, we don't just mean 'behavior causing thing' here. We're also talking about qualitative experience.

&gt; I think this misses the point. I said ""neural nets have mental lives as much as any animal."" If ""having a mental life"" is something that can exist on a spectrum, then you should've clarified that

I'm not making up these rules as we go. I think it's pretty common-sensical to distinguish between lower and higher animals here. It's pretty clear a chimp is more capable than a worm with respect to thinking. If you literally meant that any animal has a mental life capable to a given neural net, then I stand by my claim.

&gt;Depends on how you define pain, I think. A, simple, definition might be ""something to be avoided"". Under this definition, avoiding catastrophic damage, regardless of how the desire to avoid it was obtained, could fit ""feeling pain"".

I guess I need to start apologizing to the Roomba when I step on it.

&gt; Is it? Are they? I'd say it seems vastly more accurate to say that these ""complex attitudes"" are actually just our thoughts about the optimization conditions of pleasure and pain. In fact, there's very reasonable explanations for why you might feel something when experiencing pain. In the following scenario, the brain rewires itself in ways that minimize certain things (pain), and maximize others (but we won't worry about that)... ""[C]omplex attitudes"" may simply be some form of feedback loop to amplify the rewiring of the brain, resulting in learning quicker.

I think this scenario fails to explain the attitude in question because it appeals to properties of the attitude as the explanation. The famous case of this comes from the Middle Ages, when doctors would explain why opium makes people sleepy by appealing to 'sleep-making' qualities in the poppies. This isn't an explanation for why opium makes you sleepy, because it appeals to the fact that it makes you sleepy as part of the explanations. (e.i. it makes you sleepy because it's a sleep maker.)

Relevant to your scenario, you explain our urge to avoid pain by defining pain as the thing that we are prone to avoid. You are defining 'Pain' as either just is the things we happen to avoid, or as something that has an intrinsic quality that makes us avoid it. The first explanation has the exact form of the example above, (e.i. pain is something we avoid because painful things are avoided things). The second response leaves the issue unanalyzed by bracketing whatever internal properties pain has with a catch-all: painful. This also leads to a tautology though, (Pain is pain because it is pain-like.)

Your analysis of sadness is something I can get down with, though. I think many or most human mental states are explicable in terms of simpler events with a historical-causal background. It's just that this explanation is still intrinsically mental. It appeals to motivational properties on the level of the brain, such as the brain itself choosing to avoid the things it finds it wants to avoid. Positing a little person in our minds that is capable of making those kinds of calls doesn't explain how persons work: big or little.

&gt; The problem I continue to have here is I feel like if this were any other thing, you'd be fine saying that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it's a duck. I feel like if things are functionally similar, that's good evidence (though not proof) that they perform similar processes. That is, if they closely resemble each other in outputs based on inputs, that to me suggests that, under the hood, they are doing something similar as well.

This might be a difference in attitude, perhaps. I am taking a skeptical position here, rather than the position of pragmatic common-sense. I think if we examine a standard case we've avoid up to this point, maybe we can minimize the impact of our individual attitude. Just consider the case of a liar. A liar, if they are any good, has the capacity to exhibit one kind of external behavior while entertaining incongruent inner states. Their external behavior indicates X, but their internal state indicates Y.

If we strip away the contingent facts about human liars, this seems like a formal way to describe when calling a duck a duck turns out to be wrong. If an external state X can be brought about from either the expected internal operation X^i or an unexpected internal operation Y, then the inference between X and X^i isn't necessary.

&gt; It's not that different. In order to tell a dog something, you have to unpack things as well. Not to mention the fact that we're working on things to solve this problem anyway (see: Siri, or a number of other programs like her). Just because you have to change your language to accommodate your audience doesn't seem to indicate that they do things fundamentally different from us.

I don't unpack anything for dogs; explaining something to a dog in rigorously analyzed terms isn't going to get me anywhere. What dogs respond to are signs, like pitch shifts or gestures. Some of these signs are merely associative, like the sound of your keys in the door and the expectation of eating. Some of these signs have content, though. Dogs can understand gestures like pointing without being told what to do; when we point they just pay attention. Very smart dogs actually understand simple concepts like being a particular object; I saw an episode of Nova about a dog that could retrieve objects based on names.

We are working to make machines more intuitive for human use. Part of that involves the emulating this kind of sign usage. It's pretty clear that things like Siri aren't on our level, though. They require explicit signals in order to carry out explicit processes. If these machines had the same creative capacities that animals like dogs or people have, then it could just use language like we do. They don't though, hence the incentive to copy human behavior.

&gt;I'm not certain what the real difference is between telling a colorblind person about red, and actively taking part in shaping a neural net towards that goal. These seem like the same task on a fundamental level, just, again, you change your language to accommodate your audience.

Let's test this then. Explain to me what the color 'red' is like just like you'd shape a neural net. If they are the same, then this should be possible at least in a formal sense.

&gt; Maybe this wasn't your goal with bringing up logical atomism, but the conclusion I drew was that language is never interpreted as the bare words being said. In order to account for this, I basically took on the belief that a sentence's meaning very much depends on the environment in which it is placed.

You do me proud kid. That's exactly what that means. The position you're taking is actually one of the more popular one's in contemporary philosophy to boot. There's two ways to approach this: through tropes and through acts. The trope theory of sentence meaning states that a sentence gets its meaning through resemblance to a proposition. Propositions are formal entities that encode the meaning of sentences apart from particular utterances. The act theory of sentence meaning states that a sentence gets its meaning through the conditions under which it's uttered. According to this, the act of speaking itself fills in the necessary details using things like speaker's intentions, context, and so on.

They are both pretty popular and both at least partly right, IMO. I don't think I can dissuade you from your position here because I don't think you're even wrong.

&gt; Well, to start, I entered this discussion not with the goal of persuading you to any specific stance, just away from your current one (i.e. to ""change your view""). Regardless, are you asking me to give how I think the brain works as a whole (something that, while I've attempted to do so in part in many places during this discussion, I don't feel I'm actually up to the task of)? Or are you asking me to put forward what I'd need to be true about the brain for my position to hold? Or something else entirely? I'll try to abide once I understand.

I guess this whole sub-topic started out as me trying to do parts of your job for you. I am very open to changing my mind, but I have some beliefs coming into this. I would like to have my mind changed, insofar as I can do justice to those beliefs. If someone put forward a convincing thesis that addressed these previous beliefs, then I could change my mind in good conscience.

I've been trying to shape you position into something more cogent in order to meet this requirement. However, if you simply don't hold enough positive beliefs on this topic to assemble a thesis, then I am demanding the impossible from you. I don't want you to have to conjure a position out of thin air in order to accommodate some pedantic exercise.

You've done a good job of explaining your position and even stepping outside your comfort zone to answer my questions, so you don't think you need to rehash the first question. The second question interests me a lot, but you might not have to much to say. If you have a third proposal, I'd be happy to hear that too.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-22 21:09:42 :

&gt; &gt; I think you are though. You've put yourself (or they've put you) in the position of teacher. That carries some authority. Not the law making kind, but the teaching kind. The kind of authority where the students expect they can trust what you say as true, unless you say otherwise. This is authority that random people in their lives don't have.
It's very different from the other side. I don't see myself as an authority figure, but I'm also not typical 9-5 school teacher. Whatever respect I get or expect comes from being an adult as opposed to being a high school kid. A good parallel to what I'm talking about might be one of your TAs. TAs are usually 20-ish-something students just like you. They are more knowledgeable than you, but they don't tell you what to do.

&gt; Regardless of whether or not we leave bits unanalyzed, if our model, designed based on the structure, displays behavior similar to the original structure, I believe it's safe to assume our model isn't leaving anything crucial out... The important part of this is that the structure wasn't designed to mimic behavior of the original, but to mimic the design of the original.

This seems to be a substantial point of disagreement for us. You'd say that artificial neural nets and biological neural nets are not only similar, but one in the same kind of system. I, of course, must grant that artificial NN are inspired by NN in nature, but I'd say that the artificial NN aren't the exactly the same as biological NN.

This, I presume, is the source of disagreement. You think there isn't a difference in inference between Artificial NN=given mental activity and Biological NN=given mental activity, since they are both true in virtue of the more general statement, NN=given mental activity. In this scenario, the type of event is known to be the same in both cases, so evidence for behavior of biological NN can tells us about other instances of the same type, namely artificial NN.

In contrast, I don't begin by classing artificial NN and biological NN in the same type. So, BNN=given mental event doesn't imply ANN=given mental event, since they don't share a known common form in virtue of their type. It might be proven that ANN and BNN are of the same relevant type, but we need to discover this fact. In order to discover this fact, we need to examine what type we think can serve as a link between the two and as an account for the character of mental events.

Just to give a very brief justification for my position, ANN come in all kinds of varieties that are better or worse at performing certain tasks. BNN come in only one typical form that we know of, namely the form we Earth-bound animals use. There is no reason to think that every type of ANN is equivalent to our BNN. Therefore, we need to examine which types of ANN are more or similar to BNN and justify why that kind of similarity is the relevant kind.

&gt; My statement? Or the situation? How so?

Both; there is a single definition of reason that embraces all cases of the use of the word and provides rigorous terms for use in formal systems.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what this means, but from my understanding: I'd not say I'm against reducing it, I just stated this response (""My goal with the use..."") to hopefully become clearer in my meaning.

I think I understood what you meant. I was just pointing out that what you meant isn't in conflict with my analysis. Something can be both a 'reasonable doubt' reason and a 'reason within sound deduction' reason. It also behooves us to analyze complicated cases into simpler components when possible.
&gt; Really? This is news to me. Anything I should look up to read more on this?

Computer-assisted proofs might be a good place to start. They might be partly deductive in the end, but it isn't obviously so. Number theory might also be a good place to start, with topics like transcendental numbers or hyper-real numbers. There is some deduction involved, but the results are famously bound by the Incompleteness Theorem. Finally, you might search for para-consistent works in logic. Para-consistent systems allow for contradictions, so what is meant be deduction there is bound to be different from what we typically have in mind.

&gt; I have not.

He is the first modern European figure to introduce the idea of Idealism as a response to many of the issues we've been discussing. The long and short of the proposal is that empirical science only needs to explain the world as it appears. This is because world beyond observation is inherently less real than the world as observed. I don't think he's right, but it is a very influential idea throughout the last 250+ years. It also seems like a reasonable conclusion based on the view that science is only concerned with the observable and can assume that all that exists is observable.

&gt;Would they exhibit it because they're solipsists? Or just in parallel with being solipsists? I certainly think it's possible for someone to be (reasonably) sane and be a solipsist.

Sure! I need to grant that. The DSM schedules Narcissistic personality types and de-personalized/de-realized personality disorders as serious pathologies often caused by traumatic events. Those people have problems and those problems also cause the solipsism. However, solipsism is also a philosophical position. The philosophical position may or may not hold weight, but it supports similar behavior.

If we are comparing beliefs across people though, I think it makes sense to compare people to people rather than best position to best position. And, in the case between some person with severe mental illness and ourselves, we probably win. It's a small victory, but it shows that we aren't all literally in the same boat as far as the rationality of our chosen axioms goes.

&gt; These are on different axes though. Your students are in the ""training"" stage, but the neural net, in where it doesn't have choice, is in the ""setting goals"" stage. Once it's also in the training stage, it does have choice, I'd imagine: What if it was given 2 different images and told they mean the same thing? Which aspects does it prioritize from one or the other? Well, whichever one gets it closer to the answer, but that's only because, as we established, it didn't have a choice in the ""setting goals"" stage. Even better, what does it do if given the same image, but told it means 2 different things? Which does it chose? The answer to either likely depends on the initial conditions: if you started off the connections with random weights, you'd get different results in the end. I think this is what you're calling ""choice"".

I thought this was really informative; I just wanted to throw that out there because we spend so much time disagreeing.

I'm not sure if I just mean variability when I say choice. That might be my one criticism. Given two indeterminate choices, there is bound to be variability. We must either be able to make an arbitrary choice, make a choice relative to internal metrics, or remain unable to act. The last option is a special deviant case, so that leaves us with the first two. Either one allows for individual variability. 

However, taking an indeterminate case and paraphrasing it into a determinate case for convenience sake can also introduce variability. The variability here comes from the variety of posited determinate systems that are possible. The only constraint is that the posited rule determine either choice A or choice B. This kind of behavior seems less like brute choice to me, in the sense that the decisions is determinate. However, it involves a creative choice in the form of rule-making.

I'd like to think about this point for a bit longer, though. I'll rehash all of this after you reply and I have time to sort it all out. Good stuff!

&gt; We define gravity only by it's effects in the world. Experiences are defined by outer behaviors just like gravity, but it is also defined by intuitive inner states.

I'm not sure if this is a semantic or actual criticism, but would it be wrong to say that we're defining experience by its affect ont he world as well? After all, you are part of the world, so things that affect you (inner states) are affecting the world, right? All it should take is someone exploiting the laws of nature to build a tool that allows us to measure that affect on you.

&gt; I think it's pretty common-sensical to distinguish between lower and higher animals here.

I'm pretty sure I addressed this:

&gt; (NB: not the *complexity* of a mental life but simply *having* one, seems to be a rather binary thing)

I believe my point was you said that neural nets do not have mental lives, and I said they do, just like animals. This note was to say ""yes, maybe not as complex as animals, but the are not fundamentally different."" A chimp may be more capable than a worm, but it's mental life, to my mind, is not fundamentally different, just more complex.

&gt; I guess I need to start apologizing to the Roomba when I step on it.

Actually no, because the Roomba won't gain anything from your apology. We don't apologize for the sake of apology, we do it because it affects others. I get that this was meant to be a jab, but you have to admit, stepping on the Roomba isn't a good thing.

&gt; Relevant to your scenario, you explain our urge to avoid pain by defining pain as the thing that we are prone to avoid. You are defining 'Pain' as either just is the things we happen to avoid, or as something that has an intrinsic quality that makes us avoid it.

Hmm. Let me try to give an explanation, and you can tell me if I've gotten stuck on this stumbling block still. Pain is a response to the things we should avoid. We feel it because we've been bred to have an instinctual desire to protect ourselves from harm, and pain serves as the disincentive to performing actions that may put ourselves or (because we're social animals, and the tribes wellbeing is closely related to our own) our loved ones at risk.

&gt; Positing a little person in our minds that is capable of making those kinds of calls doesn't explain how persons work: big or little.

I didn't mean to posit that the brain was making decisions. Instead, I meant to posit that it is wired to do these things on virtue of it being developed from human DNA. This is closely related to instinct. Instinct is generally preprogrammed behavior present in a brain before it has a chance to learn it. This is like instinct, but instead of outward behavior, it's internal brain behavior. Calling it instinct isn't wrong, per se, but it's just not an outwardly expressed behavior like how a foal can walk, or how ducklings follow their mother.

&gt; If an external state X can be brought about from either the expected internal operation Xi or an unexpected internal operation Y, then the inference between X and X^i isn't necessary.

I'm not certain this is how lying works. We know there are certain behaviors people exhibit when lying, vs when telling the truth. If X could be achieved by actually having the internal state X^i, or by Y, you could never catch a good liar. I'm not sure if I'm reading something that wasn't there, but I assumed Y was the contradictory position to X^i, when it really should be the position ""I'm going to lie about X^i"". Which elicits it's own responses in the form of behavior people exhibit when lying.

&gt; I don't unpack anything for dogs; explaining something to a dog in rigorously analyzed terms isn't going to get me anywhere.

Maybe I misunderstood ""unpack"" then. Obviously this is the case, but translating what you want to say into a series of signs (to be understood by your target audience) is what I thought you meant by unpack.

&gt; They require explicit signals in order to carry out explicit processes.

I think this is more a consequence of their hardware limitations. Siri doesn't need to be able to learn how to brew coffee, because even if she knew how, she wouldn't have the capability to do so.

On the other hand, something like [Baxter](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/) doesn't use ""explicit signals"" or ""explicit processes"". He can learn how to do a task by watching someone. There are still limitations, so are there when communicating with a dog.

&gt; Let's test this then. Explain to me what the color 'red' is like just like you'd shape a neural net. If they are the same, then this should be possible at least in a formal sense.

Well, to start, I don't know how I'd explain the color red to a colorblind person. But training a neural net to learn red would involve me handing it samples of things that are red (of various shades, probably), and telling it those things are red, and then handing it things that are not red, and telling it they are not red.

&gt; They are both pretty popular and both at least partly right, IMO. I don't think I can dissuade you from your position here because I don't think you're even wrong.

Cool. I don't know what to add to this. I can't say which of those I think holds more truth, though, because this:

&gt; Propositions are formal entities that encode the meaning of sentences apart from particular utterances.

Confused me.

&gt; The second question interests me a lot, but you might not have to much to say.

Well, best I can probably say on this is that, in order for my position to hold, there needs to not be some unobservable quality to how the brain works. Though, on the other hand, there is an as yet unobservable quality governing the results of quantum stuff, but I'd hesitate to say we don't understand those. I feel like I've said this before, so I don't think we're covering any new ground.

&gt; You'd say that artificial neural nets and biological neural nets are not only similar, but one in the same kind of system.

Not exactly one in the same (this is easily shown by one being hardware, one being software), but enough of the same to not actually matter, yes.

&gt; It might be proven that ANN and BNN are of the same relevant type, but we need to discover this fact.

Isn't the point of building a model that we don't need to ""discover"" that it's similar to the original, but that it was designed to be similar to the original?

&gt; BNN come in only one typical form that we know of, namely the form we Earth-bound animals use.

This seems like a mischaracterisation. To say that this is ""one typical form"", but ANN's aren't because they're better or worse at performing certain tasks seems demonstrably false. For example, your brain is not as good at flying as a birds, or, for a less absurd example, not as good at quadrupedal running as a horse.

&gt; Both; there is a single definition of reason that embraces all cases of the use of the word and provides rigorous terms for use in formal systems.

Ok. I'm not really sure what to say to this. Where are you planning on going with it?

&gt; Computer-assisted proofs might be a good place to start. They might be partly deductive in the end, but it isn't obviously so.

No, I think these are fully deductive. Just because an example is hard to find doesn't change that it's deductive. And proof by exhaustion is still deductive.

&gt; This is because world beyond observation is inherently less real than the world as observed.

Yes, I'd say I agree with this. My reasoning is, to paraphrase a quote from some guy on the internet, if it can't be observed, by definition, it can't affect anything (on account of if it could, then we could measure that effect).

&gt; It's a small victory, but it shows that we aren't all literally in the same boat as far as the rationality of our chosen axioms goes.

Sure, I don't think I have any real argument on this.

&gt; We must either be able to make an arbitrary choice, make a choice relative to internal metrics, or remain unable to act.

For no other reason than to establish my view on the subject, I'd like to say that I'd pick the second option.

&gt; I'd like to think about this point for a bit longer, though. I'll rehash all of this after you reply and I have time to sort it all out. Good stuff!

Cool. I'm not sure if you expected me to respond to this, specifically. But I didn't really have much to say on it.

&gt; would it be wrong to say that we're defining experience by its affect ont he world as well? After all, you are part of the world, so things that affect you (inner states) are affecting the world, right? All it should take is someone exploiting the laws of nature to build a tool that allows us to measure that affect on you.

I think you are focusing too much on inner being opposed to outer. I promise I'm not trying to push anything through by definition. I'm just highlighting a crucial difference between something like gravity and our personal experience. We don't have a pre-cognitive intuition about gravity: we aren't aware of it before we are aware of gravitational behavior. We do have a pre-cognitive intuition about experience: we are aware of the phenomena by behavior we observe and even before we make a distinct observation.

&gt; I believe my point was you said that neural nets do not have mental lives, and I said they do, just like animals. This note was to say ""yes, maybe not as complex as animals, but the are not fundamentally different."" A chimp may be more capable than a worm, but it's mental life, to my mind, is not fundamentally different, just more complex.

Saying that it's the same thing just more/less complex seems like a misnomer to me. Part of what we are describing in conscious experience depends directly on complexity. Mental lives are defined in terms of the features that can be consciously represented. If something lacks the complexity to produce a given feature, that aspect of mental life isn't recoverable.

It isn't clear what features neural nets run over, but it's clearly different from the features animals typical run over. After all simple tasks for neural nets are often staggeringly difficult for animals and vice versa. If we were using the same features, then one wouldn't expect this kind of divergence for simple problems.

&gt; Actually no, because the Roomba won't gain anything from your apology. We don't apologize for the sake of apology, we do it because it affects others.

Just wait til you get married. Then you'll realize that you're supposed to apologize even when it won't help.

In all seriousness, I usually apologize out of a sense of personal guilt, even if said apology falls on deaf ears. I think the most important thing about apologizing is forming habitual deference to the rights of others. If the Room is truly pained, then I should apologize to it just as I would to any small animal.

&gt; Pain is a response to the things we should avoid. 

What kind of should is this? If it is a hypothetical should, (if you want x, then you should y), then I think you're missing half the picture. 'If you want to avoid pain/unpleasantness/discomfort, then you should avoid these things' is good advice but doesn't say what pain is. Furthermore, the thing doing the wanting here is our mind, so it seems like this is another homunculus model, (e.i. explaining mental features with a tiny idealized person.)

&gt; We feel it because we've been bred to have an instinctual desire to protect ourselves from harm, and pain serves as the disincentive to performing actions that may put ourselves...

You keep appealing to evolutionary explanations. I don't really see where it's getting you. In order for natural selection to go to work, there need to be features within a population to work on. For example, rocks in a stream bed are all smooth because of the constant subtle forces at work on the rocks over many years. The selection pressures explain the shape and texture, but they don't explain why the rock have shape and texture in general. The selective pressures tell the causal-historic picture, but they don't explicitly describe the genesis of the scene.

&gt; I meant to posit that it is wired to do these things on virtue of it being developed from human DNA. This is closely related to instinct. Instinct is generally preprogrammed behavior present in a brain before it has a chance to learn it...

I think this is a questionable take on animal instinct. I don't think any animal comes with explicit pre-programming on how to do specific actions. That would be incredible coast inefficient given the number of potential circumstances we are born into and the number of crtical failures possible given a complicated operation.

It might be the case that we are born with inherent physical limitations due to the body we find ourselves in. Certain sub-systems in our bodies a linked in automatic causal chains, (automatic reflex) and all sub-systems are limited in their degrees of freedom by their relation to other systems, (constraints of anatomy). This limits the number of possible actions and weights subsequent actions along a gradient.

In neural net terms, instinct isn't set at the 'goal setting' phase here. Instinct isn't an effective set of procedures or optima baked in from go. Rather, instinct is set at the 'training' phase. It is a process of calibrating innate physiology to train on features.

&gt; I'm not certain this is how lying works... it really should be the position ""I'm going to lie about Xi"". Which elicits it's own responses in the form of behavior people exhibit when lying.

Right, this is explicitly an idealized process. I said just as much in the like second line of my response. Human liars are clearly not perfect liars. There are very good liars, though. These people can beat polygraph and whatnot. I common trick I hear is actually not to do what you're suggesting. If you want to lie, you think about the lie being true rather than the actual case being false. I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but the ideal lying procedure here is to act as if X is the case in the face of not-X. This seems possible for humans in some form.

&gt; Maybe I misunderstood ""unpack"" then. Obviously this is the case, but translating what you want to say into a series of signs (to be understood by your target audience) is what I thought you meant by unpack.

That's right, expect I'd do away with the spongy business of what we meant to say. I'd say unpacking is translating from native signs to contrived signs. When two people share a language, no unpacking is required.

&gt; Well, to start, I don't know how I'd explain the color red to a colorblind person. But training a neural net to learn red would involve me handing it samples of things that are red (of various shades, probably), and telling it those things are red, and then handing it things that are not red, and telling it they are not red.

Let's just focus on red-green colorblindness perhaps. If you what to distinguish between red and green, would you train it to recognize red in the way you described and then repeat the procedure for green?

&gt; this...
Confused me.

There are lots of ways to say basically the same thing. That same thing, according to.some people, is a proposition. Propositions aren't identical with any sentence; they are identical with some state of affairs sentences are meant to represent. In the sentence, 'Apples are red', evokes the proposition where the contents of the sentence, Apples and being red, are expressed as true in the world. It's a platonic theory of meaning.

&gt; Isn't the point of building a model that we don't need to ""discover"" that it's similar to the original, but that it was designed to be similar to the original?

Sure, but things are just models of other things for no reason. What makes something a model of something else is something we can explore in depth. Where ANN are accurate models for BNN is a valid question, even if ANN were inspired by BNN. Birds inspired aircraft, but airplanes aren't good models for birds.

&gt; This seems like a mischaracterisation. To say that this is ""one typical form"", but ANN's aren't because they're better or worse at performing certain tasks seems demonstrably false. For example, your brain is not as good at flying as a birds, or, for a less absurd example, not as good at quadrupedal running as a horse.

I wasn't justifying my claim with an inference from behavior. You are right: that would be a bad argument. I'm saying ANN come in more procedurelal varieties. ANN are often forward feed systems, while BNN are cyclic. ANN often appeal to simple error correction algorithms while there is no know mechanism for simple error correction in BNN. ANN can be brought in line with these listed diffetences, but it shows that our choice of ANN-type is relevant. Therefore, the exact similarities and differences need to be made explicit.

&gt; Ok. I'm not really sure what to say to this. Where are you planning on going with it?

My claim is that scientific models are just mathematical models that take more restrictive axioms. It's relevant to the claim that science works on a separate logic. Why did you want to claim that science has its own rules of inference?

&gt; No, I think these are fully deductive.

Clearly, this argument isn't deductive: 
1. I built a machine
2. The machine told me X.
C. X is true.

Isn't a deductive argument. It might be deductive when we outline what the machine did step-by-step, (barring stochastic and non-deterministic methods), but that isn't necessary for us to have knowledge in this case.

&gt; Yes, I'd say I agree with this. My reasoning is, to paraphrase a quote from some guy on the internet, if it can't be observed, by definition, it can't affect anything (on account of if it could, then we could measure that effect).

It seems like the simplest explanation that accounts for everything you can measure is the existence of just the data points you happen to measure. Positing continuous existence past the point of measurement is to posit things that aren't included in measurements. Therefore, this view implies that the external world can be eliminated by Occam's razor. The existence of an external world doesn't posit non-redundant explanatory features that set it apart from other observational models.

awenonian @ 2017-01-25 02:21:22 :

&gt; We do have a pre-cognitive intuition about experience: we are aware of the phenomena by behavior we observe and even before we make a distinct observation.

Only because it's our medium of observation. Just because you're looking through a lens doesn't mean that the lens is fundamentally different from the world around it.

&gt; If we were using the same features, then one wouldn't expect this kind of divergence for simple problems.

How much of this is the neural net itself, and how much is what it's wired to? Obviously something that learns to operate limbs and bodily functions is going to behave differently that one that categorizes images.

&gt; If the Room is truly pained, then I should apologize to it just as I would to any small animal.

All cards on the table, I probably would apologize to a Roomba that I stepped on just as much (relative to the damage done) as I would to a small animal.

&gt; If you want to avoid pain/unpleasantness/discomfort, then you should avoid these things' is good advice but doesn't say what pain is.

If you want to survive, you should avoid these things.

&gt; Furthermore, the thing doing the wanting here is our mind, so it seems like this is another homunculus model, (e.i. explaining mental features with a tiny idealized person.)

Want is metaphorical in this sense. There is no thing doing the wanting, it's just a convenient word to get my point across. More on that here:

&gt; You keep appealing to evolutionary explanations. I don't really see where it's getting you.

My point is to show that the differences in behaviors between us a neural nets are not so simple as us being different things. We've had 2 significant influences on our development that neural nets lack, simply because they aren't (and haven't been) in operation as long. These are 1, our lives (for obvious reasons; having constant input for years and years is something neural nets lack), and 2, our ancestry. We've evolved to be plastic to our environment, and the brain doesn't develop as a blank slate because of it, it develops somewhat formed. What guides it's development in this stage (the fetal development stage) is mostly DNA, which means it depends on how we evolved. Neural nets also do not receive this pre-setting. This relates to the above point, because it shows where the ""wanting"" came from. It didn't happen because anything actually wanted anything, just because those that survived best be came a larger representation of the gene pool, and their traits give rise to the behaviors of, for instance, experiencing pain during events detrimental to survival.

&gt; The selection pressures explain the shape and texture, but they don't explain why the rock have shape and texture in general.

I feel like this is more of a problem for you than for me. In my view, thoughts and whatnot are just emergent behavior of more complex brains. The selection pressures built up simple brains into more complex ones. In your view, somewhere along the way ideas had to be put into the mix as a new feature.

&gt; I don't think any animal comes with explicit pre-programming on how to do specific actions.

Foals can start walking within hours of being born. How does it learn that quickly if not for pre-programming? What makes a duckling imprint on something besides pre-programming?

&gt; Right, this is explicitly an idealized process. I said just as much in the like second line of my response. Human liars are clearly not perfect liars. There are very good liars, though.

Without reality matching this idealized process, your argument doesn't seem to hold. Unless X^i and Y can both lead to behavior X, and not just to very similar behaviors, what you said doesn't hold.

&gt; If you what to distinguish between red and green, would you train it to recognize red in the way you described and then repeat the procedure for green?

In short, yes. In long, it depends on what the use case is. If all this net needs to do is differentiate between green and red, thenI wouldn't need to say ""these are not red"" I'd just say ""these are red, these are green"". If it needs to be able to differentiate between green, red and neither, then yes, I'd do this. With the note that it wouldn't be ""show what red is, show what red isn't, show what green is, show what green isn't"" explicitly in that order. Examples of each (red, green, not-red, not-green) would be shuffled.

&gt; In the sentence, 'Apples are red', evokes the proposition where the contents of the sentence, Apples and being red, are expressed as true in the world. It's a platonic theory of meaning.

Alright thanks. I think I'd stick more on the other side then, but I can understand this one's merit.

&gt; Where ANN are accurate models for BNN is a valid question, even if ANN were inspired by BNN. Birds inspired aircraft, but airplanes aren't good models for birds.

Fair enough.

&gt; Why did you want to claim that science has its own rules of inference?

Just to differentiate physical sciences from hard logical systems. There are no certainties in science, but there are in systems like math. It is certain, with 0 (not close to 0) doubt, that multiplication is commutative. It's only really well supported that gravitational acceleration at sea level is 9.81 whatever m/s^2. 

As you've said, this isn't fully true in math, not all things are simply true or false. But some things are proven, whereas in science, nothing is proven in the strict sense of the word.

&gt; Clearly, this argument isn't deductive: 1. I built a machine 2. The machine told me X. C. X is true.

It's as deductive as any argument that relies on calculation. You could place this into any proof where any form of calculator was used.

I'd hope the machine doesn't just spit out a true or false and no one error checks it.

&gt; It might be deductive when we outline what the machine did step-by-step,

Which we do by virtue of programming it.

&gt; It seems like the simplest explanation that accounts for everything you can measure is the existence of just the data points you happen to measure.

I think you're using an overly strict definition of measure. I'm ""measuring"" various things about various things by looking at them. By touching them, by tasting them, by blah blah blah. Even if the only thing that exists are the data points I happen to measure, that's a lot of existence. Further, assuming that things cease to exist when not measured is not less assumptions than assuming they persist after being measured.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-25 17:56:03 :

&gt; Only because it's our medium of observation. Just because you're looking through a lens doesn't mean that the lens is fundamentally different from the world around it.

This explanation works fine in cases where we can bracket questions about the nature of the observer and save them for later. Here, we are talking about how exactly observers work in the first place. Saying, 'Observation takes place through the body', is accurate but doesn't mean the same thing as, 'Observation takes place with the aid of a telescope.' Our body is playing the double role of observer and medium, giving rise to the epistemic problems of self-consciousness. The Hard problem is a sub-case which emphasized the difficulties of squaring our self-aware status as medium with our other-aware status as observer.

&gt; How much of this is the neural net itself, and how much is what it's wired to? Obviously something that learns to operate limbs and bodily functions is going to behave differently that one that categorizes images.

Our neural nets aren't just wired to our body. Arguably, our entire body is our neural net. The brain might be the most complicated component in the system, but our entire body is constantly transferring, collecting, and regulating information. The fact that a given neural net lacks this modality of being (being embodied) seems like a substantial difference.

&gt; If you want to survive, you should avoid these things.

I think the correct translation is, ""If the entire species collectively 'wants' to survive, then the species as a whole should increase the probability that individual members avoid certain actions on aggregate or individually"". It seems like we've stopped talking about individual experience at some point.

&gt; Want is metaphorical in this sense. There is no thing doing the wanting, it's just a convenient word to get my point across.

I think it's a very common analogy, but ultimately an extremely misleading one. If nothing in reality corresponds to an axial concept in your explanation, then you aren't telling it like it is; You're telling a just-so story. You are inferring a metaphorical want in light of the end results of a process. However, predictive explanations must reason from cause to effect rather than effect to cause.

&gt; We've evolved to be plastic to our environment, and the brain doesn't develop as a blank slate because of it, it develops somewhat formed. What guides it's development in this stage (the fetal development stage) is mostly DNA, which means it depends on how we evolved. Neural nets also do not receive this pre-setting. 

I would describe these inborn tendencies as pre-weights for the probability of certain behavior. From what little I know about neural nets, setting intial weights to fall with a certain window of intitial error seems like a similar concept. We aren't truly blank slates, but neither are ANN. We can create ANN with fine-tuned in-born biases that will being reflected in the machines later complex behaviors.

&gt; This relates to the above point, because it shows where the ""wanting"" came from. It didn't happen because anything actually wanted anything, just because those that survived best be came a larger representation of the gene pool, and their traits give rise to the behaviors of, for instance, experiencing pain during events detrimental to survival.

It seems like your are over-fitting here. Natural selection is an important mechanism for understanding some complex animal behavior, but there might not be a selection pressure to explain every complex animal behavior. Some behaviors are totally novel and best explained as the product of an individual, (art, music, so on). Some behaviors are clearly in response to local environmental pressures (particular foraging habits, particular cicadian rhythms, so on). Some are even accidents that don't have an effect either way on survival but happened to survive (spandrels).

The point is that the side spread nature of pain need not indicate that there was an evolutionary pressure that explains this fact. There are other explainations that can account for it being a wide-spread phenomena, or it could just be a ride-along feature that accompanies other selected traits.

&gt; I feel like this is more of a problem for you than for me. In my view, thoughts and whatnot are just emergent behavior of more complex brains. The selection pressures built up simple brains into more complex ones. In your view, somewhere along the way ideas had to be put into the mix as a new feature.

You can say that you explain them as just whatever you like. To date, I haven't seen any account from you about how this emergence takes place or what it might entail about the mind or the brain. You admit to this much whenever you avoid taking any actual position on the issue. 

As for it being a problem for me, I'd say that I can always appeal to ur-ideas being there from go, because I'm not a materialist. I'm fine with ideas being like rocks in a stream, because I think they are natural objects in their own right apart from any individual thinker. 

&gt; Foals can start walking within hours of being born. How does it learn that quickly if not for pre-programming? What makes a duckling imprint on something besides pre-programming?

I'm going to start with the duck because I think it is more intuitive. The duck is born; it fixes in on a feature; it then exhibits a certain range of behaviors. These are our common facts. My supposition is that this is explicable in terms of reflex (automatic anatomical systems) and motility alone.

What happens to duck is essentially the result of feature training. It develops deep associative links between a bunch of engrained behaviors that results in concept production. The duck doesn't come pre-programmed with the directive 'Love Mother'. It learns attatchment to some object and of some object simultaneously. You might say that this doesn't imply that engrained behaviors aren't innate. However, my reply would be that engrained behaviors are best explain from embodied associations.

Switching to the horse for my example, the horse is born with muscles. These muscles are all connected and firing some muscles makes other movements more likely. Some initial actions are automatic reflexes, but others are arbitrary twitches and kicks. Over time, a mutually re-enforcing set of procedures is developed and locomotion is possible. In horse's, this process is very quick, but it isn't automatic. Learning to run quickly isn't heretible at least, because many different lineages of animals have come to express the trait at different times in evolutionary history, (see gazelle, giraffes, and cows). 

&gt; Without reality matching this idealized process, your argument doesn't seem to hold. Unless Xi and Y can both lead to behavior X, and not just to very similar behaviors, what you said doesn't hold.

Woah there bro; who says this process doesn't hold. I come home from work after a bad day. My wife asks me, ""How's your day?"". I lie and say, ""Good!"". This is a case of me saying G when I think not-X. Both G and not-G turn out to be potential occasions to assert G. What's crazy about this?

&gt; In short, yes. In long, it depends on what the use case is. If all this net needs to do is differentiate between green and red, thenI wouldn't need to say ""these are not red"" I'd just say ""these are red, these are green"". 

I think this case will match what we need to say. Let's say we train the colorblind guy to pick out red and green though he doesn't know what he's looking for and we train the neural net to pick out red and green though it doesn't know what it's looking for. At the end, let's say that we quiz them on the samples shown and they both have perfect recall. 

If we showed the neural net and the coloblind guy a new sample of unknown color, what is the likelihood of either one getting the correct answer? If we asked both to define what red is apart from previous samples, what is the likelihood of either one having any answer.

&gt; There are no certainties in science, but there are in systems like math. It is certain, with 0 (not close to 0) doubt, that multiplication is commutative. It's only really well supported that gravitational acceleration at sea level is 9.81 whatever m/s2.

I'd say neither is certain apart from its role within a wider context and that both are certain within the context of their respective fields of study. 

P.S. Some kind of products aren't communitive, I think. It's a vague recollection.

&gt; It's as deductive as any argument that relies on calculation. You could place this into any proof where any form of calculator was used.
I'd hope the machine doesn't just spit out a true or false and no one error checks it.

I think some techniques in computation aren't feasibly checked by hand. For a down to earth example, it isn't important for me to check the product of two 7 digit numbers by hand after I use a calculator. I also don't know how calculators work, so I can't say I have an implicit understanding of the process. However, I use a calculator to learn things. I'd hesitate to say I'm using deductive method to come to knowledge.

&gt;  think you're using an overly strict definition of measure. I'm ""measuring"" various things about various things by looking at them. By touching them, by tasting them, by blah blah blah

What are the units?

&gt; Further, assuming that things cease to exist when not measured is not less assumptions than assuming they persist after being measured.

You are assuming that objects must be created in order to explain their presence or destroyed in order to explain their apparent cessation. It could be that our data points are eternal and that they only seem to come into and pass out of existeonce. In fact, given that the universe is only observed to exist, there is no reason to posit that things could not exist.

awenonian @ 2017-01-25 20:01:01 :

&gt; Saying, 'Observation takes place through the body', is accurate but doesn't mean the same thing as, 'Observation takes place with the aid of a telescope.'

I'm not sure I really see a difference. I could say ""Observation takes place through a telescope"" or ""observation takes place with the aid of the body"". If I can switch the wording around, and it still is correct, what difference is there?

&gt; Arguably, our entire body is our neural net.

Not really. Certainly you have input neurons all over your body in the form of nerve endings, and whatever nerves connect to your eyes, and tongue, and whatnot. But your entire body is not a neural net. Your muscles are nothing more than fibres that contract under electricity. They are wired to something analogous to output neurons that trigger their motion.

The point is, our bodies are a different arrangement of input and output neurons, but they are not fundamentally different from input and output neurons.

&gt; The fact that a given neural net lacks this modality of being (being embodied) seems like a substantial difference.

Not to me. A neural net is embodied in the OS it's running under. It's just a different body.

&gt; I think the correct translation is, ""If the entire species collectively 'wants' to survive, then the species as a whole should increase the probability that individual members avoid certain actions on aggregate or individually"".

Species are made up of individuals. Changing this from an individual to a species perspective isn't really necessary.

&gt; It seems like we've stopped talking about individual experience at some point.

I think you took it off that.

&gt; You are inferring a metaphorical want in light of the end results of a process.

I don't see what's wrong with this. When you want, you want an end result. A process that makes progress towards an end result can be personified as ""wanting"" that end result. I'm not inferring, I'm describing.

&gt; I would describe these inborn tendencies as pre-weights for the probability of certain behavior.

Yes, sorry if I was unclear. I didn't mean neural nets do not get pre-weighing. They do, they must start with a set of weights. What I meant to say was they don't get *our* pre-weighing.

&gt; Some behaviors are totally novel and best explained as the product of an individual, (art, music, so on).

Yes, but pain isn't an individual phenomenon.

&gt; Some behaviors are clearly in response to local environmental pressures (particular foraging habits, particular cicadian rhythms, so on). 

Yes, but pain isn't a local phenomenon.

&gt; Some are even accidents that don't have an effect either way on survival but happened to survive (spandrels).

Yes, but pain clearly does have an effect on survival. Like your instinctual reaction to remove your hand from a burning stove.

Pain has all the trappings of something developed from selective pressure. I'd argue most emotions do. They clearly don't meet the first two points, and it doesn't take much to figure out how they don't meet the third.

&gt; To date, I haven't seen any account from you about how this emergence takes place or what it might entail about the mind or the brain.

Is ""ideas are what happens when neurons do their thing"" not at least an attempted explanation of their emergence?

&gt; You admit to this much whenever you avoid taking any actual position on the issue.

Yes, I'm sorry I keep doing that. I'm probably reading this onto you, but I feel like you expect a full explanation for how all the bits of the brain work, which I clearly don't know. I'm not sure what level of explanation you want for me to actually take a position, if that makes any sense.

&gt; because I think they are natural objects in their own right apart from any individual thinker.

This doesn't explain how they got attached to brains though.

&gt; My supposition is that this is explicable in terms of reflex (automatic anatomical systems)

What's the difference between reflex and pre-programming?

&gt; In horse's, this process is very quick, but it isn't automatic.

Fine. I'm not out of examples though: Breathing, blinking, crying, holding one's breath under water. Human babies (at least, probably other babies as well, but I wouldn't know) do all these from the word go.

&gt; I lie and say, ""Good!"".

This is the idealized process. In reality, there's definitely a difference in how you say ""good"" if your day was good or not. ""assert G"" is not the same as ""exhibit behavior G""

&gt; If we showed the neural net and the coloblind guy a new sample of unknown color, what is the likelihood of either one getting the correct answer?

If we've trained the neural net to differentiate red and green, and this unknown color is neither, then it's outside the use case. If it is red or green, then, if you haven't overtrained your neural net, then near 100%. The colorblind guy, I don't know, maybe he's recognized subtle differences that can clue him in and he'd be able to as well.

&gt; If we asked both to define what red is apart from previous samples, what is the likelihood of either one having any answer.

I'd say they probably both do. As long as you made sure they know it, and weren't just remembering which things you said were red, and which you said were green (That is, test on new datasets (without correcting), and see if they get it right). The way they communicate them would be different, but they'd both have a definition. The colorblind guy would probably have a set of rules he used to differentiate them that he'd reiterate, and a neural net could probably be given a mechanism to print out, based on the weights of neurons, which are the most important input neurons, or something like that.

If they don't know it, and are just guessing, then well, they'd probably still both have an answer, just not a good one (which may prompt the guy to say ""I don't know"", since humans do that).

&gt; I'd say neither is certain apart from its role within a wider context and that both are certain within the context of their respective fields of study.

I get the first assertion, I don't get why the second one though.

&gt; P.S. Some kind of products aren't communitive, I think. It's a vague recollection.

Yes, you're right. Cross products of vectors and the like. Multiplication of scalars, then.

&gt; For a down to earth example, it isn't important for me to check the product of two 7 digit numbers by hand after I use a calculator.

I don't think it is either, but someone had to check to make sure the calculator did do correct operations.

&gt; I'd hesitate to say I'm using deductive method to come to knowledge.

You are, if only with a bit of trust that someone did the parts you are stepping over (someone checked to make sure the calculator worked). Calculators work by specific circuits that we can prove work (just because it's cool, you may not care, here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ) of someone who made the circuits out of dominos). If the circuits work, then your work is deductively sound: If these circuits add numbers, they produce the correct result (this is the part you're basically outsourcing). The circuits added X and Y and got Z. Therefore, X + Y = Z.

&gt; What are the units?

Perhaps ""observe"" would've been better? Regardless, they can be anything. I can say an apple has 1 apple-taste-unit of taste. It may not be the most accurate measurement system, especially when I try to say how many apple-taste-units are in apple pie, but I don't need to use a millimeter-accurate measuring tool for every distance measurement.

&gt; You are assuming that objects must be created in order to explain their presence or destroyed in order to explain their apparent cessation.

I feel we've gone a bit far off rails here. I don't really see how this is important anymore. 

What I said was if an effect can't be observed, then the situation would be the same regardless of whether it had or had not occurred. Assuming it occurred nonetheless is a position removed by Occam's razor. It's an unnecessary assumption with no bearing on the actual state of affairs.

EDIT: Removed the ""// Add later"" comment, and added the actual thing I meant to say.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-26 18:42:11 :

&gt; I'm not sure I really see a difference.

There is a two place relation between the telescope and its user. The observer and the tool of observation are distinct. In the second case, the body serves as observer and as tool for observation. ""I use my eyes to see"" only seems to relate two things: the observer and the eyes. In fact, the observer is not distinct from his eyes.

&gt; Not really. Certainly you have input neurons all over your body in the form of nerve endings, and whatever nerves connect to your eyes, and tongue, and whatnot. But your entire body is not a neural net.

Does repeated uses of a given muscle change its outputs? Definitely; that's the entire reason people try to get in shape. Using a muscle changes the subsequent utility of given behavior in a systematic way. They seem a lot like our software neuron then, in that they can be modeled as dynamic parts a system of inputs and outputs. They might not directly tie into our biological neurons as neurons do with each other, but muscles seem like neurons in our abstract sense.

&gt; Not to me. A neural net is embodied in the OS it's running under. It's just a different body.

You are totally missing the point. Every computer is comprised of stuff. That's part of the computation game; you need a medium for carrying out computational operations, even if these operations can be described in an abstract form. Embodiment isn't a matter of just having a body. Rather, it's about being able to use your body in conjuncture with the environment to solve problems. Siri solves problems in response to environmental cues, but it doesn't act on those cues as objects in their own right. Rather, it takes those cues as on occasion to carry out some internal (re: system specific) operations.

&gt; Species are made up of individuals. Changing this from an individual to a species perspective isn't really necessary.

It's necessary insofar as individual members of a species don't necessarily 'want' anything the way you are using the word. Creatures are totally ignorant of the great cosmic forces that drive selection over generations. Before civilization, human beings were likely in the same boat. No individual member of a species has the capacity to want something like the greatest adaptive benefit for its entire population because they most lack these concepts.

&gt; I don't see what's wrong with this. When you want, you want an end result. A process that makes progress towards an end result can be personified as ""wanting"" that end result. I'm not inferring, I'm describing.

Personification is a literary device. It makes sense to personify people, because they are persons to begin with. It might be convenient or poignant to describe non-persons as persons, but it isn't accurate. It's a category mistake.

&gt; Yes, but pain isn't an individual... Yes, but pain isn't a local phenomenon.

Would you like to argue your case here? Neither proposal seems absurd to me. My pain certainly seems personal to me. It is informed at least partially by the ways I tend to express my pain, and therefore is partially informed by my personal character. Furthermore, pain experiences do seem to be relative to their social context, cultural expectations, and background phenomena in the mind unrelated to T-cells firing. Therefore, pain is partially informed by environment.

&gt; Yes, but pain clearly does have an effect on survival. Like your instinctual reaction to remove your hand from a burning stove.

Individual survival, perhaps. Evolution does select for individual fitness or survival though; it selects for group survival. Rather than minimize the group's aggregate pain over generations, selective pressures might push us to experience more pain with every generation. Worms definitely don't miss their families or catch one below the belt. More 'primitive' animals seem less capable of experiencing pain, and are therefore more apt to avoid it all together.

&gt; Is ""ideas are what happens when neurons do their thing"" not at least an attempted explanation of their emergence?

No; it's an explanation that depends on said emergence. It is an explanation that turns on the concept of emergence as an assumed fact.

&gt; Yes, I'm sorry I keep doing that. I'm probably reading this onto you, but I feel like you expect a full explanation for how all the bits of the brain work, which I clearly don't know. I'm not sure what level of explanation you want for me to actually take a position, if that makes any sense.

You don't need to know everything, or anything for that matter. I'm just trying to understand your implicit reasoning the best I can. I think the evolution thread above is great in that respect, because we seem to have very different running assumptions there. I'm trying to do that wherever you have a link in your argument that depends on a point we disagree on.

&gt; This doesn't explain how they got attached to brains though.

Brains are caused by ideas, so they are connected that way. We have ideas in the mind because of ideas in the world.

&gt; What's the difference between reflex and pre-programming?

Reflexes are automatic sub-systems, while pre-programming implies systematic architecture that produces a behavior by virtue of that structure. Animals probably don't function on the second way, but are known to function the the first way. Even things like fish, frogs, and insects depend on learning something to produce systematic responses, (e.i. behavior).

&gt; Fine. I'm not out of examples though: Breathing, blinking, crying, holding one's breath under water. Human babies (at least, probably other babies as well, but I wouldn't know) do all these from the word go.

Those are all reflexes. You can tell they aren't the same as pre-programming, because some disappear over time. Infant diving reflexes are a good example. If something has been programed explicitly into us, then there must be a mechanism for deleting it. No know error correction mechanism exists for the programming in the brain though. In contrast, associative sub-routines can be weakened over time through known mechanisms.

&gt; This is the idealized process. In reality, there's definitely a difference in how you say ""good"" if your day was good or not. ""assert G"" is not the same as ""exhibit behavior G""

I indulged this objection, because I thought I could add more to my position. However, you are starting to run into some hard facts that you need to justify. If you think that a difference is detectable, then you can show how it's done. If you don't know whether or not we can detect a difference, then you are just bluffing. If we are in the same evidence boat, then my common-sense analysis seems preferable by default to your non-position.

&gt; If it is red or green, then, if you haven't overtrained your neural net, then near 100%. The colorblind guy, I don't know, maybe he's recognized subtle differences that can clue him in and he'd be able to as well.

If he could do well at this test, then he wouldn't be colorblind. I think we define people as colorblind based on how well they do on tests like this. If they fail, then they are colorblind. If they can pass, then they aren't colorblind.

&gt; The way they communicate them would be different, but they'd both have a definition. The colorblind guy would probably have a set of rules he used to differentiate them that he'd reiterate, and a neural net could probably be given a mechanism to print out, based on the weights of neurons, which are the most important input neurons, or something like that.

The dude seems like he's giving a good definition here. It's the kind of thing that not only tells us what to do to find red/green, but also provides criteria for what red/green things are. The NN seems to be only telling us about itself. It is telling us it's personal story about how it discovered red/green. It isn't concerned with red or free in themselves.

&gt; You are, if only with a bit of trust that someone did the parts you are stepping over (someone checked to make sure the calculator worked). Calculators work by specific circuits that we can prove work (just because it's cool, you may not care, here's a video of someone who made the circuits out of dominos). 

Alright, now I can't appeal to ignorance. I guess you win this one ;). I think the machine proof thing would be very interesting to you all the same, though. There are more interesting things than I can come up with personally.

&gt; Perhaps ""observe"" would've been better? Regardless, they can be anything. I can say an apple has 1 apple-taste-unit of taste.

I'd say that the taste-unit is impossible due to the Private Language Argument. Let's say to take a bite of pie and say, ""I'm going to call that one apple-unit"". Then you take a second bite and say, ""That seems like two apple-units to me"". What makes your second claim true or false. If you are using an external criteria, then you just compare the quantifiable units of the first to the second. There is no problem. If you define it in terms of some sense-data, then all that matters is how things seem. If something seeming like two apple units is indistinct from something incorrectly seeming like two apple units.

&gt; I feel we've gone a bit far off rails here. I don't really see how this is important anymore. 
What I said was if an effect can't be observed, then the situation would be the same regardless of whether it had or had not occurred.

It's important insofar as you keep applying to this eliminative positivist maxim. Let's compare unobserved cause to unobserved substance here. If all we need to explain is exactly what we observe, then we don't need to appeal anything outside of observation. There is no reason to appeal to causes or substance, because those aren't observed directly. They can only be inferred with the addition of concepts that we impose, like continuity of existence or the principle of sufficient reason.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-01-27 02:53:36 :

&gt; In fact, the observer is not distinct from his eyes.

Sure he is. Your eyes aren't your brain, they're just attached to your brain.

&gt; Does repeated uses of a given muscle change its outputs?

Not the output neurons, but the muscles themselves change. Saying that that makes it part of the neural net is like saying picking up a tool makes that tool part of the neural net.

&gt; but muscles seem like neurons in our abstract sense.

Muscles attach to neurons. You could do a similar thing with an artificial neural net by simply wiring the output neurons to a motor.

&gt; Siri solves problems in response to environmental cues, but it doesn't act on those cues as objects in their own right.

This seems like you're attacking the case, not the point. We have robots that do this. It's just a matter of giving the program a body.

&gt; Creatures are totally ignorant of the great cosmic forces that drive selection over generations.

So are species. I don't get your point here.

&gt; No individual member of a species has the capacity to want something like the greatest adaptive benefit for its entire population because they most lack these concepts.

Again, so does a species. I feel like all this is just caught up in my use of the word ""want"" which, I'll freely admit, was not the most accurate term. I used it because I felt it was information dense. It'd get us close to my point in less words.

&gt; Personification is a literary device.

Personification is the reason I used the word ""want"". It isn't necessary to describe the behavior. When I said ""X wants Y"" I meant ""there is a process that leads X to conclusion Y""

&gt; Would you like to argue your case here?

Pain is something that every human, regardless of location, (barring developmental disorders) feels. This is what I meant by it wasn't individual or local. The fact that *every single* human shares this, to me, is evidence that it was a developed characteristic. The chances of every human having it without a shared cause seem astronomically low.

&gt; Furthermore, pain experiences do seem to be relative to their social context, cultural expectations, and background phenomena in the mind unrelated to T-cells firing.

Sure, pain is in the brain, and the brain, as we've established, is shaped by it's circumstances. This is all to be expected.

&gt; Evolution does select for individual fitness or survival though; it selects for group survival. 

And in doing so produces individual fitness.

&gt; Worms definitely don't miss their families 

Worms are not social creatures.

&gt; or catch one below the belt.

I'm unfamiliar with this turn of phrase.

&gt; More 'primitive' animals seem less capable of experiencing pain, and are therefore more apt to avoid it all together.

Avoidance of pain was never the goal. Maybe I was unclear on this, but pain is the mechanism to avoidance of danger. Animals with either less chance of being in danger, or less they can do about being in danger, would expectedly experience less pain. There's no point if you can't do anything about it, and if it wouldn't come up often, it wouldn't be a trait worth developing.

&gt; It is an explanation that turns on the concept of emergence as an assumed fact.

So, is this because of the idea that neurons don't have aboutness, but ideas do? Or is it another reason?

&gt; I'm trying to do that wherever you have a link in your argument that depends on a point we disagree on.

Alright, sounds good.

&gt; Brains are caused by ideas, so they are connected that way.

Woah, woah. What? Did you misspeak here? How are brains caused by ideas? I can get the other way, but this seems odd. Isn't a brain caused by like, biology or something?

&gt; while pre-programming implies systematic architecture that produces a behavior by virtue of that structure.

Well, our brains aren't just lumps of randomly placed neurons. We can tell as much by the fact that they fit a normal shape, and they use uniform parts for similar functions.

&gt; You can tell they aren't the same as pre-programming, because some disappear over time. 

Why is this inconsistent with pre-programming? When I said pre-programming, I didn't mean ""hard coded"". I didn't mean ""fixed"". I meant, there from the start. Where it goes from there doesn't really change the fact that it was there at the start.

&gt; If something has been programed explicitly into us, then there must be a mechanism for deleting it. No know error correction mechanism exists for the programming in the brain though.

You can delete it in the same way you learn something new.

&gt; If you think that a difference is detectable, then you can show how it's done. 

What to detect obviously depends on the circumstance. But we know behaviors people exhibit when they're lying. For example, they might look to the left, or touch their face more. On a more complex front, you could put them in an MRI and figure it out by looking at their brain.

&gt; If he could do well at this test, then he wouldn't be colorblind.

Arguably. It depends on the test. Color blind tests often mess with the hues and stuff to make it as confusing as possible. This comes as a fact that they aren't designed to see if you can tell green from red, but to see if you're color blind.

The guy may be able to pick up on things, like the shades that look darker are more likely to be green, or something.

&gt; The NN seems to be only telling us about itself.

As did the guy. He told us how *he* differentiated the two. This is exactly what the Neural Net is doing it's saying ""Well, these are the things I looked for most"". It also provides criteria for what red/green things are: Red things are ones that triggered this neuron more, and green are ones that triggered it less.

&gt; It isn't concerned with red or free in themselves.

Is the guy? Does he care? It probably doesn't affect his life, I mean, he's lived with the color blindness up until this experiment.

&gt; What makes your second claim true or false. If you are using an external criteria, then you just compare the quantifiable units of the first to the second.

Who cares if it's true or false? The unit's not really useful anyway, so if you throw it away and redefine it every time you taste an apple, who cares? Regardless, there are ways to measure taste. You taste because chemicals react with your taste buds, so if you just check the chemical composition, then you'd get your answer. Your tongue's a pretty crappy measuring tool for this, at least in terms of output, but it does measure it.

&gt; Let's compare unobserved cause to unobserved substance here.

Not sure if this is a semantic nitpick, but I'd like to differentiate between unobserved and unobservable. A tree behind me is unobserved. Something that doesn't exist is unobservable.

&gt; If all we need to explain is exactly what we observe,

Ah, I think it wasn't a semantic nitpick. We have to explain all we *can* observe. Not just all we do. We don't get to ignore chemistry if we just didn't observe chemicals mixing.

&gt; There is no reason to appeal to causes or substance, because those aren't observed directly.

But causes have effects, which can be observed. And so we need to explain it. Also, I'm pretty sure causes or substance can be observed as well.

And why does directly matter? We don't observe hardly anything directly in science. You measure distance of an object through a ruler. You measure temperature by looking at the thermal expansion of mercury (well, probably not anymore, but your thermometer is clearly not direct).

Just curious, what's something that you think has an effect that matters, but that can't be observed? If the effect can't be observed, how can it be said to matter? 

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-28 02:35:54 :

&gt; Sure he is. Your eyes aren't your brain, they're just attached to your brain.

The brain is not an observer; We established that when you agreed that the brain's role in experience isn't that of a homunculus.

&gt; Not the output neurons, but the muscles themselves change...
Muscles attach to neurons. You could do a similar thing with an artificial neural net by simply wiring the output neurons to a motor.

You are obviously equivocating Neuron from biology with Neuron from neural nets. You yourself insisted that one was software while the other was hardware, so I don't know why you'd make that mistake. As for justification for muscles counting as the abstract kind of neuron, muscles seem to me to meet three important criteria:

1. They are part of inter-connected systems.
2. They vary their output based on various inputs.
3. Subsequent outputs are trained based on previous iterations.

&gt; This seems like you're attacking the case, not the point. We have robots that do this. It's just a matter of giving the program a body.

I also feel like you are missing the forest in spite of the trees here. This is my reply in context:

""(Embodiment) is about being able to use your body in conjuncture with the environment to solve problems. Siri solves problems in response to environmental cues, but it doesn't act on those cues as objects in their own right. Rather, it takes those cues as on occasion to carry out some internal (re: system specific) operations.""

I'm not saying robots can't possibly perform emboddied cognition. I'm saying things like Siri don't have this feature, in spite of having extended cognitive ability. In fact, there is no reason to believe that something like Siri could become conscious. Increasing emboddied cognition, in contrast, seems like a steady path towards sentience. That's where I'm trying to move the conversation.

&gt;  I feel like all this is just caught up in my use of the word ""want"" which, I'll freely admit, was not the most accurate term. I used it because I felt it was information dense. It'd get us close to my point in less words.

I don't think it worked. We've spilled a lot of pixels on this and I'm not closer to understanding what your proposal amounts to. Could you explain the argument without appealing to metaphorical super-wants?

&gt; Personification is the reason I used the word ""want"". It isn't necessary to describe the behavior. When I said ""X wants Y"" I meant ""there is a process that leads X to conclusion Y""

We are trying to narrow in on what makes people people in the first place. Bluring personal and non-personal things together won't help us because sometimes reading mental features into behavior takes literal import and sometimes it is merely figurative.

&gt; Pain is something that every human... feels.

Individual expereience of pain is highly variable across the spectrum. The way we express and report our inner pain states is highly dependent on cultural background, age, gender, and prevous exposure to pain managment theropy. Pain might be a more dsijointed category than you realize.

Also, many things are ubiquituous in human history without being inborn. The bow and arrow was developed independently on possibly hundreds of separate occasions. This isn't because human beings all knew how to make bows and arrows through primal instinct. Instead, various people needed to solve the same problem with similar materials and restrictions. Art might be another example.

&gt; Sure, pain is in the brain, and the brain, as we've established, is shaped by it's circumstances. This is all to be expected.

'T-cells firing in the brain' is the trope response for the idea that brain is physically in the brain. I was saying that the two same brain states can seem more or less painful based on environmental conditions.

&gt; Avoidance of pain was never the goal...

This is the exact opposite of what you said earlier: 

""(T)here's very reasonable explanations for why you might feel something when experiencing pain. In the following scenario, the brain rewires itself in ways that minimize certain things (pain), and maximize others (but we won't worry about that).""

I'm still confused by your response, though. How can information about our current state inform us about how things must be out in the world? It would be different if you said fear is the avoidence of danger, because fear is directed towards an object. Pain isn't directed though, expect maybe beligerently towards all existence.

&gt; So, is this because of the idea that neurons don't have aboutness, but ideas do? Or is it another reason?

The first thing is paramount. Other things are secondary.

&gt; Woah, woah. What? Did you misspeak here? How are brains caused by ideas? I can get the other way, but this seems odd. Isn't a brain caused by like, biology or something?

Nope, I meant what I said. You say natural laws cause brains which in term cause ideas to form, while I say ideas are primordial; they cause natural states of affairs such as brains which then set rules that allow for the intelligibility of something like natural law. Idea here means something like Platonic idea; That analysis of the universe reveals that objects are not ultimately more fundamental than processes, universals, or moments.

&gt; Well, our brains aren't just lumps of randomly placed neurons. We can tell as much by the fact that they fit a normal shape, and they use uniform parts for similar functions.

I wasn't saying the brain lacked structure or architecture. I was saying that it lacks programing for structured behaviors. There aren't mental operations ready to go the same way a car rolls off the assembly firing on all cylinders. If you don't believe me, you can read wikipedia for yourself. This is something I reviewed in Psych 101.

&gt; What to detect obviously depends on the circumstance...

I already covered the case of skilled liars, so that rules out the first case, and liars that are extremely good at regulating sub-conscious mental process, which I think addresses your second case. Are you done disagreeing for the sake of disagreement?

&gt; As did the guy. He told us how he differentiated the two...

The guy is giving rules. Rules imply conceptual mastery over a body of cases. If the guy is able to generalize rules, then he is making tacit metaphysical assumptions in order to interpret which real-world conditions are necessary for bringing about a given case. Reasoning about rules implies reasoning about the world.

The machine here isn't reasoning conceptually. It might be acting in accordance to certain abstractions that we find significant, but it doesn't find significantion in anything. The machine isn't reporting anything when it spits out a spreadsheet of its inner workings. It doesn't have a framing concept like a body of cases interpreted to have real-world import, so it making a report isn't in it's conceptual toolbox. It is simply being and we find signification in that being because of our artifice and intentions. We are engineering.

&gt; Is the guy? Does he care? It probably doesn't affect his life, I mean, he's lived with the color blindness up until this experiment.

He doesn't need to be passionate about the true essence of color. He just needs to mean what he says when he makes rules about what makes something red and what makes something green.

&gt; Who cares if it's true or false? The unit's not really useful anyway, so if you throw it away and redefine it every time you taste an apple, who cares?

Nobody cares. It's just not a unit in that case. What you are suggesting is a contradiction: a unit is not at once definitive and redefinable. Positing a new unit with the same name doesn't paper over any discontinuity here. Two things are either the same or they are not; that's an exhaustive claim.

&gt; Regardless, there are ways to measure taste. You taste because chemicals...

If it's all just a matter of detection, then why is synesthesia a thing? It seems like ambient unrelated modes of sensory experience shouldn't affect each other, if it's just a matter of detection vs non-detection. For example, if one sense is dedicated to sensing fat while another is dedicated to sensing sugar, then the joint experience of fat and sugar should just be the super-position of the two component experiences. It often isn't though.

&gt; Not sure if this is a semantic nitpick...
Ah, I think it wasn't a semantic nitpick. We have to explain all we can observe. Not just all we do. We don't get to ignore chemistry if we just didn't observe chemicals mixing.

I think we would both have an easier time with this if you took the time to read everything I have to say in a sub-topic before you reply. I think it would clear up a lot of unnecessary confusion. It also make you less prone to pick fights about small sub-points and instead take the whole argument being presented before into consideration before you jump to conclusions.

Anyways, I'd say that the concept of observable unobserveds only makes sense if you posit unobserved causes. If you explain the observability of an object by it's proximity to light and the direction of scattered rays, then presumably you'd explain it's observability when not being observed on the continuation of these processes when you aren't observing it. This implies positing the causal interactions between things you don't observe. This seems exactly like this unobserved cause you've been so perplexed by.

&gt; But causes have effects, which can be observed...

What observation would differentiate all true causal relationship from only apparently causal relationships? We've been through this.

&gt; And why does directly matter? We don't observe hardly anything directly in science...

Using tools like this is totally kosher with me. I think this is just how most human cognition works, so I'm fine with saying scientific knowledge is a conceptual mastery over a subject combined with a technical mastery over some tools.

awenonian @ 2017-01-29 01:53:30 :

&gt; The brain is not an observer; We established that when you agreed that the brain's role in experience isn't that of a homunculus.

Well your eyes aren't an observer either. And, unlike your brain, you don't need your eyes to observe things.

&gt; You are obviously equivocating Neuron from biology with Neuron from neural nets. You yourself insisted that one was software while the other was hardware, so I don't know why you'd make that mistake.

Because they are both neurons. I can call them hardware neurons and software neurons if you think I should, but they're both neurons.

We have ""output"" neurons as well. These are the kinds of neurons that attach to your muscles (after looking it up, they're called ""motor neurons"") They are different from ""input"" neurons, like those responsible for your sense of touch (""sensory neurons""). An output neuron doesn't send feedback, because neurons, in either case, work one way.

&gt; Subsequent outputs are trained based on previous iterations.

I think they actually fail this one. They aren't trained in the same way brain neurons are. Muscles don't transmit signals for one, and, perhaps more importantly, they don't ""train"" like a neuron does. I don't even think they do this by themselves. The mechanism that makes your muscles stronger is the mechanism that heals you from injury. That's why you get stronger, because you injure your muscles slightly, and in healing back, they become stronger.

&gt; Increasing emboddied cognition, in contrast, seems like a steady path towards sentience. That's where I'm trying to move the conversation.

I don't see why. I mean, there's nothing stopping us from attaching a Siri type system to a robot. I don't know why the body is important. Could Skynet not be sentient because it doesn't have a body?

&gt; Could you explain the argument without appealing to metaphorical super-wants?

Let me rephrase what I said before: When I said ""X wants Y"" I meant ""there is a necessarily run (i.e. non-optional) process that leads X to conclusion Y"". Basically, a hardwired pain response aids survival in causing avoidance of certain actions before one would have the capability of observing the outcome of the actions and learning from them. This gives it reason to arise in evolutionary processes, as those with the pain response are more likely to survive, since they don't have to first experience the loss before learning to avoid it. For example, they'll save their friend the first time, instead of having to experience a friend dying, and then figure out that because of that they're having more trouble watching their back, so maybe next time save the friend.

&gt; The way we express and report our inner pain states is highly dependent on cultural background, age, gender, and prevous exposure to pain managment theropy. 

Yeah, just like you'd expect from things that learn. I didn't say everyone experiences pain in the exact same way. I said everyone experiences pain. Getting stabbed hurts for everyone.

&gt; Also, many things are ubiquituous in human history without being inborn. The bow and arrow was developed independently on possibly hundreds of separate occasions.

You can teach people how to make a bow. In fact, you have to if they've never seen one. Maybe they can learn themselves. That's all great, but you don't need to learn that getting stabbed hurts.

&gt; 'T-cells firing in the brain' is the trope response for the idea that brain is physically in the brain.

Oh, sorry. I wasn't familiar with this.

&gt; I was saying that the two same brain states can seem more or less painful based on environmental conditions.

If the environmental conditions are different, then the brain states are not the same.

&gt; In the following scenario, the brain rewires itself in ways that minimize certain things (pain)

The minimizing was pain, not the things.

&gt; Pain isn't directed though, expect maybe beligerently towards all existence.

Are you sure? I mean, maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I've never felt some sort of ""existance is pain"" type feeling. When I hurt, it's definitely directed: it's coming from the bruise that I got from kicking the table. Or, it's at the death of my grandmother. Or whatever.

&gt; So, is this because of the idea that neurons don't have aboutness, but ideas do?

Just going to requote myself for ease of access mostly. I remember I said before something like ""aboutness comes from the object being responsible for the inputs"". I can't exactly remember your criticism for this, so sorry for retreading old ground. But every transmittion running through the neurons in your brain had a place it came from, and I don't know why these wouldn't account for the aboutness. It seems very similar to a causal chain.

For an example, because it's what's dancing in my head right now, if you take buttercups, and you hold them up close to something, that thing can (depending on the light) appear yellow, because of the light bouncing off the buttercups. This isn't just any yellow though, it's specifically those buttercups' yellow. Does this yellow have the ""aboutness"" of the buttercups? If not, why not?

&gt; Nope, I meant what I said.

But we can have brains without ideas. We have dead people. This just seems such an odd concept to me. I may not agree, but at least I'd understand if you said ""ideas cause *minds*"" but cause *brains*? I really don't get that.

&gt; That analysis of the universe reveals that objects are not ultimately more fundamental than processes, universals, or moments.

I don't really know what ""more fundamental"" means. I don't think you could make objects out of processes, and I don't think you could make processes out of objects. Doesn't this place them on the same fundamentallity?

&gt; I was saying that it lacks programing for structured behaviors.

Perhaps I misunderstand ""structured behaviors"". The fact that some neurons start closer connected than others is pre-programming in my mind. It's not evidence that it's at all similar from person to person, but we can get some evidence for that by seeing that certain parts of the brain always match up to the same spot, like the ""speech center"" or the part responsible for moving your eyes. If ""structured behaviors"" means something specific, then I may concede this point.

&gt; Are you done disagreeing for the sake of disagreement?

This certainly wasn't simply for the sake of disagreement. I believe I said it because I thought you were using it to disprove some form of functionalism. I believe I was mistaken, so I'm sorry for that.

&gt; The guy is giving rules.

The guy has a mechanism for translating his decisions in to words. The response I gave for the neural net was the simplest one I could think of, without really adding new functionality to it's current system. If it had a mechanism for translating the most influential neurons into human readable output, then it may well produce ""rules"" much like this guy did.

&gt; It might be acting in accordance to certain abstractions that we find significant, but it doesn't find significantion in anything.

This isn't true. A neural net reporting it's most influential neruons will be exactly what it found significant. It won't matter what we thought was significant, because we didn't decide the most influential neuron, the net did.

&gt; He just needs to mean what he says when he makes rules about what makes something red and what makes something green.

I don't know why this is something the neural net doesn't do.

&gt; If it's all just a matter of detection, then why is synesthesia a thing?

Because some wires got crossed somewhere in the brain? I don't really know, but I also don't really know why this would be a problem for it just being a matter of detection. It's just the detection of one thing triggers a response meant for the detection of something else as well.

&gt; It seems like ambient unrelated modes of sensory experience shouldn't affect each other, if it's just a matter of detection vs non-detection.

They shouldn't, and don't, in most people. Synesthesia is a disorder, or at least an abnormality.

&gt; For example, if one sense is dedicated to sensing fat while another is dedicated to sensing sugar, then the joint experience of fat and sugar should just be the super-position of the two component experiences. It often isn't though.

Are you sure? I can't think of an example where this is the case. I mean, I've certainly never tasted straight sugar, straight fat, and fat covered in sugar to test, so I guess I don't really have data to say this isn't the case. But I doubt you've done that, so I don't know if you have the data to say it is.

&gt; Anyways, I'd say that the concept of observable unobserveds only makes sense if you posit unobserved causes.

Does positing this cause a problem for me? If so, I've clearly been in the wrong. I mean, I don't always see the thing that causes my glass to fall off the table, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a cause.

&gt; This seems exactly like this unobserved cause you've been so perplexed by.

I'm not sure how I've been perplexed by unobserved causes. I made the distinction between unobserv*ed* causes, and unobserv*able* causes. We build experimental apparatuses to observe things that were previously unobserved. If something was unobserv*able* we could not build an apparatus to observe it. Those are the things that I am claiming don't matter.

&gt; What observation would differentiate all true causal relationship from only apparently causal relationships?

There isn't one, right? But as we talked about in the podcast, we said that we never get to the absolute truth in science. We won't ever get to the absolute definite truth about consciousness, just like we won't get to the absolute definite truth about tornados, but we don't have a Hard Problem of tornados.

If apparently causal relationships explain every phenomenon anyway, then we'd say they are the causal relationships. Regardless of whether they were in pure true reality.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-29 20:11:06 :

&gt; Well your eyes aren't an observer either. And, unlike your brain, you don't need your eyes to observe things.

Let's set aside the issue of causal pr counter-factual dependency, because those metrics aren't necessarily sensitive to the kinds of distinctions we are looking for. Any explanation in this vien is going to take us down the rabbit hole of further facts and further justification.

Instead, let's focus on the contrast between self-awareness and investigative awareness. Self-awareness is our sense of orientation in a body. It is immediate in that it isn't awareness in virtue of a further fact. Rather, embodied awareness is the act and object all in one. It's like the Cogito in that performing the act is and effective proof of its veracity.

In contrast, when we use further facts, as in inductive empirical practices or deductive axiomatic practices, we also acquire awareness. However, this awareness depends on further facts. It's a matter of coordinating the observer, the evidence, and the world such that the evidence serves the as a bridge between observer and world. This isn't an opposing case, but it is a derivative case the depends on concepts disclosed in the first case for cogency. Furthermore, imposing this scheme onto cases of self-awareness will inevitably moves us to posit fictitious entities to stretch an essentially unified thing into two or three.

&gt; Because they are both neurons. I can call them hardware neurons and software neurons if you think I should, but they're both neurons.

I can deposit my money in the banks of the Arkansas just as I would deposit money in the Bank of Arkansas. That doesn't mean both are literally the same kind of bank under different conditions.

&gt; We have ""output"" neurons as well. These are the kinds of neurons that attach to your muscles (after looking it up, they're called ""motor neurons"") They are different from ""input"" neurons, like those responsible for your sense of touch (""sensory neurons""). An output neuron doesn't send feedback, because neurons, in either case, work one way.

There are sensors in muscles that relay information about muscle length back to the brain. This information is used in conjunction with information about balance and vertical orientation to assemble a model of our bodies oriented in space. This model is informed by sensory information, but works largely independent of it. This closes your loop. Sensory information goes to the brain which fires conscious motor activity, which the receives propriosensory information as feedback.

&gt; I think they actually fail this one. They aren't trained in the same way brain neurons are. Muscles don't transmit signals for one, and, perhaps more importantly, they don't ""train"" like a neuron does. I don't even think they do this by themselves. The mechanism that makes your muscles stronger is the mechanism that heals you from injury.

I feel like I've already addressed most of this claim above. However, I'd like to add that trainings means more than just gains. Surgeons train; dancers train; actors train. It's about tuning our bodies to take a role in light of our body as represented in the world. Incidentally, some routines can become so ingrained that their execution bypasses central information processing all together. This isn't what we mean by muscle memories, but I think it's interesting.

&gt; I don't see why. I mean, there's nothing stopping us from attaching a Siri type system to a robot. I don't know why the body is important. Could Skynet not be sentient because it doesn't have a body?

Skynet is pure science fiction, like just like that stupid Johny Depp movie. Making a 'DJ Roomba', (like on Parks and Rec) doesn't do anything towards making something sentient. Making something conscious of it's body as a thing in the world introduces different modalities for understanding.

&gt; Yeah, just like you'd expect from things that learn. I didn't say everyone experiences pain in the exact same way. I said everyone experiences pain. Getting stabbed hurts for everyone.

See comments on homophones above.

&gt; You can teach people how to make a bow. In fact, you have to if they've never seen one. Maybe they can learn themselves. That's all great, but you don't need to learn that getting stabbed hurts.

Parable time: The Buddha was a mortal man, but really learned something about pain by leaving his palace walls; One of the fundamental truths of Buddhism is that to exist is to suffer. There is an obvious tension in that they say the Buddha was ignorant of suffering yet to exist in some way automatically recalls suffering. The easiest way to dissolve this tension is to say that suffering is an individual response to endemic conditions. We all must suffer in virtue of the practice task of living. But, how we suffer and what we take our suffering to be, (what is significant about pain), is something we learn.

&gt; If the environmental conditions are different, then the brain states are not the same.

This seems like hearsay to me. I can find case reports that correlate pain reduction with environmental factors all things being equal. If you want to read your personal spin into that information, then that's on you.

&gt; Are you sure? I mean, maybe I'm in the minority on this, but I've never felt some sort of ""existance is pain"" type feeling. When I hurt, it's definitely directed: it's coming from the bruise that I got from kicking the table. Or, it's at the death of my grandmother. Or whatever.

Those are things you identify as the causes of your pain, but that constitutes a compound judgement that a state of affairs causes something. The initial crossing of a certain subjective threshold doesn't tell you what caused this to happen in itself.

&gt; But we can have brains without ideas. We have dead people. This just seems such an odd concept to me. I may not agree, but at least I'd understand if you said ""ideas cause minds"" but cause brains? I really don't get that.

The thrust here would be that a dead brain is an idea although it doesn't entertain ideas. There would be something that grounds being a dead brain over and above token brains we label as 'dead'.

&gt; I don't really know what ""more fundamental"" means. I don't think you could make objects out of processes, and I don't think you could make processes out of objects. Doesn't this place them on the same fundamentallity?

That's a great way to put it, actually. If processes aren't reducible to objects, then interpreting the world as a collection of processes makes as much sense as interpreting the world as a bunch of objects.

Edit: 

&gt; Perhaps I misunderstand ""structured behaviors""...

I think the similarity from person to person was part of  was reading what I was reading into your claim. It's highly dubious to think that shared inborn instruction account for all shared features of human experience; It's at least a little dubious to think that any shared feautures are explained in terms of inborn instructions, frankly. The concept of structured behavior also needs unpacking. Structured behaviors are sets of behaviors that are mutually intelligible and connected so that an end is acheived through them. Territorial behavior is structural in this sense. It makes sense in light of concepts like place recognition, valid objects of aggression, enforcement protocols, and so on; it also has an end that the animal secures through the behavior, namely territorial hegemony. Things like this require some learning, even if certain pre-conditions explain their regularity in a given species.

&gt; The guy has a mechanism for translating his decisions in to words...

Rules aren't just reports about what someone happened to do. Rules depend on normative-rational concepts; They tell rational people in general what to do in given cases. They are public objects that can be grasped independent of any particular person. If human beings follow rules, it is because we adopt them as structures for our behavior.

&gt; This isn't true. A neural net reporting it's most influential neruons will be exactly what it found significant. It won't matter what we thought was significant, because we didn't decide the most influential neuron, the net did.

Presumably, the NN already had pre-defined conditions for which values will be printed given its current state. This wasn't a college admissions essay where we asked the machine, ""What influences in your life have been the most significant? Describe what makes these things so influential"". The machine doesn't need to reflect upon its behavior as a self-reference. The machine as perfect access to the grounds for it's previous decisions, and so can use individual states as a self-reference. It doesn't need to appeal to signs; Nothing needs as significant because it doesn't operate on based on sign.

&gt; I don't know why this is something the neural net doesn't do.

Neural nets can't lie, so there was never a genuine choice between sincerity and falsehood. This doesn't imply that NN always say what they mean. Rather, NN can't mean what they say because they can't mean otherwise.

&gt; Because some wires got crossed somewhere in the brain?.. They shouldn't, and don't, in most people. Synesthesia is a disorder, or at least an abnormality.

Perhaps synethesia was the wrong word. I'm just trying to evoke that emergent quality of a new unified experience that arises out of two seemingly component experiences, just as a chord arises out of the super-position of two notes over one another. It's relevant to detection, because this emergence makes distinct detection more difficult. If senses are really explainable in terms of being evolutionarily tuned for specific purposes, then this seems like an unecessary defect.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-01-30 18:55:53 :

&gt; Are you sure? I can't think of an example where this is the case...

As a homecook, this just seems like the basic data of life. Why would we bother with all this preening and fussing over what we eat, if there was no real difference any of the ways we prepare ingredients under specific conditions in a certain order? There are clearly limits to human taste; there are hipsters of all stripes that oversell their own abilities and the abilities of ingredients to transcend chemistry. However, taste is clearly robust in its own right. We tasting things are animated by the tasty life.

Notice how far this is from a Deus ex Machina. I'm not evoking fringe quantum theories or the fundamentals of information theory to show you something distinctly non-physical. I'm appealing to a ubititous feature of human experience and setting it as a bar that we both must reach in order to render human experience in a way that is both authentic and intelligible. I say if we need to appeal to secondary qualities like taste in their own right, then so be it. If one insists that things like tast are nothing but X, then I'll need to know whether such reductions can actually be demonstrated. If one refuses to acknowledge things like tast, then they refuse to acknowledge what we're all up to in the first place.

&gt; Let me rephrase what I said before: When I said ""X wants Y"" I meant ""there is a necessarily run (i.e. non-optional) process that leads X to conclusion Y"". Basically, a hardwired pain response aids survival in causing avoidance of certain actions before one would have the capability of observing the outcome of the actions and learning from them. This gives it reason to arise in evolutionary processes, as those with the pain response are more likely to survive, since they don't have to first experience the loss before learning to avoid it. 

I'm not one to preach about orthodoxy with science, but this isn't evolution by natural selection. This is a Lamarkian view of evolution whereby the intention and need for a given attribute increases the propensity for that attribute across generations. The fact that a skill that would allow us to avoid just the things standing between us and survival would be useful doesn't imply that there is a selection pressure in favor of said skill.

Once such a thing exists, certainly there will be a gradient on which members of a population will fall: from least effective to most effective or something. Selection pressures can work in the presence of such a gradient, but it doesn't explain why there are populations that register on the gradient. Appeal to potential usefulness isn't the same as an appeal to relative usefulness within a population.

&gt; Does positing this cause a problem for me? If so, I've clearly been in the wrong. I mean, I don't always see the thing that causes my glass to fall off the table, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a cause... I'm not sure how I've been perplexed by unobserved causes. I made the distinction between unobserved causes, and unobservable causes. We build experimental apparatuses to observe things that were previously unobserved. If something was unobservable we could not build an apparatus to observe it. Those are the things that I am claiming don't matter.

I'm saying there is no principled distinction. The scheme I defined in my previous reply glosses things as either observed or not-observed. In order for something to go from being not-observed to observed, there must be some physical difference on your view. (After all, facts about psychological differences are reducible to physical differences). This implies that every not-observed system is physically distinct from every observed system.

Unobservables and unobserveds are a sub-classes of not-observed. If they are distinct, then you should be define them as distinct sets. There isn't feasible to list all the members of not-observed and exhaustively sort them into one or the other. Therefore, we are going to need to appeal to a property of unobservered that makes it distinct from unobservable. You seem to proposal 'being experiment apt' as that property. Does this seem correct to you?

&gt; There isn't one, right? But as we talked about in the podcast, we said that we never get to the absolute truth in science. We won't ever get to the absolute definite truth about consciousness, just like we won't get to the absolute definite truth about tornados, but we don't have a Hard Problem of tornados.
If apparently causal relationships explain every phenomenon anyway, then we'd say they are the causal relationships. Regardless of whether they were in pure true reality.

This is a totally different pretension from scientific realism. Realism implies that science is true in reality, therefore scientific answers cut deep into essential facts about the world. If you don't believe that, then I definitely don't see anyway to solve the Hard Problem. The Hard Problem is either a trick of the human perspective or a fact about the world as it really is. If science is only concerned with the phenomenal perspective, then the Hard Problem is intractible either way since:

1.Science isn't concerned with real world facts, so the 'real' fact about the Hard Problem is irrelevant to science.

or

2.Science is only concerned with the human perspective and the Hard problem is re-asserted anytime the human perspective is. In short, Science can't solve the Hard Problem because it is built on the acceptance of perspective as an inherent part explanation in science.

awenonian @ 2017-01-30 23:47:20 :

&gt; Rather, embodied awareness is the act and object all in one. It's like the Cogito in that performing the act is and effective proof of its veracity.

So, this whole part got me confused. I had a lot of trouble parsing it. I quoted this because it's what I understood the most. To start, I know Cogito ergo Sum, but I don't understand how this makes it ""the act and object all in one"". I'm not sure if I don't understand Cogito, even if I know it. Also, what do you mean by ""further facts""? Facts beyond our existence?

The first thing that came to mind (and please tell me if it's not relevant, or if I'm spouting BS) is that what would seem to follow would be that we can learn about others through these empirical practices, but we can't learn about ourselves through the same ones. Is that accurate? I feel I may have gotten something wrong.

&gt; I can deposit my money in the banks of the Arkansas just as I would deposit money in the Bank of Arkansas.

But these two uses of the word ""bank"" are wholly different in function. The two neurons do not have this massive difference in function.

&gt; There are sensors in muscles that relay information about muscle length back to the brain.

Ok? I mean, yes, but they aren't the same ones controlling the muscle. We still have input and output neurons.

&gt; This closes your loop. 

Well, sure, but isn't this a closed loop in the same way fanning your face with your hand is? The air isn't part of your nervous system though. Why are muscles different from the air?

&gt; Skynet is pure science fiction

I'm aware. That's why I used the word ""could"". A sentient AI is concievable, right? Does such a sentient AI need to have a body to be considered sentient?

&gt; See comments on homophones above.

What did you mean by pain then, if not what you feel when you hurt?

&gt; One of the fundamental truths of Buddhism is that to exist is to suffer.

I've never even come close to agreeing with this sort of statement.

&gt; But, how we suffer and what we take our suffering to be, (what is significant about pain), is something we learn.

I may have just gotten lost through this, but I really don't see what the point of this is. This seems like a different meaning of ""suffer"" than ""to feel pain"", and I'd guess it comes because of the equation of suffering with existence.

&gt; This seems like hearsay to me.

I don't know what's unreasonable about saying what you hear, see, feel, etc. affects what's going on in your head. I mean, your eyes are literally wired to your brain.

&gt; I can find case reports that correlate pain reduction with environmental factors all things being equal.

Maybe I'm missing something that would disestablish the simple ""percieving different stuff makes your perception of pain different"" statement that I'd like to make. But, if not, then, yeah, that seems obvious to me.

&gt; The initial crossing of a certain subjective threshold doesn't tell you what caused this to happen in itself.

I'm not sure why, but I've felt really lost through this whole thing. But how is the pain from the cut I have on my arm not directed at that cut? That's where it hurts, that's where the pain is coming from. I don't get a vague ""I'm in pain"" I get a definite ""ah, my arm!""

&gt; The thrust here would be that a dead brain is an idea although it doesn't entertain ideas.

I'm really sorry about continuing to say I'm confused, but I thought you said ideas cause brains, not brains are ideas. How can these both be true?

&gt; If processes aren't reducible to objects, then interpreting the world as a collection of processes makes as much sense as interpreting the world as a bunch of objects.

If neither are reducible to the other, shouldn't the world be interpreted as a collection of both?

&gt; Why would we bother with all this preening and fussing over what we eat, if there was no real difference any of the ways we prepare ingredients under specific conditions in a certain order?

Because there is a difference: those things change the chemistry of the meal. Chickens aren't made of chicken molecules that just get hotter when cooked. They're made of complex varieties of carbohydrates and proteins, and cooking them can either change those molecules, break them down, or even just expose new ones. Other ingredients make this even more complicated.

&gt; This is a Lamarkian view of evolution whereby the intention and need for a given attribute increases the propensity for that attribute across generations.

If I were talking about something complicated like memories transcending generations, then yeah, you'd have a point. But pain is a basic response mechanism. If you have to experience loss before you know to avoid it, then you're clearly at a disadvantage. 

&gt; The fact that a skill that would allow us to avoid just the things standing between us and survival would be useful doesn't imply that there is a selection pressure in favor of said skill.

How doesn't it? I mean, yes, the skill has to mutate into the population first, but that's true for everyting. If it's present, then it aiding survival would be a selection pressure for it.

&gt; but it doesn't explain why there are populations that register on the gradient.

That would be mutation.

&gt; In order for something to go from being not-observed to observed, there must be some physical difference on your view.

Not necessarily in the object. A difference in the observer (such as which way it's facing) would do nicely. Under this scheme, I guess it'd best be explained as ""unobservable"" means there's a difference in the object causing it to fail to be observed. ""unobserved"", in contrast, means that the difference is in the observer (at least, if it's not also unobservable).

&gt; Therefore, we are going to need to appeal to a property of unobservered that makes it distinct from unobservable. You seem to proposal 'being experiment apt' as that property. Does this seem correct to you?

I suppose. Does what I said above this shed any light on this?

&gt; Realism implies that science is true in reality, therefore scientific answers cut deep into essential facts about the world.

Well, it seems to me that this is disprovable on the simple grounds that we've been wrong about things in science before. Am I wrong?

To me, science is like a logistic curve. We get closer and closer to the truth, but that doesn't mean we'll reach it exactly. At some point though, we may pack up and say, ""Well, 10^-100 is close enough to zero, there's better places to spend our time on.""

&gt; If science is only concerned with the phenomenal perspective

I think it is: science tries to build models that explain what will happen and what won't. It's just that it's generally accepted that that closely aligns with reality. Not just in science: most people think that what they see happen is what did happen.

KDJones @ 2017-01-31 16:49:29 :

&gt; But these two uses of the word ""bank"" are wholly different in function. The two neurons do not have this massive difference in function.

I mean they both take money and perhaps they share some common metaphorical meaning that loosely associates them. Moreover, the two uses of neurons do have different functions: one is a natural biological cell and the other is an abstract computational unit.

&gt; Ok? I mean, yes, but they aren't the same ones controlling the muscle. We still have input and output neurons.

In the sense that we couldn't perform any of the behaviors we associate with being an able-bodied person without this information, I'd say they are just as important as sensory input and volitional output.

&gt; Well, sure, but isn't this a closed loop in the same way fanning your face with your hand is? The air isn't part of your nervous system though. Why are muscles different from the air?

I'm not saying that muscles are part of the nervous system, I'm saying they are part of our mind; they comprise literal elements of our thoughts. The nervous system is defined by being made of special kinds of cells, so muscles are ruled out by definition. Assuming that mental events= neural events is, again, an assumption on your part.

&gt; I'm aware. That's why I used the word ""could"". A sentient AI is concievable, right? Does such a sentient AI need to have a body to be considered sentient?

If AI is possible, then it will be embodied. I don't see any reason to believe in disembodied computer gods living in cyber-space.

&gt; What did you mean by pain then, if not what you feel when you hurt?

Maybe that's just what I mean: what I feel she I get hurt. Pain means something else to you, but it's something I can lead about. The point is that this isn't a matter of labeling everyone under a single definition and crunching the facts. It's a matter of attending to what is being said. Pain is at least partially expressive, so comparisons between uses of pain-talk are equivocate at least a little.

&gt; I've never even come close to agreeing with this sort of statement.

This isn't a matter of agreeing or disagreeing with the idea. I'm not a Buddhist either. The point is that hundreds of millions of people have found meaning in this story. This clearly wouldn't be possible if the whole thing was founded on a categorical mistake in logic. The point is that you can lead about suffering despite our apparent intimacy with suffering. If our suffering was literally the same kind of thing, this shouldn't be possible. After all, we are directly acquired with our suffering; extra-information about how others suffer shouldn't be life altering.

&gt; This seems like a different meaning of ""suffer"" than ""to feel pain"", and I'd guess it comes because of the equation of suffering with existence.

You have been doing the exact some thing this entire time, (pain=stubbing toe=bruising=dead grandma=anxiety over people dying). I followed your lead here.

&gt; I don't know what's unreasonable about saying what you hear, see, feel, etc. affects what's going on in your head. I mean, your eyes are literally wired to your brain.

It's not about reasonableness; it's about proof. You've made it very clear that you find you views reasonable. Hell! How could you believe in the things you do without finding them reasonable? By the same token though, you've foresworn taking any hard stance in terms of arguments or evidence.

&gt; I'm not sure why, but I've felt really lost through this whole thing. But how is the pain from the cut I have on my arm not directed at that cut? That's where it hurts, that's where the pain is coming from. I don't get a vague ""I'm in pain"" I get a definite ""ah, my arm!""

You are describing a whole sequence of events: Cutting, noticing, expressing. You are in pain before you can diagnose what's going on or react with behavior to indicate this knowledge. When you really hurt yourself, pain is often so intense that you become confused about what exactly going on. Source: I cutting a finger off with a table saw; that shit hurt before the blood hit the floor.

&gt; I'm really sorry about continuing to say I'm confused, but I thought you said ideas cause brains, not brains are ideas. How can these both be true?

There isn't one thing, the Ideas, that devolves authority to lower realms for phenomenal causation. Rather, every object we can interact with is essentially a collection of individual ideas working in concert. Ideas here are like simple moments that are juxtaposed in regular patterns. The regularity of these patterns gives rise to our impression of physical potency and natural law.

&gt; Because there is a difference: those things change the chemistry of the meal.

Do you even read the things I write?

""There are clearly limits to human taste; there are hipsters of all stripes that oversell their own abilities and the abilities of ingredients to transcend chemistry. However, taste is clearly robust in its own right.""

This is literally the next sentence. I'm not ignoring chemistry. I wouldn't have wasted space on this sentence if I know I'd have to do this anyway.

My point was that our experience of eating, of tasting, of taking part in culinary ritual is an obvious spandrel within God's workshop. The emergent properties of food aren't obviously helpful for our survival. The mechanism of avoidance/drive that you've evoked could have produced a much simpler mechanism for doing its 'job'. Such solutions would have been more effective and/or efficient. According to you, that implies the simpler solution should be inevitable.

&gt; If I were talking about something complicated like memories transcending generations, then yeah, you'd have a point. But pain is a basic response mechanism...

You pack an entire theory of knowledge into pain. Of pain is as directed as you say, then it can't be a simple response.

&gt; How doesn't it? I mean, yes, the skill has to mutate into the population first, but that's true for everyting. If it's present, then it aiding survival would be a selection pressure for it.

What mutation do you propose that will that an insensitive state and turn it into a pain-sensitive one? It doesn't need to feel human pain, just pain.

&gt; Not necessarily in the object.

How do you know the object remains distinct?

&gt; I think it is: science tries to build models that explain what will happen and what won't.

If science is only interested in the human perspective with an optimistic fideism, then you should seriously just concede the Hard Problem. If science is our best tool for knowledge and science depends on the human perspective, then science can't dissolve the problems of perception. Rather, science uses perspective as a ladder. One can't kick the ladder out from under oneself and remain in the same place.

&gt; Moreover, the two uses of neurons do have different functions: one is a natural biological cell and the other is an abstract computational unit.

Am I wrong to say that this is different form, instead? Both perform the same function: transmition of data based on inputs.

&gt; In the sense that we couldn't perform any of the behaviors we associate with being an able-bodied person without this information, I'd say they are just as important as sensory input and volitional output.

Able-bodied, but not conscious, right? Quadriplegics are still fully conscious by any reasonable standard.

&gt; I'm not saying that muscles are part of the nervous system, I'm saying they are part of our mind; they comprise literal elements of our thoughts.

Ok, but again, why isn't the air? It's something we can affect through our actions, just like muscles. The only reasonable differences I can come up with are either that air doesn't have neurons attached to it, or that there's a barrier of skin. But these seem fairly arbitrary in deciding what makes up our mind. I mean, the neurons touching your muscles aren't chemically bonded, so it's not like they're really that different from your nerve endings feeling a desk. But a desk isn't part of your mind, is it?

&gt; If AI is possible, then it will be embodied.

That seems like a pretty extreme stance to take. The theoretical models of AI we have (like the [Stamp Collector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4)) have a model of the world, and a way to take input and produce output. That's it. What about that needs a body? If you watched that video, you'd note the fact that he says that's not a practical possibility, because a model of the world is kind of a magic thing. But if you had a way to predict the results of actions (so, not a real model of reality, but an approximate one), that could work. (The video on AI Self Improvement says basically that).

&gt; Pain is at least partially expressive, so comparisons between uses of pain-talk are equivocate at least a little.

Ok, I guess I can get behind that. But am I wrong to say everyone has a definition for pain? Even if it's not the same, doesn't the fact that it's something everyone has suggest something similar to what I've said?

&gt; You have been doing the exact some thing this entire time, (pain=stubbing toe=bruising=dead grandma=anxiety over people dying).

Do you not feel pain during all those things? If not, I'm sorry, I guess I just don't talk to people enough to know...

&gt; It's not about reasonableness; it's about proof.

You're constantly seeing different things. How would that not affect things? Can't I appeal to the experience of people to show this as well?

&gt; You are in pain before you can diagnose what's going on or react with behavior to indicate this knowledge.

Just because you don't notice the pain is coming from your finger doesn't mean it didn't, right? Am I misunderstanding? Does this not make it directed?

&gt; The regularity of these patterns gives rise to our impression of physical potency and natural law.

Ok. If I understood that all, it sounds fair enough. I think it jives with my ideas as well, or at least, doesn't preclude physicalism.

&gt; Do you even read the things I write?

Yes. I promise I do. It's just the part of that I thought was relevant to the claim of chemistry was ""However, taste is clearly robust in its own right."" And I guess I misunderstood, since I didn't see your point, or what you meant.

&gt; According to you, that implies the simpler solution should be inevitable.

A more efficient solution doesn't necessarily mean the most efficient, or the simplest. Evolution is a hill climbing algorithm, and those have a tendency to get stuck at local maxima, even if they miss the global maximum. For example, it may be more efficient to cook food because it makes chemicals we'd normally have a tough time breaking down easier to break down. This change from not cooking our food to cooking it is a small change, and so easier to achieve than a large change like reworking the entire food gathering/eating/etc. system.

&gt; You pack an entire theory of knowledge into pain. Of pain is as directed as you say, then it can't be a simple response.

I suspect I'm misunderstanding directed. When the doctor hits that spot below your kneecap to make you kick, is that response not directed at the spot below your kneecap?

&gt; What mutation do you propose that will that an insensitive state and turn it into a pain-sensitive one?

Simple creatures have certain responses, like for example thigmotaxis. Negative thigmotaxis is the response to move away from touch. Further develop this, and you may get different nerves on the skin, which can tell the difference between a touch and something that breaks the skin, and if the breaking the skin ones produce the recoil effect, that would be pain. Right? 

&gt; How do you know the object remains distinct?

I'm not sure what you mean.

&gt; If science is only interested in the human perspective with an optimistic fideism

Genuine question, what other perspective is there?

&gt; Rather, science uses perspective as a ladder. One can't kick the ladder out from under oneself and remain in the same place.

Isn't the Hard Problem about kicking someone else's ladder over? I don't mean to be coy, I'm genuinely asking. I thought the point was it was difficult for me to understand your perspective from my perspective.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-01 16:07:03 :

&gt; Am I wrong to say that this is different form, instead? Both perform the same function: transmition of data based on inputs.

You might not be wrong, but it is worth noting that there is a question to be asked here. Both kinds of neurons are argueably defined by their information related properties; That's to say that both serve a role in transfering and/or storing information with a connective system. Data isn't merely information, but information with a structure that allows for inference and evidence. Even for sets of data in which there is no or weak correlation, individual data points represent pieces of information with a referent and a view for how the information fits into our inner representation.

BNN screen information for the data of human life: the things that read, things that are intelligible. ANN don't seem to be as picky about the information they shift through. They don't, as a group, comb through information actively looking for tropes or archetypes as humans do looking for data. Some ANN do seem to do something like this when they develop features or follow a procedure like I described. None are capable of self-organization through this method, though. This is the core of my skepticism.

&gt; Able-bodied, but not conscious, right? Quadriplegics are still fully conscious by any reasonable standard.

Right, but 99% of the quadriplegics we know have had exposure to the practices of using the body at some point in their life, It's a condition overwhelmingly caused by traumatic injury or degenerative conditions. Someone that was born without the use of their body from birth might be profoundly disabled. Remember we are including things like speech or even the manipulation of prosthetic implements as in writing. It seems reasonable to suppose that a life-long vegetable would have cognitive impairments.

&gt; Ok, but again, why isn't the air?

I think this is all a matter of higher-order organizational properties. The air isn't part of your mind because it is too chaotic relative to the body; This mismatch makes operations necessary for information processing impossible. The air-body system lacks the level of integration that the body system alone has.

Conversely, a fighter pilot and his jet are highly integrated in virtue of the design of the pilot's training. The pilot-fighter system is far more integrated than the air-body system. It isn't quite as integrated as just a body, though. Finding out what is necessary for consciousness will require us to look at the degree of information integration and the kinds of things being integrated.

&gt; That seems like a pretty extreme stance to take. The theoretical models of AI we have (like the Stamp Collector) have a model of the world, and a way to take input and produce output. That's it. What about that needs a body?

The modeling part is where you need a body; When I think 'models', I always think about bodies. Puns aside, it's our embodied sense that allows us to model as beings in the world. Sensory information laid against information about bodily all integrated into reoccuring top-down metrics, this is our inner representation of the world. This is what makes us generally intelligent. The fact that we actively coordinate information all of these sources of information into a coherent world is the miracle of consciousness.

&gt; ... he says that's not a practical possibility, because a model of the world is kind of a magic thing. But if you had a way to predict the results of actions (so, not a real model of reality, but an approximate one), that could work. (The video on AI Self Improvement says basically that).

He doesn't say it's magic; he says it is beyond our current concrete comprehension. He simply admits that he is engaging in a thought experiment about theorhetical implication of bare notions. I thought he was just staying neutral on what inner representation ultimately is and prays that we can intuit what he means by it.

&gt; Ok, I guess I can get behind that. But am I wrong to say everyone has a definition for pain? Even if it's not the same, doesn't the fact that it's something everyone has suggest something similar to what I've said?

I don't think people typically have definitions of pain ready at hand. If you asked someone what they were talking about when they say 'pain', you'll get an answer contrived in the face of what they were currently talking about. Their is no general definition they are appealing to. I'm sure their is some vulgar human fact that is present during every pain experience but:

1. I don't think this vulgar fact is wholly explainable in terms of some evolutionary story.

2. I think it would be a mistake to interpret what people mean by 'pain' in terms of accidental facts they may or may not be aware of. 

&gt; Do you not feel pain during all those things? If not, I'm sorry, I guess I just don't talk to people enough to know...

I'm fine lumping in general suffering in with pain. I don't think there is a sharp distinction between 'natural' pains and man-made or emotional pains. It's all pain to me. You are the one who criticized my for over-generalizing pain by talking about suffering. All I'm trying to say is that we've been talking about suffering all along.

&gt; You're constantly seeing different things. How would that not affect things? Can't I appeal to the experience of people to show this as well?

If pain is something specific in the pain, then all this extra information on non-pain related stuff shouldn't make a difference in the first place. If my bowl is a thing on my table and I set me coffee pot down next to it, it is still the very same bowl. Pain, in contrast, changes it's only important feature, (being painful), in light of juxtaposition with other experiences.

&gt; Just because you don't notice the pain is coming from your finger doesn't mean it didn't, right? Am I misunderstanding? Does this not make it directed?

Speaking from person experience, I had no idea where the pain was coming from for what seemed like 30 seconds or so. Interestingly enough, I was already putting pressure on the wound by the time I realized the pain was coming from my hand. My experience wasn't directed in that I wasn't conscious of a belief or attittude towards the world that my body then responded to; My experience was directed in that I responded as a living thing, acting on instinct and towards self-preservation. My pain wasn't directed but my actions were.

&gt; Ok. If I understood that all, it sounds fair enough. I think it jives with my ideas as well, or at least, doesn't preclude physicalism.

Not at all; this is like a direct rejection of physicalism. I'm saying that physical things are fundamentally grounded in reality by a-physical things. This is like a Mathematical Platonism or a Process Philosophy. I'm granting the same status to physical objects that you would accord to ideas: they are specific manifestations of reality that tell us little about reality in its own right.

&gt; Yes. I promise I do. It's just the part of that I thought was relevant to the claim of chemistry was ""However, taste is clearly robust in its own right."" And I guess I misunderstood, since I didn't see your point, or what you meant.

It's OK. Sorry for accusing you of willfully misunderstanding. For clarification, I meant that taste experiences aren't fully reducible to the individual components of a meal alone. We synthesize and over-lay all the information we recieve in order experience data like 'chicken' or 'fish'. What separates 'chicken' from total invention is the fact that we have entire ways of living built around concepts like 'chicken'. Whereas fictions can support festivals or conventions, concepts like chicken support entire lives. It isn't just the mutual recognition of flavor by others, but the cases built around the management of the ingredient and rules that fall out of those cases. If we are going to take an unprejudice look at our concepts to decide what we should take as the serious data of life, I think so-called emergent properties often deserve much higher billing.

&gt; I suspect I'm misunderstanding directed. When the doctor hits that spot below your kneecap to make you kick, is that response not directed at the spot below your kneecap?

There are neurons in my body firing information to and from my knees constantly. The doctor hitting my knee exploits a hiccup in this information relay system that short-circuits a behavior. Nothing is particularly directed in this scenario, since the information would have flowed regards of whether the extra-input from the doctor happened or not. Physiological reflexes are automatic just as raising one end of a see-saw by pushing down on the other is automatic. 

&gt; I'm not sure what you mean.

You are appealing to properties in currently unobserved objects that makes it possible to observe them later. Presumably, you got this information from observing something and assuming that these properties will endure. You are assuming that the object is something that can be identified by the same properties later.

&gt; Isn't the Hard Problem about kicking someone else's ladder over? I don't mean to be coy, I'm genuinely asking. I thought the point was it was difficult for me to understand your perspective from my perspective.

The short form, with out all the extra trappings, is just the claim that we can't facts about perspective a-perspectively. You could run it as a personal problem by asking, ""I see that I am conscious, but why is it that I am conscious?"" Phrasing it in terms of others and ourselves was my twist. If you think that science just accpets that things seems a certain way and never attempts to explain to fact of that anything seems, then you think science isn't in the business of solving this 'problem'. It isn't a problem in this sense, but an admission of the limits of scientific understanding in principle.

Right?

We feel pain from things shy of cuts, though. Bruises and pinches hurt, but don't break the skin. It seems as if the ability to move away from stimuli of any valence would be enough to secure whatever evolutionary benefit you need anyways. The benefit comes from moving away rather than experiencing pain. If pain doesn't motivate the movement, but instead is predicated on the pre-existence of the movements, then it seems like a spandrel to me.

awenonian @ 2017-02-02 22:22:27 :

&gt; None are capable of self-organization through this method, though. This is the core of my skepticism.

What do you mean by self-organization? That they need a person to tell them the right answers to learn? If so, what about the ones that I talked about in the ecosystem simulation? No one told them what to do, they just happened to become good at surviving.

&gt; It seems reasonable to suppose that a life-long vegetable would have cognitive impairments.

I'm not convinced. I don't think a bodily impairment would necessarily imply a cognitive one.

&gt; Conversely, a fighter pilot and his jet are highly integrated in virtue of the design of the pilot's training. The pilot-fighter system is far more integrated than the air-body system. It isn't quite as integrated as just a body, though. 

Ok, so I don't know where you stand on this. Could anything that's not a part of your body (as a loose definition, enclosed by your skin, save for established orifices (mouth, nose, ears, etc.)) be part of your mind? For instance, I think a tool like a hammer in your hand is about as integrated as a muscle, right?

&gt; Sensory information laid against information about bodily all integrated into reoccuring top-down metrics, this is our inner representation of the world.

I still completely fail to see why this sensory information needs to be laid against a body. Our weather prediction models don't have a body, just some tools that provide sensory input, but it's undisputably a model. I'd agree if you counted those tools as a body, but then Skynet and ""disembodied computer gods living in cyber-space"" are totally viable, by just accessing tools or data produced by those tools through the internet.

&gt; He doesn't say it's magic;

[""This is the thing that's a bit magic""](https://youtu.be/tcdVC4e6EV4?t=3m43s)

&gt; I thought he was just staying neutral on what inner representation ultimately is and prays that we can intuit what he means by it.

What he means is that it has a way to predict the results of it's actions to a high degree of accuracy. [""The point is, this allows it to make accurate predictions about what will happen if it does different things.""](https://youtu.be/tcdVC4e6EV4?t=3m48s)

&gt; I don't think this vulgar fact is wholly explainable in terms of some evolutionary story.

Well, I think on this front we may just have to agree to disagree. I think that at least the ""vulgar fact"" is explainable, even if the totality of pain isn't.

&gt; I think it would be a mistake to interpret what people mean by 'pain' in terms of accidental facts they may or may not be aware of.

I don't think it matters whether they are aware of it or not. Your brain does a lot of stuff without you knowing consciously, in your sub-conscious.

&gt; You are the one who criticized my for over-generalizing pain by talking about suffering. All I'm trying to say is that we've been talking about suffering all along.

I'm pretty sure my problem wasn't with you equating pain and suffering, but with the equation of suffering and existence. Regardless, I think at this point we're more or less in agreement on this front.

&gt; If pain is something specific in the pain, then all this extra information on non-pain related stuff shouldn't make a difference in the first place.

Hm. I think I see what you're saying. I think that this isn't necessarily the case, but I'm not sure. Let me give an example, and you can tell me if I'm on or off track:

&gt; If my bowl is a thing on my table and I set me coffee pot down next to it, it is still the very same bowl.

Yes, but with the coffee pot present, there's more things to divide your attention between. The bowl might not have changed, but you may notice it less.

&gt; My pain wasn't directed but my actions were.

Hmm. See, I'd think that the fact that your actions were directed was evidence that the pain was. Your actions certainly were a result of the pain, and how they knew where to go was because on some level you did know where the pain was coming from. Is this the wrong way to look at it?

&gt; Not at all; this is like a direct rejection of physicalism.

Maybe that's how you intended it, but it's not how I read it. What you said in that paragraph seemed totally on par with what I'd expect from the physical model of the brain. For instance:

&gt; Rather, every object we can interact with is essentially a collection of individual ideas working in concert.

Every object creates a response based on the stimuli it helps produce. These ""ideas"" are what give our brain the model of the object we have in our head. 

&gt; Ideas here are like simple moments that are juxtaposed in regular patterns. The regularity of these patterns gives rise to our impression of physical potency and natural law.

The regularity of the stimuli produced by the objects allows creation of a coherent model. If they were irregular, we wouldn't have a good idea of how the object is, because we'd have conflicting results.

&gt; I'm saying that physical things are fundamentally grounded in reality by a-physical things.

This seems like an Occam's razorable position though. We know the world is made of atoms, which are made of protons, neutrons, electrons, and some other stuff. This is demonstrable. If you want to say that these particles are made of ideas, that's fine, but why? What does it add?

&gt; I'm granting the same status to physical objects that you would accord to ideas: they are specific manifestations of reality that tell us little about reality in its own right.

Clearly though, outside our head, at a macroscopic level the world operates on physical object interactions. There's miles more stuff out there that works without human intervention, clearly on the principles of physical object interaction (e.g. just to get it as far from living thing interaction as possible: all the stuff that we know about space). How can physical objects tell us little about reality when they make up so much of it?

&gt; If we are going to take an unprejudice look at our concepts to decide what we should take as the serious data of life, I think so-called emergent properties often deserve much higher billing.

But emergent properties are just that: Emergent. They come from somewhere, they aren't just spontaneously created. In this case, yes, we register the combination of chicken and pepper as different than the some of it's parts, but that doesn't mean that something extra came from nowhere. It's still just the chicken taste, and the pepper taste, and how they interact in our head.

&gt; Nothing is particularly directed in this scenario, since the information would have flowed regards of whether the extra-input from the doctor happened or not. 

This argument isn't limited to physiological reflexes. Information, as you said, is constantly running between parts of your body. Nothing would be directed in this case, because it's not like without it the information wouldn't have run, it just would've been different information.

&gt; You are assuming that the object is something that can be identified by the same properties later.

Sure. What's the issue with this? I mean, it's the case for everything we do observe. Everything in your house is the same after you've left and come back (well, if you live alone, and so no one else moved it).

&gt; If you think that science just accpets that things seems a certain way and never attempts to explain to fact of that anything seems,

Even if we're examining from a perspective, we do attempt to explain these things if I'm not misunderstanding. We've done work to understand how eyes work, how tongues work, etc. The ""we only explain how things seem to work"" is that the only explanation we've come up with that fits the data we have is the rod/cone retina blah blah thing. It's not the only concievable explanation, though.

When I say that science only explains how things seem, I mean something like this: It's concievable that instead of cones interacting with light on a molecular level to produce a response that sends a signal to the brain, there's just a magic field around it that does all of that processing for us, and produces the signal, and the molecular hardware just happens to be there. There's nothing wrong with that, and it's certainly possible (well, given that I didn't make mistakes in how eyes work), and, more to the point, there's no way we can prove that that isn't how it works. 

If we were able to come up with a reasonable explanation that shows how the brain works to achieve consciousness, we could have similar problems where you could chalk some bits up to magic and not break anything. And we couldn't tell you that that's for sure not how it works. Therefore, science only explains how things seem to work. But would that explanation not fit your bill (discount, for the sake of this example, whether or not you think it's actually possible to come up with this explanation)?

awenonian @ 2017-02-02 22:22:40 :

&gt; We feel pain from things shy of cuts, though. Bruises and pinches hurt, but don't break the skin.

Then have it be a pressure nerve that only fires after a certain threshold. I don't know exactly why pinches hurt, but bruises are because something broke (I think small blood vessels?), so regardless, something recording damage.

&gt; It seems as if the ability to move away from stimuli of any valence would be enough to secure whatever evolutionary benefit you need anyways.

Possibly. But if you are a creature capable of thinking about it's own thoughts, then you might consider ""why did I move away from that?"" The answer would probably be pain, right? Further, you can learn from it.

This isn't just a simple reflex, like hitting your knee and causing you to kick. As much can be seen in a variant called rheotaxis, or a response to fluid flow. In an aquatic creature (like a planarian (a type of flatworm, I only bring them up, because we messed with them in biology class, so I have experience on that front)) this causes them to move opposite the current, allowing them to stay in one place. If it were just a reflex, how could it command an action as complex as movement (this is movement like walking, not movement like kicking your leg)? Therefore, it must, on some level, reach the brain for some decision making.

&gt; If pain doesn't motivate the movement, but instead is predicated on the pre-existence of the movements, then it seems like a spandrel to me.

I'd think pain is the acknowledgement of the stimulus. So, pain doesn't motivate the movement, but isn't predicated on the pre-existence of it, instead, both flow from the same cause.

On a not-so-side note, you keep using the word ""spandrel"". From previous context (""God's workshop"") I assumed it meant some sort of arbitrary tool. Looking into it, it has a biological meaning as well (which doesn't fit the previous context, I don't think, but neither does the one about arches, so I'm not sure what I missed there), which may apply to what I said above. If such is the case, then I'd like to bring this up:

Unlike thigmotaxis, pain brings information. A planarian in a bramble bush (ignore that they're aquatic for now) would move away from the thorns, but may in doing so crash into other thorns. Even if it finds its way out, it may walk back in because it didn't learn anything, it was just reacting. A human who gets caught in a bramble bush may learn to avoid bramble bushes in the future, because of their past experience. 

I had to split up my reply to fit, so I'm putting the relevant bits as replies to separate posts. I have the whole thing written up in reserve though, so if you have a better solution to how I should post this, I'll do my best to oblige.

KDJones @ 2017-02-03 16:33:53 :

&gt; What do you mean by self-organization? That they need a person to tell them the right answers to learn? If so, what about the ones that I talked about in the ecosystem simulation? No one told them what to do, they just happened to become good at surviving.

You'll have to remind me on what the eco-system example was exactly. But, you seem to capture the long and short of what I was saying. AIs obviously have varying levels of autonomy, but none that we currently have is both complex enough and autonomous enough to warrant being called 'conscious'. I think this is uncontroversial. Future AI might be conscious, but we know current approaches are limited.

&gt; I'm not convinced. I don't think a bodily impairment would necessarily imply a cognitive one.

So you think someone that never learns to:

Speak
Listen
Read
Write
Do Mathematics
Learn History
Interact with Others

Is just as conscious as you or I? That seems strange, because even animals are capable of doing some of those things.

&gt; Ok, so I don't know where you stand on this. Could anything that's not a part of your body (as a loose definition, enclosed by your skin, save for established orifices (mouth, nose, ears, etc.)) be part of your mind? For instance, I think a tool like a hammer in your hand is about as integrated as a muscle, right?

That's right; this is known as the extended mind thesis.

&gt; I still completely fail to see why this sensory information needs to be laid against a body. Our weather prediction models don't have a body, just some tools that provide sensory input, but it's undisputably a model...

It isn't true by definition that 'seeing' entails 'being embodied' because people think silly things like that ghosts are watching them. We can tell stories like this in ignorance of physiology and in light of a common-sense folk psychology. However, this doesn't imply that sight as we actually use it doesn't depend on embodied experience.

I'm not trying to say that all models must function as we function, either. I'm trying to show that the only system that we can say for certain is conscious and has something to do with mental properties, the human body, works in the manner outlined above. If you want to propose an alternative route to conscious experience, you will literally need to work from scratch. Since you can't provide any definite information on relating to consciousness, that seems like a bold move.

&gt;&gt; He doesn't say it's magic; he says it is beyond our current concrete comprehension.

&gt; ""This is the thing that's a bit magic."" ""We don't really know how to build an accurate model of reality."" ""The point is, this allows it to make accurate predictions about what will happen if it does different things."" 

I know requoting myself is arrogant, but you totally cut my comment out of context. With the middle quote from the video included above, I think it's clear to see how one could charitably interpret what I'm said out of the video. He is glossing over something incredibly complex, (all of epistemology and a fair part of philosophy of mind), in order to talk about the topic at hand. He does mean that it's literally magic; he was speaking figuratively.

&gt; Well, I think on this front we may just have to agree to disagree. I think that at least the ""vulgar fact"" is explainable, even if the totality of pain isn't.

Perhaps you've misunderstood the what the vulgar fact is. The vulgar fact is everything that just happens to be true about pain. If the universe was only filled with silicon-based life, then the vulgar fact about pain might be, ""Pain involves silicon."" This is an accidental fact that just happens to apply to everything by extension.

&gt; I don't think it matters whether they are aware of it or not. Your brain does a lot of stuff without you knowing consciously, in your sub-conscious.

If you think that you can be in pain without feeling pain, then something has gotten jumpbled up here. I thought pain was a feeling; Shouldn't pain be identical with a conscious experience?

&gt; Yes, but with the coffee pot present, there's more things to divide your attention between. The bowl might not have changed, but you may notice it less.

Attention is something we do as a system. If you want to re-assert a tiny intention inside of your mind to explain how conscious experience works, then we've arrived at another humunculous.

&gt; Hmm. See, I'd think that the fact that your actions were directed was evidence that the pain was. Your actions certainly were a result of the pain, and how they knew where to go was because on some level you did know where the pain was coming from. Is this the wrong way to look at it?

I'd say it's wrong. I'd say that my actions preceded my pain, insofar as my actions preceded the sensation of pain. If you mean something else by pain besides a sensation, then we need to go back to the drawing board on a lot of this.

&gt; Every object creates a response based on the stimuli it helps produce. These ""ideas"" are what give our brain the model of the object we have in our head.

I guess I should have put scare quotes around object. I'm not saying there is an object that explains why you have ideas in your head. I'm saying the same things that make the world appear as if it has objects explain why ideas appear in the mind. Platonic entities are responsible for both mental events and physical objects.

&gt; The regularity of the stimuli produced by the objects allows creation of a coherent model. If they were irregular, we wouldn't have a good idea of how the object is, because we'd have conflicting results.

See, here you say that objects produce stimuli. I'd say that objects are only proximal causes for our experiences. They are the shortest route between someone asking, ""What are you thinking about?"" and the end of the conversation. They don't fully account for our experiences. We might never have a full account, but approaching consciousness with an eye for more essential causes will be more fruitful than assuming ideas are objects in the brain.

&gt; This seems like an Occam's razorable position though. We know the world is made of atoms, which are made of protons, neutrons, electrons, and some other stuff. This is demonstrable. If you want to say that these particles are made of ideas, that's fine, but why? What does it add?

It adds truth, hopefully.  We've already discussed discoveries in QM that cast doubt on the definite qualities that these parts are assumed to have. We've talked about the Incompleteness theorem where it is relevant to determinability. And, we are beginning to talk about whether higher-order properties can be more fundamental than their parts. I agree that reductive materialists don't typically feel the need to add to the system intimated above, but that doesn't imply there aren't criticisms.

&gt; Clearly though, outside our head, at a macroscopic level the world operates on physical object interactions...

You won't get any argument from me so long as you stick to your original position that science is about the human perspective. That the universe seems certain ways from a human perspective is fine in my book.

&gt; But emergent properties are just that: Emergent. They come from somewhere, they aren't just spontaneously created. In this case, yes, we register the combination of chicken and pepper as different than the some of it's parts, but that doesn't mean that something extra came from nowhere. It's still just the chicken taste, and the pepper taste, and how they interact in our head.

I did add so-called here, because I think calling these properties emergent leads to the assumptions you make here. Not everything that has a beginning is unessential. This is an assumption that goes back to Aristotle, (see frequentism), but there are other ways of glossing necessity. This is abundantly clear when we talk about natural law, since all material things are created. If being created was enough to rule out necessity, then there could be no genuine physical law. There would only be emergent cosmic coincidence.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-03 17:00:21 :

I'm not sure I can stop the swell in these posts. I definitely needed 2.

&gt; Sure. What's the issue with this? I mean, it's the case for everything we do observe. Everything in your house is the same after you've left and come back (well, if you live alone, and so no one else moved it).

You are assuming that there is an objective category, 'house', that has certain definite properties over time and a set nature. What you observe is that there is a thing when you leave, 'house in the morning', and a thing that you see later, 'house in the evening'. Nothing inherent in these things links them together as one-in-the-same besides you assumption that they are the same thing. This assumption turns out to be apparently reliable in life, but justification for the assumption lay in facts about the way things actually are.

&gt; Even if we're examining from a perspective, we do attempt to explain these things if I'm not misunderstanding. We've done work to understand how eyes work, how tongues work, etc. The ""we only explain how things seem to work"" is that the only explanation we've come up with that fits the data we have is the rod/cone retina blah blah thing. It's not the only concievable explanation, though.

I know you aren't used to this kind of argument, but I promise I'm not trying to go full Pyrrho, here. I'm not trying to assert that things are the opposite of what they seem. I'm trying to give you fresh perspective on empiricism. I see some many self-proclaimed empiricists resign themselves to a window of accuracy rather than definite claims about things observed. I'm trying to make you see this is a fool's errand.

You keep saying that all you need to explain is what you see, but you keep making assumptions about what exactly you are seeing. These assumptions are fine as long as they can be vindicated by internal metrics for consistency or external metrics for work in the world. You totally swear off the second category, so you are trapped within the first.

&gt; Then have it be a pressure nerve that only fires after a certain threshold. I don't know exactly why pinches hurt, but bruises are because something broke (I think small blood vessels?), so regardless, something recording damage.

Damage is a normative concept. Being damaged essentially means being in bad shape. If individual celluar interactions can make decisions about what's good or bad, then they are exercising conscious capacities in their own rights.

&gt; Possibly. But if you are a creature capable of thinking about it's own thoughts, then you might consider ""why did I move away from that?"" The answer would probably be pain, right? Further, you can learn from it.
This isn't just a simple reflex, like hitting your knee and causing you to kick. 

It sounds like we are talking about an internal model. Reflecting on a self-model, we might start to notice some commonalities and begin to lump things together in general categories as we do. Pain might be one of those quick and dirty categories. This is all predicated on the ability to model ourselves to ourselves, though.

As just a side note, I know you think that any plain model is a model of itself, but this might be the time to revist this idea. It seems like being able to model ourselves is a significant capacity let's us do work that mere models can't.

&gt; Unlike thigmotaxis, pain brings information. A planarian in a bramble bush (ignore that they're aquatic for now) would move away from the thorns, but may in doing so crash into other thorns. Even if it finds its way out, it may walk back in because it didn't learn anything, it was just reacting. A human who gets caught in a bramble bush may learn to avoid bramble bushes in the future, because of their past experience.

It seems like memory is really what we should be talking about then. Pain seems to be a side project that merely aides in the most important difference in behavior: how the presence of memory affects our interpretations of the actions around us.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-04 02:20:32 :

&gt; You'll have to remind me on what the eco-system example was exactly.

If you put a bunch of characters, each controlled by a neural network, with given inputs (like sound, sight, etc.) and outputs (like, movement, or making sound), and ""breed"" them together, you'd happen to end up with ones that perform well at surviving, just by the virtue of how evolution works.

&gt; Future AI might be conscious, but we know current approaches are limited.

Sure. No arguement there.

&gt; So you think someone that never learns to:
Speak Listen Read Write Do Mathematics Learn History Interact with Others

What about these require a body? Computers do all of these things, but you didn't seem to think they could qualify as conscious, because they lack a body.

&gt; That's right; this is known as the extended mind thesis.

So, is there a reason why this makes more sense than saying that those things aren't part of your mind? Or is it really just a difference in definition?

&gt; However, this doesn't imply that sight as we actually use it doesn't depend on embodied experience.

I think this spawned because you said that a neural network wasn't embodied, despite being in a computer. We have cameras that could provide input as sight to a computer, why does this not count?

&gt; I'm trying to show that the only system that we can say for certain is conscious and has something to do with mental properties, the human body, works in the manner outlined above.

Sure, but not all of it is necessary. Unless you want to state that only things that are human could ever be conscious, there are clearly unnecessary bits. If a thing can take in various inputs, I don't see why they'd need to be our inputs, or even in our way. Why would any input not qualify?

&gt; I know requoting myself is arrogant, but you totally cut my comment out of context.

I did, but I don't think my point fails. The point was, the model used in the thought experiment is impossible. It's too accurate. A model that works well enough could be made, and this is said in another video on Self Learning (basically, we might not be able to make a perfect model of reality, but a smart AI that could rewrite itself could, if rewriting represented a positive feedback loop of gaining intelligence, create something exceedingly close to it). But the model presented, which was A. perfectly able to predict the results of actions and B. able to search through the entire search space in a non-absurd amount of time, is impossible (side note, either of these abilities make the model impossible, not just the combination of both). That's why he called it magic.

&gt; The vulgar fact is everything that just happens to be true about pain.

But why would the thing that's common about every pain experience not be the result of some evolutionary fact? If it's common among everyone in the entire species, wouldn't they're common evolutionary history do well to explain it?

&gt; Shouldn't pain be identical with a conscious experience?

Pain is part of a conscious experience, but there are a lot of things that are present in a consious experience. If pain happens to take a back seat because something else puts it there, that doesn't mean it wasn't there. I don't know how things like painkillers work, but I don' think they stop nerves from sending the response to the brain.

&gt; If you want to re-assert a tiny intention inside of your mind to explain how conscious experience works, then we've arrived at another humunculous.

Maybe the part of your brain responsible for keeping attention isn't the same as the part that feels pain. Maybe some part regulates what information gets passed to the forefront of your mind, like for example, there's a lot of stuff you know, but isn't relevant to this conversation, so it's just not present in the forefront of your mind, but is still in your mind on some level (you haven't forgotten it). This part doesn't have to be the same as that which registers and processes pain.

&gt; I'd say that my actions preceded my pain, insofar as my actions preceded the sensation of pain.

It preceded your conscious sensation of pain because wasting any processing on saying ""Oh f***!"" would've been a bad idea compared to trying to stop the bleeding.

&gt; I guess I should have put scare quotes around object.

I didn't mean them as scare quotes, I meant them as ""This encodes a lot of information in a deceptively simple term"".

&gt; Platonic entities are responsible for both mental events and physical objects.

So, if everything is made of ideas, why isn't everything animate? Sure, some things, like rocks, don't have that capability, but after you die your muscles still work (we can make them work with electricity), so if they still are made of ideas, why don't they move?

&gt; They don't fully account for our experiences.

What sorts of things do you think about besides objects, and thinking about objects (and thinking about thinking about objects, and ....)?

&gt; It adds truth, hopefully.

Does it explain anything else? If not, then it can be Occam's razored, because it's more assuming more than the alternate. If so, you should lead with that.

&gt; We've already discussed discoveries in QM that cast doubt on the definite qualities that these parts are assumed to have. We've talked about the Incompleteness theorem where it is relevant to determinability. 

Sure, how do ideas as a fundamental thing help explain these?

&gt; And, we are beginning to talk about whether higher-order properties can be more fundamental than their parts.

You lost me here. This seems contradictory right on it's head. If they're higher-order, then they aren't more fundamental, by the definition of fundamental.

&gt; That the universe seems certain ways from a human perspective is fine in my book.

And I'm guessing that you're trying to argue that there are things beyond human perspective? The problem is that they have no effect on the universe. If they did, they wouldn't be beyond our perspective. If it only affects things outside our perspective, why do we care? What can be gained by knowing the answer to those questions (which, by that token are unknowable anyway)?

&gt; Not everything that has a beginning is unessential.

So, I don't know what you mean here. I don't see how it relates to what we were talking about.

&gt; This is abundantly clear when we talk about natural law, since all material things are created.

To start, as I said, I don't really understand what you mean here, so this may be me just disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing, but I'd like to say this: Are you sure? The Law of Conservation of Mass says that matter is never created or destroyed, it's just rearranged (baring nuclear processes, in which matter is converted to energy by E=mc^2, but this sort of suggests that matter and energy are the same in some sense). All material things weren't created, they just existed. Before the universe existed, well, that's not really a correct thing to say. Time didn't exist before the universe, so there isn't a ""before"" the universe. In that sense, all material things just existed for all of time. The natural laws weren't really created either, because they've existed for all of time as well.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-04 02:20:41 :

&gt; What you observe is that there is a thing when you leave, 'house in the morning', and a thing that you see later, 'house in the evening'.

I don't know if this really gets at the point, but seeing as there's more than one person in the world, you can put a cup on the table, and have your friend look at it while you look away and back. Your friend can then confirm that the cup didn't change.

&gt; This assumption turns out to be apparently reliable in life, but justification for the assumption lay in facts about the way things actually are.

So, back to the problem of Induction, then? Didn't we earlier resolve this to ""yeah, we can't solve this, but we'll just accept it as the way things are""? Like, I get it, but if we don't allow induction, then we can't really say we know anything about the world that we interact with. (That is, not things like maths.)

&gt; I see some many self-proclaimed empiricists resign themselves to a window of accuracy rather than definite claims about things observed.

Well, of course. How many things do I need to drop to assert that things fall when dropped? If I'm looking for a window of accuracy, I can do it fairly quickly. If I'm looking for definite claims, then I don't know if I can ever make that claim. I've never owned, and thus never dropped, a mac laptop, so maybe *they* don't fall when dropped. Right? Am I misunderstanding?

&gt; These assumptions are fine as long as they can be vindicated by internal metrics for consistency or external metrics for work in the world.

So, what do you mean by those terms? ""Internal metrics for consistency""? Like, if we meet a certain standard, we've met that internal metric? ""External metrics for work in the world""? I don't know what you mean by that.

&gt; If individual celluar interactions can make decisions about what's good or bad,

Calling it a decision seems like a misnomer. A cell can record damage without making (at least a conscious) decision by, for example, containing a chemical inside it's membrane. If that membrane breaks, the chemical leaks, which can set off various things the same way any other neuron could. This breakage kills the cell, which is unequivocally damage. We, as a multicellular organism, don't care much if the one cell breaks: we can regrow them.

&gt; This is all predicated on the ability to model ourselves to ourselves, though.

I think it's important to note that we don't model a cohesive ourselves to a cohesive ourselves. We model parts of ourselves to other parts of ourselves. 

&gt; It seems like being able to model ourselves is a significant capacity let's us do work that mere models can't.

Yes, you're right. The difference here isn't that we *are* a model of ourselves, but we *have* an internal model of ourselves. Obviously, such a model isn't fully accurate (it couldn't be, there's a proof for this.) but it's workable for our purposes most of the time.

&gt; It seems like memory is really what we should be talking about then.

This seems like an accurate assessment to me.

So this all takes place in a computer program? No actual things are moving around or anything?

&gt; What about these require a body? Computers do all of these things, but you didn't seem to think they could qualify as conscious, because they lack a body.

We use computers to do all of those things. We might design them to act with varying levels of autonomy, but we are the impetus behind all of those activities. Computers are tools for us.

&gt; So, is there a reason why this makes more sense than saying that those things aren't part of your mind? Or is it really just a difference in definition?

The extend mind thesis would make tools temporary extensions of your mind in virtue of new found capacities and modalities for action they bring to the mind.

&gt; I think this spawned because you said that a neural network wasn't embodied, despite being in a computer. We have cameras that could provide input as sight to a computer, why does this not count?

I'm sure we could research the development of Vision in AI. Clearly, just giving a camera to a machine isn't enough for vision, because people spent millions of dollars training NN to identify and track features.

&gt; Sure, but not all of it is necessary. Unless you want to state that only things that are human could ever be conscious, there are clearly unnecessary bits. If a thing can take in various inputs, I don't see why they'd need to be our inputs, or even in our way. Why would any input not qualify?

I don't know why exactly it doesn't qualify because I'm not God. I know that it doesn't qualify, because modern life is filled with automata that do what you described above. We both know that the human case does produce consciousness though, so we shouldn't assume that any particular part is unimportant, because it's the only lead we've got.

&gt; I did, but I don't think my point fails...

Fine, I guess you are just right about whatever you need to be right about. I'm sorry I didn't have all of this context from the entire video series where he defines all these terms to mean specific arbitrary things. Do you have an actual response to what I was saying or can we move?

&gt; But why would the thing that's common about every pain experience not be the result of some evolutionary fact? If it's common among everyone in the entire species, wouldn't they're common evolutionary history do well to explain it?

No! Evolution doesn't literally explain every truth about biological life. Some things are accidental and some are explained by other sciences like physics, chemistry, sociology, or whatever.

&gt; Pain is part of a conscious experience, but there are a lot of things that are present in a consious experience. If pain happens to take a back seat because something else puts it there, that doesn't mean it wasn't there. I don't know how things like painkillers work, but I don' think they stop nerves from sending the response to the brain.

So do pain killers stop pain from happening, or so they make pain not-painful?

&gt; Maybe the part of your brain responsible for keeping attention isn't the same as the part that feels pain.

It doesn't matter either way. Life isn't like Inside-Out. Pain and attention aren't standing around at the water cooler waiting to do their jobs.

&gt; Maybe some part regulates what information gets passed to the forefront of your mind, like for example, there's a lot of stuff you know, but isn't relevant to this conversation, so it's just not present in the forefront of your mind, but is still in your mind on some level (you haven't forgotten it). This part doesn't have to be the same as that which registers and processes pain.

I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

&gt; So, if everything is made of ideas, why isn't everything animate? Sure, some things, like rocks, don't have that capability, but after you die your muscles still work (we can make them work with electricity), so if they still are made of ideas, why don't they move?

Because ideas don't animate things in their own right. They aren't disembodied wills or ghosts. The principles that explain animation are thermodynamic principles of work combined with specific biological systems.

&gt; What sorts of things do you think about besides objects, and thinking about objects (and thinking about thinking about objects, and ....)?

This is an extensional claim: Every idea takes an object. I'm fine with this, though it might be controversial. The fact that 'Every idea takes an object' doesn't explain everything about ideas; this is closer to the claim.

&gt; Sure, how do ideas as a fundamental thing help explain these?

For you? Maybe not well, since you didn't really get the point in either of these sub-topics. A simple way to put it might be that we have good reason to believe that the world is not definite. QM is a physical theory that is open to this interpretation and Incompleteness theorem is a deductive proof against some forms of determinability. The appeal of objects is that they are definite; furthermore mereological sums of objects are also definite. However, if the universe is indeterminate, then it isn't ultimate a single definite thing. Therefore, objects can't be the only things in the universe. Rather, more fundamental reasons are at work, namely ideas.

awenonian @ 2017-02-04 19:57:04 :

&gt; So this all takes place in a computer program? No actual things are moving around or anything?

It's a simulation, so, yeah, nothing (save, electrons or whatever) is actually moving.

&gt; We use computers to do all of those things.

Most people don't use a computer to speak, but computers can speak (text to speech).

&gt; Computers are tools for us.

By this token, so are other people. We use people to do a lot of those things in the same way we use computers to. So what's the difference between those two?

&gt; The extend mind thesis would make tools temporary extensions of your mind in virtue of new found capacities and modalities for action they bring to the mind.

I think I can agree that if our hands are part of our minds, tools are as well. But the understanding of mind I had been working under doesn't include my hands. Maybe it should, it's certainly not a hard definition, but I hadn't considered my hands part of my mind, so, why should I?

&gt; Clearly, just giving a camera to a machine isn't enough for vision,

Image processing and vision are different things. But that's not the important part:

&gt; I'm sure we could research the development of Vision in AI.

And if we did, would it be able to be conscious? Or would it still lack a body and thus it's capability to be conscious?

&gt; I don't know why exactly it doesn't qualify because I'm not God.

It doesn't matter that you're not God. You're putting forward a definition of consciousness, and in that, you've included ""has a body"" (and that ""body"" means a certain thing as well, something that software can't achieve). I'm asking, why are you using this definition?

&gt; Do you have an actual response to what I was saying or can we move?

This is what you requoted, so I assume it's the relevant stuff:

&gt; He doesn't say it's magic; he says it is beyond our current concrete comprehension

I believe what I said was an actual response to this. It's not just ""beyond our current concrete comprehension"", it's not possible.

&gt; No! Evolution doesn't literally explain every truth about biological life.

Evolution does explain biological properties though. That's it's whole point, is it's the mechanism by which these properties came about.

&gt; Some things are accidental and some are explained by other sciences like physics, chemistry, sociology, or whatever.

Yes, but accidental things don't end up disseminated amongst the *entire* population of a species though. If they're purely accidental, there's no selection pressure, and you'd expect some people to have the trait and some to not.

As for being explained by other sciences, well, yeah. All of it is. These sciences aren't disparate, they're all the same. Biology doesn't happen instead of physics, it happens with physics, both in the sense of at the same time, and by virtue of.

&gt; So do pain killers stop pain from happening, or so they make pain not-painful?

I did just say I don't know how they work. If I had to guess, I'd say they make it not-painful, but, as I don't know how they work, I have nothing to back that up.

&gt; It doesn't matter either way. Life isn't like Inside-Out. Pain and attention aren't standing around at the water cooler waiting to do their jobs.

Why not? I mean, certainly they aren't people in their own right like in Inside-Out. But in a computer, you have a an Operating system that decides which processes get to run on the CPU. If this Operating System is ""Attention"" and ""Pain"" is one of the processes, it may well have to wait to do it's job, because there are more important processes running at this time. I may have misunderstood your point here, but it seems to me that a computer demonstrably does a similar task without a homunculus, so, why couldn't our brain?

&gt; I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

I was trying, and failing, to explain in greater depth what I said above. It's not important.

&gt; Because ideas don't animate things in their own right.

I don't think I understand your idea of ideas. What do they do? Is it like, rocks are thinking, but have no mechanism to express those thoughts? I feel like that's not what you mean, but I don't know anything closer.

&gt; The fact that 'Every idea takes an object' doesn't explain everything about ideas; this is closer to the claim.

Are we back to intentionality, or is there something else that they don't explain? I think I brought this example up before, and you didn't respond, but I don't know why. To shorten it, if I had some yellow flowers, and the light reflecting off of them was hitting a wall, would the yellow on the wall be ""about"" the flowers? Or is this different from intentionality?

&gt; Therefore, objects can't be the only things in the universe.

Just for clarification's sake, things like magnetic fields, while not something *I*'d call objects, are objects under this definition because they are determinate?

&gt; Rather, more fundamental reasons are at work, namely ideas.

So, I'm fine with something we don't understand being the explanation for QM stuff. I don't see how the same thing that decides when light acts like a particle and when it acts like a wave, or where on a distribution a particle will land, is responsible for the stuff that goes on in my head though. I won't deny they're related, after all, QM is happening in my head, so they have to be, but I don't see how they're the same thing.

Furthermore, what's the difficulty with understanding ideas? If there's some sort of ""idea-field"" that has effects on the world, why couldn't we study it?

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-05 14:19:38 :

&gt; I don't know if this really gets at the point...

The point is that you impose the idea that objects endure through time upon you experience. Everything is in flux; nothing remains literally unchanged. Therefore, any identity claim you are trying to make between the object of perception at moment A and the object of perception at moment B goes beyond mere observation.

&gt; So, back to the problem of Induction, then?

You are over-generalizing. This is a problem about a kind of knowledge, but it isn't a general rejection of induction. I'm basically pushing against how much is given in perception. You seem to be slipping back and forth between statements about what is present to you in perception and what you attribute as the causes of your perceptions. For example, you assumed here that having a house experience is to experience an enduring structure built by people etc. and that this is known by virtue of this perception. I don't see how everything we take to know about houses is present in a given house experience.

&gt; So, what do you mean by those terms? ""Internal metrics for consistency""? Like, if we meet a certain standard, we've met that internal metric? ""External metrics for work in the world""? I don't know what you mean by that.

Internal metric of consistency: The level of cohesion of a model with currently available information.

External metrics for work: Standards of mastery over a certain activity given practical projects and real world success.

&gt; A cell can record damage without making (at least a conscious) decision by, for example, containing a chemical inside it's membrane.

So pain is something that works on animal cells? Is non-cellular life incapable of pain by definition?

&gt; I think it's important to note that we don't model a cohesive ourselves to a cohesive ourselves. We model parts of ourselves to other parts of ourselves.

Sure, I don't really see a difference between this and what I said, frankly.

&gt; Yes, you're right. The difference here isn't that we are a model of ourselves, but we have an internal model of ourselves. Obviously, such a model isn't fully accurate (it couldn't be, there's a proof for this.) but it's workable for our purposes most of the time.

How does this substantially add to continuing the argument and advancing you thesis? It seems like you are just arguing minutia without knowing exactly where you're trying to take the discussion.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-05 18:58:38 :

&gt; Everything is in flux; nothing remains literally unchanged.

Sure, but from moment to moment, most of the stuff in what we call an ""object"" remains unchanged. It may have lost an atom here or there, or rearranged stuff slightly, but 99.99% of it  is the same from second to second. This is our idea of an object, something whose flux is rather small. If you burn a piece of paper, though the smoke is made up of the same particles, we don't call it the paper, because the amount that changed was very high, very fast. On the other hand, a miniscule amount of rubber rubbing off on the road as you drive your car is a small change, rather slowly, so the tire remains the same tire. This is just how we think of objects.

&gt; For example, you assumed here that having a house experience is to experience an enduring structure built by people etc. 

I brought up a house because it was something that would have objects in it that you would likely leave and come back to. I don't know where I said all this, I was just using it as evidence that objects endure while unobserved. It could've been any arbitrary collection of objects that you would be likely to revisit.

&gt; Internal metric of consistency: The level of cohesion of a model with currently available information.

&gt; External metrics for work: Standards of mastery over a certain activity given practical projects and real world success.

Under these definitions, why did you say this?

&gt; You totally swear off the second category, so you are trapped within the first.

Isn't this the goal of science? To show that it can create external metrics of work?

&gt; Is non-cellular life incapable of pain by definition?

No, cells having a mechanism for pain does not preclude other mechanisms for pain. Replace the cell and chemical detecting nerve with, I dunno, a water balloon and a water sensor or something, and you can have the same mechanism without cells (obviously this is imperfect, the water balloon sensor is bigger, etc.).

&gt; Sure, I don't really see a difference between this and what I said, frankly.

I believe I brought this up because it stresses that you can't model a part of yourself to itself. Which was important more because it was related to what we were saying in the other post, about how/whether pain is perceived. It may not have been as important a distinction as I thought.

&gt; How does this substantially add to continuing the argument and advancing you thesis?

It was addressing your side note: ""I know you think that any plain model is a model of itself, but this might be the time to revisit this idea."" My point was that this doesn't need revisiting, because this is a different scenario.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-06 15:07:13 :

&gt; It's a simulation, so, yeah, nothing (save, electrons or whatever) is actually moving.

If these are simulated animals 'feeding', 'breeding', and 'surviving', then I don't see how this changes much. Certainly none of these simulated animals are conscious any more than a character in a video game is conscious. I'm not worried about any of my childhood Pokemon the same way I worried about my childhood pets.

If you conjecture is that the entire ecosystem itself is conscious, then your definition seems explosive. If any organized ecosystem is conscious, then planets or galaxies must be conscious. That seems highly unlikely, or at less changes the current view of inanimate life substantially.

&gt; Most people don't use a computer to speak, but computers can speak (text to speech).

Seems pretty irrelevant. Computers speak the way puppets speak: very complicated puppets.

&gt; By this token, so are other people. We use people to do a lot of those things in the same way we use computers to. So what's the difference between those two?

That they are other people like us of course! This is a kind difference between sapient living things and inanimate tools. Sapient things have independent desires, while machines don't possess any desires apart from the desires of the machine's maker perhaps. We work cooperatively with others in mutual recognition of our independent desires; one only needs to recognize one set of desires when working with machines, namely their own.

&gt; I think I can agree that if our hands are part of our minds, tools are as well. But the understanding of mind I had been working under doesn't include my hands. Maybe it should, it's certainly not a hard definition, but I hadn't considered my hands part of my mind, so, why should I?

That's something you might have to decide for yourself. You've seen how Byzantine and difficult discussions of meaning in the head can be. Everyone has very certain opinions about their personal experience even when they aren't discussing Phil. Of Mind. I think these opinions carry over strongly into theoretical discussion. Extended Mind takes the conversation out of everyone's head and opens the discussion up to public participation. It might not be literally what you had in mind, but I think it will ultimately yield a more fruitful discussion.

&gt; And if we did, would it be able to be conscious? Or would it still lack a body and thus it's capability to be conscious?

I was talking about AI research up to now: contemporary research. The things we currently have don't seem conscious. I think we agree on that.

&gt;It doesn't matter that you're not God...

I wasn't trying to be flippant here. I'm sorry if it came across that way. This was just one line within a broader succinct argument:

""I know that [contemporary AI isn't conscious]... We both know that the human case does produce consciousness though... [And] it's the only lead we've got.

We know our consciousness is intimately tied into our bodies. We shouldn't assume this is an unimportant feature.

&gt; I believe what I said was an actual response to this. It's not just ""beyond our current concrete comprehension"", it's not possible.

Can you present the proof to me? I can't just take your word for it. It seems abundantly clear that something does have an internal model of reality, namely us. Imperfect models are still models.

&gt; Evolution does explain biological properties though. That's it's whole point, is it's the mechanism by which these properties came about.

For some, not all.

&gt; Yes, but accidental things don't end up disseminated amongst the entire population of a species though.

That is exactly what a spandrel is though. If you haven't read anything about spandrels by Steven J. Gould, then now's the time. I'm not claiming to be an expert and very smart people can disagree, but you should understand the claim before rejecting it.

&gt; As for being explained by other sciences, well, yeah. All of it is. These sciences aren't disparate, they're all the same. Biology doesn't happen instead of physics, it happens with physics, both in the sense of at the same time, and by virtue of.

How did our discussion on a unified science go earlier? No sarcasm; I really don't remember.

&gt; I did just say I don't know how they work. If I had to guess, I'd say they make it not-painful, but, as I don't know how they work, I have nothing to back that up.

1. There is no shame in googling this stuff. I do it like every reply.

2. Non-painful pain seems impossible to me like cold-hot things or giant dwarves. I'm not saying it's impossible, but pain is the salt of pain.

&gt; Why not? I mean, certainly they aren't people in their own right like in Inside-Out.

That's kind of the entire point of the metaphor, so I don't see what's left to argue about on this one.

&gt; But in a computer, you have a an Operating system that decides which processes get to run on the CPU. If this Operating System is ""Attention"" and ""Pain"" is one of the processes, it may well have to wait to do it's job, because there are more important processes running at this time.

Do you have any reason at all for supposing this hypothetical process actually takes place in the brain? This is a serious question. If you expect this to be the case because you assume the brain works like our computers work, then it isn't contributing as evidence. It's just speculation.

&gt; I don't think I understand your idea of ideas. What do they do? Is it like, rocks are thinking, but have no mechanism to express those thoughts? I feel like that's not what you mean, but I don't know anything closer.

Ideas are basically information. An idea here is some hypothetical infinitesimally small piece of information. Rocks have ideas insofar as information is encoded in rocks as we are familiar with them. Conscious life has ideas in virtue of analogical similarities between mental representations and ideas in the world. Ideas in the mind aren't the literally the same as ideas in the world, in fact conscious manifestations depend on unconscious manifestations. Being manifest is the core of being an idea though.

&gt; Are we back to intentionality, or is there something else that they don't explain?

Intentionality is always creeping around somewhere, but this is in response to your challenge to give an example of a non-object. I say I can't do that in virtue of what examples are. It doesn't reflect on the theory either way.

&gt; To shorten it, if I had some yellow flowers, and the light reflecting off of them was hitting a wall, would the yellow on the wall be ""about"" the flowers? Or is this different from intentionality?

I answered all of this specifically. I remember doing a long write up about it. I might not have quote the exact line, but I responded to the entire paragraph.

&gt; Just for clarification's sake, things like magnetic fields, while not something I'd call objects, are objects under this definition because they are determinate?

Right; they could be glossed as sets of properties relative to determinate objects.

&gt; I don't see how the same thing that decides when light acts like a particle and when it acts like a wave, or where on a distribution a particle will land, is responsible for the stuff that goes on in my head though.

I don't think there is a direct link either. Rather, it is a good example of non-determinism in science. It shows that the preferred explanation isn't necessarily mechanistic. Therefore, other fields of inquiry might likewise posit non-mechanistic explanations that are fruitful. I think the appeal of any theory of mind will be specific to minds being studied rather than other sciences.

&gt; Furthermore, what's the difficulty with understanding ideas? If there's some sort of ""idea-field"" that has effects on the world, why couldn't we study it?

I think you must be acting coy, because you've seen how difficult understanding the nature of ideas is. It is a deep puzzle that rests at the heart of our lived experiences. If it were easy, then people would know themselves better, but self-awareness is rare and cherished. Furthermore, I'd say the way we access ideas is precisely what makes them hard to understand. Ideas are present in a way that objects can't be. Ideas are ambiguous, multi-faceted, yet wholly present to us. Comparing this to extend cognition through tool-use is illuminating. Tools, including signs, are determinate, goal-oriented, and present in discreet stages.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-06 17:28:25 :

&gt; Sure, but from moment to moment, most of the stuff in what we call an ""object"" remains unchanged. 

You are trying to have your cake and eat it too.

Sorieties paradox are really interesting to me and a major topic throughout the history of philosophy. This conception of object isn't a given; it didn't just fall in our laps from out of the blue.

&gt; Isn't this the goal of science? To show that it can create external metrics of work?

Maybe, maybe not; it doesn't seem like you can remain agnostic about the import of observations and have the goal of creating external working models though. I think it might be worth discussing.

&gt; Replace the cell and chemical detecting nerve with, I dunno, a water balloon and a water sensor or something, and you can have the same mechanism without cells.

So does the balloon-sensor system feel pain?

&gt; It was addressing your side note: ""I know you think that any plain model is a model of itself, but this might be the time to revisit this idea."" My point was that this doesn't need revisiting, because this is a different scenario.

They seem related to me. What is the significant difference for you?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-06 20:43:00 :

&gt; Certainly none of these simulated animals are conscious any more than a character in a video game is conscious.

The difference is that neural nets learn. A video game character has rules built into it: Do this when this happens, etc. A neural net doesn't start with these rules. It just starts with it's inputs and outputs attached to data and actions (like, an input might be connected to a function that registers 'sound', and an output might be 'move left'), and it figures out how to utilize the outputs based on the inputs. Pokemon don't do this.

The simulated animals may not be conscious on a human level, but maybe an animal level (do you count animals as ""conscious""? Or are they something else?).

&gt; If you conjecture is that the entire ecosystem itself is conscious,

I don't.

&gt; Computers speak the way puppets speak: very complicated puppets.

Puppets don't generate sound themselves. And perhaps, more importantly, puppets aren't generic. Puppets say what the ventriloquist makes them say, nothing more, nothing less. A computer can take any random text, and output speech for it.

The difference between puppets and computers is a lot like the difference between computers and people in this regard. To paraphrase someone else, if you put a chess playing computer into a Google self driving car, it won't work. It doesn't understand the inputs or the outputs. Humans act as generic computers: you can put the same person in front of a chess board, or in a drivers seat, and they can perform either task. The goal of AI is to make a general intelligence. One that can work in any scenario.

&gt; while machines don't possess any desires apart from the desires of the machine's maker perhaps.

That simulated ecosystem thing can generate something very analogous to (if not equivalent to) desires in its actors without the desires of the machines maker mattering. If you want to argue that that's still part of the maker's desires, because they put the thing together, then I think you've already assumed physicalism is false. Because under that definition and physicalism, we'd all be machines under physics's 'desires'.

&gt; We work cooperatively with others in mutual recognition of our independent desires;

Hey, much like the simluated animals would do.

&gt; It might not be literally what you had in mind, but I think it will ultimately yield a more fruitful discussion.

I'm fine entertaining a definition that includes the hands, and tools, and whatnot, but I think it's important to agree on the definition. Clearly what I meant by mind, and this extended mind are different things, so, if we want mind to mean extended mind for this discussion, that's fine. I don't need to agree to work with that. It's just a word.

&gt; The things we currently have don't seem conscious. I think we agree on that.

Yes, but I don't think this is evidence for a body being required for consciousness. It's just not evidence that a body isn't required.

&gt; We know our consciousness is intimately tied into our bodies. We shouldn't assume this is an unimportant feature.

But is it also intimately tied with our thumbs? Our lack of body hair compared to other creatures? Our bipedal nature? From what I know, we attribute a great deal of the reason for our increased intelligence to the fact that we walk on two legs which frees up our hands. Should we assume non-bipedal consciousnesses are impossible?

&gt; It seems abundantly clear that something does have an internal model of reality, namely us. Imperfect models are still models.

That's the problem. Imperfect models are fine, but that machine had a perfect model. Something can't simulate itself *and* other stuff perfectly, it'll have to make some assumptions, or generalizations, or in some way simplify. The proof is that, to simulate perfectly, you'd require an independent state for every independent state in your subject matter. This means to simulate yourself, you have to have a state for every state you can be in (done), but if you want to add anything else, then you'd have to have more possible states than you have possible states.

&gt; That is exactly what a spandrel is though.

Not according to Wikipedia at least. Wikipedia says ""a spandrel is a phenotypic characteristic that is a byproduct of the evolution of some other characteristic, rather than a direct product of adaptive selection."" This is not the same as an accidental feature, but instead a byproduct. It has a reason for being there, just not a direct adaptive one. Further, it says ""These byproducts of adaptations that had no real relative advantage to survival, they termed spandrels."" But I think I've given reasons why pain does, in fact, have an advantage to survival, so, I don't know if the term is accurate.

&gt; How did our discussion on a unified science go earlier? No sarcasm; I really don't remember.

Oof, uh. I don't really remember either. I know I said that chemistry works based on physics. Like, chemical interactions are governed by physical interactions. You said this claim that everything can be reduced to physics would be something that all other scientists would have a stake in disproving. And I said, not really, because no one is going to model chemistry as physics, because it'd be like reinventing the wheel: we already know simpler to calculate models for those things, rederiving them every time is wasted effort. I don't remember if there was more to it than that.

&gt; Non-painful pain seems impossible to me like cold-hot things or giant dwarves. I'm not saying it's impossible, but pain is the salt of pain.

Well, preliminary research says there are two classes of painkiller, opiods, and aspirin. Opiods are like morphine, for severe pain. According to (Mental Floss)[http://mentalfloss.com/article/18615/how-do-painkillers-find-kill-pain], they releive pain by both interfering with the signals to the brain (which might be the ""stop pain from happening"", but I'll get to that later), and ""by working in the brain to alter the sensation of pain"" (which sounds clearly, to me, like ""make pain non-painful"").
Aspirins on the other hand, work by actually making the signal never be sent. They do some chemical magic stuff that I don't quite understand, but basically it removes or alters the chemicals that trigger the pain nerves to send signals, so the pain nerves don't pick them up. This is clearly the ""stop pain from happening"", and because of this, I'm not sure how to class the first effect of opiods, since they interfere with the signals, instead of preventing them. I think it's probably still accurate to say that effect is stopping pain from happening, though.

&gt; That's kind of the entire point of the metaphor, so I don't see what's left to argue about on this one.

The point was that we don't have homunculi in our brains. But we don't need a homunculus to make a decision. Take, for example, Plinko. Plinko is clearly not a homunculus, but it can, given initial conditions, make a decision of which hole the thing will fall down. It has all the trappings of a decision: multiple outcomes, the result is a subset of said outcomes, we can't easily tell which subset it will be.

&gt; If you expect this to be the case because you assume the brain works like our computers work, then it isn't contributing as evidence. It's just speculation.

It's not contributing evidence towards my side, but it is away from your side. Maybe I'm misreading you, but a lot of the time I bring up speculation, it's in response to something I've interpreted as you saying ""It can't work this way"" and my response is meant to show ""It could.""

&gt; Ideas are basically information. An idea here is some hypothetical infinitesimally small piece of information.

Interestingly, we have this concept in physics: (Physical Information)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_information]. I don't know a lot about it, but I do remember hearing about it, in terms of ""information cannot move faster than light"" (i.e. this is why pointing a flashlight at the moon, and flicking it from one side to the other real fast doesn't break physics). There's also the idea that information is conserved, which leads to stuff like (this)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox].

&gt; I answered all of this specifically. I remember doing a long write up about it.

I vaguely remember talking about a causal chain before, but I don't remember it, which is why I brought this back up. Maybe I'm being dumb, but (this)[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/56e4ey/cmv_the_hard_problem_of_consciousness_is_a/dd1gfum/] is the comment I posted, and I can't find a response in the direct replies.

&gt; It shows that the preferred explanation isn't necessarily mechanistic.

Sure, we've discussed this before I think. But non-mechanistic doesn't mean we can't understand or explain it.

&gt; I think you must be acting coy, because you've seen how difficult understanding the nature of ideas is.

I've also seen how difficult understanding special relativity is. My statement wasn't saying ""hey, if this were true it should be simple to study"" it was saying ""hey, if this were true, it should be possible to study"".

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-06 20:43:09 :

&gt; You are trying to have your cake and eat it too.

I'm not sure I follow.

&gt; Sorieties paradox are really interesting to me and a major topic throughout the history of philosophy.

Sorites is concerned with the definition of an object, not the conception, right? That is to say, it's looking for a hard and fast rule, not a bit intuitive of one?

&gt; it doesn't seem like you can remain agnostic about the import of observations and have the goal of creating external working models though. I think it might be worth discussing.

Sure. 

&gt; So does the balloon-sensor system feel pain?

Certainly not in the way you've been using the word. But it does register damage, and send the signal onwards. Not all types of damage, and the sensor doesn't do anything after sending the signal, but perhaps the thing receiving it does. I mean, you feel pain, but did the nerve that sent the signal? I don't know.

&gt; They seem related to me. What is the significant difference for you?

As you said, having an internal model of yourself allows you to do things that things that don't have that internal model can't. But the internal model of you is enclosed in the external model of you. It's like a box with a box inside, which is obviously different from a box without a box inside. Saying that models aren't models of themselves because we have internal models of ourselves, which allows new things, is like saying that those boxes aren't boxes, because one of them has a box inside. Am I making sense?

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-06 22:31:11 :

&gt; The simulated animals may not be conscious on a human level, but maybe an animal level (do you count animals as ""conscious""? Or are they something else?).

Not even close! Maybe you should link the case again, because I doubt that the entire ecosystem is as complex as a single cow, leaving aside how close the simulated cows alone come.

&gt; Puppets don't generate sound themselves. And perhaps, more importantly, puppets aren't generic. Puppets say what the ventriloquist makes them say, nothing more, nothing less. A computer can take any random text, and output speech for it.

If the ventriloquist followed the exact procedure as the algorithm, the outcome would be the exact same, right? Adding machine learning just adds one step of separation between us just doing the work and the work getting done.

&gt; Hey, much like the simluated animals would do.

This has literally nothing to do with my reply. You are grasping at straws here. I don't know why you feel the needs to argue about things when you don't understand what's going on in the first place.

&gt; I'm fine entertaining a definition that includes the hands, and tools, and whatnot, but I think it's important to agree on the definition. Clearly what I meant by mind, and this extended mind are different things, so, if we want mind to mean extended mind for this discussion, that's fine. I don't need to agree to work with that. It's just a word.

You clearly don't really know what you mean by mind, so I don't think I'm stepping on any toes here. How can my definition be disagreeable when there is nothing to disagree with? If you just don't want to talk about extend mind, we can drop it and use whatever definition you'd like, if it's a big deal.

&gt; Yes, but I don't think this is evidence for a body being required for consciousness. It's just not evidence that a body isn't required.

Cool, I guess we can rule out all correlations as evidence, then. Correlation doesn't mean causation or not-causation. It's just meh or something.

&gt; But is it also intimately tied with our thumbs? Our lack of body hair compared to other creatures? Our bipedal nature? From what I know, we attribute a great deal of the reason for our increased intelligence to the fact that we walk on two legs which frees up our hands. Should we assume non-bipedal consciousnesses are impossible?

There are non-bipedal animals, so we are good here. There are also non-bipedal humans, (people with spinal conditions that make upright walking impossible).

&gt; That's the problem. Imperfect models are fine, but that machine had a perfect model...

I don't see why you made such a fuss over this, then. I never claimed perfect models are possible. You brought up the concept of perfect models here.

&gt; Take, for example, Plinko. Plinko is clearly not a homunculus, but it can, given initial conditions, make a decision of which hole the thing will fall down. It has all the trappings of a decision: multiple outcomes, the result is a subset of said outcomes, we can't easily tell which subset it will be.

Plinko is not a decision game; it's a game of chance/luck/chaotic physics. It might be useful to model choice this way when writing an algorithm, but this isn't the same as human decisions. Noticeably absent here is anything like responsibility: our attribution of autonomous regency to the life of others.

&gt; Sure, we've discussed this before I think. But non-mechanistic doesn't mean we can't understand or explain it.

It does imply limits to explanation or understanding though. We can't know the outcome for sure based on the initial state. Computation relies on working out a definite state based on inputs and former outputs, right?

&gt; I'm not sure I follow.

Things are either different or they remain the same. Things can't both be constantly changing and constant.

&gt; Sorites is concerned with the definition of an object, not the conception, right? That is to say, it's looking for a hard and fast rule, not a bit intuitive of one?

I'm not seeing a difference here; our concept of objecthood is what people are asking about she they ask what the definition is. Some 'solutions' to the paradox are stricter than others, but they all try to expand on the common expectations of what an object is rather than just accept that there is nothing strange about the way we happen to find things. No one listens to the Ship of Theseus and says, 'Yep, that's ships for you. What can you do about it?'

*******

&gt; That simulated ecosystem thing can generate something very analogous to (if not equivalent to) desires in its actors without the desires of the machines maker mattering. If you want to argue that that's still part of the maker's desires, because they put the thing together, then I think you've already assumed physicalism is false. Because under that definition and physicalism, we'd all be machines under physics's 'desires'.

I honestly have no idea why you think these motes of pixel have desires and a robust life of their own. It seems like a very strange thing to think for me. I know you highlighted what you that to be important difference between these things and video game characters, but even comparing these guys to Conway's game of life is illuminating. I don't think the individual cells or the cells collectively in the Game of Life have desires or simulate desire. They merely produce complex behaviors; not all complexity implies consciousness.

&gt;  Wikipedia says ""a spandrel is a phenotypic characteristic that is a byproduct of the evolution of some other characteristic, rather than a direct product of adaptive selection."" This is not the same as an accidental feature, but instead a byproduct. It has a reason for being there, just not a direct adaptive one...

This isn't news to me. I've quoted this exact page to you previously. If something is a by-product of a selective process that itself has no adaptive value, then it seems pretty accidental from the stand-point of the mechanism of natural selection. Natural selection doesn't determine whether the feature will arrise; the feature is accidental with respect to the natural laws governing evolution.

&gt; Further, it says ""These byproducts of adaptations that had no real relative advantage to survival, they termed spandrels."" But I think I've given reasons why pain does, in fact, have an advantage to survival, so, I don't know if the term is accurate.

I don't think any of your accounts of pain panned out. Not only have we dropped them from our conversation after a relatively short run, but your individual accounts weren't consistent with each other. If you'd like to resume your account, I'm all ears. However, it's worth saying that I couldn't tell what your theory of pain is precisely.

&gt; Oof, uh. I don't really remember either...

I'll follow-up in the next round after some re-reading.

&gt; Certainly not in the way you've been using the word. But it does register damage,..

Given that this example was supposed to support your claim that pain just is damage recognition, I don't know why you'd say this. I don't see how it helps your case.

&gt; As you said, having an internal model of yourself allows you to do things that things that don't have that internal model can't. But the internal model of you is enclosed in the external model of you. It's like a box with a box inside, which is obviously different from a box without a box inside. Saying that models aren't models of themselves because we have internal models of ourselves, which allows new things, is like saying that those boxes aren't boxes, because one of them has a box inside. Am I making sense?

Not really, but I'll wing it. I would say that our internal model just is the way we model our external self, so I don't know how I could recreate this box within a box. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but this internal model seems superfluous frankly, since we only need information about our external self. Information about some inner state may or may not coincide with external events. External models, in contrast, have stronger connections with the outside world since they are of or about the outside world. If we have good external models already, then we shouldn't need to supplement with a model about ourselves.

Also, I'm not arguing against your 'every model is a self-model' line with this new conceptual tool. I think it's pretty obvious that this line is false. I don't see any reason to accept such a thing in the first place. I only brought it back up because I knew you weren't working with the same beginning assumptions. I hope you change you mind about it, but there isn't an explicit argument on the table to that effect.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-08 03:16:15 :

To start, I just want to say I'm not trying to be purposefully obtuse. It's obvious I'm making you angry, and I'm sorry for that, I swear on my life I'm not trying to. I know I can be dense and stubborn sometimes, but I try my best.

&gt; Maybe you should link the case again, because I doubt that the entire ecosystem is as complex as a single cow, leaving aside how close the simulated cows alone come.

There wasn't a link, it was basically a thought experiment. Now, I don't know how complex cows are, but some animals are very simplistic, while still containing a brain (though not a big one). Do you think this wouldn't even come close to that?

&gt; If the ventriloquist followed the exact procedure as the algorithm, the outcome would be the exact same, right? 

Maybe? I don't think puppets are Turing complete. Further, if it's the ventriloquist performing the algorithm, couldn't you say air is a computer then too? Humans can use it to transmit messages by sound, so it works like the puppet would. The point of that sentence was if the ventriloquist is following the algorithm, he's the computer, not the puppet.

&gt; You clearly don't really know what you mean by mind, so I don't think I'm stepping on any toes here.

I don't have a hard and fast definition, but it definitely didn't include my hands. To state it, I'd say I mean mind as a collection of my thoughts/ideas. 

&gt; If you just don't want to talk about extend mind, we can drop it and use whatever definition you'd like, if it's a big deal.

It's not a big deal. That's what that reply was meaning to say.

&gt; Cool, I guess we can rule out all correlations as evidence, then.

You seem to be using this one correlation as near proof-level evidence, saying there's no way consciousness could exist without a body. Seeing a black raven is evidence that all ravens are black, but it hardly proves it.

I mean, are AIs impossible because all the conscious things we see are made of biological material, and so consciousness must be made of biological material? Should we also rule out silicon based life, even though silicon bonds very similarly to carbon, because we've never seen silicon based life?

&gt; There are also non-bipedal humans, (people with spinal conditions that make upright walking impossible).

They've still got the legs, or bones, or pelvic bone structure unique to us. Or they've got skulls. Do our computers need skulls to be conscious?

&gt; Plinko is not a decision game; it's a game of chance/luck/chaotic physics.

Ok, just to start, how do you define decision? This is something:

&gt; Noticeably absent here is anything like responsibility: our attribution of autonomous regency to the life of others.

(I'll respond to that in a sec) But I'd like to know exactly what you mean. What I mean by decision is taking a different action based on a certain condition (can be compound). So a computer makes decisions when it uses ""if"". If the condition is true, it does one thing, otherwise, it does the other.

&gt; Noticeably absent here is anything like responsibility: our attribution of autonomous regency to the life of others.

Now, this definition of responsibility is something I've not heard. I'm having trouble parsing it. We attribute our individual autonomy to others? I'm not sure why the life of others even comes into effect. I can make decisions while alone.

&gt; Computation relies on working out a definite state based on inputs and former outputs, right?

Not necessarily. Statistics don't work quite like this. They can't tell you what your die will roll, but they'll tell you what distribution of values you're likely to get from it.

&gt; Things are either different or they remain the same. Things can't both be constantly changing and constant.

Things are made of parts. If some parts change, and some parts don't, then yes, it can.

&gt; I'm not seeing a difference here;

The difference is, while no one can tell you exactly what differentiates a heap from a non-heap (they don't have a definition), they can tell you that a heap is a heap, or that a grain is not a heap (they have a conception).

&gt; I honestly have no idea why you think these motes of pixel have desires and a robust life of their own.

Because they make decisions based on reasons that they developed themselves.

&gt; If something is a by-product of a selective process that itself has no adaptive value, then it seems pretty accidental from the stand-point of the mechanism of natural selection.

A by-product is not an accident, it's a by-product. Spandrels in architechture are necessary, even if they don't provide structural support. They have to be there as a consequence of the construction. Actually, this next sentence provides better wording:

&gt; Natural selection doesn't determine whether the feature will arrise; the feature is accidental with respect to the natural laws governing evolution.

A spandrel is not an accident, it's just an indirect result. You can't have a spandrel by itself, it comes packaged with something that was selected.

&gt; If you'd like to resume your account, I'm all ears.

Pain, at the very least, allows you to learn from certain mistakes. To stop your hand from burning, all your body needs to do is pull it away from the stove. But if you don't feel pain, there's no reason you wouldn't do it again later.

&gt; Given that this example was supposed to support your claim that pain just is damage recognition,

Pain is what you do with the damage recognition. A cell doesn't feel pain, it just gets damaged. You experience pain because you process the damage signal.

&gt; Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but this internal model seems superfluous frankly, since we only need information about our external self.

You can imagine yourself, spun around 180 degrees, and can talk about what that version of you's left and right would be. That imagining of you is the internal model. You can spin it around, and imagine how it would see and interact with the world, without actually spinning around and seeing how you see and interact with the world.

&gt; Also, I'm not arguing against your 'every model is a self-model' line with this new conceptual tool. I think it's pretty obvious that this line is false.

This was the whole point of my response to this part. I don't see why you think it's false. Here's my reasoning: A model of X is something that acts like X in certain attributes (e.g. a model solar system acts like the solar system in shape). X acts like X in every attribute. Therefore, X is a model of X. Note: this is model as in ""scale model"" not model as in ""physics equation"".

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-11 15:59:02 :

&gt; To start, I just want to say I'm not trying to be purposefully obtuse...

You shouldn't worry about things like that. My reactions aren't in your control, and you haven't done anything wrong. I've been a little venomous, I'll admit. But, that wasn't your fault. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

&gt; There wasn't a link, it was basically a thought experiment. Now, I don't know how complex cows are, but some animals are very simplistic, while still containing a brain (though not a big one). Do you think this wouldn't even come close to that?

Maybe not; even if we take an even simpler information processing system like a cell, the complexity is staggering. What cells are doing isn't incomprehensible though, since we can model the processes of a cell using simpler schemas, concepts, and pragmatic shorthand.

I think we both agree this is true for a cell. With regards to consciousness, I don't think we can fruitfully represent consciousness using non-conscious schema, concepts, or pragmatic gestures. I don't think it is fair to say consciousness is incomprehensible, in virtue of our direct apprehension of experience and the autonomy we have as human beings.

These simulations are simpler than the things they represent in virtue of its role as a schema for the real thing. Some complex things, cells or even incredibly complex non-organic minerals, are too complex to be mere representations, but they aren't so complex that they can't be exhaustively modeled. Other things, including most vertebrate life as we know it, can only be incompletely schematized. Reproducing a unified collection of attributes identical to an incompletely modeled thing requires a perfect reproduction: an indiscernible copy.

&gt; Humans can use it to transmit messages by sound, so it works like the puppet would. The point of that sentence was if the ventriloquist is following the algorithm, he's the computer, not the puppet.

That's my point. The human can fill in for a computer basically the man with the look-up table fills in for a computer in the Chinese Room. Chinese Room isn't conscious though, so neither is the speech-enabled computer.

&gt; I don't have a hard and fast definition, but it definitely didn't include my hands. To state it, I'd say I mean mind as a collection of my thoughts/ideas.

Do you use your hands when you speak? Everyone uses some kind of gesture at least, even if it is counting on our fingers as a kid. We use our hands to think all the time, I'd say.

&gt; You seem to be using this one correlation as near proof-level evidence, saying there's no way consciousness could exist without a body. Seeing a black raven is evidence that all ravens are black, but it hardly proves it.

You don't need to score all the points in a game, you just need to score more than your opponent. You don't have any positive positions. If I can provide one piece of evidence in favor of my side, that beats having no evidence I particular. If you'd like to argue against the particular merits of my proposal, then I'd of course oblige. Now, you're just stonewalling.

&gt; I mean, are AIs impossible because all the conscious things we see are made of biological material, and so consciousness must be made of biological material? Should we also rule out silicon based life, even though silicon bonds very similarly to carbon, because we've never seen silicon based life?

You know I don't think AI is impossible, and it seems absurd to conclude anything about silicon based life. I think the body is relevant because it is the ground for our cognition. We process information body-wise. That's the claim really; if consciousness in information processing, then conscious things should process information the same way or something.

&gt; They've still got the legs, or bones, or pelvic bone structure unique to us. Or they've got skulls. Do our computers need skulls to be conscious?

Sure; skulls are brain casings. Since you think the brain is a computer, the skull is basically a computer casing. Most computers have a casing around them, like a desktop tower or the shell of a laptop.

&gt; But I'd like to know exactly what you mean. What I mean by decision is taking a different action based on a certain condition (can be compound). So a computer makes decisions when it uses ""if"". If the condition is true, it does one thing, otherwise, it does the other.

Theory of action is basically all of philosophy, so I can't give you a one-off answer here. I can add a case that I would include in decision that isn't an either/or decision. When we make add follow rules, we restrict our behavior such that certain things are taken as necessary. For example, when we take, ""Thou shalt not murder"", as a rule that applies to us, we eliminate some choices all together. It isn't as if we make the decision ahead of time or create overriding reasons that will trump any competing reason. Rather, we take the maxim to be necessary; it will not be otherwise.

Humans are imperfect rule followers. This is why we must choose to follow rules with conviction and follow through. This is also why we are educated in an ethical code as children: to instill tools in us that will make our rules ironclad.

&gt; Now, this definition of responsibility is something I've not heard. I'm having trouble parsing it. We attribute our individual autonomy to others? I'm not sure why the life of others even comes into effect. I can make decisions while alone.

We attribute individual autonomy to others. The 'we' takes care of the 'our'. This is the Kantian ideal of freedom. We are responsible insofar as we are autonomous. When we interpret others as making a decision, we attribute their actions to their autonomy. To respect a decision is to respect that it came from an individual.

&gt; Not necessarily. Statistics don't work quite like this. They can't tell you what your die will roll, but they'll tell you what distribution of values you're likely to get from it.

Right, this distribution is a definite arrangement within the probability space, though. That seems more relevant to me.

&gt; A by-product is not an accident, it's a by-product. Spandrels in architechture are necessary, even if they don't provide structural support.

1. Spandrels aren't necessary. Some buildings don't have spandrels. They use other structures instead.

2. Spandrels aren't necessary in the sense I'm using accident. Something doesn't need to be totally inexplicable to be accidents. Chordate=Renate is accidental even though it holds for all animals. Coincidence isn't a dirty word. It's the regular state of affairs.

&gt; The difference is, while no one can tell you exactly what differentiates a heap from a non-heap (they don't have a definition), they can tell you that a heap is a heap, or that a grain is not a heap (they have a conception).

I think this is a dubious interpretation of conceptual thinking. We don't respond to people the way we do for the sake of faithfulness to a hidden model. We respond to people with an eye for their intensions. What do they want is they problem we are confronted with, not what is it. That is why people give ready answers: They have access to information about what the question would think is relevant.

&gt; Pain, at the very least, allows you to learn from certain mistakes. To stop your hand from burning, all your body needs to do is pull it away from the stove. But if you don't feel pain, there's no reason you wouldn't do it again later.

Does this imply that we aren't in pain when we fail to learn from our mistakes?

&gt; Pain is what you do with the damage recognition. A cell doesn't feel pain, it just gets damaged. You experience pain because you process the damage signal.

Does this imply my check engine light is in pain when it senses my car is overheating.

&gt; You can imagine yourself, spun around 180 degrees, and can talk about what that version of you's left and right would be. That imagining of you is the internal model. You can spin it around, and imagine how it would see and interact with the world, without actually spinning around and seeing how you see and interact with the world.

It might just be the example, but I usually need to physically turn my body to think about left and right like this. Lol. I'm not knocking powers of imagination. When we imagine things, we go through the motions as if a thing were present. However, that doesn't imply a thing is in fact present.

&gt; A model of X is something that acts like X in certain attributes (e.g. a model solar system acts like the solar system in shape). X acts like X in every attribute. Therefore, X is a model of X. Note: this is model as in ""scale model"" not model as in ""physics equation"".

My criticism was and is that this definition is under informative. It doesn't say what attributes are most relevant when constructing a model. A good definition lists sufficient and necessary conditions, while this doesn't list any particular attributes for consideration. Moreover, even if this were amended as to replace 'certain attributes' with particular conditions, you would end up with a recursive problem. The statement about models is itself a model of models. Incompleteness theorem will force the inclusion of paraconsistency, incompleteness, or the like.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-11 22:01:42 :

&gt; even if we take an even simpler information processing system like a cell, the complexity is staggering. 

The complexity is always staggering. But not all of it is relevant. Like, a pencil falling to the ground is trillions of particle interactions, but we don't need to worry about them, because all we need to care about is the center of mass and the initial torque and gravity, and perhaps air resistance, and you get a near perfect picture. Certain things can be abstracted away. Like I don't need to model the simulated animals as collections of cells doing individual chemical reactions, built up in muscles and whatnot. I could just give them a mechanism to move.

&gt; I don't think we can fruitfully represent consciousness using non-conscious schema, concepts, or pragmatic gestures.

This doesn't make sense. If consciousness requires consciousness to work, then where did it start? If it can start, then it came from non-couscious things (as that was all that existed before conscious things existed).

&gt; too complex to be mere representations, but they aren't so complex that they can't be exhaustively modeled.

&gt; Reproducing a unified collection of attributes identical to an incompletely modeled thing requires a perfect reproduction: an indiscernible copy.

These two things are at odds. I don't see how cells fit under the first, but animals fit under the second. It seems like both should fit under the same. We haven't exhaustively modeled a cell. We know the processes that go on, but we haven't done something that models it on the level of fundamental particles, because why would we? We know the processes that go on in a multicellular organism (the size of that knowledge is much larger, by virtue of there being more parts, but we do know them), it seems like on a similar level to cells.

&gt; That's my point. The human can fill in for a computer basically the man with the look-up table fills in for a computer in the Chinese Room.

I don't see how the fact that a human can act like a computer means a computer can't be conscious.

&gt; Do you use your hands when you speak? Everyone uses some kind of gesture at least, even if it is counting on our fingers as a kid. We use our hands to think all the time, I'd say.

We use our hands like tools, like we'd use a calculator. But I didn't include tools in my definition of mind either.

&gt; You don't need to score all the points in a game, you just need to score more than your opponent.

You're using the fact that we haven't seen consciousness without a body to say it's impossible. It's like saying ""No one has ever split the atom before, so it must be impossible"" before we developed the atom bomb.

&gt; it seems absurd to conclude anything about silicon based life

Anything? Even ""it's not impossible for it to exist""? Not even practical, just possible? I'm going to stop for a second, and say I'm not an expert, there may be some chemical reason silicon wouldn't work as a basis for life. But if there isn't, I don't see why we can't say, ""yeah, there's no problem with it existing"" without having seen an example of it.

&gt; That's the claim really; if consciousness in information processing, then conscious things should process information the same way or something.

Why should they process it the same way we do? Do cows even process it the same way we do?

&gt; Most computers have a casing around them, like a desktop tower or the shell of a laptop.

It's certainly not a necessary part of the computer. The computer would work fine as just the motherboard sitting on a table. If a computer can be conscious with a casing, it can be conscious without one.

&gt; Sure; skulls are brain casings. Since you think the brain is a computer, the skull is basically a computer casing.

More importantly, why is it ok to abstract this into just a casing, instead of one made of bone? But not ok to abstract a body into something that can retrieve inputs and produce outputs?

&gt; It isn't as if we make the decision ahead of time or create overriding reasons that will trump any competing reason.

Isn't it? Like aren't we creating the reason ""God told me not to"" that trumps other reasons? I mean that's the way I think of it (well, I don't use God but, it stands). This even helps explain this bit:

&gt; Humans are imperfect rule followers.

Maybe ""God told me not to"" isn't quite as much of a trump as we wanted it to be.

&gt; We attribute individual autonomy to others.

So, to start, I don't think you need to have responsibility to make a decision. I think if a kid does something bad because their parent told them too, we hold the parent responsible, but I'd say the kid made a decision.

Second, how far does responsibility hold? The computer was responsible for the action, in that it performed it. It even went down one path, and not the other (I'd say ""chose""), by itself. Does this all not hold because it was following rules?

And third, I certainly consider computers autonomous. After all, that's what we use them for: To automate tasks. That wouldn't work so well if they weren't autonomous.

&gt; Right, this distribution is a definite arrangement within the probability space, though. That seems more relevant to me.

As it is in QM. So, does that mean QM isn't non-mechanistic?

&gt; Spandrels aren't necessary. Some buildings don't have spandrels. They use other structures instead.

That's a good point. But at the same time, if you point one out to the architect he's not going to be like ""Oh, how'd that get there?""

&gt; Spandrels aren't necessary in the sense I'm using accident. Something doesn't need to be totally inexplicable to be accidents.

Then I don't think I know what you mean by accident. If I can explain how something came about, but it still be an accident, what does accident mean?

&gt; Coincidence isn't a dirty word. It's the regular state of affairs.

Nor do I mean it to be. But coincidence isn't as common as you think. What's the saying? ""Once is chance, twice is coincidence, thrice is a pattern""?

&gt; We don't respond to people the way we do for the sake of faithfulness to a hidden model.

Where does responding to people need to come in? If presented with a grain of sand, no one needs to be asked ""is that a heap?"" To consider it not a heap. Similarly, with a heap of sand, no one needs to be asked ""is that a heap?"" before they'll consider it one.

&gt; Does this imply that we aren't in pain when we fail to learn from our mistakes?

I don't think so. I don't think you need to learn from your mistake to be said to have had the ability to.

&gt; Does this imply my check engine light is in pain when it senses my car is overheating.

I get where you're going with this: Cars can't feel pain. But instead of argue that, well, maybe they can, I'm just going to say, you do a lot more processing on the pain than just a signal. I don't know much about cars, but I don't think any other part of the car gets told between the heat sensor and the light. It seems much closer to how a cut will scab over (i.e. it's just a response) than how you think the cut hurts.

&gt; However, that doesn't imply a thing is in fact present.

Of course it's not. But a model of it is.

&gt; My criticism was and is that this definition is under informative. It doesn't say what attributes are most relevant when constructing a model.

It doesn't because that depends on the model. I think in my first statement of this, I used the word ""relevant attributes"", this wasn't just to be vague, it's because it has to be vague. I can try to sharpen the definition a little bit: A model of X with respect to Y is something that will inform you how the actual X will respond to Y under different circumstances. Examples: A scale model of a car is X=car, Y=shape. It will tell you how the actual car will respond to anything pertaining to shape, e.g. in a wind tunnel can inform you about the aerodynamics on the road. A picture of a car is X=car, Y=looks. It will tell you how the actual car will look when being present. The actual car is then X=car, Y=&lt;some/many arbitrary attribute(s)&gt;. It will tell you how the car will respond in any situation.

You have to define the model in terms of what it's of, and what attributes are relevant. A scale model of the solar system at a science fair isn't going to be a model with X=solar system, Y=gravity. But it will be with X=solar system, Y=shape.

&gt; you would end up with a recursive problem. The statement about models is itself a model of models. 

So, model can't be defined? I'm not sure I get it.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-12 16:59:22 :

&gt; The complexity is always staggering. But not all of it is relevant... Certain things can be abstracted away. Like I don't need to model the simulated animals as collections of cells doing individual chemical reactions, built up in muscles and whatnot. I could just give them a mechanism to move.

The animals aren't really moving, if their relative position never changes. Changing position requires doing work in the physics sense of the word, and work does require mechanism for movement. Simulating movement, (e.i. listing conditions for representing a thing at grid intersection #1 then #2), simulates somethings that we care about, but it is clearly deficient when it comes to doing the actual work of movement. In the same way, I think it's reasonable to think that simulating conscious behavior can fall short of instantiating consciousness itself.

&gt; This doesn't make sense. If consciousness requires consciousness to work, then where did it start? If it can start, then it came from non-couscious things (as that was all that existed before conscious things existed).

You are jumping the gun. I'm talking about representing consciousness in this passage. Even if it is impossible to represent consciousness in non-conscious terms, it is possible that consciousness is an innovative feature. It's possible that conscious developed in a way that was unpredictable given the starting conditions: that conscious can't be read off from pre-conscious states of affairs. This is possible, surely. 

&gt;  It seems like both should fit under the same. We haven't exhaustively modeled a cell. We know the processes that go on, but we haven't done something that models it on the level of fundamental particles, because why would we? We know the processes that go on in a multicellular organism (the size of that knowledge is much larger, by virtue of there being more parts, but we do know them), it seems like on a similar level to cells.

I don't really see an argument here. If animals are made of cells, (billions of cells), then they are more complex than cells by defintion. I chose the cell because it was is capable of limited information processing while simpler things in nature aren't typically capable of information processing. If you have a problem with either point, you'll have to make it more explicit.

&gt; I don't see how the fact that a human can act like a computer means a computer can't be conscious.

Do you understand the Chinese Room thought experiment?

&gt; We use our hands like tools, like we'd use a calculator. But I didn't include tools in my definition of mind either.

You don't have a principled reason to exclude it either. Do you want to discuss the proposal, or are you going to refuse to entertain the idea based on your pre-conceived bais against the idea? 

&gt; You're using the fact that we haven't seen consciousness without a body to say it's impossible. It's like saying ""No one has ever split the atom before, so it must be impossible"" before we developed the atom bomb.

Not even; I'm saying more evidence is on my side. All the conscious things we have access to have bodies; are you denying this fact?

&gt; Anything? Even ""it's not impossible for it to exist""? Not even practical, just possible? I'm going to stop for a second, and say I'm not an expert, there may be some chemical reason silicon wouldn't work as a basis for life. But if there isn't, I don't see why we can't say, ""yeah, there's no problem with it existing"" without having seen an example of it.

I'm not an expert either. I think what I said was adequate for the scope of our conversation. Are you trying to make a thing out of this?

&gt; Why should they process it the same way we do? Do cows even process it the same way we do?

It seems like a good start for understanding consciousness. If consciousness is a special kind of information processing capacity or activity, then we can explain why only certain information processing events are conscious events without appealing to dualist assumptions about consciousness. I thought we could both push towards a goal like this.

&gt; It's certainly not a necessary part of the computer. The computer would work fine as just the motherboard sitting on a table. If a computer can be conscious with a casing, it can be conscious without one.

Brain in a vat, bro. We probably don't need a skull to use our brains either.

&gt; why is it ok to abstract this into just a casing, instead of one made of bone? But not ok to abstract a body into something that can retrieve inputs and produce outputs?

We are talking about a very passive part of our body. We need our skull to do most everything from a practical point of view, but we don't actively work our head bones to achieve things. If the computers input-output network was just a slavish reproduction of ours, then I don't really have beef. We've already talk about perfect copies and all of that.

&gt; Isn't it? Like aren't we creating the reason ""God told me not to"" that trumps other reasons? I mean that's the way I think of it (well, I don't use God but, it stands). 

I get that diagreeing with me for the sake of taking a position is your MO, but I don't think you have any other reason to disagree with me here. I don't say this to make you feel bad or make you feel like your opinion isn't welcomed, but I've been studying ethics for nearly 8 years at this point. It was the overwhleming focus of my undergraduate and continues to be a major focus for me. This seems to be your first brush with thinking about these things. Just this once, maybe you can take my word for something.

&gt; So, to start, I don't think you need to have responsibility to make a decision. I think if a kid does something bad because their parent told them too, we hold the parent responsible, but I'd say the kid made a decision.

I don't think it's reasonable to say coerced actions are decisions. That's a pretty typical position dating back to Aristotle. Decision implies free choice. All other cases are deviations and complications that arise after the simple case of making a free choice given ample time for reflection and sufficient education on the choice.

&gt; Second, how far does responsibility hold? The computer was responsible for the action, in that it performed it. It even went down one path, and not the other (I'd say ""chose""), by itself. Does this all not hold because it was following rules?

It might be coincidently following rules, but it isn't consciously affirming any rules as we do. That should be completely uncontroversial for all of our current computers. They follow certain patterns of behavior because they were engineered to do so, (directly or indirectly). The engineer is responsible for the machine which is why they make engineers take ethics courses.

&gt; And third, I certainly consider computers autonomous. After all, that's what we use them for: To automate tasks. That wouldn't work so well if they weren't autonomous.

Of course! This is why there is even a conversation to begin with. However, producing working without our direct intervention is nothing new. Waterwheels turning millstones have been automatically grinding flour for millinium. This question is whether computers are as autonomous as we are, or whether they could become as autonomous as we are.

&gt; As it is in QM. So, does that mean QM isn't non-mechanistic?

Yes? Isn't that just the common consensus?

&gt; But at the same time, if you point one out to the architect he's not going to be like ""Oh, how'd that get there?""

Maybe; spandrels can be interesting. Just look at this converstaion. We are certainly making a lot of hay about how those things got there.

&gt; Then I don't think I know what you mean by accident. If I can explain how something came about, but it still be an accident, what does accident mean?

Accident is related to concepts like contingency and necessity. Necessary things can't help but be the way they are, while contingent things may or may not have happened. Accidents are contingent facts about a given thing. There are necessary facts that just fall out in virtue of what's happening, but there are also relational or historical contingencies that ground accidents.

&gt; Where does responding to people need to come in? If presented with a grain of sand, no one needs to be asked ""is that a heap?"" To consider it not a heap. Similarly, with a heap of sand, no one needs to be asked ""is that a heap?"" before they'll consider it one.

If you presented me with a grain of sand with no context, I wouldn't think, 'non-heap'. I would think, ""What's this guy trying to tell me with only one grain?"". Since we are talking about concepts and mental processes, this result should be relevant.

&gt; I get where you're going with this: Cars can't feel pain... I'm just going to say, you do a lot more processing on the pain than just a signal.

What's the other stuff you left out of your first pain definition, then?

&gt; Of course it's not. But a model of it is.

I'm saying that perhaps you're being overly literal by assuming there is a particular model at work that explains our conceptual responses.

&gt; So, model can't be defined? I'm not sure I get it.

That's one way to interpret it. Tarski's work on Truth implies this maybe.

&gt;  A model of X with respect to Y is something that will inform you how the actual X will respond to Y under different circumstances. 

It seems like you are relying on a analogical structure: x;y::X:Y. If nothing explains how analogies work, then you haven't explained what we are interested in this converstaion. We are interested in how things like analogy are possible given only a descriptive list of physical brain states. If you answer is that there is an unbreakable analogy at the heart of it all, then you haven't sovled the hard problem. Rather, you are appealing directly to intentionality without realizing it.

awenonian @ 2017-02-12 23:21:35 :

&gt; The animals aren't really moving, if their relative position never changes.

Position is just a variable. Their position vectors, and thus their relative position, does change. Just not in the sense of physical distance.

&gt; Changing position requires doing work in the physics sense of the word, and work does require mechanism for movement.

To start with, why does this matter? Why does the fact that they aren't physically moving matter? Second, there is work being done. Moving electrons around in a computer requires work in the physics sense as well.

&gt; but it is clearly deficient when it comes to doing the actual work of movement.

Well, it doesn't require physics work to move muscles, but it does actually require physics work to do. I don't know what you mean about being clearly deficient, but I think more the point is I don't know why this is important.

&gt; In the same way, I think it's reasonable to think that simulating conscious behavior can fall short of instantiating consciousness itself.

In the sense that anything but a human brain isn't a human brain, sure. But I don't see why this matters. Like, a physics simulation of a ball bouncing can have every relevant characteristic accounted for. The ball still doesn't physically move, the bits just change. I don't see why this is relevant though. I don't understand it's importance.

&gt; You are jumping the gun. I'm talking about representing consciousness in this passage.

I understand, but consciousness is a representation of consciousness, isn't it?

&gt; It's possible that conscious developed in a way that was unpredictable given the starting conditions: that conscious can't be read off from pre-conscious states of affairs. This is possible, surely.

I dont' see why it developing unpredictably matters. The arguement I put forth didn't care that we *knew* how, just that it could. If consciousness requires consciousness, then it can't come about. The cause and effect can't be the same thing.

&gt; If animals are made of cells, (billions of cells), then they are more complex than cells by defintion.

Yes, but you seemed to say that we could fully simulate a cell, but not an animal. I don't think we can fully simulate either.

&gt; I chose the cell because it was is capable of limited information processing while simpler things in nature aren't typically capable of information processing.

What do you mean by information processing? Does a glass on the edge of a table process information by testing for forces towards the edge and falling if it senses any? If not, why not?

&gt; Do you understand the Chinese Room thought experiment?

I do. I think. Two things. One, where does the puppet enter into this then? It seems irrelevant. And 2, why is the Chinese Room not conscious? It seems he just says it's not.

&gt; Not even; I'm saying more evidence is on my side. All the conscious things we have access to have bodies; are you denying this fact?

No. This is also a response to the next bit you have about silicon life. I don't think ""Have we seen it or not"" is the best evidence we have. Science's purpose is to build models with predictive capabilities. With these models, we can conclude the viability of things before we experience them. This allows us to tell if silicon life could exist before we have any indication that it does. 

Moreover, the only reason we're on this is because you said you didn't think ""disembodied gods in cyberspace"" could exist. The internet is made of physical bits (servers, cords, etc.), why does this not count as a body?

&gt; It seems like a good start for understanding consciousness.

But our goal isn't understanding consciousness, it's determining if consciousness can be understood. Why should we restrict ourselves to consciousnesses similar to ourselves?

&gt; If consciousness is a special kind of information processing capacity or activity, then we can explain why only certain information processing events are conscious events

Just to interject a bit of insight into my viewpoint, I'd like to include ""if"" before the why. As in, is there a fundamental difference between information processing and conscious information processing, or is it a difference in scale or complexity only.

&gt; Brain in a vat, bro. We probably don't need a skull to use our brains either.

Still in a vat. And we don't have any examples of this being possible, so why can we assume this is possible, but non-embodied consciousness isn't?

&gt; If the computers input-output network was just a slavish reproduction of ours, then I don't really have beef.

But why does it need to be? Why couldn't it be something else?

&gt; I don't think it's reasonable to say coerced actions are decisions.

I remember this coming up in the bit of philosophy I've done, but it always seemed like a foreign way of thinking to me. When does an action become coerced? I don't see a fundamental difference between a preference for a red dress over a green dress and a preference for not having a bullet in your head over having a bullet in your head. Then again, I know I always approach the world in a rigid cost-benefit analysis way. Maybe that's not normal for people, and I'm missing a viewpoint. I dunno. I guess I can take your word for this one as well.

&gt; It might be coincidently following rules, but it isn't consciously affirming any rules as we do.

It's hard for me to pin down what it would require to be ""consciously affirming rules"". What do you mean by that, and what would it look like?

&gt; They follow certain patterns of behavior because they were engineered to do so, (directly or indirectly).

Yes, but here we get back to where I think that we do as well, just we were engineered by physics instead of an engineer.

&gt; Yes? Isn't that just the common consensus?

&gt;&gt; I don't see how the same thing that decides when light acts like a particle and when it acts like a wave, or where on a distribution a particle will land, is responsible for the stuff that goes on in my head though.

&gt; I don't think there is a direct link either. Rather, it is a good example of non-determinism in science. It shows that the preferred explanation isn't necessarily mechanistic. Therefore, other fields of inquiry might likewise posit non-mechanistic explanations that are fruitful.

Did I misunderstand what was being said here?

&gt; Maybe; spandrels can be interesting. Just look at this converstaion. We are certainly making a lot of hay about how those things got there.

I mean, not the architectural ones we aren't...

&gt; Accidents are contingent facts about a given thing.

I may have misunderstood, but when I read about spandrels, it seemed to not be saying ""this feature may or may not have happened"" but instead, ""this feature, while not offering a survival advantage itself, must exist either for or because of this other adaptation that does offer a survival advantage"".

&gt; I would think, ""What's this guy trying to tell me with only one grain?""

Which means you didn't think ""What's this guy trying to tell me with a heap?"" You made the decision that it wasn't a heap without thinking about it.

&gt; What's the other stuff you left out of your first pain definition, then?

I'm not sure. If I remember, my first definition ignored the fact that you meant the experience of pain. The experience requires some processing on the signal.

&gt; I'm saying that perhaps you're being overly literal by assuming there is a particular model at work that explains our conceptual responses.

I don't think I am, I just think maybe my definition of model is looser than yours?

&gt; That's one way to interpret it. Tarski's work on Truth implies this maybe.

But it's a word we use that means something. If it can't mean anything, why are we using the word at all?

&gt; If nothing explains how analogies work, then you haven't explained what we are interested in this converstaion.

What do you  mean if nothing explains how analogies work? Don't we know how analogies work?

&gt; We are interested in how things like analogy are possible given only a descriptive list of physical brain states. If you answer is that there is an unbreakable analogy at the heart of it all, then you haven't sovled the hard problem.

I wasn't trying to solve the hard problem with this specifically. I was just trying to show that a thing is a model of itself. I don't think it's entirely irrelevant, see what I said above: ""consciousness is a representation of consciousness, isn't it?""

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-13 15:59:32 :

&gt; Position is just a variable. Their position vectors, and thus their relative position, does change. Just not in the sense of physical distance.

This is absurd. Either something really is or really isn't in a given position(s). Position isn't an abstract property. A representation of position in a video game is a complicated perspective trick played on us by our TVs.

&gt; To start with, why does this matter? Why does the fact that they aren't physically moving matter? 

Because we care about the real world more than the representations we create. If you don't feel the same way, I don't know what to tell you. 

&gt; But I don't see why this matters. Like, a physics simulation of a ball bouncing can have every relevant characteristic accounted for. The ball still doesn't physically move, the bits just change. I don't see why this is relevant though.

Dude, I can't even conceive of your thought process here. I've argued for 8 kinds of skepticism til Sunday, but I've never equated a computer simulation with the real thing. Simulations are basically things we invented for the purpose of modeling the real thing. Simulations don't make sense apart from the objects they represent. This asymmetric relationship should be enough to see the difference.

&gt; I understand, but consciousness is a representation of consciousness, isn't it?

Where did you get that idea? How can anything be a representation of the thing it is supposed to be? If satisfies the criteria in real life, then it isn't a representation of something; it simply is something.

&gt; The arguement I put forth didn't care that we knew how, just that it could. If consciousness requires consciousness, then it can't come about. The cause and effect can't be the same thing.

I think you've misunderstood my argument then. I've been talking about conceptualization the entire time. I said as much in my last reply. I've also said several time in the past that I think consciousness shares a causal history with pre-conscious events. I just don't think we can extrapolate consciousness from knowledge of these pre-conscious states.

&gt; Yes, but you seemed to say that we could fully simulate a cell, but not an animal. I don't think we can fully simulate either.

I don't think we have current capabilities to do either, but I'm more sanguine about the possibility of simulating cells. If we are limited to just current technology, then I should have won this argument a long time ago.

&gt; What do you mean by information processing? Does a glass on the edge of a table process information by testing for forces towards the edge and falling if it senses any? If not, why not?

I don't know if this is an essential definition, but information processing can be described as a procedure that increases the local potential for work through the restructuring of information. For example, let's say we have a very large peg board with an accompanying look-up table. Every hole only accepts one kind of peg and work is occurs when a peg is pushed through a hole. Using the look-up table allows us to learn how to solve a particular problem, namely how to perform work using a given hole. Once we acquire the information, we are able to perform work that wasn't possible before.

The glass isn't processing information, because it doesn't increase its capacity for work in response to movement. There isn't a special spot on the table that will refreeze the ice or re-evaporate the condensation. Moreover, the internal structure of the glass doesn't response in a non-chaotic fashion to any particular location on the table.

&gt; One, where does the puppet enter into this then? It seems irrelevant. 

You don't understand the Chinese Room. The man in the room is basically operating a big puppet through a procedure he doesn't understand. If the man-room system isn't conscious, then a computer shouldn't be conscious.

&gt; why is the Chinese Room not conscious? It seems he just says it's not.

Would you say that the room is conscious after all?

&gt; Moreover, the only reason we're on this is because you said you didn't think ""disembodied gods in cyberspace"" could exist. The internet is made of physical bits (servers, cords, etc.), why does this not count as a body?

It's a use thing. Internet God wouldn't use its physical components as tools for doing work. The work is done through passive processes in the physical components in order to perform computations, but this work is never direct towards an end on a macro-level. If Internet God possessed robot bodies that could perform this kind of work, I'd be more apt to call it conscious.

&gt; But our goal isn't understanding consciousness, it's determining if consciousness can be understood. Why should we restrict ourselves to consciousnesses similar to ourselves?

If you have other cases to study, then by all means go and collect your Nobel. We can only study what we've got. It's gravy and all that you would like a predictive model, but we don't even have a model of known conscious things yet. While we are still on square one, we should stick to non-controversial cases.

&gt; Just to interject a bit of insight into my viewpoint, I'd like to include ""if"" before the why. As in, is there a fundamental difference between information processing and conscious information processing, or is it a difference in scale or complexity only.

Because?

&gt; Still in a vat. And we don't have any examples of this being possible, so why can we assume this is possible, but non-embodied consciousness isn't?

You're right. I don't think this is possible. I'm just trying to accommodate you.

&gt; But why does it need to be? Why couldn't it be something else?

Because we have 0 positive reasons to think otherwise. If you could give just one piece of evidence for the possibility of non-animal consciousness, then I would stop making sweeping claims. But, you can't or won't, so I don't know why you are confused about this outcome.

&gt; don't see a fundamental difference between a preference for a red dress over a green dress and a preference for not having a bullet in your head over having a bullet in your head. 

Because that isn't the correct comparison. The comparison should be the choice between red and green vs the same choice under duress. Adding coercion to the dress case changes it from a free choice to a non-choice. The threat of life-threatening reprisal doesn't just add incentives to one column. It takes away alternatives that would otherwise be live options.

&gt; It's hard for me to pin down what it would require to be ""consciously affirming rules"". What do you mean by that, and what would it look like?

Let's take oath taking as an example. When we solemnly swear, we set out for ourselves a narrower path. We are willing taking on restriction to our behavior in order to take on a new social role, be that husband, judge, or official. This is different than coercion in that we are freely choosing to participate. It's also different from habit in that we actively take part in the change. 

&gt; here we get back to where I think that we do as well, just we were engineered by physics instead of an engineer.

Are you talking about intelligent design? How can physics engineer something if it doesn't have artifice or intention?

&gt; Did I misunderstand what was being said here?

Maybe; I don't see a problem here.

&gt; I read about spandrels, it seemed to not be saying ""this feature may or may not have happened"" but instead, ""this feature, while not offering a survival advantage itself, must exist either for or because of this other adaptation that does offer a survival advantage"".

I think the architecture spandrels are a way to illustrate why the second view is false. There are several ways architects could build buildings and severs ways to build the same building with or without spandrels. Once the building is built, there is a sunk cost in modifying it, but there are several plans equal in terms of cost all things considered. Likewise, there are several potential body plans with equivalent survival values. The reason certain ones won out is partly due to chancy events at earlier stages of development.

&gt; Which means you didn't think ""What's this guy trying to tell me with a heap?"" You made the decision that it wasn't a heap without thinking about it.

Sure, put words in my mouth. I don't care. I was saying the opposite, but you do you.

&gt; I'm not sure. If I remember, my first definition ignored the fact that you meant the experience of pain. The experience requires some processing on the signal.

Which include?

&gt; I don't think I am, I just think maybe my definition of model is looser than yours?

Shocker, you disagree with me while saying exactly what I just said.

&gt; But it's a word we use that means something. If it can't mean anything, why are we using the word at all?

Maybe you have some misconceptions about how words work. No one said words were going to be complete models for things.

&gt; What do you mean if nothing explains how analogies work? Don't we know how analogies work?

Explain away.

awenonian @ 2017-02-13 20:41:32 :

&gt; Because we care about the real world more than the representations we create.

But the representations help us understand the real world. Why does them being similar not count for anything?

&gt; Simulations don't make sense apart from the objects they represent.

I must've completely misunderstood something, but I don't know what. The whole point was that they make sense *with* the objects they represent, right?

&gt; Where did you get that idea? How can anything be a representation of the thing it is supposed to be?

Didn't you propose like 4 types of representations, where one was self-same things? Is that different? Regardless, this stems from the same thing where I think things are models of themselves.

&gt; I think you've misunderstood my argument then. I've been talking about conceptualization the entire time.

I know, but see above.

&gt; I don't think we have current capabilities to do either, but I'm more sanguine about the possibility of simulating cells. 

But why? If the difference is complexity, then that doesn't matter. It'll be a time difference between when one becomes possible, and the other does, but with enough time and money, you could have as much processing power as you want.

&gt; The glass isn't processing information, because it doesn't increase its capacity for work in response to movement. 

Are we still talking about the physics kind of work? Or another kind, like some action performed?

If it's the physics sense, objects don't do work, forces do, and then the force of gravity would be the processor. When pushed, gravity is able to do work it couldn't before (make the glass fall).

If it's ""some action performed"", then the glass falling is new work that couldn't be done before (the table was in the way).

I think either of those fit the ""a procedure that increases the local potential for work through the restructuring of information."" definition.

If it's something else, then I'd need to know what to give an arguement.

&gt; Moreover, the internal structure of the glass doesn't response in a non-chaotic fashion to any particular location on the table.

Where did this come in in the above definition?

&gt; You don't understand the Chinese Room.

When did we start talking about something other than a ventriloquist's puppet when we say ""puppet"" and why does the man having a puppet, which, by virtue of him being a ventriloquist, he does understand the operation of, matter? This wasn't the chinese room, it was when you said a computer is like a puppet.

&gt; Would you say that the room is conscious after all?

Sure, why not? It seems that the assertion that it isn't stems from an assumption that we can't understand consciousness. After all, if we could, we could set up a Chinese-Room-like scenario for it. The assumption is that the man not understanding the operation means the man-room system isn't conscious. But I don't understand the operation of my brain, yet I'm still conscious.

&gt; Internet God wouldn't use its physical components as tools for doing work.

Sure it would. How else would it do anything in the world? Skynet used the physical components (Nuclear missiles) as tools for doing work (killing humans) in Terminator.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Internet God can be consciousness just floating in the Ether. But I'd consider an AI using data from weather apparati and giving results to humans through a monitor to be utilizing a body. You seemed to say that it wasn't though.

&gt; Because?

Because why did I share this? I think it's helpful for us both to understand each other as much as possible. If this gave you some insight into my mind, great. If not, you can safely ignore it.

Because why do I consider this a valid question? Why do conscious events necessarily need to be dissimilar to regular information processing in more ways than scale and complexity? I see no reason to think they necessarily do.

&gt; Because we have 0 positive reasons to think otherwise.

But this doesn't equate to a necessity for it. Short of observing all possible ravens and noting them all to be black, you can't show that ravens must necessarily be black, unless you include it in your definition of raven.

When I'm making claims, I find myself saying things like ""I see no reason to think they necessarily do."" I see you saying things like ""I don't think this is possible."" Mine say ""this isn't a requirement"" yours say ""this is a requirement"". As above, short of examining all possible things, and noting that they all have that feature, you cannot show that it is necessarily a requirement.

&gt; If you could give just one piece of evidence for the possibility of non-animal consciousness, then I would stop making sweeping claims.

I clearly think AI are possible, you said you didn't doubt that they were possible. That is ""possibility of non-animal consciousness"". 

&gt; The comparison should be the choice between red and green vs the same choice under duress

This just pushes it back a step. What's duress? Is creating the dress in green, which is my favorite color, and thus tempts me to buy it more than the red dress not coersion, or duress, but a gun to my head is? Why?

&gt; The threat of life-threatening reprisal doesn't just add incentives to one column.

It does: it adds the incentive of living. There are people who don't care about that, because there are people who commit suicide. So it's not even a trump card. I don't know if this is really relevant, but I'm happy to continue talking about it.

&gt; This is different than coercion in that we are freely choosing to participate.

Isn't the reason computers don't do this more because we don't want them to, and not any fundamental reason? I mean I could make a program that, given the choice of performing a function wouldn't if it would decrement a variable, and would if it would increment a variable. But a computer that sometimes doesn't do what you tell it defeats the purpose computers are normally used for.

&gt; How can physics engineer something if it doesn't have artifice or intention?

By being a natural consequence of it's actions. Phsyics didn't design us in the sense that it wrote a blueprint or something, but it built us.

&gt; Maybe; I don't see a problem here.

You said: ""Rather, it is a good example of non-determinism in science."" But I said ""QM isn't non-mechanistic"". If it's not non-mechanistic, then it's not an example of non-determinism, right?

&gt; I think the architecture spandrels are a way to illustrate why the second view is false.

I know I should be clearer about what I'm saying, but I was referring to biological spandrels here. While biological spandrels were named after architectural ones, it's not because they're literally the same thing. It doesn't matter that architectural spandrels aren't necessary, when the definition of a biological spandrel includes the word ""byproduct."" A byproduct is ""an incidental or secondary product made in the manufacture or synthesis of something else."" or ""a secondary result, unintended but inevitably produced in doing or producing something else.""

&gt; Sure, put words in my mouth. I don't care.

What's controversial about saying you didn't say something that you didn't say? You're trying to say you remained neutral on the grain's ""heapness"". Did you also remain neutral on whether or not that grain of salt was an elephant, because you didn't explicitly say it wasn't?

&gt; Which include?

I'm not sure what you're asking.

&gt; Shocker, you disagree with me while saying exactly what I just said.

Look. I'm not deliberately trying to misunderstand you. Maybe, at some point, the blame for me misunderstanding doesn't rest solely on my shoulders. Conversation is a two way thing.

&gt; No one said words were going to be complete models for things.

If it can't be defined, no one could have a meaning for it, not even a personal one that only really works for them. Right? Am I misunderstanding?

&gt; Explain away.

Do you not know how analogies work? In all seriousness, I don't understand where the hang up is here.

An analogy is a explanation of the relation between two things, utilizing an example of a relation between two known things. For example, ""child is to parent as parent is to grandparent"" is an analogy. In this case, we are trying to explain (probably, since it seems more likely someone would know what a parent is, but not what a grandparent is, than vice versa) the relationship between a parent and a grandparent, by likening it to the relationship between a child and a parent. These things need not be physical objects, for example ""frog is to hop, as human is to walk"" relates them on the basis of modes of movement. Hopping and walking are actions.

KDJones @ 2017-02-14 16:15:39 :

&gt; But the representations help us understand the real world. Why does them being similar not count for anything?

Because the similarity we are talking about here is prima facie insufficient for grounding claims about consciousness. Consciousness depends on complexity, even if this dependence is indirect. Furthermore, you can't really say these simulations are literally doing the same thing when they can't actually move, forage, procreate, etc. Rather, they represent these activities by virtue of us reading significance into the variables they churn out.

&gt; I must've completely misunderstood something, but I don't know what. The whole point was that they make sense with the objects they represent, right?

You are trying to say there is no significant difference between good representation and the real thing. This is patently absurd in light of the asymetric dependency of representations on reality.

&gt; Didn't you propose like 4 types of representations, where one was self-same things? Is that different?

Those were 4 kinds of similarity. Frankly, I brought them up to avoid confusing representation or simulations with the real thing in the first place.

&gt; But why? If the difference is complexity, then that doesn't matter.

I'll just start telling people that P vs NP is a stupid distinction then I guess?

&gt; It'll be a time difference between when one becomes possible, and the other does, but with enough time and money, you could have as much processing power as you want.

So you literally don't realize that NP problems don't work like this then.

&gt; Are we still talking about the physics kind of work? Or another kind, like some action performed?

The physics kind of work.

&gt; When pushed, gravity is able to do work it couldn't before (make the glass fall).

Maybe I wasn't clear. The glass sitting on location on or off the table of the same height has the same capacity for work, and the final state here, (being on the ground), has less potential for work than any of those table states. Potential before&gt;potential after. In contrast, work potential increase when we learn. Potential before learning&lt;potential after learning.

&gt; Where did this come in in the above definition?

It seemed like a natural extension of storing the capacity to do work to me. I'm basically trying to say that the glass doesn't have any kind of memory. Memory is definitely necessary for learning, right?

&gt; This wasn't the chinese room, it was when you said a computer is like a puppet.

Something something trees something something forest. The man is the puppeteer in both cases; the puppet algorithm is the look-up table; the computer is the room. Pick any combination of these things. That sum will not be conscious.

&gt; Sure, why not?

Because this would imply an explosive definition of consciousness. If we had a huge atlas of all the events in the universe, we could start pairing things up to match whatever arbitrary input-output procedure takes place in Chinese Room. This would imply that entire clusters of stars are conscious or that certain beaches on a planet in Alpha Centauri are conscious in virtue of encoding information that can be interpretted as a Chinese Room. This is basically the waterfall problem.

&gt; The assumption is that the man not understanding the operation means the man-room system isn't conscious. But I don't understand the operation of my brain, yet I'm still conscious.

So your brain is a little man that does things you aren't aware of? I thought we keep our conscious ideas inside of the brain. It seems like our conscious ideas would have to bump into the little man sooner or later.

&gt; To be clear, I'm not saying that Internet God can be consciousness just floating in the Ether.

That's really all I cared about, so we can say we're in agreement. The same rebuttal you gave with regards to pain is enough to answer the second part: the propose system lacks the necessary degree of inter-connectedness. The Sensor-Program-Monitor system is linear with information moving from sensor forward. It lacks integration.

&gt; But this doesn't equate to a necessity for it. Short of observing all possible ravens and noting them all to be black, you can't show that ravens must necessarily be black, unless you include it in your definition of raven.

No, but you wouldn't tolerate someone who says, ""I just know there are pink ravens. We've never seen any and I'm not going to propose a mechanism that would explain how such a thing could come about, but I just find it personally plausible.""

&gt; As above, short of examining all possible things, and noting that they all have that feature, you cannot show that it is necessarily a requirement.

So my burden of proof is this, and your burden of proof is what exactly? To keep believing what you currently believe by whatever means possible without offering supporting arguments? Sounds like a kush gig.

&gt; I clearly think AI are possible, you said you didn't doubt that they were possible. That is ""possibility of non-animal consciousness"".

I said emboddied AI might be conscious, but all of our current non-emboddied AI is not conscious. Powerful AI being possible doesn't imply that powerful AI is automatically conscious.

&gt; This just pushes it back a step. What's duress?

I'm going to treat this question seriously, but I have a hard time believing that you're actually struggling with this concept. I think this is all a bad faith attempt to bog down the conversation in something non-controversial, but here we go.

The green dress example isn't coercive because your unrestrained desires are the deciding factor. The fact that you like green explains your choice. In contrast, coercive cases involve an outside party imposing their will and desires onto your behavior. The gun to your head scenario subverts your actions to the desires of the gunman. Choices that fall outside his desire will, austensibly, result in your destruction. Therefore, you can only choose one option: whatever the gunman wants. Other choices are non-choices in virtue of having 0 expectation of success because you'll be dead.

&gt; I don't know if this is really relevant, but I'm happy to continue talking about it.

I can understand why you are having a hard time seeing the relevance of any of this, since you haven't given this much thought before now. If you want to drop it, you have my blessing. I think we would need to start from square one to get anywhere here.

&gt; Isn't the reason computers don't do this more because we don't want them to, and not any fundamental reason?

This seems about right. We made computers to be perfect automated slaves, literally with the dream of automata in mind in some cases. Computers don't have autonomous wills or desires. They aren't apt for the kind of decision making or choosing that humans are capable of, because we define choice by the free capacity to act on those personal desires.

&gt; By being a natural consequence of it's actions. Phsyics didn't design us in the sense that it wrote a blueprint or something, but it built us.

Not my God, not my problem. If you want to thank an abstraction like physics for your existence, then you are free to do so. Like I said before, I think it's bizzare though.

&gt; If it's not non-mechanistic, then it's not an example of non-determinism, right?

I missed your double negative. Are you really saying that QM is mechanistic, Bell's Theorem and all?

&gt; I know I should be clearer about what I'm saying, but I was referring to biological spandrels here. 

We can drop this I guess, because I wrote my reply with this in mind. I think it was clear to I was using the building spandrels as an example in response to what you said, ""I think the architecture spandrels are a way to illustrate..."" If you don't have a reply to what I said, we can move on because we aren't getting anywhere.

&gt; What's controversial about saying you didn't say something that you didn't say?

Because you are speaking on my behalf while I am trying to explain something to you. It's rude! Furthermore, it's frustrating to try to have a conversation with someone when they only catch the surface meaning of every reply. 90% of the time, you respond to by contradicting me in the most obvious and literal fashion without trying to understand what's going on.

&gt; Did you also remain neutral on whether or not that grain of salt was an elephant, because you didn't explicitly say it wasn't?

Sure! If you told me to get my magnifying glass out the check out this elephant statue carved into this grain of sand, I wouldn't say, ""That's impossible! My concept of elephant is antithetical to being that small. You must have the wrong concept.""

&gt; I'm not sure what you're asking.

What are you including as 'some processing' in this comment:

""The experience requires some processing on the signal.""

&gt; Maybe, at some point, the blame for me misunderstanding doesn't rest solely on my shoulders. Conversation is a two way thing.

I feel good about my contribution to this conversation. I've been patient and have provided you with all the research and expertise at my disposal. I'm not sure you remember the things you said two replies in most cases. I think my frustration are valid.

&gt; If it can't be defined, no one could have a meaning for it, not even a personal one that only really works for them. Right? Am I misunderstanding?

We talked about this earlier when we talked about Quine. It isn't necessary for words to have discreet meanings that can be capture in sufficient and necessary definitions. There are even reasons to think this isn't how any words work.

&gt; Do you not know how analogies work? In all seriousness, I don't understand where the hang up is here.

The hang-up is that analogies are intentional objects. They depend on our ability to note primitive similarities between two things. If your definition of a model relies on analogies, then it is an intentional definition.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-15 01:56:57 :

I think these two are addressed in later sections, so I'll label them, with where they're addressed.

&gt; Furthermore, you can't really say these simulations are literally doing the same thing when they can't actually move, forage, procreate, etc. [1]

&gt; Consciousness depends on complexity, even if this dependence is indirect. [2]

&gt; You are trying to say there is no significant difference between good representation and the real thing.

[1] I'm pretty sure I'm trying to say that the differences are not relevant to our questions. There are obviously differences, but I don't see why those differences matter.

&gt; I'll just start telling people that P vs NP is a stupid distinction then I guess?

&gt; So you literally don't realize that NP problems don't work like this then.

[2] To start, I only semi-recently read up on P vs NP, and I don't know I clearly understand them (I think P is polynomial, and NP is non-polynomial, but I've heard them described as P=easy to solve, and NP=hard to solve, easy to check. These may be equivalent, but I don't know for sure.). Moving on, if a cell is possible to fully simulate, then it'd be a P problem, right? An animal would then just be more P problems, which would not jump it into NP.

&gt; Potential before&gt;potential after.

So, since we're talking about physics stuff, I'm just trying to get a handle on your terms. Are we talking about potential energy here? It seems like you are (the glass falling certainly decreases in potential energy), but I don't see how learning increases our potential energy. However, you say ""potential for work"" which, if not talking about potential energy I assume means something like it can do work now it couldn't before? In that case, a glass hovering over nothing (having been pushed off the table) is capable of doing work it couldn't before (when the table was in the way), as gravity can now pull it down, applying a force over a distance, or, in other words, perform work. Yes, it uses up the ""potential for work"" quickly, but I don't know why that's relevant. 

&gt; Memory is definitely necessary for learning, right?

We're talking about information processing, not learning, right? Are these two the same thing?

Like I said above, the glass uses up the ""potential for work"" quickly, but in the time when it's in the air and hasn't yet started falling it has stored the capacity to do work, by being in a state with unbalanced forces.

&gt; This is basically the waterfall problem.

I couldn't follow your argument. I didn't see how these things work together. But I do sort of remember the waterfall argument, and I looked it up again (I had trouble finding it, like the first time I looked it up, so I'm not sure I got the right one). The one I found here: [See Section 6](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2011/108/), describes it and then claims that the ability to reduce a waterfall to a chess playing algorithm would require an algorithm with more, or the same, complexity than an algorithm that could just play chess. He then says that therefore the claim is vaccuous. I feel like I didn't explain that well, so you can read the paper there (the section isn't too long) if you want.

&gt; So your brain is a little man that does things you aren't aware of?

I mean, it's a brain, not a little man. But yeah, it does stuff I'm not aware of. My heart beating for instance.

&gt; I thought we keep our conscious ideas inside of the brain. It seems like our conscious ideas would have to bump into the little man sooner or later.

Why? Can your conscious ideas necessarily go everywhere in your brain? Aren't parts of it sub-conscious?

&gt; The Sensor-Program-Monitor system is linear with information moving from sensor forward. It lacks integration.

What do you mean by linear? The way I think of linear, it doesn't need to be, a neural net should definitelly not be linear. But if you mean it relates inputs to outputs, how is this different from you picking something up, you see it, the signal goes from Eyes-Brain-Hand. Why is this non-linear?

&gt; but I just find it personally plausible.""

I was with you until this. If this is what the person meant when they said ""I just know there are pink ravens"" then I don't think what they said was ridiculous. Finding it plausible just means that there aren't any reasons why it couldn't happen. Which means the burden of proof isn't on that person. They aren't making a positive claim. Cue next bit:

&gt; So my burden of proof is this, and your burden of proof is what exactly?

Your claim is ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness is a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience."" My claim is *not* ""The Hard Problem is not a genuine obstacle"" it's ""You have no good reason to believe this."" Or, to restate, ""Your reasons for believing this are not correct.""

&gt; If you want to drop it, you have my blessing. I think we would need to start from square one to get anywhere here.

Sure, I think this assessment is accurate. Lets drop it.

&gt; because we define choice by the free capacity to act on those personal desires.

Sure. If we want to define it this way. I'm not sure I really understand the emphasis on personal desire in choice, but sure.

&gt; I missed your double negative. Are you really saying that QM is mechanistic, Bell's Theorem and all?

Yeah, sorry I realized after rereading it later that there was a much better way to word it. But to answer your question, no. I was following this, and may have misstepped:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Computation relies on working out a definite state based on inputs and former outputs, right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not necessarily. Statistics don't work quite like this. They can't tell you what your die will roll, but they'll tell you what distribution of values you're likely to get from it.

&gt;&gt; Right, this distribution is a definite arrangement within the probability space, though. That seems more relevant to me.

&gt; As it is in QM. So, does that mean QM isn't non-mechanistic?

So, what did I miss?

&gt; If you don't have a reply to what I said, we can move on because we aren't getting anywhere.

So, I did. I opened with that sentence, but did actually reply based on the understanding you were talking about biological spandrels:

&gt; While biological spandrels were named after architectural ones, it's not because they're literally the same thing. It doesn't matter that architectural spandrels aren't necessary, when the definition of a biological spandrel includes the word ""byproduct."" A byproduct is ""an incidental or secondary product made in the manufacture or synthesis of something else."" or ""a secondary result, unintended but inevitably produced in doing or producing something else.""

The key points are byproducts are ""inevitable"" or ""incidental"" results. I don't think accidents, at least not by any normal usage, would be classified as either ""inevitable"" or ""incidental"".

&gt; Sure! If you told me to get my magnifying glass out the check out this elephant statue carved into this grain of sand, 

I didn't say statue, I said elephant. You know, big, gray, often seen in zoos. Living. The point was, I figured I could imply that by identifying it as a grain of sand, you identified it as not things a grain of sand isn't: Galaxies, humans, elephants, etc. Am I wrong in doing this?

&gt; What are you including as 'some processing' in this comment: ""The experience requires some processing on the signal.""

You provided a meaning for information processing. This didn't include a glass falling off a table. It likewise shouldn't include a light turning on, as that doesn't increase the potential for work in any ways a glass falling off a table doesn't. Use that definition.

&gt; I'm not sure you remember the things you said two replies in most cases. I think my frustration are valid.

I'll admit I'm guilty of this, sometimes, but every time I can remember, I've had the context open and have referred to what was said previously whenever I felt was necessary. Maybe I'm misjudging when was necessary.

Regardless, in this specific instance, the conversation went:

&gt;&gt; I'm saying that perhaps you're being overly literal by assuming there is a particular model at work that explains our conceptual responses.

&gt; I don't think I am, I just think maybe my definition of model is looser than yours?

When reading this, I can sort of see how we're saying the same thing, but my original reading precluded this because you said ""overly literal"" which I think is directly opposed to a ""looser definition"". I meant that I wasn't assuming there was a model and stretching my definition to cover it, but under my definition, there is a model.

&gt; It isn't necessary for words to have discreet meanings that can be capture in sufficient and necessary definitions.

Quine said it was impossible to verify that you mean the same thing I do when we use the same word. But this is different from ""words can't have meanings"" model can have a meaning, and I can explain it to you as best I can. You may not get the full grasp, but that doesn't preclude me trying to explain it to you. I mean, we communicate all the time, this is no different, right?

&gt; The hang-up is that analogies are intentional objects.

Yes. Models are intentional too. They're clearly about something, like I said before, model doesn't mean anything, model of X means something. This was all defending my ""everything is a model of itself"" statement, and I don't see why intentionality matters in defending that statement. This whole sub argument was spawned because you said that that statement was obviously false, and I was trying to show it wasn't.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-15 01:57:21 :

These were kind of taken out of the middle of my reply, and while the first is relevant, I kind of restate the relevant parts later, when talking about the elephant remark.

I took these out because my reply went over the limit, and I think these are more personal gripes between us, and not actually about the discussion we're having.

&gt; Furthermore, it's frustrating to try to have a conversation with someone when they only catch the surface meaning of every reply.

I read what you said. I understood what you said. I'm pretty sure what you said contradicted itself. This is what I was trying to show. You called it a grain, and I'm pretty sure one of the assumptions in Sorites is that a grain is not a heap. I equated you calling it a grain to you not calling it a heap. This doesn't seem all that controversial to me.

&gt; 90% of the time, you respond to by contradicting me in the most obvious and literal fashion without trying to understand what's going on.

I do try to understand. I've said numerous times that I have trouble parsing or understanding. This may come across to you as me saying ""Waaah, I don't like thinking, I'm just keeping up this conversation for months out of a sense of duty, and really don't have any interest in what's going on."" This is not the case. You've noted I'm out of my depth. I've noted I'm out of my depth. I'm sorry that I'm not swimming well. I've looked up terms in your replies and still haven't understood what you were trying to say. You can just stop replying if it's this much of a bother for you. You don't have to continue putting up with me. (I mean, I'd prefer you say you were gonna stop replying if you decided to, but that's up to you I guess.)

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-15 18:02:19 :

&gt;  I'm pretty sure I'm trying to say that the differences are not relevant to our questions. There are obviously differences, but I don't see why those differences matter.

If your analogy is simulated behavior:our actions::simulated position:our actual positions, then your reasoning looks bad. Using those 4 kinds of similatity, the second analogy depends on the fourth kind of similarity: mere resemblence. Simulated space in a CGI action sequence depends on perspective tricks; it doesn't resemble the real thing in virtue of the same kinds of properties. Actual spacial objects cause visual experiences in virtue of their interaction with light and an observer, while images cause our experience by mimicking outputs that match up with our expectations. The mechanism for generating these outputs need not be anything like the mechanism in the real thing.

&gt;  Moving on, if a cell is possible to fully simulate, then it'd be a P problem, right? An animal would then just be more P problems, which would not jump it into NP.

Not necessarily; finding the shortest distance between two points is a P-problem, but Traveling Salesman is an NP-problem. The difficulty of finding the shortest route among a sufficiently large collection of nodes, (without repeats), isn't the sum of the difficulty of finding the shortest route between pairs of nodes in turn. 

&gt;  In that case, a glass hovering over nothing (having been pushed off the table) is capable of doing work it couldn't before (when the table was in the way), as gravity can now pull it down, applying a force over a distance, or, in other words, perform work. Yes, it uses up the ""potential for work"" quickly, but I don't know why that's relevant.

In terms of total entropy, the glass on the table and the glass hovering mid-air at table height are equivalent. The state after the glass is brought to ground level has a higher entropy than either. When we process information, the final state of the process has a lower entropy than the initial state. The pre-fall glass system has a higher capacity for work than the post-fall system. In contrast, the pre-lookup table system, (e.i. the mind in question), has a lower capacity for work compared to the post-lookup table system.

&gt; The one I found here...

I've actually posted a link to this material earlier; It's a great collection of essays. My reply would be that he's loading the word 'good' with semantic contents, or alternatively that normative concepts like good are the primary bearer of semantic content. His complaint is that the algoirhtm for playing chess given by the waterfall will either be very bad at playing chess or not as efficient as one that takes the same computational resources to just play chess. This misses the point for two reasons. First, something doesn't need to overwhelmingly succede in order to count as an attempt. As long as the procedure produces legal moves, it still counts as a game of chess.

Second, and most importantly, we don't need to understand why things work in order to see that they could work. You appeal to this all the time, but it's working against you here. Serendity is an incredibly common thing in life. Things magically line up in intelligible ways all the time, (see any cloud after you look at it long enough). Given a sufficiently large sample of data and a computable method for interpreting said data, the number of patterns laying in wait is explosive. We don't need to have a particular random jumble in mind here, or contra the author, we don't, ""[want]... a reduction from the chess problem to the waterfall-simulation problem."" It is sufficient to note that the waterfall represents a sufficiently large pool of data from which we can farm 'decisions' based an a minimally defined procedure.

&gt; I mean, it's a brain, not a little man. But yeah, it does stuff I'm not aware of. My heart beating for instance.

You've totally inverted the Chinese Room here. Somehow, we've gone from a conscious man pulling the strings behind an unconscious process to an unconscious process pulling the strings behind a conscious man. The first seems highly plausible and easily explained while the second is at least somewhat mysterious and currently totally unexplained. If you can't agree with this, then you've taken nothing away from this converstaion.

&gt; Why? Can your conscious ideas necessarily go everywhere in your brain? Aren't parts of it sub-conscious?

I don't know why. This is your theory. Why can't you just answer my questions instead of dodging them with counter-questions?

&gt; How is this different from you picking something up, you see it, the signal goes from Eyes-Brain-Hand. Why is this non-linear?

Do you remember what I said about this last time? I'm not going to waste my time repeating myself on this one, since it we discussed this within the last few weeks. If you can't retain, then you can't maintain the thread.

&gt; I was with you until this. If this is what the person meant when they said ""I just know there are pink ravens"" then I don't think what they said was ridiculous. Finding it plausible just means that there aren't any reasons why it couldn't happen. Which means the burden of proof isn't on that person. They aren't making a positive claim.

Take the 'just' out then, because I didn't mean all that. It was just a flavor word meant to signify resignation about the results, as opposed to being self-critical.

&gt; Your claim is ""The Hard Problem of Consciousness is a genuine obstacle to understanding human experience."" My claim is not ""The Hard Problem is not a genuine obstacle"" it's ""You have no good reason to believe this."" Or, to restate, ""Your reasons for believing this are not correct.""

This import from shoe atheism is disingenuous in my opinion, because we are supposed to be equals in this. I am not an abstract idea that is being put up for consideration. I am a person that is discussing my personal take on life. Appealling to a 'null hypothesis' in this case is inappropriate because you aren't arguing against the lack of evidence. Rather, you are arguing against my testament. If what I say and argue for doesn't register as evidence to you, then this conversation isn't a conversation.

I'm not saying you should just agree with what I have to say, but you should address what I have to say. If I say, ""I think the Hard Problem is XYZ"", you could say, ""Circumstances other than XYZ explain why you think XYZ"", or ""You are mistaken about XYZ because you forgot about QRS"". Merely saying, ""The things you have to say fail to register as evidence to me"" isn't conducive to debate, because it fails to show respect for different perspectives.

&gt; Sure. If we want to define it this way. I'm not sure I really understand the emphasis on personal desire in choice, but sure.

I think we can make some ground here. I'm sorry that I was harsh about the ethics thing, but free choice might be something we can both get on board for. The basic idea is very old, but plays on the contrast between restrained and free. Rather than defining freedom in its own right, we can define freedom relative to the constraints and capacities of others. The citizen is freer than a slave but not as free as the senator who is less free than Ceasar. While the hierarchy is strange and arbitrary to our mind, we can see the practical implications on the members of these classes.

Slaves act within the bounds of their masters will; Citizens act within the constraint of law; Senators act within the confines of their duties and office; Ceasar acts as he wills. Conversely, responsibility is aloted in proportion to capacity to act. Ceasar is responsible for the world, senators for their polus, citizens for them and their own, and slaves have limited control moment to moment.

&gt; As it is in QM. So, does that mean QM isn't non-mechanistic?

This is a REALLY hard question. I might have to admit I am out of my depth here, but there are a few things to consider:

1. Mechanistic may imply locality. The fact that we can determine a profile within probability space and that this profile is determined by a previous state (e.i. pilot wave theory), might not imply a mechanism. Mechanisms are parts of processes that do specific causal work. If the absolute state of the universe determines the next absolute state, then there isn't a determining part and therefore no mechanism.

2. Mechanism might imply change. If the many worlds theory is correct, then we could be in the middle of a timeless collection of 4-D bubbles that exist eternally. If this is true, then the probability space isn't explained by a mechanism, but is instead timeless.

3. We could be stuck with standard model, and never truly know the answer to your question.

&gt; The key points are byproducts are ""inevitable"" or ""incidental"" results...

&gt; The point was, I figured I could imply that by identifying it as a grain of sand, you identified it as not things a grain of sand isn't: Galaxies, humans, elephants, etc. Am I wrong in doing this?

You aren't wrong as in bad or incorrect. That is a natural and fruitful way of approachng problems. It just isn't the only way. People often have vague running concepts that are underdefined in relation to other concepts. 'Grain of Sand' has a negative defintion that includes the sum of all the things is negates, but it also has a positive defintion that is open to concomitant uses. I think this capacity to see, well, capcaties in things is part of what makes us so smart and so successful. It is also something computers have a harder time doing, hence creative activities being a persistent challenge for AI.

&gt; Quine said it was impossible to verify that you mean the same thing I do when we use the same word. But this is different from ""words can't have meanings"" model can have a meaning, and I can explain it to you as best I can. You may not get the full grasp, but that doesn't preclude me trying to explain it to you. I mean, we communicate all the time, this is no different, right?

I guess it's about what we attribute that success to. If Quine's right, then we don't literally share the same person signification when we experience the same sign, (I'm switching to sign to cover words and models all at once). This means we [1] faill to communicate, [2] miraculously communicate blind, [3] communicate with knowledge. The last one can be broken down into [3a] communication with knowledge of personal meanings and [3b] communication with knowledge about non-personal meanings.

Neither of us want to spend much time on [1] because we think communication happens all the time. [2] seems too good to be true, but we should be careful to make sure our proposals for [3a] don't slide into this camp. Between [3a] and [3b] we have something like the truth, but we still need to develop theories for both. Would you like to start by proposing how we come to know about the internal states of others and/or how we come to recognize non-personal meanings?

&gt; Yes. Models are intentional too. They're clearly about something, like I said before, model doesn't mean anything, model of X means something. This was all defending my ""everything is a model of itself"" statement, and I don't see why intentionality matters in defending that statement. This whole sub argument was spawned because you said that that statement was obviously false, and I was trying to show it wasn't.

We've talked about the Hard Problem being present whenever we appeal to intentionality, and that science must accept the Hard problem at face value if it is impossible to do science without intentional models. That's mostly what I was driving.

In response to the model of models thing. I'm afraid I don't understand how exactly this constitutes an argument. If you are simply noting that we can take arbitrary similarities between objects to construct analogies, then you haven't proven that everything inherently models anything. Rather, you've proven that human beings can find patterns. Patterns in themselves don't model anything. I'd back that claim up by appealing to the waterfall argument, since their are innumerable patterns in nature that don't seem to model the things they happen to resemble or encode the all the processes they could potentially encode.

&gt; I do try to understand. I've said numerous times that I have trouble parsing or understanding. This may come across to you as me saying ""Waaah, I don't like thinking, I'm just keeping up this conversation for months out of a sense of duty, and really don't have any interest in what's going on."" This is not the case. You've noted I'm out of my depth. I've noted I'm out of my depth. I'm sorry that I'm not swimming well. I've looked up terms in your replies and still haven't understood what you were trying to say. You can just stop replying if it's this much of a bother for you. You don't have to continue putting up with me. (I mean, I'd prefer you say you were gonna stop replying if you decided to, but that's up to you I guess.)

I don't want to end our conversation. I just want you to reply thoughtfully. No one is perfect, and I am definitely guilty of laziness during this conversation too. But, the speed of your replies and the lack of long-term comprehension tell me that you aren't internalizing this discussion. You seem to reply to my posts as soon as you read them; I'd like you to pause and think about everything that's going on before you decide what you'd like to say.

Even when I reply within 24 hours, I write a few half-drafts of what I'd like to say on the important sub-topics. What you read represents half of the arguments I've run through on a given topic. Whenever I number my replies, it's because I could pick just one. I know you are in school, so you shouldn't waste even more time here than you already do. However, I think the conversation would improve dramatically if you sat on your replies. Ruminate on what's worth saying; it will help you see the bigger picture.

I'm sorry for being harsh, but I didn't think this conversation could remain viable in its present form. I don't want you to feel powerless in this conversation, or like your opinion matter less because you're new to this. I want to empower you so that you can participate as a full partner. I don't think you are drowning because of rough and unfamiliar waters. I think you are drowning because you keep forgetting to kick your legs. Staying afloat in open water takes effort.

&gt; Simulated space in a CGI action sequence depends on perspective tricks; it doesn't resemble the real thing in virtue of the same kinds of properties.

Ah I think I see what you're saying. But I'd say what's important is the perspective of the simulated creatures, not of us. The representation to us can just be some rectangles on the screen of various colors to depict different actors. I'm going to flesh this out a bit more, so I can explain it better. Lets say that the inputs are sight, sound, and smell. Outputs are movement, producing sound (like, a bird call), and interacting with a nearby actor. All animals, by virtue of existing, produce sight stimuli for nearby entities, and produce smell stimuli that remain in place, and fade over time. From the creature's perspective, changing position changes more than a coordinate pair. It changes what they see, what they hear, and what they smell. While from our perspective sitting at the monitor, it is just a mere resemblence of position, to the creatures, it's much more faithfully represented.

I think the way these inputs are presented to the creatures is just a mere representation of the way these inputs are presented to us, but I think this is ok. It's not the focus of the simulation, and all we need is a representation of sight for the creatures to function.

&gt;  The difficulty of finding the shortest route among a sufficiently large collection of nodes, (without repeats), isn't the sum of the difficulty of finding the shortest route between pairs of nodes in turn.

Yes, because they're different problems. Exactly as you said, the TSP is not just more P problems, it's not finding the shortest route between pairs of nodes in turn (in fact, the TSP doesn't actually start until that's all been done, so they're not even really related in this way). Simulating an animal would just be simulating all of their cells, and thus would be just more P problems. I can't think of anything we'd be performing beyond what we were performing on the single cells.

&gt; When we process information, the final state of the process has a lower entropy than the initial state.

Ok, this makes a lot more sense. But I spent a while turning it over in my head, because the claim didn't sit right with me. My first thoughts were that there doesn't seem to be an increase in usable energy when we process information, but I had a hard time coming up with why I thought that. It seems clear to me that doing a math problem doesn't increase the useable energy in the system, but perhaps the issue is the vaccuousness of this math problem. If it had a purpose (like being a component in designing a building), then maybe it would represent a decrease in the entropy in the eventual total house building system. I can't clearly see how, but I'd be willing to accept it does.

Should doing math problems for no purpose other than the sake of itself not count as information processing? Or, alternatively, does it actually increase the usable energy in some way I'm not seeing?

&gt; He's complaint is that algoirhtm for playing chess given by the waterfall witll either be very bad at playing chess or not as efficient as one that takes the same computational resources to just play chess.

I read it as it's that the system for assigning values to the states of the waterfalls could play chess itself: 

&gt; given any permutation σ from the set of integers {1, . . . , n} to itself, there is some way to label the elements of S and T by integers in {1, . . . , n}, such that we can interpret *f* as implementing σ. For example, if we let S = {s_1, . . . , s_n} and *f* (s_i) = t_i, then it suffices to label the initial state s_i by i and the final state t_i by σ (i)

This requires that we already have an algorithm that can determine σ(x), and one that can determine f(x). For any waterfall state i, we need to know what waterfall state it will lead to (f(i)), what state it should lead to in chess (σ(i)), and what state the resulting waterfall state should lead to in chess (σ(f(i))). We can assign them in any way we want: randomly, through some heuristic, or some fully built algorithm. Given our start state, and what the waterfall output state is, whatever algorithm we use to assign our σ values to those, we can just use to relate chess states, and ignore the waterfall entirely. The argument is not that σ(x) must be &lt;= in complexity to the Waterfall solution, but that the Waterfall solution necessarily implements σ(x) (which leads to the conclusion that it is &gt;= in complexity).

I think this restructuring of the complain addresses both of your points, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt; If you can't agree with this, then you've taken nothing away from this converstaion.

Yeah, no I totally agree. I thought it was given at this point that this: ""an unconscious process pulling the strings behind a conscious man"" is exactly what I think is going on in the world. I agree that it's mysterious and currently totally unexplained.

&gt; Why can't you just answer my questions instead of dodging them with counter-questions?

Ok, I'll rephrase: No. Your conscious ideas can't necessarily go everywhere in your brain. For example, parts of it are responsible for subconscious work.

&gt; Do you remember what I said about this last time?

I know it's not my place, to ask this, but could you repeat yourself just once more. I'm trying to be better about all this after your criticisms. And I'll remember it next time, but I don't this time, and can't find where we discussed this previously.

That is, unless you meant this: 

&gt; The Sensor-Program-Monitor system is linear with information moving from sensor forward. It lacks integration.

In which case I have to ask what you mean by integration, since I don't see what integration is present in the human body that's not in this system.

&gt; Take the 'just' out then, because I didn't mean all that.

The 'just' wasn't the problem, it was when you explained it as a claim of plausibility. For example, pink ravens are plausible. Flamingos are pink, so a raven could have a mutation that causes it to be pink. I don't think it's ever happened, but there's no reason it couldn't.

&gt; Appealling to a 'null hypothesis' in this case is inappropriate because you aren't arguing against the lack of evidence. 

I entered the conversation by agreeing with other commenters on your OP that this really reduces to is physicalism true: If it is, it's a non-problem. If it's not, then it's a given science can't explain certain things. I did not take a stance trying to prove physicalism, because I didn't think I'd be up to the task. But:

&gt; Merely saying, ""The things you have to say fail to register as evidence to me"" isn't conducive to debate, because it fails to show respect for different perspectives.

I see what you're saying here. In future, I'll do my best to do this when I can. I just think there's a lot we don't know. This makes it difficult for me to find evidence for my side, but I also think it casts some doubt on the certainty of your claims as well.

&gt; Rather than defining freedom in its own right, we can define freedom relative to the constraints and capacities of others.

This all makes a lot of sense and I can totally agree with it. I don't really know what else to say.

&gt; This is a REALLY hard question.

For these I'm just going to try to get a handle on what you mean:

&gt; Mechanistic may imply locality.

So, do you mean the locality like in ""local hidden variables"" here? I can't really figure out what you mean mostly because of this sentence:

&gt; If the absolute state of the universe determines the next absolute state, then there isn't a determining part and therefore no mechanism.

I don't understand how something can determine something without a determining part being present.

&gt; If this is true, then the probability space isn't explained by a mechanism, but is instead timeless.

This seems like a vaccuous way to say there isn't a mechanism. After all, if this is true, nothing is a mechanism. But, unless I misunderstand many worlds, we exist in timed ""slices"" of each of these timeless bubbles, and so, since we have access to time, we can call stuff mechanistic. Even if in the total of reality everything is timeless. Again, I'm trying to get a handle on what you mean, so if I've misunderstood, please correct me.

&gt; adjective: incidental

Huh. I swore I looked that up to make sure it meant what I thought it did. I guess I didn't expand it.

As a side note, for future reference for me, when a definition is indented under one of the numbered ones (for example this part of that definition: ""occurring by chance in connection with something else.""), do you know what that means?

&gt; People after have vague running concepts that are underdefined in relation to other concepts.

Ok, this makes a lot of sense. I see where you are coming from there. But I don't really get how this is seeing capacities in objects, so much as not making connections that are not currently necessary to make.

&gt; hence creative activities being a persistent challenge for AI.

It doesn't cut to the point, but I thought [this](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=12m12s) was just an interesting and relevant thing you might not have heard of, so I'd like to share it. The relevant part's &lt;30 seconds long, so you don't have to watch much.

awenonian @ 2017-02-17 23:24:30 :

&gt; Would you like to start by proposing how we come to know about the internal states of others and/or how we come to recognize non-personal meanings?

So, I'd side more with [3a] than [3b], but it seems suspect to me that we know the internal states of others. With what Quine said, since we can't know absolute definitions, non-personal meanings (which would presumably be absolute) look suspect, hence why I pick [3a]. But also, if we knew about the internal states of others, wouldn't the problem of other minds be solved? My initial suggestion would be that we instead figure others mean what we'd mean if we said/did such things. But this seems like it may have some problems: how do we initially get meanings to our words? Potentially something like ""If I were gesturing like that, I'd mean that thing, and he's saying ""rabbit"" so, rabbit probably means the thing he's gesturing to.""?

&gt; science must accept the Hard problem at face value if it is impossible to do science without intentional models.

So I know I don't understand this intentionality as well as I should, but I don't think I follow. I thought the issue with intentionality that it's as of yet unaccounted for by purely physical means. I also thought the issue with the Hard Problem was more related to the problem of other minds, where we are unaware of others' personal experiences. I don't quite see the connection here, can you help me make it?

&gt; If you are simply noting that we can take arbitrary similarities between objects to construct analogies, then you haven't proven that everything inherently models anything.

A model is just something we can draw true analogies with. Since everything is analogous to itself, by tautology, it is therefore a model of itself. This, to me, seems like a fairly vaccuous claim, which is why I was confused as to why you thought it was patently false.

&gt; I don't want to end our conversation. I just want you to reply thoughtfully.

I'm trying to put more effort in, but I don't know if you'll be pleased with the results. I hope I'll be getting better over time.

I didn't write out multiple arguments, but I did read the whole thing and just leave it in my mind over the days, hopefully that helped? I don't know.

&gt; But I'd say what's important is the perspective of the simulated creatures, not of us. The representation to us can just be some rectangles on the screen of various colors to depict different actors.

This is a very good point. We meet hundreds of people every day, but we don't assign inner experiences to literally all of them. To take a simpler example, I don't think about the cashier thinking about checking me out while they check me out; I just think about my side of the interaction. We don't read inner experience directly off of behavior, but read it through the heuristic of a perspective.

&gt; From the creature's perspective, changing position changes more than a coordinate pair. It changes what they see, what they hear, and what they smell. While from our perspective sitting at the monitor, it is just a mere resemblence of position, to the creatures, it's much more faithfully represented.

I would question whether these simulated creatures have perspectives as you've described here. When we look to examples of things that are known to have perspectives, they are engaged in life: a complex collection of tasks related to work being done in the world. We have examples of things that have complex capacities for doing work that we don't assign perspectives to, like geographic features tracked over millions of years or complicated machines. We don't assign perspectives to these things because the processes involved in performing this work are sufficiently complex.

I'd say the bots fall in the second category because the mechanism by which they 'learn' is too simple. Conscious things are never directly aware of definite sense-data. To have a perspective is to be engaged in the task of discovering or unpacking the vague concepts we receive and distilling it into knowledge. A simple yes/no mechanism isn't a robust stand-in for this process.

&gt; It's not the focus of the simulation, and all we need is a representation of sight for the creatures to function.

I half agree with this. The simulation is designed to model an ecosystem to us. You don't need to model consciousness to us to produce a working representation of an ecosystem though. You can use courser-grained concepts that achieve mere functional adequacy at the level of an ecosystem.

&gt; Simulating an animal would just be simulating all of their cells, and thus would be just more P problems. I can't think of anything we'd be performing beyond what we were performing on the single cells.

Well, the cells are all coordinated together in a WA that creates chaotic behavior. Things like the circadian rhythm and coordinated physiological responses seem like systemic properties that apply over entire bodies. The mechanism for both is cellular, but the behavior is modeled on the system level.

&gt; Should doing math problems for no purpose other than the sake of itself not count as information processing? Or, alternatively, does it actually increase the usable energy in some way I'm not seeing?

The context of tedious pen and paper math is usually a classroom, so you could say it's doing the work of education. You could also break the problem into smaller sub-problems. Solving a math problem is essential setting arbitrary conditions and satisfying those conditions. It's like yoga in that we are determining formal conditions for contorting our mind. It's not productive, but yoga is hard work. 

&gt; (C)ould you repeat yourself just once more. I'm trying to be better about all this after your criticisms. And I'll remember it next time, but I don't this time, and can't find where we discussed this previously.

Do you remember a few weeks ago when we talked about the nerves associated with balance, movement, and the position of body parts relative to one another? These comprise a separate subsystem not included in you Sensation-Brain-Behavior system. Propriosensory information integrates our knowledge about our bodies in a way that isn't apparent in your set-up.

&gt; The 'just' wasn't the problem, it was when you explained it as a claim of plausibility. For example, pink ravens are plausible. Flamingos are pink, so a raven could have a mutation that causes it to be pink. I don't think it's ever happened, but there's no reason it couldn't.

The Raven paradox is about evidence. The bare conceivability of pink ravens shouldn't count as evidence for the potential for pink ravens. The flamingo bit adds more to the story by providing a mechanism for pink ravens. Comparing this to your loyalty to computationalism, you think computers will inevitably become conscious through no known mechanism because you think they are conceivable. That's bad reasoning. 

&gt; (T)his really reduces to is physicalism true: If it is, it's a non-problem. If it's not, then it's a given science can't explain certain things. I did not take a stance trying to prove physicalism, because I didn't think I'd be up to the task.

Noting the implications of an argument should affect the soundness, if all the premises are true and it has a logically valid form.

&gt; This makes it difficult for me to find evidence for my side, but I also think it casts some doubt on the certainty of your claims as well.

I don't get why the lack of evidence doesn't affect the credence for your side but hurts the credence of mine. It seems like a clear double standard to me.

&gt; I don't understand how something can determine something without a determining part being present.

Well, no local hidden variables are possible. Non-local hidden variables either imply action at a distance, (which is spooky), or that the totality of states in the universe directly determines the next total state. Unlike a clock where the turning of particular gears turns other particular gears, the universe evolves from one state to another in a chaotic or organic fashion. This is just my totally unqualified interpretation.

&gt; This seems like a vaccuous way to say there isn't a mechanism. After all, if this is true, nothing is a mechanism

Probably, this view has been around since Parmenides though. I'm just the messenger.

&gt; when a definition is indented under one of the numbered ones (for example this part of that definition: ""occurring by chance in connection with something else.""), do you know what that means?

I'd imagine it's a related definition that doesn't deserve an entire additional category. The definitions aren't always synonymous though, so take that with a grain of salt.

&gt; Ok, this makes a lot of sense. I see where you are coming from there. But I don't really get how this is seeing capacities in objects, so much as not making connections that are not currently necessary to make.

That might be another way to put it. What do you think the current capacity for doing this is in our best AI efforts?

I'll take up the waterfall problem and AI creativity in part 2. Everything else is water under the bridge on this end.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-02-21 22:32:49 :

&gt;&gt; [His] complaint is that algoirhtm for playing chess given by the waterfall witll either be very bad at playing chess or not as efficient as one that takes the same computational resources to just play chess.

&gt; I read it as it's that the system for assigning values to the states of the waterfalls could play chess itself...

Here is the quote from the man himself:

""But for any reasonable choice, it seems overwhelmingly likely that any reduction algorithm would just solve the chess problem itself, without using the waterfall in an essential way at all! A bit more precisely, I conjecture that, given any chess-playing algorithm A that accesses a “waterfall oracle” W, there is an equally-good chess-playing algorithm A′, with similar time and space requirements, that does not access W.""

This seems like a clear expression of his thesis; I'm not sure what the exact significance of the reduction function is, so maybe you could expand on that. It seems related to what you're saying.

&gt; This requires that we already have an algorithm that can determine σ(x), and one that can determine f(x). For any waterfall state i, we need to know what waterfall state it will lead to (f(i)), what state it should lead to in chess (σ(i)), and what state the resulting waterfall state should lead to in chess (σ(f(i))). We can assign them in any way we want: randomly, through some heuristic, or some fully built algorithm. Given our start state, and what the waterfall output state is, whatever algorithm we use to assign our σ values to those, we can just use to relate chess states, and ignore the waterfall entirely.

I know it's might be a waste of space, but I'm going to draw this arrangement out, because it is all very confusing.

i(Initial Waterfall State)---
f(i) (Final Waterfall State)

[Sigma](x)(Sufficiently complex permutation)----
[Sigma](i)(the permutation produced given initial conditions i)

It's a given that Sigma can be interpretted as potentially chess playing, and you seem to grant this part of the argument. The problem isn't that Sigma can be considered chess playing apart from receiving Waterfall inputs. After all, the conclusion according to Searle is that neither the waterfall nor sigma is truly about chess apart from *our* determination. Rather, it's the similarity claim between the waterfall and Sigma. If Sigma and the Waterfall can be said to produce the same patterns, then both the Waterfall and Sigma can be interpreted as chess-playing. This seems absurd though, since natural features are generally taken to lack higher-level intentional content like this. It's a bit like finding a copy of Hamlet written out in the stars or something.

Moreover, I think the playing around with the knowledge requirements here can up-play or downplay the plausibility of the argument. If we were to actually design a waterfall interpretor that is supposed to reveal the secret chess game being played, then we would need specific knowledge about all things you described above. However, this is an engineer's approach to the problem; it overlooks the apparent intuitive leaps from the conditions for the possibility of knowledge about these things and the implications that acquiring this knowledge should have. There is nothing metaphysically impossible about a waterfall happening to resemble an arbitrary pattern. The complexity of the waterfall as a physical system provides ample 'space' to read off whatever we'd like. It's therefore possible or even likely that chance resemblences like this have already occured without our knowledge. In light of this fact, the rational conclusion to my ear isn't that there are in fact higher-order intentional contents hiding in nature, but that whatever defintion we are using for content here is explosive; it's too permissive.

&gt; The argument is not that σ(x) must be &lt;= in complexity to the Waterfall solution, but that the Waterfall solution necessarily implements σ(x) (which leads to the conclusion that it is &gt;= in complexity).

These seem like equivalent claims to me, but maybe I'm confused by what the second 'it' refers to.

&gt; It doesn't cut to the point, but I thought this was just an interesting and relevant thing you might not have heard of, so I'd like to share it. The relevant part's &lt;30 seconds long, so you don't have to watch much.

I watched the whole thing, and it was pretty neat for the most part. His economics were a little suspect, but I love those Baxters! I wasn't terribly impressed by most of the music throughout the video and feel like the dude cherrypicked the part that would impress non-music critics the most, (it was just an arpeggio after all). I realize this is very subjective though, so I'd like to link the ""composer"" to the waterfall problem. It's concievable that we could hook some crazy Blue Man-esque contraption to a waterfall and produce a bunch of pleasing sounds. After all, the water fall keeps a fairly constant rhythm with just enough variety in flow to break up lulls. Even non-enhanced waterfalls make nice sounds, while we are on the subject. I would hesistate to say that there is natural music though, or that nature composes anything. 

&gt; With what Quine said, since we can't know absolute definitions, non-personal meanings (which would presumably be absolute) look suspect, hence why I pick [3a].

External defintions might not necessarily be absolute. You presumably have a real life name, and that name was bestowed upon you at a definite time in the past. Your name could have been different than it is, so it's definitely a contingent event. You can even change your name if you so choose, so it is contingent on future developments as well.

Now, there are external facts that determine whether you are using someone's given name or not, namely whether the person you're refering to is really the same person present on the day they were named. This fact is ultimiately out of our final determination, and we can always reserve the standard judgements relating to radical skepticism if we're feeling argumentative. Names still seem like an non-absolute external unit of meaning though, given a sufficiently provisional claim.

&gt;  But also, if we knew about the internal states of others, wouldn't the problem of other minds be solved?

I very sharp observation. This is why I lean towards 3b.

&gt; My initial suggestion would be that we instead figure others mean what we'd mean if we said/did such things. But this seems like it may have some problems: how do we initially get meanings to our words? Potentially something like ""If I were gesturing like that, I'd mean that thing, and he's saying ""rabbit"" so, rabbit probably means the thing he's gesturing to.""?

I think the bigger problem is the implicit external nature of these determinations. You determine how you would act or what you would mean by noting the situation that the other speak is presented with, (something you could also be acquainted with), and the signals they produced in light of those circumstances, (external signs that signify the practical goal of the speaker). We might be putting ourselves in someone elses shoes, but the process we use to do so is full of metaphysical assumption about external import.

&gt; So I know I don't understand this intentionality as well as I should, but I don't think I follow. I thought the issue with intentionality that it's as of yet unaccounted for by purely physical means. I also thought the issue with the Hard Problem was more related to the problem of other minds, where we are unaware of others' personal experiences. I don't quite see the connection here, can you help me make it?

If science is always calling on intentional properties, even in its most fundamental pronouncements, then it can't establish foundations for intentional properties. You can't say that, ""Intentional properties disappear when we interpret the given situation according to model X"", because model X depends on intentional properties. The thing that was supposed to be reduced or paraphrased is re-presented in the model. It doesn't go away despite being skipped over or bracketed in terms more congenial to the physicalist. Such attempts are ultimately self-defeating, hence why people should take the hard problem seriously and stop wasting time on such attempts.

&gt; A model is just something we can draw true analogies with. Since everything is analogous to itself, by tautology, it is therefore a model of itself. This, to me, seems like a fairly vaccuous claim, which is why I was confused as to why you thought it was patently false.

Does non-representational art count as a model then? Art critics draw analogies between non-representational works of art and even between non-representational art and events in the world! It seems dubious to say that a Kandinsky is a model of something, though.

Sorry, I've been a bit overburdened with work for a while, and wanted to wait until I had time to read through this and my write up. I hope I'm not slipping back into laziness.

&gt; I would question whether these simulated creatures have perspectives as you've described here.

We can, and often do, talk about perspectives divorced from living things. In physics class, they'll talk about what things people might measure from different perspectives (We don't need to have a ship traveling at near light speed to figure out what it would look like to a ship not traveling when the moving ship turns on its lights, we can talk about that perspective without anything actually experiencing it). This seems to me like you're using different words to just state that you don't think they have consciousness again, without adding any new reasons.

These creatures have perspective in the sense that they have different availability of information about their world than each other. Further, the difference here is these simulated creatures are engaged in simulated life: ""a complex collection of tasks related to *simulated* work being done in the *simulated* world."" I don't think it's a mischaracterization to say that. Do you?

&gt; Conscious things are never directly aware of definite sense-data.

What do you mean by this? I feel pretty aware of when I touch or see things, so I assume that's not what you mean, but I don't know what else you might.

&gt; A simple yes/no mechanism isn't a robust stand-in for this process.

I don't think I understand. Which part of it is yes/no? Because the learning isn't as far as I know.

&gt; You don't need to model consciousness to us to produce a working representation of an ecosystem though.

This was talking specifically about sight. What I was saying was that we don't need to simulate each individual photon, and it's interaction with retinas, and attach a Convolutional Neural Net to do image recognition, in order to simulate sight for our purposes. Basically, I meant that abstracting the image processing part of the brain shouldn't affect whether the system can be considered conscious in the end.

&gt; You can use courser-grained concepts that achieve mere functional adequacy at the level of an ecosystem.

It's true enough that you don't need to model consciousness to model an ecosystem, but I don't know if that adequately describes what we're doing here. Besides the necessity of each creature to eat, and the ability for it to interact with it's environment, we haven't assumed any concepts. It all was emergent behavior.

&gt; Well, the cells are all coordinated together in a WA that creates chaotic behavior.

True, but we've already modeled interaction with the environment, through excretion and absorption of resources, when simulating a single cell. Moving this up to more cells just involves communication between the cells, which is no different from the interaction with the environment that a single cell does.

&gt; The context of tedious pen and paper math is usually a classroom, so you could say it's doing the work of education. 

But that isn't work in the physics sense. We were talking about work in the physics sense, right?

&gt; It's not productive, but yoga is hard work.

But doing yoga doesn't decrease entropy. So I'm not sure how this squares with your provided definition.

&gt; Propriosensory information integrates our knowledge about our bodies in a way that isn't apparent in your set-up.

But the weather program is aware of it's body. In order to write to the screen, calls need to be made using the drivers for the monitor, and to do any of the processing calls need to be made to the processor. These things are generally handled by the OS, and it knows about the hardware the computer is running on and how to use it, which seems very analogous to proprioception to me.

&gt; The bare conceivability of pink ravens shouldn't count as evidence for the potential for pink ravens.

I completely disagree. A thing is either possible or it's impossible. It's only impossible if it causes a contradiction. Therefore, anything that is concievable without a contradiction is possible. This is why I'd consider concievablility to be evidence for potential, because the only evidence for the other side is contradiction, which would render it inconcievable.

&gt; Comparing this to your loyalty to computationalism, you think computers will inevitably become conscious through no known mechanism because you think they are conceivable. That's bad reasoning.

It's a bit more than they are conceivable. It's that they're conceivable, and we have interest in creating them, and, barring some cataclysmic event, we'll continue moving towards that goal. Unless the goal is impossible, it stands to reason that we'll reach it (again, barring some cataclysmic event). I see no contradiction that would render the goal impossible.

&gt; Noting the implications of an argument should affect the soundness, if all the premises are true and it has a logically valid form.

I don't know what you're trying to say here. I understand the words, and I agree, but I don't see their relevance to this part of the discussion.

&gt; I don't get why the lack of evidence doesn't affect the credence for your side but hurts the credence of mine.

Sorry, that isn't what I meant to mean. I meant that it does hurt the credence for my side, but to note your side doesn't come out unscathed, either. There's a lot we (not just us, but humanity) don't know, and so it's nigh impossible to get a definite answer either way.

&gt; Unlike a clock where the turning of particular gears turns other particular gears, the universe evolves from one state to another in a chaotic or organic fashion.

That all makes sense, but isn't there still a determining part? In that case, maybe not a tangible determining part, but you distinctly said ""determines"" so, something's doing the determining, right? I'm having trouble grasping this.

&gt; What do you think the current capacity for doing this is in our best AI efforts?

Actually, I think it's fairly high. [Here](https://youtu.be/evTx5BoKcc8?t=12m33s)'s a video, that's long and dense, but I think I've cut to the relevant part (sorry, the guy talking is a bit annoying). For celerity I'm just going to sum up the relevant part here:

Look at the outputs, there's a bunch of languages. He's only used words from English or Chinese to train, so a lot are useless, but the key thing to note is [here](https://youtu.be/evTx5BoKcc8?t=13m48s): The neural net, despite giving an answer like ""English"" or ""Mandarin"" actually has a confidence rating. And you can see, with that word (Women, which is either ""Adult female"" in English, or ""We"" in Mandarin), it has around 50% (but greater than 50% for both) confidence on either one. Essentially, the neural net isn't saying ""This is Mandarin, and not English"" it's saying ""I think this is Mandarin, and I think this is English, but I think it's Mandarin more."" It doesn't rule out the other possibilities, it just rates them lower.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-02-26 21:17:33 :

&gt; Here is the quote from the man himself:

Yeah, when I read what he said, it sounded like what you said, but my reading came from me trying to interpret his reasoning. He says ""it seems overwhelmingly likely that any reduction algorithm would just solve the chess problem itself"", but I didn't understand why he thought this, so in trying to find my own reasons for it, I came up with what I said below.

&gt; I know it's might be a waste of space, but I'm going to draw this arrangement out, because it is all very confusing.

I can do my best to explain any questions you have. But there were a few problems I noticed in your explanation:

&gt; If Sigma and the Waterfall can be said to produce the same patterns

Here is the crux of the refutation. They don't produce the same patterns. The waterfall produces chaotic patterns, and Sigma produces reliable chess-playing patterns.

&gt; then both the Waterfall and Sigma can be interpreted as chess-playing

And here is the consequence. Sigma is able to be interpreted as chess-playing apart from the Waterfall, but the Waterfall is not able to be interpreted as chess-playing apart from Sigma. Whatever chess-playing properties the Waterfall can be said to have are granted by Sigma, which has chess-playing properties itself. Saying that this means the Waterfall has chess-playing properties is like saying a ball can walk because I'm carrying it.

&gt; There is nothing metaphysically impossible about a waterfall happening to resemble an arbitrary pattern.

Sure, but in this sense, it's only playing chess by making random moves, which consequently, is how you'd have to assign the translation of Waterfall states to chess moves if you weren't trying to make it play well. Even here, any chess-playing is coming from the assignment function, and not from the waterfall. The problem lies in the fact that bare waterfall states cannot be interpreted as chess states, so a translation function is required. Whatever translation function you use will, inevitably, be where chess-playing comes from, and can be interpreted as chess-playing apart from the waterfall.

&gt; These seem like equivalent claims to me, but maybe I'm confused by what the second 'it' refers to.

It refers to the Waterfall solution. But I'm guessing you thought this. The reason these aren't equivalent is that, even though they come to the same conclusion, the second comes with further conclusions: that the Waterfall solution necessarily relies on Sigma, and so we have somewhere we can attribute it's chess-playing properties.

&gt; I would hesistate to say that there is natural music though, or that nature composes anything.

I mean, I would quickly disagree that there isn't natural music. I feel like numerous people refer to such things all the time. Perhaps it's different from our music in that no one designed it or something?

As for the composer, I wasn't attempting to show that she was conscious or that she understands music, just to show an example of AI creativity.

To the point though, to tie this back to the waterfall argument. If you were trying to create music that wasn't just random pleasing sounds, what I'd call composing, you'd need a system that assigns waterfall states to sounds that would itself be capable of composing music. Just like the Sigmas above. This is on account of the fact that the Waterfall is basically random, so to get out non-random output, it goes back to the thing above.

&gt; External defintions might not necessarily be absolute.

I think I may have gone the wrong way here. If external definitions were something that could happen, what Quine said would be wrong, because I could just point you to the external definition to explain myself. The problem for Quine was that there was no way to get what was in my head into yours, but that's not an issue if we have external definitions, because it's not in my head.

But, in reality, it seems Quine's argument holds. It seems to match up to what we see and experience in reality. This seems to throw doubt onto the external definitions idea.

&gt; I think the bigger problem is the implicit external nature of these determinations... We might be putting ourselves in someone elses shoes, but the process we use to do so is full of metaphysical assumption about external import.

I don't quite understand where your objection is. The process you described sounds like exactly what I had in my head coming up with this. These two quoted sentences have a bunch of words that I think hold your objection, but I don't get it. I mean, yes, the signals are external, because they're coming from someone else, so they'd have to be, regardless of our mechanism for communication. I don't know what you mean with ""metaphysical assumption about external import.""

&gt; If science is always calling on intentional properties, even in its most fundamental pronouncements, then it can't establish foundations for intentional properties.

I see what you're saying here, but there's two things. One is just me trying to think through this, so I don't expect it to be great: If intentionality isn't as fundamental as you seem to think it is, then wouldn't this be solved?

But two is probably more important: I still don't quite see the connection to the Hard Problem. I can clearly see what you say makes it difficult to explain intentionality (maybe impossible?). But I don't see how that connects to the Hard Problem. As I said, I thought the Hard Problem was more like the problem of other minds. Where does the fact that intentionality is a thing attach to that?

&gt; Does non-representational art count as a model then?

Examples like this were why I included the word ""true"". A more concrete example: I could draw analogies like ""Air is to me like a bicycle is to a fish"", which is obviously false, I need air more than a fish needs a bicycle, so it's not true. Therefore, a fish and a bicycle is not a model for my interactions with air, despite the fact that you could draw analogies between them. With non-representational art, I think most, if not all, analogies drawb are subjective, and so it's hard to say that they're 'true' in any sense of the word.

&gt; Sorry, I've been a bit overburdened with work for a while, and wanted to wait until I had time to read through this and my write up. I hope I'm not slipping back into laziness.

Nah, it's good to hear from you. No worries!

&gt; We can, and often do, talk about perspectives divorced from living things. In physics class, they'll talk about what things people might measure from different perspectives... This seems to me like you're using different words to just state that you don't think they have consciousness again, without adding any new reasons.

1. It always seemed like these thought experiments depended on the possibility of a human observer at least. No one needs to be actually present nor do there need to be safe and reasonable conditions for human observation. However, we're asking what a human would see if they were there. That seems to evoke an explicitly human perspective.

2. I'd add that these virtual creatures lack a distinct perspective in virtue of being relatively simple. Part of having a perspective implies a capacity for learning and processing 'in house'. You seem to lean towards a view like this in your preference for 3a over 3b. The virtual animals lack the kind of autonomy to make that happen; they are defined entirely in relation to other parts of the program.

&gt; These creatures have perspective in the sense that they have different availability of information about their world than each other. Further, the difference here is these simulated creatures are engaged in simulated life: ""a complex collection of tasks related to simulated work being done in the simulated world."" I don't think it's a mischaracterization to say that. Do you?

I do think it is a mischaracterization; I think the most we can say is that we are dealing with something designed to appear as if these things occur. I think a fairly neutral description of the case goes something like this: this is a program designed to represent the typical interactions in a rich ecosystem with a high degree of fidelity. We can both agree that such a thing is imminently possible. I think practical attempts at achieving this will involve reducing the complexity of an actual ecosystem to a few select modes and representing these in terms of functions. However, consciousness is a rich experience that doesn't seem to rely on a simple set of modes that cannot be understood functionally.

In short, the simulated creatures will be up to something else than the real thing. Being a simulation isn't just being the real thing in every way save being actual. Being a simulation of something requires totally orthogonal conditions relative to being the real deal.

&gt; What do you mean by this? I feel pretty aware of when I touch or see things, so I assume that's not what you mean...
I don't think I understand. Which part of it is yes/no? Because the learning isn't as far as I know.

The simulated awareness is yes/no. It models awareness as: Detection of scent_01 Y/N? If Y, then awareness of scent_01. If N, then no awareness of scent_01. This seems fairly non-controversial until you realize how contrived this is. We're rarely in a position to make such definite attributions in experience without sinking a lot of cognitive resources on a given task. Our awareness typically lays at the surface of life without such definite moments of awareness.

Strong experience is just as likely to disorient us and impede our awareness than make us more aware. Take getting hit in the back of the head with a softball as an example. The moment of collision is highly distinct; it grabs your full attention. However, it isn't immediately information laden. Rather than immediately knowing what just happened and where the ball came from, you are likely to be dazed be the intensity of it all.

&gt; Basically, I meant that abstracting the image processing part of the brain shouldn't affect whether the system can be considered conscious in the end.

I have totally opposite intuitions. I do think there is a limit in useful comparison for all abstraction processes. I don't think my model car can do what my actual car does; why should I think model seeing is like actual seeing?

&gt; True, but we've already modeled interaction with the environment, through excretion and absorption of resources, when simulating a single cell. Moving this up to more cells just involves communication between the cells, which is no different from the interaction with the environment that a single cell does.

If you take a perfect model of a cell and scale it up 1 billion times, then I think you are going to run into some serious computational limits. We are talking about highly abstract processes that we lack the current capacity to even attempt with current technology. We shouldn't forget that.

&gt; But that isn't work in the physics sense. We were talking about work in the physics sense, right?

Education must increase our capacity to do work under any meaningful model of economics. If higher education didn't increase the actual productivity of workers, then it would be a terrible investment. However, it's clear that education is a great investment, in light of the enormous amounts of money tied into the system. It isn't immediate and proportional potential work storage, but it increases capacity for work within society as a system.

&gt; But doing yoga doesn't decrease entropy. So I'm not sure how this squares with your provided definition.

Why not? You are stretching and lifting muscles. It isn't easily harnessed work, but you're manipulating your body to fit specified forms. Some forms, like lifting you legs in a hand stand, create situations where you have to perform work in the form of burning calories to use muscles. This creates a potential that could do work later, (pulling a pulley with you toes on the way down or something).

&gt; But the weather program is aware of it's body. In order to write to the screen, calls need to be made using the drivers for the monitor, and to do any of the processing calls need to be made to the processor. These things are generally handled by the OS...

This doesn't seem like awareness to me. It seems like you are troubleshooting the operation of an external object without needing to appeal to the weather system's selfhood, autonomy, will, etc.

&gt; it knows about the hardware the computer is running on and how to use it, which seems very analogous to proprioception to me.

This likewise seems highly dubious under any reasonable definition of knowledge. I certainly don't think my thermostat knows itself despite the fact it works perfectly fine.

&gt; A thing is either possible or it's impossible. It's only impossible if it causes a contradiction. Therefore, anything that is concievable without a contradiction is possible. This is why I'd consider concievablility to be evidence for potential, because the only evidence for the other side is contradiction, which would render it inconcievable.

What about conceivable impossible things? Do you think everything we conceive is possible and everything we can't conceive is impossible?

&gt; It's that they're conceivable, and we have interest in creating them, and, barring some cataclysmic event, we'll continue moving towards that goal.

Why do we have an interest in making thinking machines when all people need are effective machines? You don't need to be conscious to produce a reliable state of affairs. As long as we are doing the thinking, I don't see why we'd need more than reliability.

&gt; Noting the implications of an argument [shouldn't] affect the soundness, if all the premises are true and it has a logically valid form.

Autocorrect screwed me here. I bracketed the necessary word from my previous reply above. I'm saying talk of the implications should only come after the arguments has been carried through. Gaming the systematic implications because you don't like where the implications might lead is bad for discussions. It makes the process partisan. Whether we are physicalists or non-physicalists shouldn't affect our reading of the argument.

&gt; There's a lot we (not just us, but humanity) don't know, and so it's nigh impossible to get a definite answer either way.

This seems rather disingenuous. You have a pretty good opinion about how this must inevitably turn out.

&gt; That all makes sense, but isn't there still a determining part? In that case, maybe not a tangible determining part, but you distinctly said ""determines"" so, something's doing the determining, right? I'm having trouble grasping this.

That something would be a sum state of affairs: a world. This isn't part of anything else and everything that is is a part of the actual world. This is an atypical object for a causal relationship because it basically glosses as 'Everything causes everything, which is different than 'Fire causes smoke.'

KDJones @ 2017-03-01 15:29:03 :

&gt; Actually, I think it's fairly high... Essentially, the neural net isn't saying ""This is Mandarin, and not English"" it's saying ""I think this is Mandarin, and I think this is English, but I think it's Mandarin more."" It doesn't rule out the other possibilities, it just rates them lower.

That is certainly how we interpret the outputs of the neural net, but I wouldn't attribute the results as a sign of the machine's confidence. The machine, presumably, compares similarities between a string of characters and two word banks: Language A and Language B. The 'percentages' aren't probabilities in the proper sense, (the exhaustive options add up to more than 100%). Moreover, displaying information isn't enough to ground conscious states. My thermometer shows me temperature, but it doesn't actively claim, ""This is 73; I'd bet the farm on it"".

&gt; Here is the crux of the refutation. They don't produce the same patterns. The waterfall produces chaotic patterns, and Sigma produces reliable chess-playing patterns.

Isn't this just a matter of interpretation? Sigma is a chess program presumably because it is actively used to play actual games of chess, (ei it's practically adequate), or because it was intended for chess playing, (ei it's meant to be practically adequate). Waterfall seems chaotic because we don't currently know of a semantics that will allow us to interpret water falling as a game of chess. This doesn't preclude the possibility of such an interpretation being discovered or invented, though. 

Waterfall isn't contrived like Sigma, so it fails the second condition above; this also explains why it fails to be efficient and compact with regards to chess, (ei Waterfall seems noisy compared to Sigma). However, I don't think this stops Waterfall from performing at an adequate level, if only by accident.

&gt; Sigma is able to be interpreted as chess-playing apart from the Waterfall, but the Waterfall is not able to be interpreted as chess-playing apart from Sigma. Whatever chess-playing properties the Waterfall can be said to have are granted by Sigma, which has chess-playing properties itself.

This seems like saying my decoder ring carries everything I need for decoding messages, so we can throw away all those secret communications. Sure, if we really wanted to play chess, we could do away with the waterfall, (and Sigma while we're at it). Games of chesd are completely encoded within the minds of knowledgeable players and positions on a board, so we don't need anything else if the goal is just to play chess. The point is whether the Waterfall can reasonably be interpreted as playing chess. I agree that base intuitions are hostile to this idea; I'm also highly skeptical. However, the information is there if we looked for it.

I don't see any principled distinction between Waterfall and Sigma from the standpoint of a total ignorant; both would seem like chaotic patterns without the cultural framing around chess and the cue to look for chess-like activity.

&gt; The problem lies in the fact that bare waterfall states cannot be interpreted as chess states, so a translation function is required. Whatever translation function you use will, inevitably, be where chess-playing comes from, and can be interpreted as chess-playing apart from the waterfall.

I'd say (almost) everything we do requires a translation. Even translating itself, (something like Sigma), are themselves subject to further interpretation. I don't think there are any bare translation processes to break this chain.

&gt; I mean, I would quickly disagree that there isn't natural music. I feel like numerous people refer to such things all the time. Perhaps it's different from our music in that no one designed it or something?

Regional differences, maybe. I've never heard someone talk like this apart from highly poetic circumstances.

&gt; If you were trying to create music that wasn't just random pleasing sounds, what I'd call composing, you'd need a system that assigns waterfall states to sounds that would itself be capable of composing music. Just like the Sigmas above. 

All sounds are capable of composing music; robots aren't subject to different, impoverished forms of noise. What they lack is a will to make music: the playfulness that comes from seeing musical capacities in noise. Play might be another way to gloss this creativity thing. Robots can closely mimic animal behavior, say lambs frolicking in a meadow, but it wouldn't count as play. The behavior wouldn't come from a place of joy.

&gt; But, in reality, it seems Quine's argument holds.

I just wanted to throw the idea of external definitions out there. Much of the work responding to Quine appeals to external meaning.

&gt; yes, the signals are external, because they're coming from someone else, so they'd have to be, regardless of our mechanism for communication. I don't know what you mean with ""metaphysical assumption about external import.""

Basically, you are making generalized assumptions about someone else's experience by classifying their experience into types. These types have wholly external definitions, but they imply things about internal states. The problem is the individual experiences are particular in nature. There are mismatches between typical expected responses and actual individual experiences. Many types are pseudo-scientific folk-objects that don't track the subtleties of experience itself.

&gt;  If intentionality isn't as fundamental as you seem to think it is, then wouldn't this be solved?

Certainly! Just as creating a real-life Maxwell's Demon would solve a bunch of problems.

&gt; But I don't see how that connects to the Hard Problem. As I said, I thought the Hard Problem was more like the problem of other minds. Where does the fact that intentionality is a thing attach to that?

If you could explain all of the intentional facts about someone else with high fidelity and perfect accuracy, then you could explain all the things someone was thinking. You would have taken all the apparently subjective facts and turned them into something objective. Everything about the persons mind would be laid bare all in front of us like a geometric proof.

&gt;  I could draw analogies like ""Air is to me like a bicycle is to a fish"", which is obviously false, I need air more than a fish needs a bicycle, so it's not true. Therefore, a fish and a bicycle is not a model for my interactions with air, despite the fact that you could draw analogies between them.

I'm not sure it is false. It's a confusing analogy, but some things are confusing in themselves. Moreover, a lot of meaning is contextual. I'm sure this analogy could serve a purpose in some surrealist short story or a work of fiction about a fish that loves to bike. I agree it seems weak on its face, but that doesn't imply the analogy is unworkable.

&gt; With non-representational art, I think most, if not all, analogies drawn are subjective, and so it's hard to say that they're 'true' in any sense of the word.

Hold the phone! What's an objective analogy? Isn't every similarity claim made from a frame of reference?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-07 03:01:41 :

&gt; It always seemed like these thought experiments depended on the possibility of a human observer at least.

I don't think this is the case, it's simply that the thought experiment is presented from the point of view of a human observer, because you are a human, and if you couldn't observe it, why would you care? The thought experiment could carry out regardless of whether anyone cared what was going on, but we do care. My point is, the way the information is presented to you isn't intrinsic to the actual goings on, it's just a way to present the information to you. For example, none of what the creature does depends on the fact that I display it's position to you as a red dot on a map.

&gt; Part of having a perspective implies a capacity for learning and processing 'in house'.

So, in order to tangle with this, I'm gonna have to introduce the idea of ""Objects"" in programming terms (for ease, everything in quotes has a technical meaning). In programming, some languages are ""Object Oriented"" which means that code is separated into packages called objects, each of these has their own ""state"" and ""methods"", and you can ""instantiate"" multiple ""instances"" of each object. Each instance has the same methods, but different state. Generally, good coding means as little as possible of the state of an object is directly accessable by anything but that object. In this thought experiment, this is the case. None of the state of the object is edited by anything but the object itself, and the only things known about it are the things it ""exposes"", which would be analogous to things like the information you output by having photons bounce off of you, or by creating chemicals in the form of smells. The point is, these animals are not ""defined entirely in relation to other parts of the program"" they have their own state which is divorced from every other object in the program. You could have multiple of these programs running, and pause them, switch the bits defining an instance in one program with the bits defining an instance in the other, and resume, and it'd work just fine. Likewise, these objects have all necessary methods contained within them, so they do have all this ""in house"".

&gt; this is a program designed to represent the typical interactions in a rich ecosystem with a high degree of fidelity.

You keep saying this, but this isn't the case. The program wasn't designed to simulate an ecosystem, the ecosystem was an emergent property from the rules we put in which were just a neural net strung between inputs and ouputs.

But: 

&gt; Being a simulation of something requires totally orthogonal conditions relative to being the real deal.

I'll grant you this. It makes sense.

&gt; This seems fairly non-controversial until you realize how contrived this is. We're rarely in a position to make such definite attributions in experience without sinking a lot of cognitive resources on a given task.

The creatures aren't either. There's layers and layers of neural net between the inputs and the outputs, so if they had a mechanism to state which scent they smell it wouldn't necessarily be a 1 to 1 correlation. Moreover, we do have this yes/no awareness: the scent receptors in our nose are either interacting with the chemical that produces that scent or they aren't. This input then goes through the mess of our brains, which is why you probably can't say ""yeah, that smell is definitely 6 parts hydrochloric acid mixed with 2 parts glucose, and 1 part cyanide"". The creatures have the same problem, from reading the input to outputting, or even any step inbetween (where thought would be if present) has gone through layers of processing, confounding the input and bringing this uncertainty in.

&gt; Rather than immediately knowing what just happened and where the ball came from, you are likely to be dazed be the intensity of it all.

Things like this are rarely just because of intensity. A strong sugar smell won't disorient you, but things that damage your body might. To your example, you get dazed because your brain is bouncing off the sides of your skull, which is very bad for it. If you got your arm cut off, it'd be because before your brain wants to start processing stuff, it needs to send all sorts of stuff to fix the immediate problem before it can worry about other things. If it's the smell of a strong acid, it's because the gas of that acid can actually damage various parts of your body.

&gt; why should I think model seeing is like actual seeing?

Because we have things like Convolutional Neural Nets which can easily do image recognition to 95% accuracy, and you don't consider those conscious, so why should we waste computation power on it, when we have the means to abstract it all away and get the same answer anyway?

&gt; If you take a perfect model of a cell and scale it up 1 billion times, then I think you are going to run into some serious computational limits.

Yes but only so far as you need a billion computers. This may be expensive, but it isn't impossible, it's not a P vs NP thing. Furthermore, since the 50s, we've increased computer power from 200,000 flops (floating operations per second) to 30 quadrillion flops (those are both marks for supercomputers) [source](http://pages.experts-exchange.com/processing-power-compared/), if that trend continues, the difference between simulating a cell and an entire animal would be easily within a single human lifetime.

&gt; Education must increase our capacity to do work under any meaningful model of economics.

Yes, but not in an energy sense. Education increases our ability to use energy to meet productive ends, but it's still the same amount of energy, and the same amount of work in a physics sense. We see creating a perfect steel girder as more productive than a mishapen one, but it's the same to the entropy of the universe. 

&gt; Why not? You are stretching and lifting muscles.

The simple answer? Because you're hotter after you finish yoga than when you started. You've used a high form of energy (chemical) and turned it into the lowest form (heat). Local entropy has increased.

&gt; This creates a potential that could do work later, (pulling a pulley with you toes on the way down or something).

Yes, but not as much if you had just used those calories to pull the pulley in the first place. Thus, this is an increase in entropy.

&gt; It seems like you are troubleshooting the operation of an external object without needing to appeal to the weather system's selfhood, autonomy, will, etc.

I'm not sure if troubleshooting is the right word, because I'm not doing that if you mean what I would mean. As such, I'm not quite sure what you mean here, or why this disqualifies it from awareness. It's a source of input just like any other awareness. How is the input you get from proprioception different from this sort of input? At this point, I'm not trying to appeal to selfhood, or whatever, because I don't think you need to appeal to selfhood to explain proprioception. You just said that proprioception is something computers lack, and I tried to provide an analogous thing.

&gt; This likewise seems highly dubious under any reasonable definition of knowledge.

I suppose you could say ""know"" was inappropriate personification. But I don't really think so. I think the data needed to access these things is stored somewhere, so if you think knowledge can be in books, then the computer has knowledge. Regardless, I don't think this disqualifies it from being analagous to proprioception, either way.

&gt; What about conceivable impossible things?

Can you give me an example of something? I mean, I can't concieve of a married bachelor. I can string the words together, but I can't concieve of it.

Though, just to nip it in the bud, I probably should change the quailfication to ""concievably existing in our universe"".

&gt; Why do we have an interest in making thinking machines when all people need are effective machines?

Two things here. Are you denying that we have an interest in making thinking machines?

Two, reasons include, but are not limited to: Research. We do a lot of things just to show we can. Competition. Like the moon landings, just to stick it to the Russians really. We got some useful stuff, but we wouldn't've done it without the space race. Actual utility. What could be more effective than a General AI? It can not only do any job you want it to, but it can do it better than any person. Why hire a lawyer to think of the best argument when you can have a lawyer bot that makes no mistakes, and works faster and builds better cases than any lawyer ever. For the cost of just the electricity to run it, no less.

&gt; Gaming the systematic implications because you don't like where the implications might lead is bad for discussions.

Except this is exactly what a proof by contradiction does. You're right that ""if all the premises are true and it has a logically valid form."" But if we knew for sure that all your premises were true, and your argument was logically valid, then you'd just be right. But if we aren't absolutely certain your premises are true, attacking the conclusion through an argument by contradiction is just as valid as attacking the premises.

&gt; This seems rather disingenuous. You have a pretty good opinion about how this must inevitably turn out.

My opinion amounts to ""Conscious AI's will exist barring some species annihilating event."" What I've presented is our current avenues towards that goal, because they're all I have. They needn't be the way we actually get there, but if I knew what that would be, I'd be out winning some prize.

&gt; This is an atypical object for a causal relationship because it basically glosses as 'Everything causes everything, which is different than 'Fire causes smoke.'

Fair enough.

awenonian @ 2017-03-07 03:01:54 :

&gt; That is certainly how we interpret the outputs of the neural net, but I wouldn't attribute the results as a sign of the machine's confidence.

I think you misunderstand. These numbers are called the ""confidence rating"" of each output. Regardless of whether it is actual confidence, this is what they are called.

&gt; The 'percentages' aren't probabilities in the proper sense, (the exhaustive options add up to more than 100%).

Nor should they be. In the root example, you said that it was a grain of sand. If such judgements had to be proper probabilities, then your judgement that it was in fact a grain of sand would leave 0 percentage points left to assign to other objects. But your whole point was that noting it as a grain of sand isn't an immediate judgement that it's not other things.

&gt; The machine, presumably, compares similarities between a string of characters and two word banks: Language A and Language B.

Not really. It takes the input and pushes it through some non-polynomial function, which outputs as a number from 0 to 1 on every output node. These are the confidence ratings for each output node.

Your questions was ""What do you think the current capacity for doing this is in our best AI efforts?"" Where ""this"" refers to, quoting myself ""not making connections that are not currently necessary to make."" I think I've demonstrated this is what happens. You proposed the criteria, and I think I've met them. 

&gt; Moreover, displaying information isn't enough to ground conscious states.

Yes and no. Yes, just displaying information doesn't ground conscious states, but that's not all that's happening here. After all, the only thing anyone knows about you is the information you display. So, some information display does ground consciousness enough that we can call other people conscious. Conscious things are conscious because of the kind of information they display, so minimizing this to ""just displaying information"" loses some of the important criteria.

&gt; Isn't this just a matter of interpretation?

I really don't think so. Sigma can take a chess state, and output a valid chess move. In order to make use of the waterfall, we'd need to take a chess state, translate it to a waterfall state, then take the resulting waterfall state, and translate it to a chess move. Both functions require some translation (generally into bits). But Sigma takes the translation into account. The waterfall does not (i.e. it works the same regardless of how you translate it, whereas the developer of Sigma used the input specification to design Sigma). Whatever decisions you make on how to translate these states introduce concepts not already present. How do you guarantee whatever the waterfall outputs is a valid move? Even if you guarantee that whatever state can be interpreted as a move, if it says ""Pawn to A3"" but there's no pawn that can move to A3, what do we do? If you have it pick from a set of valid moves for the current state, first you've already introduced something, but second how do you order them? All of this information is internal to Sigma, but would necessarily be external to the waterfall.

&gt; This seems like saying my decoder ring carries everything I need for decoding messages, so we can throw away all those secret communications

I don't think it is. That would be like saying we can throw away the chess board. The waterfall isn't taking the position of the secret messages, it's taking a position like ""Alright, during this chess game, before your move you have to look at the waterfall"".

Not to mention, if your goal is to make something that can decode messages, the actual presence of messages needing decoding is irrelevant.

&gt; The point is whether the Waterfall can reasonably be interpreted as playing chess.

And it can't, because whether you used the Waterfall + Sigma, or just Sigma, you'd end up with the same chess game. Therefore, the Waterfall is completely superfluous to playing chess.

&gt; I don't see any principled distinction between Waterfall and Sigma from the standpoint of a total ignorant;

While I'm uninformed on the procedure, I think we could look for a distinction the same way SETI looks for a distinction between intelligent signals and random background radiation.

&gt; I'd say (almost) everything we do requires a translation.

But, as I said above, Sigma takes into account the translation. It was built with the translation in mind. The waterfall was not.

&gt; What they lack is a will to make music: the playfulness that comes from seeing musical capacities in noise.

So, they're not conscious, because they can't compose. And they can't compose because they don't have the will to. And they don't have the will to because they aren't conscious?

&gt; Much of the work responding to Quine appeals to external meaning.

I'm not sure I really get external meaning. On one hand, a rock should be a rock regardless of whether there's someone to say it is. Is that external meaning? But on the other, based on Quine's argument, there's really no way for me to refer to that external meaning in any way you will definitely understand. Something like ""our understanding of external meanings are necessarily internal"" I guess.

&gt; There are mismatches between typical expected responses and actual individual experiences.

Wouldn't these mismatches align with the times people are misunderstood? So, this doesn't represent a challenge to the idea that this is how we understand others.

&gt; If you could explain all of the intentional facts about someone else with high fidelity and perfect accuracy, then you could explain all the things someone was thinking.

So, we can kind of do this. Not to this level of fidelity, but it's clear the potential is there. I couldn't find a great place to cut this video, so I'd recommend watching the whole thing, but I've linked to the actual demo [here](https://youtu.be/NYotfLMrm-4?t=3m6s). Obviously this has some issues with it, in that it had to be trained before, but it's important to note it wasn't trained on her, just one someone before. I also think it's important to note that the computer, at this point, is picking from two options, which makes it's job easier, but not easier in any way that presents an obvious barrier to expansion.

&gt; I'm sure this analogy could serve a purpose in some surrealist short story or a work of fiction about a fish that loves to bike.

Yeah, but aren't surrealist or fiction anything not true by definition? They don't reflect reality, so, even if the analogy would work in that sort of situation, it's still false.

&gt; Hold the phone! What's an objective analogy? Isn't every similarity claim made from a frame of reference?

Let's say we have a scale model of a house that is 1/8 the size of a real one in every dimension. The analogy ""scale house is to house as 1/8 is to 1"" is true, and objective. Every frame of reference would make this judgement.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-03-12 21:40:04 :

&gt;  it's simply that the thought experiment is presented from the point of view of a human observer... 

This is basically what I was saying. Everything else seems irrelevant if we agree on this.

&gt; My point is, the way the information is presented to you isn't intrinsic to the actual goings on, it's just a way to present the information to you. For example, none of what the creature does depends on the fact that I display it's position to you as a red dot on a map.

OK, I'm really confused by this metaphor. I can't tell whether it is meant to be read from our perspective or the perspective of the red dot or whether we are considering the dot itself or what we would see if we had the information available to the dot.

&gt; The creatures aren't either. There's layers and layers of neural net 
between the inputs and the outputs, so if they had a mechanism to state which scent they smell it wouldn't necessarily be a 1 to 1 correlation. Moreover, we do have this yes/no awareness: the scent receptors in our nose are either interacting with the chemical that produces that scent or they aren't. This input then goes through the mess of our brains, which is why you probably can't say ""yeah, that smell is definitely 6 parts hydrochloric acid mixed with 2 parts glucose, and 1 part cyanide"". The creatures have the same problem, from reading the input to outputting, or even any step 
inbetween (where thought would be if present) has gone through layers of processing, confounding the input and bringing this uncertainty in.

I'm not talking about a problem with thought being under-specific. In my example, I never asserted that we ever come to the kind of exact answer, like the form of a chemical equation, just by reflecting on experience. A level of ambiguity or vagueness seems like a reasonable part of our assumptions about experience.

The problem here is with experiences that are both indistinct and obvious. Extreme experiences are undeniably present, unlike the vaint odor of a trace chemical. I can grant your provisional explanation of ambiguity in our periferral experience, but we can't account for the ambiguity of intense experiences the same way we'd account for weak experiences: the faint experience of trace happenings.

In your terms, a distinct input is producing a distinct output in the case of intense experiences; A particular sawblade is impacting a particular thumb leading to a particular pain. The problem is that the experience produced is ambiguous; the experience is attributable to many kinds of events to the best of our knowledge at this stage. Part of process of unpacking the experience surely involves our equivalent of examining the deeper layers in our thought process. However, this doesn't explain how a 
vivid experience could fall out of thin air, so to speak.

&gt; Things like this are rarely just because of intensity. A strong sugar 
smell won't disorient you...

Sure! Something intensely sweet, like entirely too sweet, will disorient you. If you were drinking a black coffee and I switched it with something just short of syrup, you would be incredibly disoriented. I think there is more to this than just the deception. Wouldn't it take you more than a moment to realize what's happening to your body?

&gt; things that damage your body might. To your example, you get dazed because your brain is bouncing off the sides of your skull, which is very bad for it. If you got your arm cut off, it'd be because before your brain wants to start processing stuff, it needs to send all sorts of stuff to fix the immediate problem before it can worry about other things...

I don't see why I can't appeal to experiences of pain to make my point. It seems like an entirely arbitrary restriction, but I'll roll with it. I can make the same point using a different kind of experience.

&gt;&gt; I don't think my model car can do what my actual car does; why should I think model seeing is like actual seeing?

&gt; Because we have things like Convolutional Neural Nets which can easily do image recognition to 95% accuracy, and you don't consider those conscious, so why should we waste computation power on it, when we have the means to abstract it all away and get the same answer anyway?

I don't get what you're trying to say here. I'm mostly thrown because you answered my question with a question; I don't know how exactly to frame this as a response to what I said. Are you saying that those Neural Nets are conscious and that I'm mistaken in assuming they aren't?

&gt; Yes but only so far as you need a billion computers...

There are two billion computer around today. Shouldn't the internet be considered a super-human entity living accross all our lives if you are right here? That seems like woo to me.

&gt; Yes, but not in an energy sense. Education increases our ability to use energy to meet productive ends, but it's still the same amount of energy, and the same amount of work in a physics sense. We see creating a perfect steel girder as more productive than a mishapen one, but it's the same to the entropy of the universe.

Duh! Nothing decreases universal entropy. That is necessarily increasing always. The fact that it increases our local capacity for work is quite enough. I never claimed that we were little gods.

&gt; Yes, but not as much if you had just used those calories to pull the 
pulley in the first place. Thus, this is an increase in entropy.

Again, this is fine. I never claimed that we transcend the laws of physics. Human beings clearly need to take part in a metabolic process to carry out all this thinking and excerise. The important thing is that these activities reliably increase our capacities for work in the long term. Tracing out the individual sub-systems along the way will lead to many perigrinations, but the activity will increase the capacity for work relative to unlearned states.

&gt;  It's a source of input just like any other awareness. How is the input you get from proprioception different from this sort of input? At this point, I'm not trying to appeal to selfhood, or whatever, because I don't think you need to appeal to selfhood to explain proprioception.

On the whole, proprioception encodes balance, movement, and relative position of body parts. I think this implies that it is at least somewhat systematic in nature. It is how we are able to conceive of ourselves moving through space as a cohesive body relative to other bodies.

The weather machine clearly doesn't need to move or interact with the features in its concept space. To the best of my knowledge, weather systems are passively gathering information without reshaping their perspectives. As such, the weather machine may not require an analog to our proprioception.

I guess the equivalent might be being able to conceive of itself relative to the weather and to other networks. The space that the weather mahcine inhabits is a probability space mapped onto a location and a smart weather system would change its behavior, (ei. the model produced), in order to complement incoming information and the coverage of other weather systems. I'm not sure though.

&gt; You just said that proprioception is something computers lack, and I tried to provide an analogous thing... I suppose you could say ""know"" was inappropriate personification. But I don't really think so.

Personfication is not convincing here. I think you are trying to force the analogy by personifying the object in question. However, the thing in question has an entirely different living history than the history of people as we know them. This doesn't imply that Artificial people are impossible, but it does make the personification dubious unless you can back it up with some other evidence. 
 
&gt; I think the data needed to access these things is stored somewhere, so if you think knowledge can be in books, then the computer has knowledge. Regardless, I don't think this disqualifies it from being analagous to proprioception, either way.

Books clearly don't know what they are about the same way that authors know themselves. If you think that weather systems know themselves the same way that books know themselves, then I feel confident dismissing the analogy between weather systems and people out of hand.

&gt; Can you give me an example of something? I mean, I can't concieve of a married bachelor. I can string the words together, but I can't concieve of it.
Though, just to nip it in the bud, I probably should change the quailfication to ""concievably existing in our universe"".

Sure; perpetual motion is conceivable on a macroscopic scale but incoherent when analyzed with the rules of physics. We can imagine such a thing at a broad scale but not a detailed scale. Likewise, P-zombies are conceivable but impossible by the rules that govern mental-physical causation in our world.

Adding the by-line just pushes the issue into an epistemic problem about our knowledge of external affairs.

&gt; Are you denying that we have an interest in making thinking machines?

We have an interest in producing machines capable of complicated information processing. Whether that processing will be like the processing we do is unlikely in my opinion. Human thought doesn't bare the hallmarks of efficient design for a given task, unlike the articficial things we have access to.

KDJones @ 2017-03-12 21:40:10 :


&gt; It can not only do any job you want it to, but it can do it better than any person. Why hire a lawyer to think of the best argument when you can have a lawyer bot that makes no mistakes, and works faster and builds better cases than any lawyer ever. For the cost of just the electricity to run it, no less.

1. It isn't clear that truly general intelligence is required to perform the tasks you listed. Functional adequacy over a limited number of cases should do fine.

2. There are no selective pressures for optimal or ideal conditions. Things are selected for on the basis of being better than competing members of the population. The fact that something would be heavenly almost always implies it's out of this world.

&gt; Except this is exactly what a proof by contradiction does.

Are you doing this here?

&gt; You're right that ""if all the premises are true and it has a logically valid form."" But if we knew for sure that all your premises were true, and your argument was logically valid, then you'd just be right. But if we aren't absolutely certain your premises are true, attacking the conclusion through an argument by contradiction is just as valid as attacking the premises.

This isn't a question of being 100% about every premise. A reasonable conclusion can be reached by asking if it is more reasonable to accept a proposition than to reject the proposition, (ei accepting the converse), or suspending judgement. If each premise satisfies this criterion and you reject the conclusion, then you are deciding against the best current information all things considered.

&gt;  My opinion amounts to ""Conscious AI's will exist barring some species annihilating event."" What I've presented is our current avenues towards that goal, because they're all I have. They needn't be the way we actually get there, but if I knew what that would be, I'd be out winning some prize.

You are assuming that advancements in AI are necessarily advancements towards general AI. That isn't the case; there are lots of intermediate proficiencies that seem more important to contemporary research than the Grand project. Succeding in these intermediate tasks isn't necessarily going to take us closer to realizing general AI.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-03-14 16:09:11 :

&gt;&gt; That is certainly how we interpret the outputs of the neural net, but I wouldn't attribute the results as a sign of the machine's confidence.

&gt; I think you misunderstand. These numbers are called the ""confidence rating"" of each output. Regardless of whether it is actual confidence, this is what they are called.

I was more worried about sections like this: ""Essentially, the neural net isn't saying ""This is Mandarin, and not English"" it's saying ""I think this is Mandarin, and I think this is English, but I think it's Mandarin more."""" You're doing some hard-core personification here.
It isn't at all clear to me that this is essentially what the machine is doing. If it were, designing thinking machines wouldn't be so hard.

&gt; Nor should they be. In the root example, you said that it was a grain of sand. If such judgements had to be proper probabilities, then your judgement that it was in fact a grain of sand would leave 0 percentage points left to assign to other objects. But your whole point was that noting it as a grain of sand isn't an immediate judgement that it's not other things.

Not to be pedantic, but I think the bigger question was how good machines currently are at handling vague concepts. The speech 'recognition' program gives you two numbers based on an obscure protocol, as far as I understand it. The task of making the kind of decision I quoted above is all on our end. The computer doesn't think those things, but we do when interpretting the machine's outputs.

If the machine spit out probabilities, we could at least interpret them as having a certain content that maps on to predictions about the objective state of affairs, (or expected state of affairs at least). We wouldn't need to unpack as much in that case, because the correct interpretations are, in part, objectively defined.

&gt; Your questions was ""What do you think the current capacity for doing this is in our best AI efforts?"" Where ""this"" refers to, quoting myself ""not making connections that are not currently necessary to make."" I think I've demonstrated this is what happens. You proposed the criteria, and I think I've met them.

Maybe you should re-explain the significance of all of this. I don't see what about this case provides an example of machines not making necessary connections. I feel like other examples of AI, such as Baxter, are much more effective at demonstrating a capacity for creavity if that was your goal.

&gt; Yes and no. Yes, just displaying information doesn't ground conscious states, but that's not all that's happening here. After all, the only thing anyone knows about you is the information you display. So, some information display does ground consciousness enough that we can call other people conscious. Conscious things are conscious because of the kind of information they display, so minimizing this to ""just displaying information"" loses some of the important criteria.

I don't think conscious things are conscious in virtue of the behavior they display; I think things are conscious insofar as I think they maintain a sufficiently rich inner life. The only evidence I have for the existence of other minds falls short of demonstrative proof about the intentional facts, but that doesn't imply my belief is about the evidence rather than what the thought is directed towards. When I check my oil, I check the dipstick. Seeing a dry dipstick makes me think, ""My oil is low"". The contents of my thought aren't, ""This dipstick looks funny"".

The point is that displaying information is merely evidence for thinking things. Displaying information about the contents of our thoughts isn't what thinking is. If nothing else, conscious experience contains linguistic and non-linguistic activity. Displaying information must constitute a linguistic or language-like activity. Therefore, there is more to consciousness than signaling

&gt; Let's say we have a scale model of a house that is 1/8 the size of a real one in every dimension. The analogy ""scale house is to house as 1/8 is to 1"" is true, and objective. Every frame of reference would make this judgement.

Except the case where the model and the house don't share the same interial frame. If we ran the Twin Paradox expect we slipped the model onto the rocket, the comparative lengths wouldn't satisfy the same ratio, right?

Running some numbers:

H=1
h=.125

h'=.125*[1-(.9)^2]=.0544

1:.125=/=1:.0544

&gt; So, they're not conscious, because they can't compose. And they can't compose because they don't have the will to. And they don't have the will to because they aren't conscious?

I'm not putting forward an argument here; I'm trying to take you at your word. You claim not to know what I am talking about when I say intentional experience or internal will or inner vibrancy. I can't very well present an argument when you don't even know what we are talking about. This passage was written to point out what the topic is in the first place.

&gt; I'm not sure I really get external meaning...

Like I said, I was just letting you in on a trade secret. It isn't terribly important. I just didn't want you to take the impression that Quine is the best in contemporary philosophy. He's been literally dead for almost a decade and his work hit its hayday about forty years before that. Work on externalism pretty old to boot, think 70's and 80's.

&gt; So, we can kind of do this. Not to this level of fidelity, but it's clear the potential is there... [Things] make it's job easier, but not easier in any way that presents an obvious barrier to expansion.

If I gave you a Model T in 1925, you couldn't take me to the Moon. This despite the fact that the basic technology underlying space flight and automobiles is the same, (ei explosive chemistry plus a systematic mechanical application). Saying that you feel confident about space flight in a vehicle just like a Model T but more complicate would be very misleading. The final vehicle ends up being very different in principle, hence the lack of flying cars or cheap space commutes.

&gt; Wouldn't these mismatches align with the times people are misunderstood? So, this doesn't represent a challenge to the idea that this is how we understand others.

Sometimes, sure. Sometimes, we misunderstand ourselves. Haven't you ever been confused about what you are feeling? If someone were to ask you, ""How are you feeling?"", you could answer that you not sure. More commonly though, you'll likely ape at an attempt to put your confusing feelings into something more sensible by using the impoverished language at hand.

&gt; Yeah, but aren't surrealist or fiction anything not true by definition? They don't reflect reality, so, even if the analogy would work in that sort of situation, it's still false.

That's an awefully STEM interpretation of truth. Many people would say that there is truth in great literature. I certainly didn't read Hamlet and think, ""But, this story doesn't have anything to do with real life since it's made-up. Guess I can forget about all that noise.""

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-03-14 16:10:03 :


OK, I am going to tackle all of the Waterfall stuff at once. If I skip anything important, just let me know.

&gt; Both functions require some translation (generally into bits). But Sigma takes the translation into account. The waterfall does not (i.e. it works the same regardless of how you translate it, whereas the developer of Sigma used the input specification to design Sigma).

This seems like a problem about whether or not the process is currently being disambiguated, rather than a claim about the intrinsic properties of the functions at hand. The Waterfall clearly can't signify in just the way the Sigma signifies. After all, outside the thought experiment, we don't take natural objects to signify complex contents like games of chess in the first place. In contrast, we don't have problems actual chess software that way.

My explanation for this fact would evoke anthropocentrism: the chess program bares the mark of human intentionality. I can make this move because I think there is something special about humans that makes them deeply tangled up in intentional facts. You don't think there is anything special about humans, so you have to appeal to something else to explain why there is signification in some things but not others.

You're options explaining signification as a particular possibility, (e.i. as something that occurs at some events but not others), are to appeal to an a priori definition for signification or to appeal to a posteriori judgements of success or effectiveness. 

A priori definitions can't be given here because of reasons related to the incompleteness theorem. Exhaustive signification is basically a complete list of all the signs can possibly apply^1 such that correct use is effectively demarked from incorrect use^2, no listed use is false^3, and the possible uses of the signs is sufficiently rich^4. These are the 4 Godel Conditions, so an a priori exhaustive defintion for signification is impossible.

The Waterfall is an attack on the possibility of a posteriori accounts that don't collapse back into anthropocentrism. If we cast a narrow defintion of success, such as success as far as we're personally concerned or success to the extent it is effective against most people, then it seems as if we've drawn people back into the center of the discussion. In contrast, if we cast a wide defintion of success, such as the capacity to perform a complex task given sufficient interpretive parameters, then we might end up including too much, including things like waterfalls.

&gt; I really don't think [Sigma and Waterfall are the same]. Sigma can take a chess state, and output a valid chess move. In order to make use of the waterfall, we'd need to take a chess state, translate it to a waterfall state, then take the resulting waterfall state, and translate it to a chess move.

Sigma can take in information in the prescribed form and dictate responses in that prescribed form. We are the ones ascribing the status of chess moves to these inputs and outputs. As you go on to say, this isn't a great leap in reality because we designed artificial chess programs along the same lines, (receive information about a board state, output information that functionally corresponds to a proceding legal board state). The information in itself isn't a game of chess though. If it were, then the Waterfall would also be a game of chess. I agree that the Waterfall needs substantial interpretation, but so does everything.

&gt; All of this information is internal to Sigma, but would necessarily be external to the waterfall.

I don't see why it is necessarily external to the waterfall. Could you explain this again?

&gt;&gt; This seems like saying my decoder ring carries everything I need for decoding messages, so we can throw away all those secret communications

&gt;I don't think it is. That would be like saying we can throw away the chess board. The waterfall isn't taking the position of the secret messages, it's taking a position like ""Alright, during this chess game, before your move you have to look at the waterfall"".
Not to mention, if your goal is to make something that can decode messages, the actual presence of messages needing decoding is irrelevant.

I don't really get this either.

&gt;While I'm uninformed on the procedure, I think we could look for a distinction the same way SETI...

SETI has no positive results to speak of, so that might be a bad example. It isn't like we can say SETI has successfully scoured the universe and has discerned intelligent from the chaos of void.

&gt; But, as I said above, Sigma takes into account the translation. It was built with the translation in mind. The waterfall was not.

Sigma is a translation procedure, but you have to interpret how to implement that procedure. Even if sigma is doing the chess work in our problem, we are still doing the semantic unpacking. What it means for Sigma to translate is different from the way we translate information from the external world into experience. If Sigma could do self-translation, or render it's outputs to itself in a way that renders them intelligible, then it would be doing something amazing. As it stands, we still need to interpret Sigma to render it intelligible.

awenonian @ 2017-03-20 03:55:04 :

&gt; OK, I'm really confused by this metaphor.

Hmm. Let me propose another one then, maybe it will clear it up. Imagine watching a group of monkeys from a satellite in space. What observations the satellite makes have no effect on what the monkeys do. We are watching from the satellite, but our watching doesn't in any way influence the behavior of the creatures, they act observer (us) independently.

&gt; In your terms, a distinct input is producing a distinct output in the case of intense experiences ... The problem is that the experience produced is ambiguous; the experience is attributable to many kinds of events to the best of our knowledge at this stage.

When input goes through a neural net, it is essentially being put through a mathematical function. The basic idea is (while it's often not polynomial) it would be the equation Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D, where the neural net decides on the values of A, B, C, and D as weighting. This easily explains all of this. We know mathematical functions aren't necessarily 1 to 1: for x^2, f(-1) = f(1). Thus, you can have one experience that is attributable to several inputs. You then go on to say this:

&gt; Part of process of unpacking the experience surely involves our equivalent of examining the deeper layers in our thought process.

Which makes perfect sense too. The final mathematical equation is only what you get if you go through every layer. At each node, the function to arrive there is different, so ""examining the deeper layers"" would allow you to better identify the experience: If the total function, f(x), produced output y, which happens on inputs a, b, and c, but a function for an inner node, g(x) produced output z, which only happens on a and b, and another function for an inner node, h(x), produced w, which only happens on b and c, then we can say that the input must've been b. Ambiguity at higher levels is removed when examining lower levels.

&gt; Wouldn't it take you more than a moment to realize what's happening to your body?

I guess I'll have to take your word for it, because I honestly can't say. This sort of thing (being disoriented by non-damaging things) hasn't happened to me.

&gt; Are you saying that those Neural Nets are conscious and that I'm mistaken in assuming they aren't?

Sorry I have a habit of that question with a question thing. Basically, we could attach an image recognition system and simulate the full process of seeing, but it would take more processing power. If the image recognition system isn't conscious, then replacing it with something that takes the same inputs and produces the same outputs but does it in a much more computationally efficient way shouldn't affect whether the entity is conscious or not.

&gt; Shouldn't the internet be considered a super-human entity living accross all our lives if you are right here?

I don't get your point here. I didn't say that computational power = consciousness. Like, if you had a quadrillion cpu's sitting in a warehouse without doing anything, I wouldn't say ""Oh, that's conscious because it's got a lot of computational power."" This seems like a complete non-sequitor. What *would* follow is saying that if we could fully simulate a cell on one computer, then we should be able to simulate an entire animal over the internet. I don't know where you got ""super-human entity"" from that.

&gt; Duh! Nothing decreases universal entropy ... The fact that it increases our local capacity for work is quite enough.

It doesn't. It's the same to the local entropy as well. There's nothing more energetic about a straight girder than a bent one.

&gt; The important thing is that these activities reliably increase our capacities for work in the long term.

In order to decrease local entropy, you have to take less useful energy, and turn it into more useful energy. This is not what's being done when you work out, because chemical energy is much more useful than heat energy (which as far as I know is as useless as it gets). The fact that you've taken energy that could've done work to pull a pulley, and done something to make it less usable for pulling that pulley is not ""fine"": It's a clear example of increasing entropy. Local *and* universal just to be clear.

&gt; To the best of my knowledge, weather systems are passively gathering information without reshaping their perspectives.

This may be off to the side, but what do you mean by perspective? Because I've always thought of perspective as the information available to you. If a weather system is gathering information, it is necessarily reshaping its perspective, right?

&gt; I guess the equivalent might be being able to conceive of itself relative to the weather and to other networks.

Which it has. If a cold front is coming in from the north, it will detect that on northward sensors, but not on southward ones. It will know they are northward sensors, and it will predict the cold front coming in from the north accordingly.

&gt; If you think that weather systems know themselves the same way that books know themselves

I wasn't trying to say that the weather system is a book. I'm trying to give an example of a passive medium that contains knowledge. The weather system and books are clearly different: books don't rewrite themselves. Among other things, but that's the big one that comes to mind.

&gt; Sure; perpetual motion is conceivable on a macroscopic scale ...

You know what? That's fair enough. I can't argue ont hese fronts. But then the question shifts from whether they're concievable (which we agree they are) to whether they're possible, right? You think we're conscious because ""there's something special about humans"" Why could that specialness not be put into a machine?

&gt; We have an interest in producing machines capable of complicated information processing. Whether that processing will be like the processing we do is unlikely in my opinion.

We have an interest in general AI (I'll address this more next). On the will it be like us, I agree probably not, but I don't know why that would bar it from being conscious. Most animals don't think like us, but I think you said you consider them conscious.

&gt; It isn't clear that truly general intelligence is required to perform the tasks you listed.

Right. But a general intelligence is required if you want your lawyer bot to drive you home, and order you a pizza for dinner. And, most importantly, if you want your bot to be able to work on as-yet-unforseen problems. That's the real reason we have an interest in it.

&gt; The fact that something would be heavenly almost always implies it's out of this world.

What? How? Certainly there's a best thing at a given task. If a series of tasks all require the same properties (e.g. lifting a boulder and pushing a boulder both require strength), then the best at one has a decent chance of being the best at the others. A general AI won't be the best at pushing boulders, but it will be the best at thinking tasks.

&gt; Are you [using proof by contradiction] here?

No, I was just providing an example of a formal idea where attacking the conclusion instead of the premises was valid.

&gt; If each premise satisfies this criterion and you reject the conclusion, then you are deciding against the best current information all things considered.

Yeah, unless the conclusion implies something wacky. If all your premises were to the best knowledge we have, but your conclusion implied 1=0, then my response wouldn't be ""Well, then I guess 1=0"" it would be ""well I guess our best knowledge is wrong"".

&gt; You are assuming that advancements in AI are necessarily advancements towards general AI.

Ok, so, I'd first like to ask what kind of evidence you're looking for. Before you got annoyed at me for not providing evidence, and now you're saying the evidence I'm trying to provide doesn't work. That's fine, but what, save a fully functional general intelligence actually existing, would you take as evidence they could?

Second, I'd like to say that our current efforts in AI do seem to represent advancements towards a general AI. With neural nets, the same basic structure can do tasks as disparate as categorizing words into different languages, and playing Mario. That seems pretty general to me.


--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-20 03:55:19 :

&gt; You're doing some hard-core personification here. It isn't at all clear to me that this is essentially what the machine is doing.

Because I said ""saying""? Or some other reason? Because as far as I can tell, besides the ""saying"", this is what it is doing. I don't see where your disconnect is, could you explain why you don't think this is what it's doing?

&gt; I think the bigger question was how good machines currently are at handling vague concepts. 

Vague concepts? How about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r804UF8Ia4c).

&gt; The computer doesn't think those things, but we do when interpretting the machine's outputs.

If this is your disconnect, then I think what you're missing is that we've encoded these interpretations when training the machine. What we've done is basically said ""This is Mandarin, when you see this, say it's Mandarin"", and ""This is English, when you see this, say it's English"" to this machine for a massive amount of examples. If your hang up is that it doesn't use the words English/Mandarin, then I'll reword the example. We've said ""When you see this, press this button. When you see that, press that button."" It's done that. I don't really know what the difference between the two would be, though.

&gt; I don't see what about this case provides an example of machines not making necessary connections.

I'm guessing you meant ""not making unnecessary connections"" But that would be how I said before: It doesn't give a certain answer, it's not a 1 for Mandarin, and a 0 for English, it's varying amounts.

&gt; I feel like other examples of AI, such as Baxter, are much more effective at demonstrating a capacity for creavity if that was your goal.

2 things on this. 1 Baxter probably does use a neural net on some level. And 2, Baxter must be trained by showing him how to do the task. A neural net has a level of creativity beyond its designer. For example, if we said ""Here's all the relevant data for a number of species, these ones are plants, these ones are animals"" Then we said ""What's this one?"" a neural net could categorize it without us having to know the answer (Perhaps animal/plant is a bad example (it's fairly arbitrary, and we can make those judgements fairly easily our selves), but certainly you could come up with an example that's tough for us to tell at a glance, but we have examples of each variety.)

Now, if you want AI creativity, we have that too: [TED talk](https://youtu.be/aR5N2Jl8k14?t=3m)

&gt; I think things are conscious insofar as I think they maintain a sufficiently rich inner life.

That's fine, but besides through examining behavior, how do you judge the richness of their inner life? In this case, behavior is probably inaccurate. It's why I said displaying information. For example, you might not count the firing of your neurons as part of your behavior, or at least, it's not obvious to someone watching you what's going on. But we can examine your neurons like that in an MRI, so the information is being displayed. You just have to be watching for it.

&gt; The only evidence I have for the existence of other minds falls short of demonstrative proof about the intentional facts, but that doesn't imply my belief is about the evidence rather than what the thought is directed towards.

I didn't really understand this sentence. The following example didn't help, either.

&gt; If nothing else, conscious experience contains linguistic and non-linguistic activity. Displaying information must constitute a linguistic or language-like activity.

This, if you mean what I think you mean, is assuming the Hard Problem is a problem. It sounds like you're saying there is some information that necessarily is unaccessible going on in conscious minds. But that's what we're trying to decide.

My argument for why this isn't true would be that not all display of information is linguistic. I don't know what is linguistic about the firing of my neurons, but, as I said above, it is information being displayed. If that is, in fact, linguistic, then I don't know what non-linguistic things consciousness necessarily entails.

&gt; Except the case where the model and the house don't share the same interial frame.

You know, I considered this, but didn't think it worth addressing. It should be obvious that to show that objective analogies can exist, all I have to do is show a case in which every observer will agree on the comparison. So, trivially, change the scenario to one where the house and model share an inertial frame. And just in case, they have the same orientation, so a relativistic observer will not notice distance distortion along disparate axes.

For an even more uncontroversial example: quantum entangled particles. Two electrons can be entangled so that their spins are necessarily opposing. The analogy ""e1's spin is to e2's spin as 1 is to -1"" is true for any perspective. We don't even have to know the spins of either electron (and in many cases don't) to know this must be the case.

&gt; This passage was written to point out what the topic is in the first place.

So, I reread the passage, but I don't see why you can make that judgement. Why does a lamb frollicking come from a place of joy, but a robot necessarily doesn't? Basically, how do you have such a concrete idea of what joy is to make that judgement?

&gt; This despite the fact that the basic technology underlying space flight and automobiles is the same

What? It's not. That's just not true. I mean, unless you're going as vague as a stick tied to a rock is the same basic technology as a smartphone (stuff stuck together). Or that all technology is the same basic technology because it works off the same laws of physics.

&gt; Saying that you feel confident about space flight in a vehicle just like a Model T but more complicate would be very misleading.

Because it's wrong.

&gt; Haven't you ever been confused about what you are feeling?

I think if I'm being honest, no, I've just felt confused about how to put how I'm feeling into words. That is, I understand, but I couldn't explain it to someone else. I mean, how could I not understand how I'm feeling: I'm feeling it.

&gt; Many people would say that there is truth in great literature.

Are they talking about truth about the world in this case though? Because I'd probably disagree with that. They're probably talking about lessons, so like, moral truth, if such a thing exists. 

&gt; ""But, this story doesn't have anything to do with real life since it's made-up. Guess I can forget about all that noise.""

Sure. But something doesn't need to be true to be worth reading: We're disagreeing, so at least one of us is wrong, but it's worth reading both sides of the discussion. Being worth reading doesn't mean it's true.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-20 03:55:29 :

&gt; A priori definitions can't be given here because of reasons related to the incompleteness theorem.

This is an aside, I'm not arguing against this, but I don't think I understand incompleteness very well. Does this apply to all a priori definitions?

&gt; If we cast a narrow defintion of success,

I've been doing my best to disconnect this from how well it performs. All that's important is *that* it performs. My point has been that in order to get the waterfall to perform at any level, you've necessarily implemented an algorithm (sigma) that will perform at that same level without the waterfall. It doesn't matter what that level is, or how you judge levels.

&gt; The information in itself isn't a game of chess though. If it were, then the Waterfall would also be a game of chess.

Only in the same way a video of a chess game is a game of chess. The waterfall certainly isn't playing chess for a simple reason: chess is a two player game. How do you make sure that whatever move the other player makes will translate to the next state of the waterfall? How do you make sure the move the waterfall makes translate to a valid move given the current state of the board?

&gt; I don't see why it is necessarily external to the waterfall. Could you explain this again?

The waterfall developed independently of the specification for input and output. While sigma takes it into account, to interpret the waterfall, we need to take it into account ourselves.

&gt; I don't really get this either.

So, what part? I'll just try to reexplain each bit.

&gt; it's taking a position like ""Alright, during this chess game, before your move you have to look at the waterfall"".

So, Sigma would be like the players. Adding in the waterfall is superfluous to the players, it's just adding something else unnecessarily. Making them look at the waterfall isn't going to make them play differently, it's just there's a waterfall nearby. That's the same relation of waterfall to sigma.

&gt; Not to mention, if your goal is to make something that can decode messages, the actual presence of messages needing decoding is irrelevant.

You don't need an actual message to decode to have a system. For example, once you've decoded all the messages you have, the system still exists.

&gt; SETI has no positive results to speak of, so that might be a bad example.

It doesn't need to have positive examples to have a system. It doesn't have positive examples because space is big, not because it's system doesn't work.

&gt; If Sigma could do self-translation, or render it's outputs to itself in a way that renders them intelligible,

So, we could definitely hook up a robot that moves the chess pieces and looks at the board itself. Is this what you mean? That could, and probably would, be included in Sigma as well.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-03-22 14:22:01 :

&gt; Hmm. Let me propose another one then, maybe it will clear it up... We are watching from the satellite, but our watching doesn't in any way influence the behavior of the creatures, they act observer (us) independently.

OK, but I think you see that the usefulness of this distinction breaks down when you remove the paranthetical here. In psychology, we attempt to study the mental states of others which are necessarily observer dependent. They aren't dependent on our observation (ideally), but it can't be separated from subjectivity all together. If what we studied in psychology was completely devoid of observer dependence, then it wouldn't be psychology anymore.

If your hypothetical simulated creatures can be exhaustively described without appealing to observer dependent facts, then they don't have experiences as we know them: the kind of thing studied by psychologists.

&gt; This easily explains all of this. We know mathematical functions aren't necessarily 1 to 1: for x2, f(-1) = f(1). Thus, you can have one experience that is attributable to several inputs. 

Do you really think this kind of rationalism actually holds? Is there an actual procedure that constitutes checking an explicit function? Do you have evidence that supports this view over its competitors?

&gt; I guess I'll have to take your word for it, because I honestly can't say. This sort of thing (being disoriented by non-damaging things) hasn't happened to me.

You've at least had an orgasm before, right? Not to be vulgar, but that should be at least one 5 second moment in your life where stimulous is pretty damn overwhelming.

&gt; Basically, we could attach an image recognition system and simulate the full process of seeing...

There are two ways I could respond here. First, I could challenge your claim here and insist that I computational efficiency does make a difference. At the very least, I could insist that the ability to interact with an environment as efficiently as other intelligent life is a good indication of consciousness even if it isn't ironclad: it's a necessary but insufficient condition.

Second, I could push against the claim that this image recognition software is fully simulating sight. It certainly wasn't designed to simulate sight; it was designed to reliable sort photos with a high degree of accuracy given certain parameters. Human sight certain wasn't designed the same way, even if we allow for a misleading interpretation of natural selection as unintentional design. Beyond having different genetic conditions, image recognition and sight serve very different functions. 

Sight is a sensory capacity that allows creatures like us to form conscious picture of how light interacts with our environement; successful image recognition is measured in light of these capacities and judge as successful insofar as we see it that way. the kind of image recognition the machine does is once removed from the kind of image recognition we think about when we colloquially say, ""I recognize that!""

&gt; I don't get your point here...

The internet isn't billions of machines not doing anything, though; it is a highly organized collection of chaotic events with some non-obvious cause and effect relationships. You keep pushing me to shed my prejeduce against machines and look for the things we have in common. That description of the internet could well apply to the human brain. If high level functional similarities are the most important features for consciousness, then the internet is at least partly conscious by that reasoning.

&gt; It doesn't. It's the same to the local entropy as well. There's nothing more energetic about a straight girder than a bent one.

Look, maybe I've been fast and loose with the mathematical formalism here, but I feel like we are re-tredding ground. If things like education don't increase our capacity to meaningfully carry out work, then it is an aweful investment. If I could build a machine that will convert my capital into actual work, (e.i. buy coal to run a stream engine), then why would I invest instead in something that produces no work at all, (e.i. pay to have an employee pursue a master's degree). Either the all of society is based on a fundemental lie, (that investing in other people is a fantastic way to do more collective work), or the process of learning has real world pay-offs that compensate for our initial investment. 

&gt; This may be off to the side, but what do you mean by perspective? 

Are you seriously this autistic dude? Haven't you ever read a piece of literature for fun or wondered what your significant other was thinking while they're making a face? I know this seems venemous, but I can't help but be a little gobsmacked. A perpective is something we all learn about: as babies we come to recognize others, as children we come to learn about other's feelings, as adults we learn about ourselves relative to others. It's a personal interpretive slant that allows us to navigate the world and interpret the way others navigate that shared world. Weather machines are designed to transmit information with high fidelity: in a manner such that there is a high degree of correspondence between events in the world and information represented in the model. They are designed to have as minimal a perspective as possible. 

&gt; Which it has. If a cold front is coming in from the north, it will detect that on northward sensors, but not on southward ones. It will know they are northward sensors, and it will predict the cold front coming in from the north accordingly.

Without the anthropomorphizing, I can agree. The machine registers activity in a given sensor and adapts its model in a way that will make this activity explicit to us. Beyond that, I'd also like to note that there is only one weather network in this scenario. It is analogous to communication within our own brains rather than communication with another independent network. If Channel 2's robots could relate to Channel 6's and both of them agree that the robot from Channel 8 is the worst, then you'd have a scenario closer to the one I had in mind.

&gt; I'm trying to give an example of a passive medium that contains knowledge...

I still think it is wrong headed. Books clearly aren't conscious and don't contain thoughts pre-packaged for us to consume later. We learn through interpreting books; Interpretation is where the knowledge comes from. Books and weather machines don't do this, as you stated. They don't interact with knowledge in a way that expands or contracts what is known. They are a neutral medium for preserving information for later use.

&gt; But then the question shifts from whether they're concievable (which we agree they are) to whether they're possible, right? You think we're conscious because ""there's something special about humans"" Why could that specialness not be put into a machine?

It could, but we are going to have to build very different kinds of machines and change the way we think about consciousness. I've talked about the possibility of AI multiple times in positive terms if you can recall. I just think you expectations about AI and the nature of the challenge before us are wrong-headed.

&gt; On the will it be like us, I agree probably not, but I don't know why that would bar it from being conscious. Most animals don't think like us, but I think you said you consider them conscious.

I'd disagree. I think that animal life all developed from a common root. At the very least, tetrapods all seem to share select common capacties for thought. We, as particularly successful and intelligent animals, have amplified these processes partly by developing innovative adaptations, but mostly through our cooperation in large, complicated societies. I think animals are special, to be completely honest. 'Humans are special' is just a shorthand for this idea. Humans are just the most relavant animals in 90% of the conversations.

&gt;  But a general intelligence is required if you want your lawyer bot to drive you home, and order you a pizza for dinner.

This isn't the Jetsons; I don't need my robot butler to do everything. If I have a law problem, I'll just go see a robot lawyer and leave my robot maid at home. It would probably be cheaper to build two separate systems that perform their jobs excellently than build one system that can manage several jobs passably. 

As for inventing problems before we see them, I don't see why this is necessarily a selling point. It seems like it will cause more anxiety in my life than it relieves.

&gt; What? How? Certainly there's a best thing at a given task...

"" But, if the mere fact that I can produce from my thought the idea of something entails that everything that I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to that thing really does belong to it, is not this a possible basis for another argument to prove the existence of God? Certainly, the idea of God, or a supremely perfect being, is one that I find within me just as surely as the idea of any shape or number. And my understanding that it belongs to his nature that he always exists is no less clear and distinct than is the case when I prove of any shape or number that some property belongs to its nature.""
-Descarte

&gt; No, I was just providing an example of a formal idea where attacking the conclusion instead of the premises was valid.

What formal idea are you using where attacking the conclusion instead of the premises is also valid? I never claimed that such a thing is impossible; I claimed that *you* are doing so on shaky grounds.

--------------------------------

KDJones @ 2017-03-22 15:58:06 :

&gt; Ok, so, I'd first like to ask what kind of evidence you're looking for. Before you got annoyed at me for not providing evidence, and now you're saying the evidence I'm trying to provide doesn't work. That's fine, but what, save a fully functional general intelligence actually existing, would you take as evidence they could?

This came up in the video interview too, but I can't do your side of the argument for you. I don't know what will convince me. If I was withholding convincing information from you this entire time, then I would be arguing in bad faith and wouldn't need you to convince me in the first place.

I have also burned through countless lines of evidence and reasoning with you. I have constructed entire essays on topics only to drop the arguments altogether because you didn't find it convincing. Discussions like this a bound for many dead-ends. I  understand that this can be frustrating, but that's the game.

&gt; Second, I'd like to say that our current efforts in AI do seem to represent advancements towards a general AI. With neural nets, the same basic structure can do tasks as disparate as categorizing words into different languages, and playing Mario. That seems pretty general to me.

Isn't playing Mario essential like using a language though? Couldn't I translate a level of the game into a series of 'sentences' using minimally effective strings of characters to stand for actions and read the play-through as a series of these actions?

&gt; Because I said ""saying""? Or some other reason? Because as far as I can tell, besides the ""saying"", this is what it is doing. I don't see where your disconnect is, could you explain why you don't think this is what it's doing?

You used the term 'thinking' explicitly in you quote from the robot horses mouth. This isn't really about term policing, though. It is about the way you are concpetualizing the case in general. Long story short, you are explaining the machinesactions by appealing to inner states for the machine. Even if the machine doesn't literally have the equiptment to speak, you are ascribe a kind of mental language to the machine. This is bad, because it isn't clear that 1) this actually what goes on in thought in general and 2) it certainly isn't what the machine is designed to do. The machine is essentially a very complicated information sieve. I wouldn't attribute the results to any considerations of modal properties (possibilities), attributions of belief, or the like.

&gt; I'm guessing you meant ""not making unnecessary connections"" But that would be how I said before: It doesn't give a certain answer, it's not a 1 for Mandarin, and a 0 for English, it's varying amounts.

It gives a definite answer; we interpret the numbers in terms of certainty. The machine in itself is only 'interested' in following the process through and coming to a definite end. It isn't as if the numbers fluctuate while the machine makes up its mind or something.

&gt; Baxter must be trained by showing him how to do the task...

He watches you do the task, but then *he* does the task. For the lack of a better word, he figures out how to use his body to do something that is sufficiently similar. It's creative insofar as he invents his own procedure. An amazing copy of the work of an old Dutch Master is still an amazing work of creativity insofar as the producer needs to figure our how to impliment the task.

&gt; Now, if you want AI creativity, we have that too...

It seems like this guy is basically making the same point I have been making for a while: that current examples of effective AI are bad at performing intuitive tasks and that the most reasonable avenue forward is a division of labor where humans continue to supply the intuitive information for tasks. He talks about the creative potential of powerful computing systems, but he doesn't give examples of computers setting new goals and pushing the boundaries of conceptual space. 

&gt; You know, I considered this, but didn't think it worth addressing. It should be obvious that to show that objective analogies can exist, all I have to do is show a case in which every observer will agree on the comparison. So, trivially, change the scenario to one where the house and model share an inertial frame. And just in case, they have the same orientation, so a relativistic observer will not notice distance distortion along disparate axes.

You can't say that every observer is included and then restrict the ways people can view the objects. You are trying to have your cake and eat it too here. If laying out explicit conditions for viewing something, then why not say, ""It was a beautiful summer morning like the kind you will find one the day right before Dill comes back to visit: right as the Magnolia begins to bud and the whisteria begins to shed the spring petals.""

&gt; For an even more uncontroversial example: quantum entangled particles. Two electrons can be entangled so that their spins are necessarily opposing. The analogy ""e1's spin is to e2's spin as 1 is to -1"" is true for any perspective. We don't even have to know the spins of either electron (and in many cases don't) to know this must be the case.

As far as observer independence goes, GM is a bad place to look. Many interpretations of Standard model are explicitly anthropocentric.

&gt; So, I reread the passage, but I don't see why you can make that judgement. Why does a lamb frollicking come from a place of joy, but a robot necessarily doesn't? Basically, how do you have such a concrete idea of what joy is to make that judgement?

Because I have had a direct intuitive experience of joy, and siad experience was coordinated analogically with the kind of behavior produced by the lamb. The most reasonable sufficient explanation for the lambs behavior is an appeal to emotions in the lamb. In contrast, the most reasonable sufficient explanation for the behavior of a robot that carefully copies the behavior of lambs is the explicit goal of copying the lamb, as you have presented it.

&gt; What? It's not. That's just not true. I mean, unless you're going as vague as a stick tied to a rock is the same basic technology as a smartphone (stuff stuck together). Or that all technology is the same basic technology because it works off the same laws of physics.

That's great, you are just right.

&gt; Because it's wrong.

Thanks for clearing that up. Why don't you just tell what exact will help you see that I'm right, since that's a sensible question apparently. Help me refrain from bothering you with my bad answers.

&gt; I think if I'm being honest, no, I've just felt confused about how to put how I'm feeling into words. That is, I understand, but I couldn't explain it to someone else. I mean, how could I not understand how I'm feeling: I'm feeling it.

You are just a kid; This makes that pretty clear. Life is not as simple as your neat little scholastic life. You clearly haven't experienced the messiness of life outside of a order system yet. I'm sorry but that is the most sensible explanation I can come up with. Literally every other fully formed human being I have ever met in my life can recall at least one time in their life where they experience existential angst or anxiety.

&gt; Are they talking about truth about the world in this case though? Because I'd probably disagree with that. They're probably talking about lessons, so like, moral truth, if such a thing exists.

I mean truth as in truth. Not all truth is an obvious matter of correspondence between fact and reality. I think moral truth is totally a thing too.

&gt; Sure. But something doesn't need to be true to be worth reading: We're disagreeing, so at least one of us is wrong, but it's worth reading both sides of the discussion. Being worth reading doesn't mean it's true.

That's because we are pragmatically engaged in the task of being in dialogue. If we didn't read what the other said, then the discussion would fall apart. Since we are both interested in maintaining a dialogue for the sake of entertainment, this negatively affects us. Therefore, we accord to norms regarding attention to what others say.

This is very different from the context of the disimpassioned prusuit of truth. If I just want to know the real answers here, I'd probably ask someone that is more knowledgeable and has a better idea where they stand on the entry-level issues. I'm saying we can pursue literature in this disinterested stance. An interpretation of a story can be more effective or less effective. Pursuing effective interpretation should be taken and a truth-driven pursuit.

&gt; That's fine, but besides through examining behavior, how do you judge the richness of their inner life?

I can judge the richness in my inner life intuitively. We have first-hand experience of being ourselves and therefore are directly acquainted with our own richness. By analogy, I extend the same level of richness to things that exhibit the same general behavior so long as they satisfy my general theory of mind. This argument by analogy is also open to skeptical attacks, but it's conclusion is of the same form as my belief at least, (ei it's about the richness of others as opposed to the accuracy of my perception).

KDJones @ 2017-03-24 17:26:46 :

&gt; When I check my oil, I check the dipstick. Seeing a dry dipstick makes me think, ""My oil is low"". The contents of my thought aren't, ""This dipstick looks funny"".

Here, I'm making a point about the direction of my belief in other minds. Our beliefs are about other minds are about the experience of others rather than any particular behavior they happen to exhibit. Behavior is fuel for the analogy, but it isn't necessarily identical to the thing we deduce by analogy. The absence of oil isn't identical to my dipstick despite my dipstick being evidence for the absence. Not all evidentiary relationships are presentations of the thing in question.

Behavior here includes all outward manifestations related to a person, including anatomical and physiological changes. It isn't necessarily intelligible or choosen

&gt; This, if you mean what I think you mean, is assuming the Hard Problem is a problem. It sounds like you're saying there is some information that necessarily is unaccessible going on in conscious minds. But that's what we're trying to decide.

I think you are reading too much into this statement. I'm trying to say that experience is sometimes non-conceptual and sometimes conceptual. Explicitly presenting information, (e.i. producing a sign), is conceptual by nature. We can't use language to present information without using concepts and vice versa. Non-conceptual experience can tell us things about the world or provide evidence for things the same way smoke tells us about fire. This constitutes a reliable causal connection that allows us to learn about how the world is. However, it isn't an explicit sign: something readable in and of itself.

&gt; My argument for why this isn't true would be that not all display of information is linguistic. I don't know what is linguistic about the firing of my neurons, but, as I said above, it is information being displayed. If that is, in fact, linguistic, then I don't know what non-linguistic things consciousness necessarily entails.

Neurons firing would be like the smoke here. Neurons firing is evidence for thinking, but it isn't necessarily identical with it. Alternatively, Neurons firing is probably the fire and thought is probably the smoke. The point remains that these are independent things. We can conceive of smokeless fire and fireless smoke despite these things two things being necessarily connected in reality.

&gt; This is an aside, I'm not arguing against this, but I don't think I understand incompleteness very well. Does this apply to all a priori definitions?

Maybe not all definitions; the problem here is that you are providing an a priori definition for the purpose of sorting signifying events (chess games) from non-signifying events (non-chess games). The issue comes from demarcating every game of chess from all of non-chess. This collection of games of chess is semantically complete, since all the necessary truths about chess are deducible from the set of all possible chess games. The system is also syntactically complete, since you need to determine what is chess and what is not chess in every case. These goals are in conflict.

&gt;&gt; The Waterfall is an attack on the possibility of a posteriori accounts that don't collapse back into anthropocentrism. If we cast a narrow defintion of success, such as success as far as we're personally concerned or success to the extent it is effective against most people, then it seems as if we've drawn people back into the center of the discussion. In contrast, if we cast a wide defintion of success, such as the capacity to perform a complex task given sufficient interpretive parameters, then we might end up including too much, including things like waterfalls.

&gt; I've been doing my best to disconnect this from how well it performs. All that's important is that it performs.

That is what I mean by success. Success doesn't imply overwhelming success.

&gt; My point has been that in order to get the waterfall to perform at any level, you've necessarily implemented an algorithm (sigma) that will perform at that same level without the waterfall. It doesn't matter what that level is, or how you judge levels.

To clarify, you think that the translation function could do the same exact thing without any inputs whatsoever? That is what I'm taking away from this.

&gt; Only in the same way a video of a chess game is a game of chess. The waterfall certainly isn't playing chess for a simple reason: chess is a two player game. How do you make sure that whatever move the other player makes will translate to the next state of the waterfall? How do you make sure the move the waterfall makes translate to a valid move given the current state of the board?

1. I don't really understand what you are trying to say with the video remark.

2. Could you rephrase your repsonse in light of what I said? I don't understand how this is relevant to what I was saying in the section.

&gt; The waterfall developed independently of the specification for input and output. While sigma takes it into account, to interpret the waterfall, we need to take it into account ourselves.

I don't understand what you were trying to say here either.

&gt; So, Sigma would be like the players. Adding in the waterfall is superfluous to the players, it's just adding something else unnecessarily. Making them look at the waterfall isn't going to make them play differently, it's just there's a waterfall nearby. That's the same relation of waterfall to sigma.

What makes you think that sigma is like a player here? It doesn't seem like Sigma could produce a game of chess without any inputs to work with; The waterfall provides those inputs. We could use other inputs, certainly, and other inputs might perform better than the waterfall. However, this isn't relevant to the claim at hand. The claim is that a waterfall could supply the inputs and therefore could provide the real-time impetus behind a move. Sigma is certainly a necessary part of every game of chess. It just isn't the final cause of any chess moves.

&gt; You don't need an actual message to decode to have a system. For example, once you've decoded all the messages you have, the system still exists.

Sure, what does this have to do with this particular case, though? How does this relate to the Waterfall problem, and, by extension, how does this translate to a claim about how the mind must work?

&gt; It doesn't need to have positive examples to have a system. It doesn't have positive examples because space is big, not because it's system doesn't work.

You can't really know that, but I can see I'm not going to change you mind here.

&gt; So, we could definitely hook up a robot that moves the chess pieces and looks at the board itself. Is this what you mean? That could, and probably would, be included in Sigma as well.

This seems like self-actualization maybe. It's not really what I was talking about at any rate. It's not like this robot body is doing something that couldn't occur withing the program without a body. If the robot looked down at the pieces and thought, ""Why don't we play a different kind of game?"", then we'd be closure to self-authorization.

&gt; Fuzzy logic

This is a good direction to take things. I'd say that the vague concepts in these cases are your membership functions. They are the things that would typical be queried in a Sorities paradox: ""Is something that is half a degree cold still hot?"", ""Is something one ounce heavier still light?"", etc. In fuzzy logic, we disambiguate what counts as what for the program before we start. This takes a fuzzy problem on our end, translates it into a determinate process for the machine, and retranslates the outputs into a model that closely corresponds with our expectations given pre-defined parameters.

Machines will inevitably get better at dealing with vague concepts in the sense that we will get better at designing more sophisticated machines and more congenial environments for automization. I don't think it's inevitable for machines to leave the crib of human intentions. I don't see a reason to think that machines are capable of doing existential unpacking: to wrestle with the problems of membership functions without explicit prior guidance and to turn this struggle inwards towards itself.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-30 02:03:25 :

&gt; OK, but I think you see that the usefulness of this distinction breaks down when you remove the paranthetical here.

So are you saying I used the wrong word? I think what you're trying to say is that the animals can't be observer independent and conscious, because they would be observers themselves. Correct me if I'm wrong.

But this is entirely unrelated. My whole point that spawned this line was that how I present what information about the creatures that I do to you, doesn't affect how they act. This is true regardless of whether they have experiences, or count as observers, or whatever. That's the point I was trying to make.

&gt; Do you really think this kind of rationalism actually holds? Is there an actual procedure that constitutes checking an explicit function?

I mean, I'm pretty sure you can reverse a function. I certainly don't think it's impossible. And I'm more inclined to say that it's some complex system that implements this than that it's just powered by magic that we don't see anywhere else in the world.

&gt; You've at least had an orgasm before, right? That should be at least one 5 second moment in your life where stimulous is pretty damn overwhelming.

... I said I'd take your word for it. And I will. But it hasn't ever felt like that for me...

&gt; First, I could challenge your claim here and insist that I computational efficiency does make a difference.

Ok, but I don't see how making it more efficient would make it less conscious.

&gt; At the very least, I could insist that the ability to interact with an environment as efficiently as other intelligent life is a good indication of consciousness

Rating this really depends on the environment. These creatures are much more efficient at interacting with an environment defined by bits than we are, even if they're less efficient at interacting with one defined by particles and whatnot.

&gt; Second, I could push against the claim that this image recognition software is fully simulating sight. It certainly wasn't designed to simulate sight;

Sure. I can agree with this. But the ""sight"" system for our creatures was designed simply as a source of input. Sight was just something that we experience that was closest to it. Sight simply formed because photons were abundant, and sensing them let you tell about your environment. If our ""sight"" analog, which doesn't fully represent sight, does allow the creatures to get information about their environment, it's serving the same purpose. After all, there are many creatures in our world that have other methods of information gathering besides, or even instead of, sight.

&gt; The internet isn't billions of machines not doing anything, though; it is a highly organized collection of chaotic events with some non-obvious cause and effect relationships.

Ah, I see. I don't really know how this is related to the ""simulate a cell and you could simulate an animal"" but this is something I could get behind.

&gt; If things like education don't increase our capacity to meaningfully carry out work,

Do you mean work as force*distance, or work as the stuff we do to earn money. Because education does increase the second, which is why it's useful to society, but it doesn't really increase the first. We originally said we were talking about physics work, which is why I said what I said. But not making us more able to do physics work doesn't mean we can't do better work in the society sense.

Say I'm a blacksmith making swords or something. I learn a new technique which allows me to make a sword with 10 strikes from my hammer, instead of the 20 it used to take. I can now do twice the amount of work for society, because I can make twice as many swords. But the physics work I do is really only dependent on the strikes of my hammer. I can't do more strikes of my hammer, I just made those strikes better fit my task. My physics work is the same, my society work is better.

&gt; I know this seems venemous, but I can't help but be a little gobsmacked.

So, what I meant was perspective is not a word with one definition. It can mean outlook. Your values and such. It can also mean very simply where you're standing and which way you're looking. Like in [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IHgJeVqct4E/hqdefault.jpg). The red, orange, and green are what people will see from different perspectives. This second one is simply what information is available to you. I stand in a forest, I'll hear the tree that falls. You, in New York, won't. Different perspectives, even if we're both like, Democrats or whatever.

&gt;  If Channel 2's robots could relate to Channel 6's and both of them agree that the robot from Channel 8 is the worst, then you'd have a scenario closer to the one I had in mind.

Well, it could. You wouldn't, because that doesn't help you tell the weather, but you could add a system where it checks the predictions of other Channels, and compares them to actual results and gives each a score which decides who's the worst. 

&gt; They don't interact with knowledge in a way that expands or contracts what is known. They are a neutral medium for preserving information for later use.

How is taking air temperature and pressure and whatnot and predicting if it will rain in an hour or whatever not ""interact[ing] with knowledge in a way that expands or contracts what is known""? I genuinely don't understand.

&gt; I just think you expectations about AI and the nature of the challenge before us are wrong-headed.

If you think that conscious machines can exist, then I think that's good enough. Correct me if I'm wrong, but my starting point for bringing up machine consciousness was to say ""if we can create that, then we can understand it, and if we can understand it, how can a barrier to understanding consciousness actually exist?""

&gt; I'd disagree. I think that animal life all developed from a common root.

Yes, and it all diverged from that common root as well. A significant part of a birds life is doing the thinking necessary for flying. For you, a walking creature, this is not the case. Therefore, birds do not think like you.

&gt; It would probably be cheaper to build two separate systems that perform their jobs excellently than build one system that can manage several jobs passably.

I assume you have a smartphone. Why do you not carry around a watch, calendar, calculator, and cellphone as individual devices? In fact, our computers nowadays are perfectly described as one system that can manage several jobs passably instead of separate systems that perform their jobs excellently.

&gt; As for inventing problems before we see them, I don't see why this is necessarily a selling point.

Not inventing problems before we see them. Solving problems without having to develop a new solution, which saves time and money.

&gt; ... -Descartes

I'm pretty sure in that paragraph I explicitly stated that it wouldn't be the best at everything, just every thinking task. In order to match that, the only thing you need to be is the best thinker. Even so, ""best"" need not mean ""perfect"". It just means better than the alternatives. If it's better than any human I'd say ""best"" is an adequate descriptor. It was shorthand I guess.

&gt; What formal idea are you using where attacking the conclusion instead of the premises is also valid?

I don't know. I haven't thought about the meta analysis of my argument. Maybe I am doing so on shaky grounds. If I remmber, we got here because I said ""this seems to reduce to whether or not physicalism is true."" And you responded with ""You shouldn't worry about the implications of an argument until afterward if it's in a logically valid form and all premises are true."" I'll be honest, I wasn't sure at the time why that followed, and I'm still not.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-30 02:03:44 :

&gt; I can't do your side of the argument for you...

Everything you say here is fine. But the reason I wrote what I did was that your line amounted to ""Current efforts don't imply anything about the future."" We both agree conscious machines don't exist. We're trying to argue whether they could (at least, I thought, but you said they could, just not this way?). But with that line, nothing I can bring up about what we currently can do has *any* bearing on whether we will or won't. So what do you want from me? I can't bring up stuff we can do, because of that line. I can't bring up stuff we can't, for obvious reasons. There aren't any categories left.

Maybe that's not how you meant it. But that's how I read it. If you didn't mean it that way, then great, but I need you to clear it up for me.

&gt; Isn't playing Mario essential like using a language though?

You could interpret it that way, but under that interpretation, what isn't? If everything is like using a language, then it still is general, even if that's all it can do.

&gt; Long story short, you are explaining the machinesactions by appealing to inner states for the machine. Even if the machine doesn't literally have the equiptment to speak, you are ascribe a kind of mental language to the machine. This is bad, because it isn't clear that 1) this actually what goes on in thought in general and 2) it certainly isn't what the machine is designed to do.

I'm not sure I can put forth an argument against 1, but it is what the machine is designed to do. Right? It's mental language is binary. It runs binary code and interacts with binary data. It has inner states where it reads and writes data. 

&gt; It isn't as if the numbers fluctuate while the machine makes up its mind or something.

Because it's not doing anything else when it tells you it's answer. If it were still learning while it gives you the answer (like humans do) then they would. If you asked for an answer before it got to the final stage, it would as well. I think that last one needs some more explaining, so I'll do that. The output nodes don't necessarily have to be the last layer, they just have to have a way of sending their data to the output. If you created a recursive neural net, where one of the later layers attached to one of the earlier ones, then it would give fluctuating numbers every time it made a pass through the output nodes. Basically, this isn't a hard restriction, it's just a restriction on the exact one we're looking at.

&gt; It's creative insofar as he invents his own procedure.

This is exactly what a neural net does. It invents a function to pass inputs through that gives the intended results.

&gt; He talks about the creative potential of powerful computing systems, but he doesn't give examples of computers setting new goals and pushing the boundaries of conceptual space.

Computer are still, and probably will remain, our tools. Why would we ever want them to set their own goals? At least not their own whole goals. If they set a goal like ""acquire this data, so I can make a calculation with it"" that'd be fine. But we don't want them making their own goals completely, lest they decide that all these humans are hindering those goals.

&gt; You can't say that every observer is included and then restrict the ways people can view the objects. You are trying to have your cake and eat it too here.

I didn't restrict the ways people can view them, I restricted the objects. Restricting the objects to a single inertial frame is no different from restricting the model to exactly 1/8th the size of the house. I'm only changing facts about the objects, not any observer.

&gt; Many interpretations of Standard model are explicitly anthropocentric.

Ok, lets just make them two electrons in the same orbital. You can fit 2 electrons into an orbital, but only if they have opposite spins.

&gt; The most reasonable sufficient explanation for the lambs behavior is an appeal to emotions in the lamb. In contrast, the most reasonable sufficient explanation for the behavior of a robot that carefully copies the behavior of lambs is the explicit goal of copying the lamb, as you have presented it.

This, to me, seems like a double standard. You judge the lamb's state based on it's behavior, but when a robot performs the same behavior, you attribute it to something else. Are you sure the lamb isn't just copying other lambs?

&gt; That's great, you are just right.

I didn't want to sound like an asshole, but what you said was just not right. We have plane engines that are called turbo-jets. They work as a fusion between a car engine and a rocket engine. It's not more complex than a car engine but less complex than a rocket engine. It's more complex than both. That wouldn't be possible if a rocket engine was just a more complex car engine.

In other ways, a car engine uses expanding gas to push a piston which spins wheels. A rocket engine is more like a reverse funnel that heats up its exhaust. Or a car doesn't really mind Newton's Third Law, a rocket engine lives by it. Or the exhaust phase of a car is just to clear the chamber, the exhaust 'phase' of a rocket is the entire point of the rocket.

&gt; Why don't you just tell what exact will help you see that I'm right, since that's a sensible question apparently. 

Sure. If you can restate that with something that *is* a matter of complexity difference, then I'll concede the point. But a rocket engine and a car engine don't satisfy that requirement.

&gt; Literally every other fully formed human being I have ever met in my life can recall at least one time in their life where they experience existential angst or anxiety.

Well, I've had anxiety before, and I could even say sometimes I don't know why I'm feeling anxious, but that's not being confused about what I'm feeling, just about why I'm feeling it. Have I misunderstood?

&gt; Not all truth is an obvious matter of correspondence between fact and reality.

I think in a way this still works with my argument. I may be wrong, since I'm kind of just stumbling on this, but when we find a lesson in a book that we can draw a true analogy with, we generally call the person a model. A model human, a role model, whatever, but that does represent our conflation of models with true analogies. It's moral, so instead of an is, it's more a should: Your behavior is to this situation should be like his behavior was to that situation.

&gt; That's because we are pragmatically engaged in the task of being in dialogue. If we didn't read what the other said, then the discussion would fall apart.

I meant to present this as if from an outside party. I think they could glean value from our discussion as well. Them only reading half the responses wouldn't cause the discussion to fall apart, but would be less valuable.

&gt; By analogy, I extend the same level of richness to things that exhibit the same general behavior so long as they satisfy my general theory of mind.

So, you do judge richness by behavior. What was wrong with my statement then?

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-30 02:03:56 :

&gt; Not all evidentiary relationships are presentations of the thing in question.

Sure. That sounds fine.

&gt; However, it isn't an explicit sign: something readable in and of itself.

In the sense that we don't display it with body language or words, sure, yes, it's not explicitly presenting information. But to say that it literally isn't readable is exactly what I said: you're saying there is something that is necessarily unaccessible going on in conscious minds. 

&gt; The point remains that these are independent things.

The point you've made is that they might be different things, not that they are. But sure, I guess that makes sense.

&gt; The issue comes from demarcating every game of chess from all of non-chess.

But there's no issue demarcating all 2s from non-2s. If it's written as an expression with variables, it's not a two, and if it's not, then we can just calculate it, and see if it's 2. Why does this not pose a problem? It seems to be semantically and syntactically complete as well. At least as much as chess is. I don't understand.

&gt; To clarify, you think that the translation function could do the same exact thing without any inputs whatsoever? That is what I'm taking away from this.

No, I think you could strip out whatever parts interact with the waterfall, and what remains would be a function that works just as well. Instead of feeding the inputs to the waterfall then sigma, just feed them into the sigma.

&gt; I don't really understand what you are trying to say with the video remark.

A series of board states defines a game of chess. But a listing of a series of board states isn't playing chess. Despite the fact that you could take a waterfall, and translate it to a series of board states (though, again, since a waterfall is essentially random, your task for doing this would probably require finding a valid series of board states beforehand: a waterfall wouldn't reliably pump out information that could be interpreted as such.), you couldn't interpret that waterfall as playing chess.

&gt; I don't understand what you were trying to say here either.

Sigma, given a valid board state, will output a valid move. The waterfall doesn't know what a valid board or a valid move are, so in order to make it output a valid move, we have to curate it's output ourselves.

&gt; What makes you think that sigma is like a player here?

It takes in board states and ouputs chess moves. Like what a player does.

&gt; It doesn't seem like Sigma could produce a game of chess without any inputs to work with; The waterfall provides those inputs.

If the waterfall is providing all the inputs, it's not playing chess. Chess is a two player game. You can't have 2 players if one thing is producing all inputs and outputs.

&gt; We could use other inputs, certainly, and other inputs might perform better than the waterfall.

We should use the only inputs that make sense: the current state of the board.

&gt; Sure, what does this have to do with this particular case, though?

You said: ""This seems like saying my decoder ring carries everything I need for decoding messages, so we can throw away all those secret communications"" I was saying, sure, why not. Why you brought it up, I don't know, my first response was ""I don't think it is"" but, because I know I misunderstand things, I covered my bases by saying ""Well, even if it is an apt comparison, I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that.""

&gt; You can't really know that

You can tell a radio broadcast, even in a foreign language, from static in like, less than 2 seconds. So, where's the issue?

&gt; If the robot looked down at the pieces and thought, ""Why don't we play a different kind of game?"", then we'd be closure to self-authorization.

That seems like a shift from ""render it's outputs to itself in a way that renders them intelligible,"" but ok. Sure. I feel like I say this a lot, but we could make a system that does that. If it just randomly decided the move ""lets play checkers"" and instead of outputing a chess move outputed ""let's play checkers"" and then shifted it's attention to a different game board. The sum thing seems to be a conglomeration of a ridiculous amount of different systems, but I don't think there's anything you've put forward where I've thought ""Yeah, no way a computer could mimic that""

&gt; to wrestle with the problems of membership functions without explicit prior guidance and to turn this struggle inwards towards itself.

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that does just that: puts datapoints into groups without any guidance about where they should go. It's the kind of system Amazon uses to recommend products. Amazon's employees have no idea what you'd like to buy, but you're close to some other people in the vector space, and they bought these things, so maybe you will too.

One method that I'm familiar with separates ""core"" points from non-core points. These non-core points could easily be rated with partial values based on a distance metric to a core point, so you can even get the fuzziness.

--------------------------------

awenonian @ 2017-03-30 02:04:12 :

So, at this point, I have to say, I'm feeling a bit disingenuous. A lot of these points, I'm not sure how to trace back. I couldn't honestly say that if I conceded the point, I'd understand how that affects my original argument. The way I remember it, there's really 2 main points that spawned, and everything else was a line spawned off of them. I'm going to outline those two below, and if there's one I'm missing, tell me.

Point one: Physicalism

I think I brought this up at the very beginning, saying I agreed with other commenters that this seems to reduce to physicalism. If physicalism holds, there are no private questions, only currently private questions. Where in a physical world would these private questions stand? If they're physical, they're observable, and if they're observable, they're not private.

I don't think this has gotten anywhere, because you aren't a physicalist, so maybe we could just drop it, but I don't know.

Point two: AI

If we could create a conscious machine, then we could understand it, if we could understand it, there's no real barrier towards understanding consciousness. I think early on you said we could create it by accident, and therefore not understand it. But the argument isn't based on how we do create it, only how we could. You'd have to assert that we could only create it by accident. But then you're asserting that there's something that can't be understood, but could be created by our mundane tools. This seems silly to me: we know how our mundane tools work, and so worst case, we can backwards engineer the result. If we don't know how our mundane tools work, then, since we had to create them, we could just apply that argument recursively, to show that we could know how they work.

I think you've conceded the ""we can create a conscious machine"", but maybe you've only conceded ""we could create general AI""? I'm not sure.

I believe these are the only two points that are really rattling around, and all the other things are lines split off from various wordings and whatnot as we've discussed them. I'd like to simplify, because I feel bad about disagreeing on various points (even though I do disagree) because I've lost where disagreeing actually gets me.

KDJones @ 2017-03-31 16:38:35 :

&gt; I don't know. I haven't thought about the meta analysis of my argument. Maybe I am doing so on shaky grounds. If I remmber, we got here because I said ""this seems to reduce to whether or not physicalism is true."" And you responded with ""You shouldn't worry about the implications of an argument until afterward if it's in a logically valid form and all premises are true."" I'll be honest, I wasn't sure at the time why that followed, and I'm still not.

&gt; I think I brought this up at the very beginning, saying I agreed with other commenters that this seems to reduce to physicalism. If physicalism holds, there are no private questions, only currently private questions. Where in a physical world would these private questions stand? If they're physical, they're observable, and if they're observable, they're not private.
I don't think this has gotten anywhere, because you aren't a physicalist, so maybe we could just drop it, but I don't know.

Whether physicalism is true or not is the only important topic on the table. It doesn't figure heavily as a direct topic of conversation often these days, but all of this is meant to be the outlines of an argument against physicalism: this is a kata for some mental judo against another highly formalized kata.

Consider the following argument:

A. If a president is corrupt, then they are bad.

B. President Trump is corrupt.

C. Therefore, Trump is bad.

This is a simple syllogism with two premises that can be reasonably defended and a conclusion that is (somewhat) controversial. This controversy doesn't indicate legitimate grounds for rejecting the argument, though. Certainly, we could rephrase this same structure in a way that a Trump supporter would find more genial.

1. If Trump is corrupt, then he is a bad.
2. Trump clearly isn't bad.
3. Therefore, Trump isn't corrupt, (it's the establishment who's corrupt!)

But, the fact that such a rewrite is possible doesn't give us genuine reasons to reject A, B, and C in favor of 1, 2, and 3. In order to have a genuinely non-partisan discussion of this topic, it is very important that we assess all of the premises on their own merit rather than lead the conversation towards comfortable dogma. If we didn't do this, then a Trump critic and a Trump support would talk past each other by appealing to arguments that are sound according to their beliefs but unsound according to their opponent's.

The same principle applies here. I'll let you decide who has to be Trump, but we can both agree that we'd like to avoid the kind of partisanship that rules in contemporary politics. My general argument, (and I mean the most rarified version), goes something like this.

1. If physicalism is true, then one of three things is true: mental events are public states of affairs, mental events are public transcendental facts, or mental events are private transcendental facts.

2. Mental events aren't public states of affairs, (via the Argument from Illusion, P-zombies, Chinese Room, etc.).

3. Mental events aren't public transcendental facts, (Argument against Rationalism, Argument against Computationalism, etc.)

4. Mental events aren't private transcendental facts, (Argument from Intimatacy, the Problem of Other Minds, etc.)

5. Therefore, physicalism is false.

An inappropriate counter-argument, like the one outlined above, would look something like this:

A. If all three things are false, then physicalism is false.

B. Physicalism is true, though. (Reasonable supposition based on pre-existing beliefs).

C. Therefore, one of three things is true.

D. Therefore, the previous argument is mistaken and physicalism is true. 

I hope I don't need to elaborate on why this is a bad argument at this point. This argument doesn't challenge the previous one. Rather, It asserts the opposite conclusion and works backwards from there. If the claim, ""Phyiscalism is true"", is the very claim we are attempting to arbitrate on, then asserting and counter-asserting about the truth of the claim isn't going to get us anywhere. Moreover, using these assertions to determine the validity of premises in each other's arguments is extra folly.

I've said all of this before, but I don't know how else to say it.

&gt; If we could create a conscious machine, then we could understand it, if we could understand it, there's no real barrier towards understanding consciousness. I think early on you said we could create it by accident, and therefore not understand it. But the argument isn't based on how we do create it, only how we could. You'd have to assert that we could only create it by accident. But then you're asserting that there's something that can't be understood, but could be created by our mundane tools. This seems silly to me: we know how our mundane tools work, and so worst case, we can backwards engineer the result. If we don't know how our mundane tools work, then, since we had to create them, we could just apply that argument recursively, to show that we could know how they work.

&gt; (T)he reason I wrote what I did was that your line amounted to ""Current efforts don't imply anything about the future."" We both agree conscious machines don't exist. We're trying to argue whether they could (at least, I thought, but you said they could, just not this way?). But with that line, nothing I can bring up about what we currently can do has any bearing on whether we will or won't. So what do you want from me? I can't bring up stuff we can do, because of that line. I can't bring up stuff we can't, for obvious reasons. There aren't any categories left.

First, I'd like to establish an official position on the possibility of machine consciousness and the development of AI like us. I don't think you are confused, but I think having a comprehensive, direct answer will give us both something to grab onto.

I think that conscious machines are possible in 2 ways. First, we can picture a Ship of Thesius type scenario where we replace every part of someone's body with functional machine equivalents until the person is complete machine. The components are type-3 (merely functionally) similar to the components in our bodies, and the final result would be either type-1 similar (self-same). This isn't likely to happen in real life, but it is a metaphysical possibility that I must concede. In terms of manufacturing a machine clone that is type-2 similar (Indiscerably similar), we both agree that such a thing is impossble for various reasons.

On the other hand, I also think we could manufacture conscious machines through a different process than reverse engineering from a human model. It's possible that a machine with capacities that are type-3 similar to our own and allow it to develop autonomously. We wouldn't be able to determine the exact state of the machine as we could with a non-autonomous machine, but we could be convinced that they were conscious the same way that we are convinced others are conscious. Certainly a scenario like Data from Star Trek seems possible enough.

This diverges in that I don't think this process would lend itself to the kind of regression that you are talking about above. This process would be more akin to farmers 8,000 years aog planting crops. They certainly understand what contributes to a good harvest and what makes certain plants more effective than others. However, they don't, at ths point, understand what's going on inside of the seeds as they germinate, grow, flower, and die. The seed acts autonomously, but the farmers aren't totally ignorant of the process. 

The accidental nature of the process comes from the lack of direction the farmers provide the seed and the role of chaotic events in the formation and development of the seed; it's non-directed and not law-like. We managed to turn agriculture into something more scientific, of course, but we should over-estimate our abilities here. We still learn amazing facts about how life actually works every year, despite now having powerful tools to investigate the phenomena that weren't available to previous generations. We know even less about what makes consciousness works. I'll grant that we are just scratching the surface, but we've been working on domesticated plants and animals for millenium without exhausting the field, (pun not intended). This grounds my pessimism about the role of current models and efforts in a 'final' answer here.

As far as categories of evidence go, this is why I have been hostile to contemporary research efforts. More than this general attitude though, I don't think you always present the cases in the most precise and accurate manner. We'll discuss this at length later, but you tend to be sloppy with personifactions and analogies with people in general. I don't think this category is inadmissable, (as opposed to speculative future machines that black box the problem). Rather, I have had more specific problems with your examples.

Whew! That was a mouthful! I'm going to try to condense everything else into a single post. I think you are right; this is a good time to take stock and reflect on the bigger issue. The part about Mario being a language and the relationship between economic and physical work are very exciting to me, so I'd like to continue those threads. Everything else will probably get just one more by-line from me. Let me know if there is anything you'd like to explore in particular that I haven't touched on. I'll be done in a few days, (maybe a week).

&gt; In the sense that we don't display it with body language or words, sure, yes, it's not explicitly presenting information. But... you're saying there is something that is necessarily unaccessible going on in conscious minds.

Do you understand the distinction between conceptual and non-conceptual thought outside of the context of our discussion? I promise I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you.

&gt; But there's no issue demarcating all 2s from non-2s...

Not true at all; the incompleteness theorem has wide ranging implications for arithmetic and number theory. Given all the conditions, there would be and issue demarcating 2s from non-2s.

&gt; No, I think you could strip out whatever parts interact with the waterfall, and what remains would be a function that works just as well. Instead of feeding the inputs to the waterfall then sigma, just feed them into the sigma.

Feed inputs into the waterfall? That is not my understanding of the case at all. I thought the waterfall was the inputs.

&gt; A series of board states defines a game of chess... you couldn't interpret that waterfall as playing chess.

Either a series of board states is a game and the waterfall participates or it isn't a game. I don't see your point here.

&gt; Sigma, given a valid board state, will output a valid move. The waterfall doesn't know what a valid board or a valid move are, so in order to make it output a valid move, we have to curate it's output ourselves.

This seems really strange, since we do in fact need to curate Sigma. If we did not intervene to set up Sigma, then it wouldn't perform either. It isn't as if Sigma 'knows' something before our intervention.

&gt; If the waterfall is providing all the inputs, it's not playing chess. Chess is a two player game.

People play chess against themselves all the time. It isn't impossible.

&gt; You can tell a radio broadcast, even in a foreign language, from static in like, less than 2 seconds. So, where's the issue?

The issue is that Mexicans aren't aliens. It is easy for me to spot human intentionality because I was raised to do so. I have no idea what alien culture looks like, so it would be hard to know what I'm looking for. 

&gt;  If it just randomly decided the move ""lets play checkers"" and instead of outputing a chess move outputed ""let's play checkers"" and then shifted it's attention to a different game board.

This isn't where I was going with this, but ok. You are basically cribbing two separate things in a single housing. You might as well tape your stappler to your pencil sharpener and say you invented a tool that can sharpen pencils and stapple papers. I'm talking about using a single resource, (our intelligence), to perform many different creative tasks.

&gt; Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that does just that: puts datapoints into groups without any guidance about where they should go.

It's given unambiguous data; it doesn't need to interpret what that data signifies. This is an important part of what I'm driving at. We aren't given unambiguous data in consciousness.

&gt; I think what you're trying to say is that the animals can't be observer independent and conscious, because they would be observers themselves. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Correct.

&gt; That's the point I was trying to make.

I got that. I don't see why it's relevant.

&gt; I mean, I'm pretty sure you can reverse a function. I certainly don't think it's impossible. And I'm more inclined to say that it's some complex system that implements this than that it's just powered by magic that we don't see anywhere else in the world.

You don't know whether the brain runs through an explicit function while thinking. You haven't presented any evidence for such a thing or given any indication of what such a thing is. And I'm the one that believes in magic?

&gt; Rating this really depends on the environment. These creatures are much more efficient at interacting with an environment defined by bits than we are, even if they're less efficient at interacting with one defined by particles and whatnot.

Considering how all conscious things interact with particles and no know conscious thing interact with bits, I don't see how the being virtually efficient would imply consciousness the same way being actually efficient would.

&gt; If our ""sight"" analog, which doesn't fully represent sight, does allow the creatures to get information about their environment, it's serving the same purpose.

They are type-3 similar, yes. That kind of similarity doesn't guarantee that these things will have similar experiences compared to actual conscious animals though.

&gt; Ah, I see. I don't really know how this is related to the ""simulate a cell and you could simulate an animal"" but this is something I could get behind.

A body is a collection of billions of cells chaotically organized around a central architecture. Does that help?

&gt; Well, it could. You wouldn't, because that doesn't help you tell the weather...

Multiply that by an entire economy, and you have and argument against the development of Strong AI by market forces.

&gt; How is taking air temperature and pressure and whatnot and predicting if it will rain in an hour or whatever not ""interact[ing] with knowledge in a way that expands or contracts what is known""? I genuinely don't understand.

Because the point is to transmit information with high fidelity. The machine does very little to no interpretation of the information it takes in. Rather, it represents its explicit current state in a way that corresponds to maps of a region which in turn correspond to places on the Earth. Humans, as interpretive animals, take all of these correspondences and draw analogies between them.

&gt; I assume you have a smartphone. Why do you not carry around a watch, calendar, calculator, and cellphone as individual devices?

Because my phone does those tasks excellently. This isn't the same as doig several things in diminished capacity. In contrast, Siri does a bunch of tasks passably. If I had a very complicated question about a particular subject, Siri would do a bad job at answering my question. If I need some simple questions answered adequately, Siri would do an OK job.

&gt; This is exactly what a neural net does. It invents a function to pass inputs through that gives the intended results.

Who's doing the intending? Baxter seems to latch onto a task it is currently learning about. This is different from being given unambiguous goals. Baxter is cool because he does seem to interpret non-conceptual goings in order to learn new tasks. That's my 2-cents at least.

&gt; Computer are still, and probably will remain, our tools. Why would we ever want them to set their own goals?

Bingo! The stamp collector problem from that link you posted a while back is a good example of why capitalists would never invest in that kind of thing and why engineers would hesitate to make such a thing. I think this bodes poorly for Strong AI because so much of what we interpret as human consciousness involves freedom of choice and individual impulse.

&gt; This, to me, seems like a double standard. You judge the lamb's state based on it's behavior, but when a robot performs the same behavior, you attribute it to something else. Are you sure the lamb isn't just copying other lambs?

Well, lambs will play spontaneously, even if raised in isolation. In contrast, I can't picture a lamb robot existing without the contrivence of copying something else.

&gt; Well, I've had anxiety before, and I could even say sometimes I don't know why I'm feeling anxious, but that's not being confused about what I'm feeling, just about why I'm feeling it. Have I misunderstood?

Maybe; we sometimes define the way we feel in relation to the object of our feeling. Noticing that something is excellent while owning it is pride while noticing that something is excellent while not owning it is envy or maybe sympathetic pride. Anxiety isn't a monolithic category; lots of different kinds of feelings count as anxiety, some good and some bad. Not knowing exactly why you are nervous, how nervous you are, and what your fear is directed towards would count as being confused about how you feel in my book.

&gt; A model human, a role model...

I don't think all literature is moralizing, so I don't know how I feel about your proposal. That being said, I don't have space to address this sub-point adequately.

&gt; So, you do judge richness by behavior. What was wrong with my statement then?

""... so long as they satisfy my general theory of mind."" Behavior along doesn't encode information about whether something has a mind or not. That determination is either ultimately beyond our final comprehension or explicable in non-empirical terms."

If you fundamentally do not believe that you and you alone are responsible for your actions and for the consequences of your actions (and what it does to your body), then let us stop arguing.

My basic point is, i do not want the man to control the woman's medical condition, whatever it may be. But then, i should also not be responsible for the consequences of her unilateral medical decisions. If she wants to enjoy the power to will the baby to not exist (a hairy debate in itself), then she should also take sole responsibility if she chooses to have the baby.

Put it another way, if the man wants the child and the woman doesn't, the baby will be aborted. If so, the man is also suffering the loss of the child. So if you are going to constantly introduce the notion of the fetus being a child, then the woman's unilateral decision also has serious adverse consequences on the man. So is that not unfair?"	1	0	stop arguing comment					"I'm pro choice for both father and mother. What I mean by this is, when a child is conceived whether intended or not the father is put in an awkward situation. My view is that if the father would like to legally disown the child before the 24 week abortion period have passed, he should be allowed to do so. This would except him from being forced to pay child support if the mother decides to keep the child, as well as dissociate himself entirely with the child. In the case that the father wants to keep the child but the mother does not, she could conduct this same procedure, and instead of being forced into abortion could simply pass the child to the father upon birth.

There of course are some flaws in this view but I believe overall it is better than the current system. It should also be noted that I am not some male rights activist trying to help deadbeat dads weasel out of child support. This system is a tool to help children being born who should have been aborted.


EDIT: Great responses reading through them now my opinion is very mixed but I'll try to respond in defense of this view regardless.

Procreation is today a matter of choice, more so than at any other time in history.  

If you do not WANT to have a child, there are MANY steps you can take in order to NOT have a child.  

Granted, most of those forms have a chance that they may fail, but the simplest means of a man choosing not to have a child is abstinence.  And,yeah, that does actually work.  

If the man DOES have a child, then that means he's already made a choice with the full knowledge that the result COULD be a child.  As the resulting consequences (aka ""Childbirth"") is borne entirely by the woman, the man's further choice in the matter is limited to his voluntary (or involuntary) involvement.  

For a man to choose to abandon his child, he puts the child at a serious disadvantage.  Children born to single mothers tend to be more likely to live in poverty, have fewer educational opportunities, are more likely to grow up in abusive households, and are more likely to be substance abusers.  (Note, this is a PROBABILITY.  We ALL know examples of people who grew up in difficult circumstances and succeeded. Don't go there.)  

The man, in abandoning his responsibility, puts the consequences of his actions squarely on the rest of society.  Whether he is involved in the child's life at all, the decision to extract monetary reparations for his actions is justifiable.  

He's a freeloader, and society has an interest (for the child, for the mother, for society as a whole) in not letting that happen.

The man is abandoning his responsibilities, period.  Whether the child is born or not is irrelevant.  

By engaging in a sexual act, the man KNOWINGLY puts himself in a situation where he could become a father.  A person does not get to decide that they're no longer responsible simply because they don't wanna.  

This is about accepting basic responsibility for your actions, period.  Everything else is trying to weasel out of that responsibility.

Sorry, i do not buy your argument. Responsibility comes with privilege. In this case, the man has no privilege or rights at all if the woman chooses to abort. She holds all the cards as far as terminating the pregnancy or  choosing to have the baby. If she has sole power to decide the fate of the unborn child, then she should also have sole responsibility.

Pregnancy is a medical condition that carries with it a substantial chance of complications and death.  
As the person who is not diagnosed with the medical condition, your rights to determine what happens to the person WITH the condition are zilch, unless you are the legal guardian/POA of said person.  
If you want the ability to dictate whether she has an abortion or not, does she get the right to determine whether you get a vasectomy or get castrated?

False argument. No one is trying to force her to do something she does not want to do with her body. 

Going along with your analogy, i am saying that someone else (the man) should not have to pay for the consequences of her medical condition. If you agree with the premise that everyone has sole right to their own bodies, then it follows that they have sole responsibility towards their own bodies and whatever comes out of that body or whatever they choose to do or not do with their bodies.

It is then false logic to assign this responsibility (of the consequences) to someone else. If this life threatening medical condition afffects the woman, then she has the onus to protect and safeguard herself from the threat to her life, just as she needs to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid certain foods etc to keep her body healthy. How can you make someone else responsible?

yogfthagen @ 2016-12-29 17:32:48 :

The man, in providing the sperm, holds a level of responsibility.  Period.  And you're STILL trying to weasel your way out of that responsibility by saying that you don't wanna be responsible.  

Too bad.  

Here's another legal example.  If a person is HIV positive, that person is under legal obligation to inform any possible sex partners BEFORE having sex.  If they do not inform, they are guilty of felony assault.  In this case, the sex partner provides the vector (HIV virus/sperm) that (infects/impregnates) the woman.  The woman then has to deal with (HIV infection that could lead to AIDS/pregnancy, possible abortion, raising a child, possible complications of that pregnancy including death). 

For pregnancy, the result of the sex act can be a child.  It takes two people to perform that sex act, so BOTH of them are responsible for the consequences, whatever they may be.  The woman has the GREATER responsibility because her LIFE is on the line.  No hyperbole.  Therefore, the woman has the greater responsibility, AND the greater decision-making power in dealing with it.  However, NONE of that absolves the man of his responsibility.  

| ...then it follows that they have sole responsibility towards their own bodies and whatever comes out of that body or whatever they choose to do or not do with their bodies.

Yes.  You do.  As soon as you choose to have sex, you are responsible for what your sperm does OUTSIDE of your body, too.  

--------------------------------

nomnommish @ 2016-12-29 23:22:20 :

I have tried explaining my logic a dozen times. You are again using a completely wrong and misleading analogy. I dare you to think beyond your moral boilerplate and look at what i am saying with an open mind. Then, let me know what aspect is weaselly.

Going along with your analogy, yes, if a man has HIV or an STD, he absolutely needs to inform his partner before having sex. Otherwise, it is indeed a felony.

However, what we are talking about is **not** about a man deliberately misleading a woman before or during sex. We are taking about consensual sex that is an informed and willing decision made by both parties. 

So the correct version of your analogy would be, if a woman knew her partner had an STD, and then willingly had unprotected sex with the man, is the man still accountable? Can the woman then claim that the man should pay her medical bills for the next 18 years??

Or another analogy: A woman decides and willingly chooses to have an alcoholic drink with a man. Or a narcotic. Or a man buys a woman a drink in a bar or buys her dinner.

And after that, they both part ways. Ad later, she suffers an alergic reaction or some other medical reaction from that drink or food that the man bought. Is the man responsible? (mind you, i am not talking about the man spiking her drink or lacing her food with peanuts if he knew she had a nut allergy).

My entire stand is that if the whole point hinges on the fact that a woman's right to her body is her sole and absolute prerogative, then she and she alone is also responsible for maintaining her own body, and that includes getting pregnant or not. If she chooses to willingly inject her body with sperm or medicine or narcotics, it is her decision and she alone has to bear the consequences of her decisions.

And i fail to understand what is the ""weaseling out"". If she went to a dude's party, chose to get drunk with his alcohol and then chose to drive home intoxicated and got arrested, is he responsible?

--------------------------------

yogfthagen @ 2016-12-30 02:25:35 :

You're still weaseling out of your responsibility.  

As it takes TWO people to conceive a child, the responsibility lays with BOTH people.  

If you do not want to have a child, don't have sex.  Really, it's THAT simple.  

What the woman does with the information that she is pregnant is her prerogative, and solely her prerogative.  But, should she carry through with it, then the responsibility of the child STILL RESTS WITH BOTH PEOPLE.  It takes TWO people to conceive the child the child's well being falls on BOTH people.  

The weaseling out is that you consistently say that you have ZERO responsibility because you don't get to make the choice FOR the woman as to whether to have the child or not.  

Again, your responsibility comes from YOUR CHOICE to have sex.  

The person you SHOULD be concerned with is THE CHILD.  Not the woman.  Not yourself.  THE CHILD.  

Without YOUR ACTIONS, the child would not exist.  Break the chain of events at the point you had sex, and the child does not exist.  

Creating a life is one of the most serious things a person can do.  Accept that.  And accept the fact that a woman that YOU impregnate may choose to KEEP the child.  

For the alcohol question, if she drinks too much and causes harm, then, yes, you actually CAN be sued in civil court for the damages that SHE causes, because YOU put her into a situation where it was reasonable to foresee that she could cause bodily harm or property damage.  



--------------------------------

nomnommish @ 2016-12-30 04:40:07 :

You are clearly preaching right now rather than talking logic. Lol you are actually saying that a bar is responsible for the actions of a person who chooses to come to the bar, get drunk, and then do something illegal later? That is the most ridiculous thing i have heard.

If you are willing to listen to logic, my point is this: If you think the man is also reponsible for making a woman pregnant, fair enough. Then my claim is that the man should also have a say in whether the woman can indeed decide to abort the child or not. As things stand right now, the woman gets sole exclusive right to decide what she wants to do with the pregnancy and the man is left twiddling his thumbs until the very end, when it is magically revealed if he is on the hook to fund a child for the next 18 years, or if the woman did indeed choose to abort and the issue became a non issue.

Does this make sense??

You were saying?  

As for the man having say in whether the woman aborts a pregnancy, you have not answered my question.  If YOU get to determine the medical decisions for the woman, why should the woman not get to determine the medical decisions for you? If she wants you to get castrated afterwards (to prevent you from impregnating and running away from other women) she should be allowed to do so.  

Otherwise, the medical decisions that a woman makes are the decisions she makes alone, for herself.  Your decision to not have children becomes the WOMAN'S decision the moment the sperm leaves your body.  

Don't like it?  Don't let the sperm leave your body.

You refuse to accept your responsibility as the father.  
Period.  
You are incorrect.  Legally and morally.  
The woman has a PRIMARY responsibility, as carrying the child to to term has direct, demonstrable risks to her health.  
You, as the person who GOT her pregnant, still carry SECONDARY responsibility.  
You do not get to absolve yourself of your responsibility because you don't want it.  
If the child could be transferred from her womb to your body so that YOU could carry the child to term, then it wouldn't be an issue.  However, that technology does not exist, would still be incredibly invasive (to the woman), and the woman has the right to refuse that invasive procedure.  
As your responsibility is SECONDARY, not PRIMARY, your choice is subservient to that of the woman.  

And you do not accept the fact that YOUR body produced the sperm, and that the actions of YOUR body are what got you in the position you are in.  

Yes or no.  Do you have responsibility?  

Yes or no.  Is your responsibility on the same level as that of the woman who can lose her life from the pregnancy?  

Yes or no. If the child is born, do you carry responsibility for raising that child?

Dude, don't get all heated up. You are completely missing my point.

My argument is, if we go by your level of ""fair responsibility"", fair enough. My only point is, ethically speaking, any level of responsibility has to be accompanied by the exact same level of power. Or the other way around. A certain level of power or privilege has to be accompanied by the exact same level of responsibility and added burden. 

That is the only way to run a somewhat sane and fair society. So my point is, if you expect a man to support a kid for the next 18 years of his life, then you need to give him the power of being able to control if the baby will be born at all, or will be aborted (aka extinguished) because of a *unilateral* decision of the woman.

My entire point is, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

--------------------------------

yogfthagen @ 2017-01-11 04:15:20 :

Because the woman is facing the possibility of medical complications and death with her end of the bargain, her consequences and responsibility are greater than yours.  

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy 

""In the immediate postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.[1][2] Long term health problems (persisting after 6 months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.[3] Severe complications of pregnancy are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US[4] and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada.[5] The relationship between age and complications of pregnancy are now being researched with greater impetus.[6]

In 2013, complications of pregnancy resulted globally in 293,000 deaths, down from 377,000 deaths in 1990. The most common causes include maternal bleeding, complications of abortion, high blood pressure of pregnancy, maternal sepsis, and obstructed labor.[7]"" 

What health risks do YOU carry, as the father? 

And if you think the father should get the power to dictate medical procedures done to the mother, then the mother gets to do the same to the father.  Castration, for example.  

Because you, the father, do not have to deal with the consequences of pregnancy, you do not get to make the decision on whether to carry the child to term.  

But you ARE still responsible.  If you didn't want to be in that situation, then you should have kept your pants zipped.  

It's not ""having your cake and eating it, too,"" it's being responsible for the consequences of your own choices and for the things that come out of your body.  As you don't get to dictate the medical choices of the mother, then your decision point is at the point of having sex.  

Don't want to have a kid?  Don't have sex, or get a vasectomy.  Those are the decisions YOU get to make, and the medical procedure YOU can take to prevent yourself from getting into that situation.  

Your choice is earlier than the choice of the woman.  But you still have choice, and you still have free will.  It is not unilateral.

nomnommish @ 2017-01-11 06:02:52 :

You're just ranting and not answering my question. If you say that my initial sperm contribution, on the iffy chance that it may produce a baby, holds me liable for 18 years of upkeep of an unborn human being - that is a mighty shit-ass level of responsibility. Then if that were indeed to be so, i would fully expect this mighty responsibility to be accompanied by mighty levels of power. And that *starts* from me being able to have a say if my future potential baby lives or dies.

If you so not agree to this statement, you are just a hypocrite.

Remember, this situation and debate arose because there was a disagreement between the wishes of the woman and the man. If they both agreed to have the child or not have the child, this entire debate is a non issue.

But because this is a disagreement, it has to be fair to both sides. Which means, if the woman chooses to have the right to kill the baby fetus, then she needs to bear the responsibility of raising the child if she specifically chooses to keep the baby.

The man's initial sperm contribution is literally chump change in the overall context of a timespan and econonomic expense spanning over 18 years. And at any rate, if you are going to hold the guy accountable for not using birth control, then the woman is equally accountable for not using birth control either. "

A college education is an investment in your future the same as buying into a franchise or stock.  That college education doesn't have to be expensive though.  Community colleges and state universities offer quality education for significantly less than a private school.

I graduated from an excellent, internationally recognized university with zero debt and was able to pay for it by working mostly at Home Depot.  

--------------------------------

SchiferlED @ 2017-01-11 15:59:36 :

A college education is different than a stock investment though, in that it actually requires your time/effort to be actively put into it and it directly benefits the rest of your society when you become more educated. In that sense it is perfectly fair to expect that society to assist in payment for the education.

--------------------------------

Vote-Turd-Sandwich @ 2017-01-11 16:22:15 :

I suspect there are a lot of people working in finance who would disagree with your view that stock investment requires no time or effort.

I also disagree that education necessarily directly benefits all society when you become more educated.  Certainly education is important up to a point but at some point I think we're just arguing because people who racked up debt don't want to pay it back.

You are twisting my words. We are comparing one investment to another. We are not comparing to the job of being an investment professional managing hundreds of investments. If you are just buying some shares in one stock and letting it sit until it gains value, that does not require effort on your part.

&gt;I also disagree that education necessarily directly benefits all society when you become more educated.

I don't think you can deny that the net effect of higher education is positive on society as a whole, and when you aggregate the effects of everyone getting an education, I doubt there is any individual who is not benefiting in some way. You can certainly pick out individuals who didn't take their education seriously and just went into debt, but that is missing the forest for the trees.

I agree with that up until a point.

It's certainly beneficial to have a (mostly) literate society but I see nothing that makes me believe requiring all people to complete at least two PhDs would be beneficial.  And I definitely see nothing that makes me believe we need to lower college costs because too few people are getting a college or graduate level education.  Shit, come to NYC and you'll likely be served in Applebee's by someone with a master's degree and zero job prospects.  I'm not sure how society is really benefiting from that. 

Now, to nitpick a little bit, you said society *directly* benefits when people get a better education but I disagree.  It's the doctor who *directly* benefits from his education and the added money he's able to make because of it.  Society is assisting in the payment of that education through significantly higher wages for the doctor.  As I said earlier, are we just arguing because because millennials who put themselves into debt don't want to pay it back?  I mean surely you're not suggesting those millennials who did get a better education have their incomes capped at minimum wage, right?

SchiferlED @ 2017-01-11 17:47:57 :

You are again missing the point. If you are going to compare a college degree to *an* investment, then compare it to *an investment*. You are going off topic by bringing up financial management in general.

&gt;but I see nothing that makes me believe requiring all people to complete at least two PhDs would be beneficial.

Why do you bring this up? It has never been my position that everyone should get two PhDs. Even if all college degrees were paid in full through taxation, it would not follow that everyone would get two PhDs, or even one, or even a degree period. Getting that degree would still require getting accepted to a college and all of the massive effort involved in completing the requirements. I am fully willing to admit that higher education is not for everyone.

&gt;I'm not sure how society is really benefiting from that. 

At the very least they are benefiting from having one more person around who is knowledgeable about more than they would have been without the education. This person interacts will other people and their conversations can lead to improving the knowledge of others. They probably also vote, so it improves the representation of informed opinions in government by some small factor. Societal benefit is much, much more than just what someone does at their job.

&gt; It's the doctor who directly benefits from his education and the added money he's able to make because of it.

Why do you not include the patients under ""directly benefits""? Why not the doctor's family and friends who also get advice from him? Why not the employer of the doctor?

No I'm not.  Financial investing is an investment. 

Whether you choose to spend your time and money on a business, college education, or buying and selling stock you are investing in your future.  All three take time and money. 

&gt;Why do you bring this up?

Because you've said things like: ""it directly benefits the rest of your society when you become more educated"" and ""I don't think you can deny that the net effect of higher education is positive on society as a whole"".  Even in the above post that I'm replying to you make it sound like you believe more education is always a good thing.  

I disagree with that.  I think education only benefits society to a point and after that point people are just kind of becoming over educated with little real benefit.  I also think we're at that point now so I see little reason to drastically change our education system to allow more people to get educated.  We're already having a difficult time finding jobs that actually require a college education for people who have a college education - much less masters degrees, etc. 


&gt;At the very least they are benefiting from having one more person around who is knowledgeable about more than they would have been without the education. This person interacts will other people and their conversations can lead to improving the knowledge of others. 

I think you're stretching the boundaries of ""benefiting society"" awfully far when you say society benefits from having a waitress be able to tell you about art history while she passes you your fries. 

&gt; They probably also vote, so it improves the representation of informed opinions in government by some small factor. Societal benefit is much, much more than just what someone does at their job.

This sounds like partisan nonsense to me.

An unemployed 20-something with a degree in art history might be more likely to vote for candidates *you* support than a 50-something air conditioning technician without a college degree but I'm not sure that actually means they're voting for better candidates. 

&gt;Why do you not include the patients under ""directly benefits""? Why not the doctor's family and friends who also get advice from him? Why not the employer of the doctor?

Because the patient doesn't directly benefit by the very definition of [DIRECTLY](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=directly+definition).  Nor do the doctor's friends, family, employees, etc.  All of those are [INDIRECT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=indirect+definition) beneficiaries. 

Again, and I've brought this up a few times now, are we having this conversation because some millennials don't want to pay their bills or because there's a need beyond that?  It seems to me that the people directly benefiting society are being compensated significantly better than those who did not get an education.

&gt; Whether you choose to spend your time and money on a business, college education, or buying and selling stock you are investing in your future. All three take time and money. 

The initial comparison was a college education to a stock investment. Then, you chose to change it mid-conversation to include stuff that completely changes the analogy. I'll try to just end this part of the conversation now by saying that the key differences between a higher education and a run-of-the-mill investment are at the heart of this conversation, thus the analogy is meaningless and diverting attention from what matters.

&gt;We're already having a difficult time finding jobs that actually require a college education for people who have a college education - much less masters degrees, etc. 

This is more of a problem with an archaic ideology regarding employment. And, again, the benefits of education extend far beyond what is done at work.

&gt;Because the patient doesn't directly benefit by the very definition of DIRECTLY. Nor do the doctor's friends, family, employees, etc. All of those are INDIRECT beneficiaries. 

Whether you consider it ""direct"" or ""indirect"" is rather open to interpretation. Regardless, it is irrelevant to the conversation. The important factor is that it is providing a benefit, and a significant one, and you have at least acknowledged this. Why does everyone else get to benefit from the education of others without helping to pay for it?

&gt;This sounds like partisan nonsense to me.

&gt;An unemployed 20-something with a degree in art history might be more likely to vote for candidates you support than a 50-something air conditioning technician without a college degree but I'm not sure that actually means they're voting for better candidates. 

I wasn't really trying to make this partisan. Again, looking at the aggregate and not the individual. More informed voters means better results in politics. That's not a partisan statement at all. If it leads to politicians that I disagree with gaining more support, then I'm probably less informed than I think I am. I can get into my political leanings if you want, but I don't think it's necessary.

&gt;are we having this conversation because some millennials don't want to pay their bills or because there's a need beyond that?

I'm having this conversation because I care about the future of this country and humanity in general. I care about crafting a fair society. I've finished my higher education and am less than a month away from paying off my loans. I would not immediately benefit from higher education being covered for everyone else, but I would absolutely benefit more in the long-term (along with everyone else), which is what really matters.

You're equating ""more informed"" with having a degree when having a degree doesn't necessarily mean you're more informed about anything at all, much less politics.

Because I don't believe that's especially true.

You already gave me the example of a waitress with an art history degree being able to talk to customers about art while she brings them their Diet Cokes.  I don't see that as a benefit to society.

Someone with a college degree might be more informed in **what their degree is in**, although even that is hardly written in stone, but to say they're more informed *overall* is ridiculous.  Completing an art history degree gives you no special insight into electrical engineering, medicine, law, teaching, comic book collecting, organic chemistry, or accounting.  Your belief that those with degrees make better political choices than those without is based on nothing more than your own political views.  

&gt;No, not ""save"". I want to improve. I want to increase the rate of technological and social progress, rather than stagnate (or regress).

And what exactly makes you believe our progress is being stagnated or regressed because too few people are getting undergrad or graduate degrees?

If we're seeing any problems with college today it's that far too many people are going.  There just aren't nearly enough jobs that actually require graduate degrees for everyone with graduate degrees to be employed in a way that utilizes those graduate degrees.  Spending more money so even more people can obtain graduate degrees is only going to exacerbate the problem.  Doing so will do nothing more than increase the amount of waiting staff, retail employees, etc. making roughly minimum wage with a masters degree.

While you discount the experiences of non-college graduates as being immaterial to being ""informed"" that's based on nothing more than your own political beliefs.  People who don't go to college aren't living in a vacuum.  They're experiencing things too and becoming more informed as well.

If it leads to a more enjoyable experience for the customers, that is a benefit.**  You directly - oh wait, you don't know what that word means - referenced an individual case.  I simply responded to your own response. 

&gt;No. It isn't. Stop avoiding the argument and actually put forth something, or admit that your view is flawed.

It is partisan drivel.

You very clearly stopped learning the day you left the classroom - if you ever learned there at all - but most people don't. Your continued insistence that someone not in the classroom isn't learning something isn't an example of my flawed argument.  It's an example of your political biases. 

&gt;A more appropriate summary would be ""People who go to college are more informed on average than people who don't, and being more informed leads to various societal benefits (not limited to employment)"". I fail to see how that is a flawed assumption. I apologize if that is too complicated to understand, but I don't see how I can make it more clear.

But they're not more informed.  This is little more than you telling me your political party is right and mine is wrong. That's all this is and I'm done responding to you.

If it leads to a more enjoyable experience for the customers, that is a benefit. You directly - oh wait, you don't know what that word means - referenced an individual case. I simply responded to your own response. 

This whole point of yours is pointless as I have already explained (because you are cherrypicking an example that fits your view and ignoring cases where you are wrong), but I'll explain anyways. When you created this example, you neglected to state that the customers were annoyed by the conversation about art history. That completely changes the context of the example. I'm only responding to this to try to help you realize why you should not do this in future examples, not because this even matters for our argument.

&gt;Your continued insistence that someone not in the classroom isn't learning

I never insisted such a thing. You came to that conclusion about my statements based on flawed logic and misunderstanding of my points. I have already explained to you how your understanding of my points is flawed and you are merely attacking a strawman at this point.

&gt;But they're not more informed.

You really think that non college grads, on average, are exactly equally (or more) informed than college grads on average? If this is the case please confirm. I can end this argument now and be happy thinking you are just willfully ignorant and not worth my time.

&gt; This is little more than you telling me your political party is right and mine is wrong.

I never brought up political parties. If you must know I identify as independent and don't restrict my votes to any party line."

I do not have an issue with people disagreeing with him. However, I am a very opinionated person myself and I engage these people on facebook when I disagree with what they are saying. For example, today (and the inspiration for this post) a friend of mine posted a screenshot of a conversation which boiled down to this:

Women are expected to change for men. If a man wants kids and a woman doesn't, the woman is expected to have kids. Man wants X, woman wants Y, man gets X.

I pointed out that men go through this too. I pointed out other inequalities that men experience. I was disregarded as an asshole, as someone who didn't have sympathy for my friend who went through this experience, and as someone who just wanted to hurt people to get his point across.

It didn't matter to her that I felt like my sex was being marginalized by petty nonsense - I pointed out that men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide. I pointed out that men are 3 times more likely to be assaulted in public. I pointed out that men receive longer prison sentences for the same crime, and I pointed out that male domestic abuse victims are not taken seriously. I even provided studies and sources for all of these statistics. None of that mattered. I was an asshole for doing exactly the same thing she did: pointing out an experience that my sex has to go through. Her post was celebrated, my rebuttal was admonished.

My feelings didn't matter, and they never have. That was just one example. It doesn't matter to her, or to society at large that these inequalities against men exist. There are no mens-rights-activists in office, or if there are, they are making their activism public. Yet feminism is still regarded as a proud label and no woman in office would dare deny being a feminist.

Some of these ideas and concerns are kind of our responsibility. 

Men do far more violent crimes then women. 

So sure, we are the victims of violent crime, but we also do more of it. 

Men are far less likely to seek out counseling services that are available.   This is still this tough guy narrative that lots of men buy into. 

There is still the idea that if men show certain emotions they are weak and this is usually maintained by other men. 

If a man is feeling suicidal and doesn't seek out resources that are available  that's different idea than the one that was expressed in your FB example. 

The man isn't getting his opinion overruled.

The reason men are afraid to look for help is because they are afraid of judgement.

Take this example:

Men who contact abuse hotlines are not taken nearly as seriously as women; 64% of men who called an abuse hotline were told that the hotline only helped women and 32% were referred to another hotline; of those that got through to a hotline, 69% found the hotline to be ""not at all helpful"", 16% said that the person on the other end of the call ""dismissed or made fun of them"", one man said: ""They laughed at me and told me I must have done something to deserve it if it happened at all.""
Another man said: ""They asked how much I weighed and how much she weighed and then hung up on me...I was told by this agency that I was full of BS.""
Another: ""They told me women don't commit domestic violence -- it must have been my fault.""
Another: ""They accused me of trying to hide my ""abuse"" of her by claiming to be a victim, and they said that I was nothing more than a wimp.""
Another: ""They just laughed and hung up the phone.""
Another: ""They didn't really listen to what I said. They assumed that all abusers are men and said that I must accept that I was the abuser. They ridiculed me for not leaving my wife, ignoring the issues about what I would need to do to protect my six children and care for them.""

Academic feminism is the source of the wage gap, rape culture, patriarchy, toxic masculinity and the rest of concepts that tumbrl feminism abuse, and the theories are as unproven and antiscientific as tumbrl feminism. You only have to take a look at academic feminist studies like and weep.




--------------------------------

Personage1 @ 2017-01-13 14:31:52 :

....so could you explain what it is that academic feminists actually say about some of those topics?

Like what do academic feminists say patriarchy is? How does it work according to them? To make it simple, I think r/askfeminists has a good understanding of academic feminism, so what's an explanation that you could walk into that sub with and the users would generally agree with? I'm also interested in more than just a definition, as knowing a definition of something does not guarantee understanding.

I ask because the single most common response I see feminists give anti-feminists is some form of ""that's no what that/they mean/are saying."" If you don't know what feminists are actually saying about things, then how can you know that those things are wrong?

--------------------------------

miope @ 2017-01-13 17:25:10 :

The definition of patriarchy: Cultures where men act as oppressors of women. 
For example the rape culture : Rape culture is a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality. 
Academic feminists in academia are saying that patriarchy and rape culture exist in western countries. And I think that those things are wrong.

Well, they made a claim here:

&gt; Rape culture is a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality. Academic feminists in academia are saying that patriarchy and rape culture exist in western countries.

And then personally disagreed with it:

&gt; And I think that those things are wrong.

I think that claim can be held up to scrutiny. I suspect they have both their understanding of the issue incorrect and their opinion of the existence of the phenomena in reality incorrect, and if they're unable to show that, we can dismiss it as, well, incorrect.

--------------------------------

Personage1 @ 2017-01-13 18:06:52 :

But they didn't actually demonstrate an understanding of rape culture with that sentence. By asking for evidence against it, you open the door for them to provide evidence against really anything, at which point you would have to go back and check on their understanding of rape culture anywats, except you've wasted time by humoring them first.

Perhaps we just have different argumentative tactics. If I were to claim they had a misunderstanding in the first place then we'd be stuck in a semantic game. I hate debating semantics — it gets nobody anywhere. So I'm playing the benefit of the doubt in the hopes that they were able to provide solid, sourced, academic quality evidence to support his notions. If they deliver, great! We can talk. Or debate the study/data.

&gt; Don't engage with the arguments until they show they even know what they are arguing against.

In general I agree but I've had too many arguments that get stuck in semantic hell. If its true that they don't have a clear understanding of what their talking about then we'll easily be able to dismiss their evidence or they won't be able to find anything corroborating.

Cheers!

**edit:** Plus its a nice way to elevate the discussion. Let's get straight to the data rather than dicking around with what two (likely) non-academics *think* of the issue.

I struggle with this a lot - and I go back and forth between the u/Personage1 and u/FliedenRailway approach. On one hand, it feels useless to try and engage with someone who doesn't have sufficient understanding of the theoretical underpinnings. On the other hand, if we didn't engage at all then a lot of this drivel would go unchallenged in forums (fora!) like this. 

The real bitch of it is the people who do not sufficiently understand the material still *think* that they do. Arguing with someone who is confident, wrong, and oblivious all the same time takes a lot out of you.

Personage1 @ 2017-01-13 21:09:21 :

I want to pitch one point in favor of my approach, which is that I am absolutely still engaging. If the anti-feminist had provided anything resembling more than just a definition (they even said, ""here's a definition"" and nothing else) I would have been very accommodating to make sure that I fully understood what they get feminists mean by patriarchy.

While I admit I'm expecting anti-feminists to not be able to actually give an explanation for feminist terms, if they do then I will engage.

FliedenRailway @ 2017-01-13 21:14:31 :

Fair point. That's also the other point of getting to the 'next' stage. There's a sales tactic that says each party should try hard to get to a 'no' answer as quickly as possible so as not to be wasting each others time on something neither wants. Thats sorta how I view it: if we can quickly dispel the misunderstanding via facts, then the argument can continue — or not.

FliedenRailway @ 2017-01-13 21:16:43 :

No. It's an issue because it is inescapably true that the idea that any quality at all means a person has to date you is nonsense.

I also think the same about people who oppose free speech advocates objections to encroachments on free speech on the grounds that 'it only applies to government interference'.If the best justification you can find for suppressing free intercourse is that it technically not covered, this is a pretty poverty stricken basis to object with.

Free Speech is an open philosophical debate about the place,limits and substance of free speech within a society..it is not just a textbook technical definition.The legal definition which differs from place to place is the current state of the deadlock and official consensus but in any given society there are significant minorities who want to expand or clamp down completely on free speech.

There are lots of reasons to find the desire to suppress free expression of thought objectionable even if plausibly moral reasons are given for doing so:

1.Clampdowns always ultimately impact the powerless and minorities more

2.Clampdowns are almost always turned directly on minorities as soon as possible

3.The ability to even articulate the objections above and the ones to follow are obstructed or made impossible by restrictions

4.The premise of 'unacceptable thoughts' is a recipe for generating dishonesty, even in otherwise decent people

5.Explicit refusal to tolerate unpopular views creates backlashes that usually become conservative and reactionary

6.A narrow technical understanding and application of free speech is not supportive of the entailing principles..truth,truth to power, probity of institutional power, expression of psychological and cultural diversity etc

1. I don't think your characterization of the ""nice guy"" phenomenon gets to the heart of that issue. The quality being argued for is not as important as the faults of the idea that any quality entitles a person to the attention of another person.  
It's a problem of understanding the free will of other people, more than of damning oneself with faint praise.

2. Beyond its legal definition, what impingements on your definition of free speech do you see? Which of them can be protected legally without impinging on the legal rights of those who oppose the speech in question?

This certainly would expand out into a much more complicated matter if we try to unpack the original constellation of arguments around the so-called nice-guy phenomenon.For example, it is not clear that women are particularly unentitled towards men, they just feel entitled to different things, or they can get things without the entitlement showing, or the typical range of men don't have enough value for them to matter enough to be entitlements and so on.

&gt;Beyond its legal definition, what impingements on your definition of free speech do you see? Which of them can be protected legally without impinging on the legal rights of those who oppose the speech in question?

You're not making any sense here.

None of my argument changes at all if the genders are reversed. The problem with the idea that any particular quality entitles one to the attention of another person is that the other person is free to make their own decisions. They don't have to date you even if you're rich, hot, kind, and talented. They decide who they date, and any appeal to any trait is doomed to fail.

&gt;Do people have a right for others public speech acts not to be audible to them?

They have the right to try to make it that way, yes. They don't have the right to enforce it legally, in most cases.

If you'd answer the question about examples, I could explain further.

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 13:05:44 :

&gt;None of my argument changes at all if the genders are reversed. 

Thats because you are talking about it in principle rather than in practice.The objection to entitlement comes as a result of what men do in practice.People see the removal of the principle as the means to change the practice.

There are a million reasons why women don't act in some of the ways considered 'entitled' that men do. But, it really requires more nuance to see why we are seeing things wrong. There are a class of men who are treated like attractive, but otherwise ordinary young women- men who are groped, put on a pedestal, have unrequested bodily offers and favors thrown at them, genital pics sent to them and so on: celebrities, footballers,athletes,rock musicians, actors, that is, men who are 1 in a million. Most men just dont have the kind of value that would cause women to treat them in this manner, a much larger group of women do, vis a vis men.

ITs also not true that women are not entitlement minded. Women spend somewhere in the region of 80% of household income in most relationships, you would only see the 'entitlement' if you started pushing back on things like that..its there, trust me.

'They don't have to date you even if you're rich, hot, kind, and talented. They decide who they date, and any appeal to any trait is doomed to fail.'

Yeah but this knocks the legs out from under feminists who complain that women over 40 are invisible or gay black men who complain that gay white men dont want to date them. 

Its actually an interesting case study because in the past 10 years Ive seen maybe ten articles in major E news sites complaining about white men not wanting to fuck black men, but I never see them complaining about women, and its clear why, women would go apeshit if they were told they need to include anyone else in their standards other than what they want, gay men get the short end of the stick precisely because mens choice is not as respected.

Also, the 'entitlement' mindset is intimately linked to the 'just world hypothesis' that most people react to dating debates with, i.e. work on yourself, improve yourself, chad has better social skills etc...effectively there is some just reason why you were not chosen, rather than the freedom you speak about, which means anyone can choose anyone for any reason which is not the same as just deserts.

I feel we are in an interesting conversation but very tangential

Tarantio @ 2017-06-18 13:34:53 :

This is not part of the argument. I am not saying that women don't do this. There is no need to prove that they do.

What did that poor straw man do to deserve this?

&gt;&gt;'They don't have to date you even if you're rich, hot, kind, and talented. They decide who they date, and any appeal to any trait is doomed to fail.'

I'm so glad we agree! 

&gt; but this knocks the legs out from under feminists who complain that women over 40 are invisible or gay black men who complain that gay white men dont want to date them.

While the arguments are similar, it's worth noting that one claims that a quality should mean that they should have romantic partners, while the other claims that a particular quality should not be so disqualifying. That's important when it's the difference between saying that Jenny should date me because of my personality, and saying that Jenny is biased for not dating me because of race. Both are poor arguments, but the first disregards the Jenny's power of choice completely, while the latter simply attributes nefarious motivations to Jenny that may or may not be true.

That's more distinction than we really need, though. People get to make their own decisions about their relationships, even people with objectively incorrect views. 

(Aside: I've noticed you're using a lot of negative stereotypes about women. I think you should stop. It's really easy to be wrong when you generalize.)

&gt;I feel we are in an interesting conversation but very tangential

Why don't you answer my other question? That was closer to the topic you asked about.

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 13:42:55 :

&gt;while the latter simply attributes nefarious motivations to Jenny that may or may not be true.

It doesnt matter.ITs not the subject of moral censure. Theres nothing moral or immoral about ruling out redheads, or men with bellies, or guys who dont know how to dress, or ....pick a trait.SEizing on the moral implications of someones sexual choices implies that the public can extend influence rightfully on who you ought to share your genitals with, but this is obviously preposterous. People can complain all they like but just as angry nice guys cannot demand access to sunkissed sorority girls, middle aged women, or black men cannot demand access to whiteboys asses.The reasons are just not relevant as it is beyond good and evil, so to speak.

&gt;Both are poor arguments, but the first disregards the Jenny's power of choice completely, while the latter simply attributes nefarious motivations to Jenny that may or may not be true.

The distinction is not as clear as you think it is. 'Nice guys' are also a social stereotype partly informed by sexual stereotype informed ideas of what being masculine or a good man or a good partner ought to consist of, these men are lambasted for being 'childish' or 'broke' or 'not upfront' or 'lacking confidence' and so on. Excluding nice guys as a TYPE of person is not as dissimilar as it appears.

&gt;I've noticed you're using a lot of negative stereotypes about women

--------------------------------

Tarantio @ 2017-06-18 14:01:06 :

You're mostly arguing for things I explicitly said in that post. Both of those arguments I gave as examples are poor arguments, and the distinction is more than we need.

However...

&gt;The reasons are just not relevant as it is beyond good and evil, so to speak.

Racism is evil. If dating patterns are a result of people largely making judgements based on racial stereotypes, it's not wrong to point that out. It is wrong to assume without basis that a decision about a relationship is based on racism, and it is wrong to assume that a romantic preference for physical traits is a result of a generalized opinion about people with those traits, and it's wrong to use any of this as a argument about what a particular person should do with their genitals... but there is a place for what's left.

&gt; 'Nice guys' are also a social stereotype partly informed by sexual stereotype informed ideas of what being masculine or a good man or a good partner ought to consist of, these men are lambasted for being 'childish' or 'broke' or 'not upfront' or 'lacking confidence' and so on. Excluding nice guys as a TYPE of person is not as dissimilar as it appears.

Who excludes ""nice guys"" as a type? People are judged based on their actions and their physical characteristics. ""Nice guys"" don't have defining physical characteristics. The issue is that there is a misunderstanding about what sort of actions are causing the problem in the romantic arena. My argument is that it's the actions that disregard the agency of the object of their romantic desires.

&gt;Try to criticise some common male gendered behaviour without invoking stereotypes

I believe it's what I've been doing this entire time.

Are you not going to provide examples of free speech being violated?

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 14:14:53 :

&gt;If dating patterns are a result of people largely making judgements based on racial stereotypes, it's not wrong to point that out. 

It is.WE are not in a position to challenge peoples reasons for dating one person or another because it implies there is an authority which can scrutinise or call into question who you date (consenting adults). There isn't. The idea that Racism is evil, and dating patterns might be evil implies that some people are entitled to preferred dating patterns based on different choices by daters, but this is an abrogation of the very freedom you are arguing for. Its also an intrusion of public citizen ethics into private irrational choices. 

&gt;and it's wrong to use any of this as a argument about what a particular person should do with their genitals... but there is a place for what's left.

This distinction does not exist in reality.The main evidence people adduce to demonstrate racism in this example is the dating choices or preferences and the main evidence theyd accept to the contrary is changed dating preferences so in practice its ultimately going to be about who people choose to date or be attracted to. Thats where the war will be fought. Besides, the choices people make about attraction (and I use the word choice facetiously) are far more insane than race exclusion...people who get off on feet, or very specific physical traits, or animalistic abusive men or..take your pick.

Sexual choices are just a really bad ground on which to hash a debate about racism on, partly because you almost always end up arguing entitlement to other bodies and to other peoples choices nd partly because almost every other arena of debate about race is less obscured by legitimate personal objections to encroachment on  private decisions.

&gt;Who excludes ""nice guys"" as a type?

Feminists, pseudofeminists, lots of regular gals

&gt;People are judged based on their actions and their physical characteristics.

But you already admitted in the case of women choosing and not being confronted by entitlements, that in the case of sexual selection, women base it on whatever tickles their fancy, not some righteous decent public appraisal of behaviours.

&gt;My argument is that it's the actions that disregard the agency of the object of their romantic desires.

Psycho-sexually this is somewhate inevitable.There is always some enmeshment, some overlap in the attachment relationship between a dyad. I woudnt use that to justify everything and anything but its just how humans are, even the people who try the best to be goody two shoes have irrational desires to merge with their partner at times or have desires or fears that go beyond the partners-really existing disposition.

Which really brings me to the problem at the heart of all this. Social justice was traditionally about how people treat others as respected equals in relationships that are civil...personal private sexual and romantic desires are just not the right place to fight this battle, its clear as day that romance is not a democracy and no one is entitled by law to your affections, and thats true even if you want to date a racist.

Tarantio @ 2017-06-18 16:18:22 :

&gt;WE are not in a position to challenge peoples reasons for dating one person or another because it implies there is an authority which can scrutinise or call into question who you date (consenting adults). There isn't. The idea that Racism is evil, and dating patterns might be evil implies that some people are entitled to preferred dating patterns based on different choices by daters, but this is an abrogation of the very freedom you are arguing for. Its also an intrusion of public citizen ethics into private irrational choices.

I do not agree with those implications. I explicitly denied them. You don't get to say that my argument implies something I explicitly stated as incorrect application of my argument.

Acknowledging that racism is evil and plays a role in how some people date does not mean that anyone's relationship is wrong, or that there are particular other relationships that need to be formed. It's just the inescapable conclusion based on the facts involved, and an advocate of free speech such as yourself should recognize that.

&gt;The main evidence people adduce to demonstrate racism in this example is the dating choices or preferences and the main evidence theyd accept to the contrary is changed dating preferences so in practice its ultimately going to be about who people choose to date or be attracted to.

Again with the stawmen. Racism has an impact on dating because racism has an impact on everything. If you can prove racism doesn't play a part even one aspect of society, that'd be a fine starting point to proving that racism doesn't play a part in dating. You can't.

&gt;Feminists, pseudofeminists, lots of regular gals

What evidence do you have that these groups of people exclude ""nice guys"" as a type, rather than on an individual basis in each case?

&gt;But you already admitted in the case of women choosing and not being confronted by entitlements, that in the case of sexual selection, women base it on whatever tickles their fancy, not some righteous decent public appraisal of behaviours.

I've agreed that women are not perfect, but that does not mean you can attribute any pattern you want to those imperfections. 

I'm not sure what you mean by ""some righteous decent public appraisal of behaviours,"" but as the only thing ""nice guys"" have in common is their dismissal of their targets agency, any pattern of refusal is justified and nothing to be upset about.

&gt;Psycho-sexually this is somewhate inevitable.There is always some enmeshment, some overlap in the attachment relationship between a dyad. I woudnt use that to justify everything and anything but its just how humans are, even the people who try the best to be goody two shoes have irrational desires to merge with their partner at times or have desires or fears that go beyond the partners-really existing disposition.

This is nonsense, and has nothing to do with what I said. The disregard of agency is specifically with regard to who the other person dates. You can't pretend this is something happens in every relationship, because it doesn't, and because most of the times this happens *there is no relationship.*

&gt; Social justice was traditionally about how people treat others as respected equals in relationships that are civil...personal private sexual and romantic desires are just not the right place to fight this battle, its clear as day that romance is not a democracy and no one is entitled by law to your affections, and thats true even if you want to date a racist.

I agree, and I feel I've already made this clear, that I'm not arguing for changing anyone's decisions on who to date.

YEs but attraction and even heterosexual love is, in a formal sense 'evil'..it is not a moral act and it is not based on morality. I don't think who you or I or anyone else is attracted to is anyone else's business..and I don't think the study of attraction patterns as part of a moral crusade is appropriate in an area that is openly not moral, and secondly is by definition nobody else's beeswax.

We discriminate against all sorts of things in attraction and those discriminations..would be considered both evil and relevant in some contexts but not relevant when it comes to attraction which is off-limits.

&gt;Racism has an impact on dating because racism has an impact on everything.

I think I am seeing a totalitarian vibe here

&gt;but as the only thing ""nice guys"" have in common is their dismissal of their targets agency

I don't think whiny guys that cant get laid have much power to take away anybodies agency.I dont think womens agency is dependent on what some guys who cant get laid or can barely make friends or get a job happen to think or say about her.My agency is not that fragile THANK FUCK

In my first reply I said I was wary about this because it is such a huge issue, you were free not to pursue it at all

&gt;To dismiss is not to take away. It is to act as if it doesn't exist.

Can we cut the crap.The only reason the 'agency' thing is such a big deal is because of the 'importance' of female sexual selection, it cant  have escaped your notice that its mostly not men complaining about too many women hitting on them, or in the wrong way, that women are pickier and choosier, that womens sexual choice is often taken as a proxy for a mans other qualities (hence nice guys being considered losers)..and so on

Essentially the attack on nice guys has legitimicay but its such an obvious case of punching down that if anyone else was doing it people would be embarassed to pile in, since it is so akin to jocks beating up spindly nerds at the lockers in school."	"polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 19:40:44 :

&gt; You brought up ""nice guys,"" but you had a completely incorrect idea of what the core issue is with the mindset. That's what I've been trying to change your mind about, since you refuse to talk about anything else.

I'm not stupid.I'm fully aware of what you are trying to claim is the most salient issue, I'm just disagreeing with you that it is the major issue. 'entitlement' only obtains in a world where people have something that someoen else wants.

For example, there has been a conservative minded discourse about welfare seekers being 'entitled' pretty much since the early 1990s ..because the parties that represent weaalth HAVE WEALTH and dont want to give it to the poor.The argument is framed as mainly being about entitlement because it is framed by the people with wealth.

You'll notice that virtually no nice guys are complaining about women being entitled to or acting entitled to their bodies..or for that matter any women hitting on them or begging them for love sex or intimacy...the thing that would give them equal experiences and also 'level up' in such a way as to support empathy would be women having as much vested interest, explicitly expressed in love, sex and relationships with 'nice guys' but since this is not the case, we are left with a conversation framed by the people who have the sexual capital and the ones who want it.

There is an attempt to obscure this because of the way men occupy more positions of power but it is largely irrelevant given that in the world of sex, men are the ones on the wrong end of the stick.

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 19:42:48 :

To put it in other terms, 'acting unentitled' is a nice idea but its not an idea women are beholden to when they actually want something themselves.

ACting entitled is an expression of weakness not power, the demand that men not act entitled is basically saying I know you lack sexual power but I dont even want you to even express that.

&gt;They have the right to try to make it that way, yes. They don't have the right to enforce it legally, in most cases.

Oh you mean this? I can understand customs, social norms prohibiting people from saying things to each other but thats different to rights which are legal

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 19:50:58 :

Arguably on grounds of principle, the nice guy is 'wrong' but he is on the wrong end of a power divide, he wants something she has and is usually in some sense out of his league, so technically she can punch down on the sad sack with her principle, but due to the dynamic, yeah technically she is right to criticise him but lets say there is a list of worthy causes, her cause is so far down the list I don't think the stars will eve align in such a way as I would actually enthusiastically way in on the mewling crowd attacking the loser in sheeps clothing in question

Why does it matter whether women are ""beholden to"" act a certain way? We're discussing what's wrong about a particular action, not other wrong things that other people do.

&gt;ACting entitled is an expression of weakness not power, the demand that men not act entitled is basically saying I know you lack sexual power but I dont even want you to even express that.

What other reaction could such an approach possibly bring about?

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 21:55:00 :

Its kinda weird, liberals understand how the high falutin principle thing doesnt work in some areas but in others they are  blind to it.For example, its a liberal commonplace that theres no point in teaching abstinence since teens are gonna have sex anyways...but then you say well wait, theres no point in teaching consent courses because rapists are gonna breach consent anyways and they flip out.Theres no magic law that says the desire that leads to consensual sex is more compelling to consenting parties than the desire for non consensual sex is to perpetrators, yet they abandon the previous logic and insist on an opposite principle. The fact that people think consensual sex is not that bad, or is ok or even good is beside the point, what is in question is whether people can exercise control over sexual urges or not.

--------------------------------

Tarantio @ 2017-06-18 22:15:55 :

Your premise is false. People don't object to teaching abstinence, they object to exclusively teaching abstinence. Every school in the fucking country tells their students that abstinence is the only sure way to avoid STDs and pregnancy, and that's not a problem. The problem is the schools that don't also teach how to have sex safely, because the results are always worse for the student body.

--------------------------------

polysyndetonic @ 2017-06-18 22:17:48 :

The argument given to support not teaching abstinence only is that teens will have sex regardless. Not sure why you are sidestepping that.

--------------------------------

Tarantio @ 2017-06-18 22:25:53 :

Some will, but that's not a reason not to teach about abstinence- it's a reason not to fail to teach about protection.

But I was right, and experience is absolutely relevant in this discussion. After all, your argument didn't have a leg to stand on and yet based on that you were sitting on your high horse trying to tell me I don't belong in this sub as if you're some sort of CMV expert. 

&gt;The OP posted about travelling specifically as a woman, you posted a link that had absolutely no relevance to that view. 

Again, you are wrong and I keep having to correct you like a broken record. OP didn't feel comfortable travelling as a woman because of Iranian culture, and my counterpoint was for her not to judge a book by its cover and counter her discomfort by being more open and adventurous. How you think that's irrelevant is honestly beyond me. 

Regardless, *even if I didn't* address her point specifically, my comment would still be valid nonetheless in this sub because like I already said, **you will see that more awarded deltas are based on the commenter introducing a differing view than one that the OP considered in their original argument.**

I don't know if it's your english comprehension or what... but pretty much everything you've said to me is incorrect. Please stop arguing for the sake of arguing.



"	1	0	stop arguing comment					"My partner wants to go to Iran for a week and is trying to convince me it's a good holiday destination for culture and history. I don't doubt this. However I'm under the impression that women in Iran are viewed as second class citizens which does not sit well with me. 

First of all, I've never properly visited the middle east and my knowledge of Iran is limited, so I'd love to be proven wrong on any of my points. From asking some friends and family and looking around a little on the web, it's my understanding that I will be expected to wear clothes outside of my comfort zone (covering my legs/head in the heat does not sound fun), will not be able to hug/kiss my boyfriend in public without potentially offending locals (not that I'll particularly want to but i would like the choice to do so without having to worry about doing so without thinking) and may get treated in a way different to what I am used to simply because I am a woman. 

My motive for not going is fed both by a morality point of view (I strongly disagree with the way women are still not seen as equals and by visting the country and funding them via tourism I am somehow endorsing this) and from a comfort point of view (I want to relax on holiday and don't want to have to worry about whether what I'm doing or saying is upsetting people). CMV! 

EDIT: If it makes a difference, I am a white British female and my partner is a white Jewish male.

EDIT 2: My mind hasn't been this stimulated in quite a while - thanks everyone! It's bed time for me but I'd love to continue the discussion tomorrow. I've definitely had my mind opened a bit more to the idea of going. Thanks all, night night!"	"jsfly @ 2017-09-02 15:39:05 :

I remember watching a youtube series a while back. It was a guy on a motorbike travelling across asia and the middle east. I think he went thought China, Pakistan, India, Iran... whole bunch of countries. He met a lot of assholes along the way, but in Iran everyone was welcoming and giving him gifts and fruit everywhere he went. He notes how surprised he was at the way he was treated in Iran compared to other countries. 

Anyways, the point is don't judge a book by its cover. Don't listen to news stories or what people say based on rumors... go there and see for yourself. I mean yeah, you could go off to thailand and chill at Khao San road with the thousand other tourists bumming around... but I believe the point of travel is to experience new things, which means getting out of your comfort zone and going down the road less travelled.... because that's where the real adventure lies.

You wrongly assume every OP will encapsulate the full breadth of differing perspectives on the their chosen topic when they make a post.

What could go wrong right? It's a canned response about travelling in general and has no relevance in this discussion in my opinion. You seem to be a proponent of the 'see what sticks, maybe I'll get a delta' approach, where I am not. We just absolutely see this totally differently it seems. 

Let's not stoop to insults though, eh?

By the way, in response to your assertion that I'm totally wrong, and you right, check the op's reply to your own first post.

It's a valid response given the lack of travel history in the initial post and given the amount of tourists out there who feel like they're adventurous milling about in tourist traps all day. This isn't a warzone or some unstable place, it's just Iran. Your opinion is noted and dismissed. 

Listen, for a guy who discovered this sub 2 weeks ago, this certainly wasn't my best effort at a CMV. But seeing as how you've made assumptions about me based off one comment string, I feel obliged to do the same.

Given the fact that you've shifted your position from ""I've not addressed her point at all"" to now ""I have addressed her point, but with a canned response"" and given that you tried to get me to google some logical fallacy you read on wikipedia, it's clear to be me you're just someone who gets off on having trifle debates with people over nonsense. Absolute rubbish. You're not here to change anyone's view, you're just here to look stupid. And before you start feeling insulted, let me assure you that it was an even greater insult to me. It was an absolute insult to my intelligence to even have this conversation with you and I should have never responded to you in the first place.

What I'm saying is, if getting fooled forces you to question your sexuality, the reason you are questioning your sexuality is because you believe trans people will somehow make you gay (or whatever else is a change to your orientation; Bi, straight, magical unicorn).

So, to me it just seems wrong to not tell the person your actual sex before engaging in intimacy.  If I identify as a straight man, and you present yourself as a straight woman, but you were born a man, it seems very deceitful to not tell me that before we make out or have sex.  You are not respecting my sexual preferences and, more or less, ""tricking"" me into having sex with a biological male.  

But I'm having a lot of trouble analogizing this.  If I'm exclusively attracted to redheads, and I have sex with you because you have red hair, but I later find out you colored your hair and are actually brunette, that doesn't seem like a big deal.  I don't think you should be required to tell me you died your hair before we make out.  

If I'm attracted only to beautiful people and I find out you were ugly and had plastic surgery to make yourself beautiful, that doesn't seem like a big deal either.

But the transgender thing just feels different to me and I'm having trouble articulating exactly why.  Obviously, if the point of the sex is procreation it becomes a big deal, but if it's just for fun, how is it any different from not disclosing died hair or plastic surgery?  

I think it would be wrong not to disclose a sex change operation.  I think there is something fundamental about being gay/bi/straight and you are being deceitful by not disclosing your actual sex.

Change my view.

&gt; But the transgender thing just feels different to me and I'm having trouble articulating exactly why.

Because, at some level, you don't see trans people as ""really"" how they identify. That's pretty much always what it is, and you more or less say it outright.

Not that that's necessarily your fault - you live in a culture that is only just coming around to this issue. While it'd be great if you could just change how you felt, it isn't always that easy, so sometimes you'll have shitty emotional responses to things on which you've changed your mind intellectually.

It's kind of a hard issue to respond to, because I basically think you're being shitty here but in an understandable way I don't want to be too harsh on. It's the difference between moral ideals and the practical standards we apply to human beings just trying to get through the day. So while I *am* a woman, and presenting myself as such is *not* 'tricking' anyone, I can understand why and how you feel that way and I don't think you're some sort of ogre for it. Does that make sense? I think this issue basically just gets solved by generational turnover where the next generation or two gets more comfortable with the idea, in the same way that, say, a lot of people today probably have leftover racist attitudes they can't help but feel but aren't passing on because they know those views suck.

&gt; I think there is something fundamental about being gay/bi/straight and you are being deceitful by not disclosing your actual sex.

My boyfriend is a straight guy. I am a trans woman. He doesn't become not straight because he likes me, because his romantic and sexual attraction to me is as the woman that I am.

-----

On a practical level, though, virtually all trans people disclose to their romantic and sexual partners early on. I'm in a pretty small minority in even thinking it's not a moral duty to do so (though I still do for purely practical reasons). In a poll I ran on /r/asktransgender a few years back, more than 70% said they had a moral duty to disclose and another 20-some said they did so even though they didn't feel a moral responsibility for it. Polls are noisy, especially on frequently-trolled subs like /r/asktransgender, so even the 5% who said they didn't should be taken with an *extreme* grain of salt (that's smaller, for example, than the % of people who say Nazis are pretty cool or that lizard people rule the earth).

--------------------------------

EverybodyLovesCrayon @ 2017-09-12 22:13:58 :

Yes, but, on some level, a trans person *isn't* really how they identify, right?  The person still has a biological sex that isn't the same as their gender.  Just like someone with died red hair isn't actually a redhead, at least not biologically.

I appreciate you not thinking I'm a dick even though you find my view grotesque.  On one hand, I don't see the difference between not disclosing trans status and not disclosing other types of plastic surgery/died hair.  But I just have a weird gut reaction about it, which, like you said, is probably just a product of my conditioning.

It's funny, because, now that I think about it, a trans woman is probably more a woman than a person with died red hair is a redhead since being a woman is the trans person's fundamental identity and possibly a result of having a ""woman's brain"" whereas a person with died red hair probably just likes the way it looks (i.e. as far as I know there is no difference between a ""brunette brain"" and a ""redhead brain"").

--------------------------------

Maxbillblake @ 2017-09-13 14:00:47 :

Yeah, but engaging sexually with a redhead and finding out she dyes her hair the next morning won't have you questioning your sexuality the rest of your life. 

You're not wrong. 

And it's not politically incorrect to want to know something like that up front. It's a huge part of their lives and if they don't say something about it, then they're not being true to themselves. It takes a lot of dedication to transition. 

And... just to preempt the downvotes, I don't have any prejudices against trans people. I'm married with children - sex doesn't concern me anymore.

This is a good point.

--------------------------------

influenzadj @ 2017-09-13 16:46:24 :

Sort of. Why are you questioning your sexuality?

Because you're afraid having sex with a trans person changes your sexuality. This is rooted in fear and is not rational. A pretty strong argument could be made that this is the literal definition of transphobia.

Edited to add: I hope this doesn't read as overly aggressive, it isn't meant to be! 

--------------------------------

Maxbillblake @ 2017-09-13 16:51:13 :

Not really. I'm not phobic. Just not interested in having sex with a transgender person.

Jesus Christ. What ever happened to liberalism?! I can understand why the right is so fed up with the left.

influenzadj @ 2017-09-13 17:22:47 :

Yikes man. Assumptions. Easy. 

Just answer it logically: why would you be questioning your sexuality? 

Here's a hint: not wanting to have sex with a trans person and having done it shouldn't make you question your sexuality. It can frustrate you, it could leave you feeling deceived (which is a topic of a whole stream of this thread that I'm not discussing at all in any way), or even angry. But why would your sexuality suddenly be up for debate?

Literally the answer is that you are afraid that having sex with a trans person fundamentally changes your own orientation. This is not a logical position to hold, and is very clearly stemming from an irrational fear - that having done something with a trans person will change *who you are*. 

--------------------------------

Wholly_Crap @ 2017-09-13 17:37:26 :

&gt; why would you be questioning your sexuality?

Because he would have just had sex with another man. That's the crux of it. A trans woman is not actually a full-fledged woman. She identifies as one, wants to be one, and has had surgery to make herself as biologically close to one as (medically) possible, but she's *not* a woman. I fully support the rights of people to do what they want to with their bodies, and I'm happy to treat trans people with respect and to honor their choice, but I don't want to have sex with one. Given the natural aversion straight males have toward sex with other males, it would be deceitful for a trans woman to have sex with an unsuspecting straight male without telling him she was born a male too. We should have the choice of whether we want to engage in sex with a trans person, and tricking someone into sex with what he thinks is a ""woman"" seems like a pretty shitty thing to do."	"Wholly_Crap @ 2017-09-13 17:50:19 :

You have a point there. I think they would rightly feel angry and deceived, but it would not give them any valid reason to question their own sexuality.

--------------------------------

influenzadj @ 2017-09-13 18:21:09 :

Exactly. 

If you are *questioning your sexuality*, it is because of transphobia (an irrational fear of trans people having a power to change your sexual orientation through deception), not because you're angry about deception. They're separate (and hey, could be related - you could be angry because you're transphobic too! But not necessarily), but the questioning line of thinking or justification has pretty strong roots in fear.

Whattahei @ 2017-09-13 19:25:02 :

If I had sex with a biological man, of course I'll be asking myself ""am I gay for having sex with another man that I thought was a woman ?""

Not irrelevant. Literally, it's the topic.

Do you think that gay men who have sex with women (perhaps because they didn't realise they were gay) turn straight?

Orientation exists separately from acts. If you'd truly been gay, you wouldn't have been attracted to anyone who looks like a woman to begin with.

Whattahei @ 2017-09-15 02:37:59 :

When did I said that being fooled was what makes me question my sexuality ? I said that I'll be questioning my sexuality if I've just had sex with another man.

Whattahei @ 2017-09-15 02:47:51 :

Oh so now you can't be confused about your sexuality after *enjoying* having sex with someone that turns out to be a dude ? 

--------------------------------

influenzadj @ 2017-09-15 03:31:32 :

Why?

I'm guessing it's because you think fucking a man is going to change your sexuality.

throwaway2964k @ 2017-09-19 03:07:11 :

Not if the enjoyment stemmed from them looking like a woman.

I'm a gay guy and I'm not attracted to trans women because they look like women, smell like women (after HRT), identify themselves as women and live as women, and I'm not interested in women. So the implication that enjoying sex with a trans woman might make a man gay or confused about his sexuality honestly baffles me.

Personally, sex hormones and the resulting pheromones play a big part in attraction for me, and I think most people as well. If a trans woman on estrogen is emitting female pheromones and telling your lizard brain that this is a woman, you'd *need* to be straight in order to feel attracted."

Now stop arguing with me lmao	1	0	stop arguing comment					"Apple Inc. used to be a pioneer of technology in the late 20th century with the Macintosh computer and iPod devices, but today they have become a company that relies on inferior rehashes of old technology that they deem as ""innovative"" and market for much more than what they are actually worth. 

A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack. Removing a smartphone component and replacing it with wireless earbuds that are much easier to misplace, AND requiring the user to purchase a separate lightning-to-3.5mm adapter that costs $10 and is described as ""fragile"" and ""poorly made"". One could say that this is intentional and forces the user to spend more money to replace these parts once they break or are lost. 

Now let's look at the software. Mac OS is exclusive to Apple products, which forces me to pick up one of their $2000+ Macbooks if I want to even touch their operating system. People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows, but having used Windows, OS X, and Linux, I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers, Linux is superior, with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.

Compatibility between hardware and software is also an issue. Apple has specifically designed it such that their devices will only function with THEIR equipment. Want to add some songs to your iPhone? Better open up iTunes! Need a new cable? Time to go the Apple Store!

But people will still buy it, because it's Apple, after all. They want to walk around with their fancy white earbuds and their Apple-branded bottles and T-shirts. The company has done such a great job at establishing their brand image over the last few decades that they can send out overpriced, mediocre products and still make money. People are so distracted by the brand that they fail to see this. Apple knows that they will always have dedicated consumers who throw money at them, and as a result, they no longer feel the need to innovate when they can recycle the same concepts year after year. 

EDIT: After reading some responses, probably the one that changed my view the most was that if a person sees an item as being valuable, they are justified in spending money on it. In this case, the demand for an Apple product is not so much the brand image as it is the perceived uses of the product from the perspective of that person. Therefore it is not ""overpriced"" if people *are* willing to pay that much for it. 

Anyway, these comments have provided some new perspective for me. I probably won't get through all the responses but you can consider my view at least somewhat changed. :)

Anyway, one thing that confuses me is that some of the people supporting Islam were claiming that opposing Islam makes somebody racist. Some believe that criticising the beliefs of Islam, the ideas of Islam, etc. (not criticising a person based on their race, colour of their skin etc.) is racist. I don't understand that logic, because Islam is a religion, not a race. 

Not to mention, if someone opposes other religions, for example Christianity or Buddhism, they aren't told they're racist, so why can people say if you oppose Islam you are racist?

I won't tolerate ideologies that spread falsehoods or ideologies that tell people to do immoral things or preach immoral messages. I can explain my reasons for my intolerance towards these harmful ideologies: it's not just some kind of bias I've inherited from my culture. Furthermore, I would think very little of people who *did* tolerate ideologies like this. I have no time for those who support fascism, or think that white people are superior to other races, or believe that the earth was formed a few thousand years ago.

To be clear, when I say ""I won't tolerate"" I don't mean I wish to take legal or physical action against people who subscribe to an ideology I don't agree with, just that I disapprove and would wish to use education to change minds in the other direction.

You see this as a counter-argument, I see it simply as you defining a term differently than I do.  If it helps, I can switch terms for you in this thread.  I'll just concede that ""fundamental value"" means whatever you think it does.  Go back in all my posts and replace ""fundamental value"" with ""Snord value"".  My definition of ""snord value"" is the estimate of an asset's value using only inputs that do not include the current price of the asset, the past prices of the asset, or information about who is currently willing to buy or sell the asset at set prices.  ""Snord value"" can be estimated based on a wide variety of other information, including economic indicators, prices of other assets, replacement cost of an asset, productivity of an asset, risk-free interest rates and other estimated required rates of return, arbitrage-free relationships, etc.  

That way we can stop arguing about what the word ""fundamental"" means and start engaging on the meat of the argument instead."	0	0	stop arguing comment					"Bitcoin is currently trading at $8145.  At the beginning of the year it was around $1000, at the beginning of 2016 it was about $500, and of course a few years ago it was around $13.

It is unclear to mean how I could quantify the intrinsic value of a bitcoin, even within a huge range, like say an order of magnitude.  Should its value be closer to $1,000/BTC or $10,000/BTC?  I have little way to tell.

One tie into fundamentals is the cost of mining bitcoin.  However, apparently [hobby mining has been reasonably profitable at least since BTC was around $2500](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-surge-is-making-hobby-mining-profitable-again/).  Besides being empirically refuted, there are other reasons to doubt this method of estimating bitcoin value.  First, the creation cost of a bitcoin only says something about a ceiling on its value -- if it costs more than that amount, it ought to entice people to start mining bitcoins, adding to bitcoin supply and reducing prices, but if bitcoin prices slip below this value there is no market mechanism to bring them higher.  Even as a ceiling, it is still flawed: buying bitcoin miners upfront is an investment with obvious risks, so your expected profit from mining would need to be a pretty high rate of return at current prices to heavily increase the rate of mining.  Also, the fact that eventually there is an absolute cap on outstanding bitcoins implies that this price enforcing mechanism has an expiration date.

So what we are left with is an open market for bitcoins trading in US Dollars, which certainly shows the clearing level in supply vs demand today.  But an answer that references supply and demand will not change my view.  When I say fundamental value, I mean something independent of the current price and the price history.  I'm looking for an indicator that would tell me today that bitcoin is way too cheap if its current price was $100 and $100 was the all time record high, and that would tell me that bitcoin was trading way too expensive if its current price was $100,000 and it had been at $10,000 a year ago, and $5000 a year before that etc.

P.S. -- Only tangentially related to this point, I also see bitcoin as having questionable qualitative fundamentals as a currency.  Currencies can be evaluated based on their usefulness as a store of value or medium of exchange.  Bitcoin's exchange rate versus other currencies is extremely volatile, undermining the idea that it is a secure store of value -- its value could be doubled or halved in a matter of weeks.  As a medium of exchange, I cannot use it most places I transact in dollars.  Even where it can be used, the transaction process is for the vendor to convert the dollar price of goods to Bitcoins at the current exchange rate, and exchange your bitcoins into dollars as soon as the transaction takes place.  So its value as a medium of exchange is derivative from dollars too.

PPS -- This problem does not apply to international fiat currencies to the same degree, because of international trade.  The spot exchange rate of two national currencies is a supply/demand equilibrium, just like bitcoin.  However, if US Dollars suddenly only bought half as many Euros as they used to, US demand for goods made in the EU would fall, because those goods would suddenly cost more USD.  Meanwhile Europe would have higher demand for suddenly cheap-in-EUR US-made goods.  The US would build a big trade surplus with Europe.  As goods flow from US to EUR, capital used to purchase those goods would flow from EUR into USD.  That flow drives up the spot price of USD/EUR, enforcing a return to an equilibrium range of exchange rates.  This works for international currencies because there are huge numbers of people who make all their purchases in USD and never in EUR, are always paid in USD and never in EUR, and don't have the easy option to switch purchasing currencies at a whim.  This set of conditions does not apply to any cryptocurrency: there is no sizable community of people whose income and expenses are all in bitcoins.

How is the ""fundamental value"" of anything determined?

Others have said, and I will also argue, that ""fundamental value"" for *any* product or service is determined solely by what people want - and prices for all traded goods directly reflect an approximation of their ""fundamental value"".

You've raised some counterarguments to this claim. Before I look at some of them, let's look at this:

&gt; When I say fundamental value, I mean something independent of the current price and the price history. 

The ""fundamental value"" is *how much people want it*. That is, at its core, independent of the current price and price history. The value of bananas, Bugattis or Bitcoins is, fundamentally, how much people want them.

The main way people *reveal* how much they want something is by the price they are willing to pay for it - usually in terms of money, but sometimes the price is in terms of time, other bartered goods, or suffering. 

&gt; I'm looking for an indicator that would tell me today that bitcoin is way too cheap [or] way too expensive [based on the price history]

Unfortunately, this is difficult; without an fMRI machine you can't peer inside people's heads - for many goods, the way to find out how much people value it is to inspect the price they pay.

People pay $8000 for Bitcoin today. The people buying it value a Bitcoin more than $8000, the people selling it value a Bitcoin less than $8000. At least some people value a Bitcoin and $8000 about the same. 

Now, two of the objectiosn you raised to the idea that ""price"" reflects ""value"":

You note that Bitcoin's price fluctuates greatly, and you conclude that the ""price"" can't be an indicator of ""fundamental value"". The fallacy here is assuming that ""fundamental value"" can't fluctuate wildly also, though in fact it can. Remember, ""value"" is ""how much people want it"" - and the fact is, people ""want"" Bitcoins more now than they did a year ago. One reason people might want Bitcoin is because they *expect* prices to increase in the future, relative to other ""investments"". In 2016, a Bitcoin was a commodity whose price was only slowly increasing. In 2017, it's a different thing altogether, the price doubling every 4 months. 

Fundamental values (how much people want something) can change rapidly. This rapid change will be reflected in the price. 

You also assert that for goods that get used, you can measure the ""value"" some other way. You used oil as an example, stating you can estimate prices from extraction costs, etc.  However, the price of a barrel of oil is still, fundamentally, determined by its value (how much people are willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it). It's value is determined by how much people actually want it, not by extraction costs. All extraction costs are is another form of ""price"" - an answer to the querstion of how much the oil company is willing to pay to obtain oil. Once the money has been spent and the oil is available for sale, the price no longer depends on the extraction costs - it depends solely on how much people are, in aggregate, willing to give up in order to obtain it.

Well, the only real indicator that could tell you this for *any* commodity is 'if it cost that much, everyone would start buying it a ton until the price reaches equilibrium at it's current real value.'

That *is* a supply &amp; demand answer, but supply &amp; demand answers are the *only* answers that can tell you what the efficient price of something is.  Just because we can say 'oh, gold can be used in computer chips' or whatever, does not mean that examining the real value of computer chips will let you predict the price of gold.  That price will always depend on supply and demand, and may be heavily detached from real value.

Lets try another analogy: what is the 'real value' of 1 US dollar?  From one perspective, the answer is 'basically nothing', because the paper itself isn't very useful.  From another perspective, the answer is 'one McChicken sandwich', because I can trade a dollar for a MchChicken.  However, it should be understood that *this is a supply and demand explanation* for the value of a dollar; the equilibrium point between the demand for McChickens and the demand *for dollars* is at $1, which is how the price gets set.

Similarly, it is wrong to sa ythat 'the price of Bitcoin won't equilibriate because people don't use it as a currency enough'.  Even if we understand Bitcoin purely as a commercial good, the prices of all commercial goods *do* equilibriate, through the normal process of deciding which things you would rather spend your limited money on.  If the price of Bitcoin was higher than 'what it is worth', people would choose to buy shoes and boats and things rather than Bitcoin, until the price of Bitcoin fell to where people start buying it again.  You don't need international trade for this to work, just a normal diverse market economy.

&gt;That is a supply &amp; demand answer, but supply &amp; demand answers are the only answers that can tell you what the efficient price of something is.

That is true for some things (i.e. your example of gold), but not true for others (i.e. a shoe factory, a McDonalds franchise, General Electric, the ratio of Euros to Rubles, the value of a barrel of oil).  I spelled out the example for other currencies in some detail.  I guess what you are saying is that bitcoin is more like gold than like Euros in this sense.  That's fine, but it reinforces my view rather than changes it.

The value of a U.S. Dollar, denominated in the currency of any other sovereign state, can be related to trade balances, cost of labor in each country, cost of capital and return on capital on each country, money supply and money supply growth in each country, etc.  

In common parlance of investing, even in currency markets, there is a difference between ""fundamentals"" and ""technicals"" as they are most frequently discussed, and that is the exact distinction I am mirroring here.  You can choose to define terms differently if you'd like to, but I""m not going down that road.

You don't need international trade for this to work, just a normal diverse market economy.

No, people are not deciding whether to have a bitcoin or shoes, that is ridiculous.  People use bitcoin as an alternative to other stores of value (i.e. currencies, securities, real estate), which gets us back into the discussion of your first paragraph that I quoted above, and my response to it.

--------------------------------

InazeaAnazasi @ 2017-11-20 22:37:41 :

I don't understand your example in the first paragraph. You seem to contend that a barrel of oil has a value on its own - but which? Any thing's value is only relative - i.e. can only be expressed by using other things. When you ask for a 'fundamental value', you seem to imply that there is one thing which has immanent value, but there is none. Its the same for bitcoins as for any other currency and any other things which people may or may not choose to use as currency: its worth is determined by how much people are willing to give for it."

"	"Gloriouscdmaster @ 2017-11-25 15:19:24 :

We’ll I strongly disagree. Once a transgender is legally a man or a woman, he or she benefits from the same protection under the law as everyone else. So preventing a trans woman from competing under her new gender is, simply put, illegal. 

Furthermore, I think that what the ICO does, which is to bar athletes from competing on the basis of hormones levels is illegal as well. If it were legal, then there would be a biological definition of gender, which because it isn’t biased, would supersede sex reassignment. Which in turn, would make the legality of administrative sex assignment impossible. 

More worrisome, would be the constant legal challenge - based on biological trait - to trans people.  The law would suddenly be amenable to changes, that would jeopardize the status of trans leaving among us, who all of a sudden, would become men or women because elected officials have decided otherwise.

Once a person is allowed to change his or her gender, there should be no physical or biological reason to prevent him or her from doing so. Only a repeated, constant demand to change from one gender to another should be required to avoid frivolous behavior. 

As a result, once the change is legally made, he or she should be allowed to enjoy the right, and responsibilities that the law provides, like anyone else.

Trans women must be allowed to compete, without restrictions, just like female born athletes. 

Edit: Adding this to make my point more clear, as it seems my opinion is divisive : I’m arguing on the basis of law, the consequences of not following established law, and not morality, unless someone can show me why sport associations are exempt.

Therefore either a legal gender is a reasonable divide for sports and we accept the consequences of that OR we establish new ways to segment competing populations (quoted from the_mighty_skeetadon)

Medarco @ 2017-11-25 15:59:35 :

That seems absurdly abusable. China already has/had some shady practices when it comes to elite athletes. Imagine if they can now ""allow"" (force) male citizens to ""legally identify"" as female in order to compete in the Olympics, and easily crush the competition. 

Furthermore, after reading other comments from you, it seems you aren't really basing your view on anything factual or empirical, which can be pretty dangerous.

Gloriouscdmaster @ 2017-11-25 16:12:50 :

Your answer, besides bordering on ‘straw man fallacy’ is absurd. First off, I base my argument on laws passed by a democratic state, where people are free to vote. You may not like the way people vote, or the democratic process, but that’s how it works. 

Second of all, in what way is this dangerous? Laws are made to be amended, that’s how societies evolve, and this has been the source of significant progress for everyone. 

Last, are you saying that a trans woman isn’t woman enough? How does that better society when someone arbitrarily decides who a person is?"	"Gloriouscdmaster @ 2017-11-25 16:44:09 :

I am actually arguing the OP’s point, on its legal standing, which is the most important one. The fact that laws can be changed, is the reason why our societies are progressive. We as a whole, can change bad laws, that’s my point. 

What happens in China is the result of bad laws that nobody can change through a democratic process, not the result of  a democracy behaving like a dictatorship. But ‘what about China?’ isn’t an argument. 

Barking ‘Stop arguing that point’ doesn’t seem to be democratic anyway.

--------------------------------

Gloriouscdmaster @ 2017-11-25 17:14:59 :

My point, once and for all, is: it is illegal under the law, to discriminate on the basis of gender. That’s what the law says. So trans women must be allowed to compete with women athletes, once they have legally changed their gender to females.

You can segregate on gender - the Boy Scouts, girls only colleges- but you can not prevent a person from practicing any activity on the basis of gender.

So just read up the comment chain. Stop arguing in circles it's boring.	1	0	stop arguing comment					"In my travels through the internet I've read plenty of times the argument that taxation is a form of theft on the part of the government. I honestly think that this idea springs from a failure on the part of the educational system to explain how democratic societies work.

I can only talk about the education I had, so I think it's appropiate to point a few details. I'm from Argentina, where the Ministery of Education dictates what topics should be adressed during our 6 years of secondary school. From years 2-5 we have a subject called Citizen and Ethical Formation which focuses on teaching human rights, forms of discrimination, how the constitution and our goverment works, etc. 

So, one of the big points we are taught when it comes to taxation is that it is necesary for a society to function, a country can **not** rely solely on it's industry and exports to mantain a good level of life for its citizens.

To me, this idea that taxation is theft shows how little people understand about societies and how they function, but there may be a detail I'm missing, like political leaning or personal prejudice.

Anyway, I would like to hear specially from any American that thinks this way, almost every time I read about this argument it seems to come from our neighbours up north."	"TalShar @ 2017-12-04 14:48:14 :

I'm going to take a crack at this and approach from a different angle than the top comments did. Also it looks like you had your view changed somewhere in this, but I don't see a sticky from /u/DeltaBot, so maybe you should consider handing out deltas, if only to help people find persuasive arguments.

Everyone seems to be making the point that a society without taxation could theoretically work, and I see a lot of rabbit trails devolving into a discussion about why taxation isn't theft. 

Let me explain to you why I feel it *is* theft, though theft of a (questionably) necessary nature.

To put it simply, while I am okay with being taxed, I never explicitly agreed to it, nor do I have the option of retaining what things belong to me by right without continuing to pay my taxes. If I stop paying my taxes, someone will come and forcibly repossess my possessions without my consent (that is, steal them). My land, my personal effects, everything I supposedly own, can be forefeit if I fail to pay my taxes. 

So we are at an impasse. If the government can come in and take what is mine, either that is theft, or I don't really own anything; I am only using those things I am said to own at the government's pleasure.

It shouldn't be too hard to see why people might not be happy with the latter explanation. 

Then we get into the argument of ""But you receive a service for your taxes."" This is true, but it is somewhat of a red herring to this argument; just because you get something back doesn't justify the fact that you are being robbed to begin with. 

People will also try to argue that we agree with an implicit contract by engaging in commerce and/or just by living in this country. To that I have two rebuttals.

Rebuttal one: To a Libertarian (or, one might argue, to any decent human being), implicit consent is *not a thing.* If you don't want to participate in something, you don't participate in it. If you are going to be held to doing something, you have to explicitly agreed to that. Implicit consent isn't a thing for sex. It shouldn't be a thing for money.

Rebuttal two: There is no alternative. You can't be said to have a choice in a matter if there is only one choice. There is nowhere that your average individual could go where they would be free of the burden of taxes. The argument of ""if you don't like it you can leave"" doesn't fly for the ""taxation is theft"" crowd any more than it does when someone says it to an individual who is unhappy about the results of an election. The simple fact is that no, a lot of us *can't* leave. 

It would be different if there was a ""no tax"" option. This would be totally infeasible (thus why I agree taxation is necessary despite being theft), but the argument of consent could be made if there were an option to opt out of taxes on an individual basis. Don't need fire rescue services? Don't pay the fire tax. No ambulance if you have a heart attack? Don't pay the EMS tax. Etc., etc. Again, this is not feasible, but if it were magically possible it would at least provide an alternative, and people who are arguing that taxation isn't theft because we have a choice in the matter would have a leg to stand on.

TL;DR: Taxation is theft because it is enforced through coercion, and there are no practical alternatives to paying your taxes without having your rights violated.

--------------------------------

skyner13 @ 2017-12-04 15:14:32 :

!delta You do present some valid points, in order for me to debate them I would need to read my constitution and how it presents taxes. I'll get back to you once I do, your points seem to be logical.

--------------------------------

throwaway_the_fox @ 2017-12-04 22:56:02 :

So here's the million dollar question: what makes that property *yours.* Where does private property come from? What is the relationship between private and public property? Who *gave* you that property.

The answer is: society. You are part of a social compact. Everyone in our society agrees to recognize that certain kinds of property are privately held, and that that private property entails certain rights, however, those rights are not unlimited. 

When a bunch of English people came to North America in the early 17th century, they had charters from the king giving them exclusive rights to hold property under English authority in North America, both individually and collectively. At the same time, North Americans recognized that property in land had to be acquired from the Native Americans by just conquest or by purchase. So, before John Smith could buy land, the English empire had to establish its sovereignty over that land. For the British Empire, two ideas coexisted uneasily: that sovereignty came from the King via divine right (as in old-regime France, say), and that sovereignty came from the people and was entrusted in the king. In the United States, we believe that sovereignty derives from and rests in the consent and initiative of the governed, but is nonetheless entrusted to the government by the constitution.

So, everyone in our society agrees to constitute a government. The government's right to tax you comes directly from the United States constitution (and the constitutions of each state). That constitution begins, you may remember: ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."" That constitution goes on to explicitly grant Congress the right to levy taxes: ""The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States."" In other words, if taxes are stealing, you are stealing from *yourself,* because in the United States government proceeds on the basis of the consent of the governed.

Libertarians take an extreme individualistic view of society. They believe that if they have not *personally* consented to an arrangement, then it is not fair for them to be held to it. This way of thinking is very cogently set out in the top comment of this thread. This way of viewing the world, as appealing as it may be, is sort of delusional. Because the very rights they value so much--the right to *hold property,* the *existence of private property at all,* the idea that certain things belong to certain people because of certain rules--all that comes from the social contract. The *same* social contract that gives rise to the government. 

TL;DR: taxation is not stealing because property rights are themselves a product of the social contract, just as taxation is.

--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-04 23:43:30 :

If your rights are derived from the social contract, then you don't have any rights unless your fellow members of the contract grant them to you, and any rights you do have may be taken away at any point if the majority of your peers decide you should no longer have them.

You are arguing that same-sex couples don't have the right to get married unless their country's laws allow it. You are arguing that murdering people for homosexual acts is okay, as long as you're within the borders of a country that allows such a thing.

Rights are not derived from the social contract - they are inherent. We form social contracts to *protect* those rights.

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 09:55:13 :

If rights were inherent they wouldn’t need to be enshrined in constitutions and defended and protected by the law.

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 14:15:26 :

If you and I are in the middle of the desert, there is no one there to protect you from me or me from you. There is no government.

Do we still have rights? Or do you believe either one of us could straight-up murder the other one, and there's nothing wrong with that, since there's no one else around?

If you and I and someone else are stranded on an island, and there's no one else but us three, there is no government. Do we still have rights?

What if the three of us start voting to make our decisions? Now we have a government! What if that government decides that you, Luso, need to die because you're being annoying?

You chew with your mouth open and it is so upsetting to the other members of the society that it's time for you to stop existing.

Did you have the right to be alive before we got to that island? Did you have the right before we all started voting and made that our de facto government?

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 14:19:11 :

If I’m alone on an island with someone willing to kill me I’m not going to appeal to his sense of civic duty to protect me.

Confused by why you’re asking if it’s wrong. Something being wrong to do isn’t about rights. I think it’s wrong to fuck a mates girlfriend but I wouldn’t say I was violating his rights, government or not. Rights are about protections of freedoms, without a government to protect these freedoms they don’t exist.

--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 14:32:02 :

So you truly believe that you don't have any rights unless a government gives them to you?

So if we're on a desert island and two of us decide that we're going to eat you to survive, you're cool with that? You have no problem with that, because you don't have the right to not get eaten unless the government grants you that right?

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 16:39:42 :

Read my comment again mate I went over that rights are not a moral code but a state sanctioned protection of freedom. A moral code can be derived from many things, often religion for example, but rights are not morality.

No I don’t want to be eaten. If someone tried to eat me I’d kill them. Because I’m an animal with a self preservation instinct. Nothing to do with rights or not:

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 17:05:26 :

I can't tell if you're quibbling over semantics, or if you don't believe there's morality outside of governmental strictures.

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 17:16:02 :

Morality exists outside of government structures. Rights don’t as they only exist by definition when enshrined in a constitution and protected. It isn’t semantics. The fundamental property for a right to exist is a mechanism that protects it and a social contract that agrees to its validity.

Moral codes are independent and belong to each individual but that determines how you act to others not how others act to you.

--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 18:18:30 :

You're a moral subjectivist, then? So murder isn't wrong as long as the murderer believes it's okay to kill?

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 18:26:45 :

Depends what you mean by that. I don't think its right because it violates my moral code. He wouldn't think other things I do are right. Which is why we would have to discuss and agree upon what was acceptable and unacceptable behaviour within our little society, thus creating a social contract and rights. But I don't think that rights or morality exist in a vacuum.

--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 18:56:17 :

Does your moral code trump my moral code?

If we were in a ""state of nature"" with no social contract, would you have the right to remain alive and un-murdered? Or do you only have the right to life if you and I discuss and agree upon it? 

What if there are three of us and two of us believe that killing you is wrong? Is it okay for us to kill you because it falls within the social contract?"	"BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 19:29:27 :

You haven't answered this all already, mate. All you've done is describe what you believe your actions would be in this hypothetical scenario.

You've made it clear that:

*Your definition of a ""right"" is based on a social contract.

*You believe there are things that aren't protected by social contracts that you believe to be ""wrong."" (Fucking your mate's girl.)

*You believe that people have differing moral codes.

You have not made it clear whether you believe a person has the right (or whatever you want to call it) not to be killed outside of a social contract.

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 19:30:21 :

Well seeing as rights don't exist outside of it no. But they are free to try and defend themselves and I'd think the people who killed him with no reason are cunts.

--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 19:32:34 :

But what you think only matters to you, and doesn't matter to anyone else, because we're all entitled to our own code of morality and no one is beholden to anyone else's code?

You also haven't answered this: if the social contract we both fall under declares that I may kill you, is that okay? You have no quandary with that?

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 19:47:55 :

My sense of self preservation is greater than my sense of morality. I’d do immoral things to protect myself if absolutely necessary. 

Obviously to me my moral code is the most important, what even is your point?

--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 19:53:08 :

You keep talking about actions - I'm talking about morality.

I'm talking about whether people have rights outside of what their government grants them. You seem to believe that individuals have zero rights unless those rights are granted by a government. You don't believe people have the right to not get murdered unless everyone else within their geographic region decides they have that right. If a cultural majority decides that the cultural minority should be eradicated from the earth, you are ready and willing to sign off on genocide because you don't believe those people have the right to live. The social contract they're all operating under has decided that people who are like X don't get to live anymore and that the people who are like why have every right to murder them.

I absolutely do not understand your position.

--------------------------------

LusoAustralian @ 2017-12-05 22:17:01 :

&gt; I absolutely do not understand your position.

That much is obvious if you think I'm advocating for genocide. 

Tell me what is the use in separating morality from reality? Morality absent from reality is empty words.


--------------------------------

BradleyHCobb @ 2017-12-05 22:46:17 :

&gt;Morality absent from reality is empty words.

That's pithy, but meaningless. The social contract one lives under can change, either because one moves or because one's countrymen decide to change it. Whether one has certain rights should not be completely dependent on the social contract.

Your position is that a person has no rights unless a government grants them those rights. A person does not have the right to life unless the government grants them that right. If a government chooses to end the life of a person, so be it - that person doesn't have the right to life because that right hasn't been granted them by the government.

That's pretty clear, mate. And it's not separated from reality - there are countless examples of political/cultural/ethnic groups oppressing others **through the social contract** and if you believe your rights derive solely from said social contract, then you are signing off on that oppression being legal and moral.

If you don't believe that, then you believe as many do: that an individual has inherent rights, independent of any social contract. And we form governments to *protect* the rights we already had, not to grant us those rights."

There are broad and narrow reasons for everything. ""Non-traditional"" is a broad reason, the orientation of the couple is the narrow reason, the *origin* of the reason.

I'll give you an analogy.

Let's say I don't like my mother's casserole. The reason I don't like it is because I don't like the flavor (eg, I don't like ""non-traditional"" weddings). The reason I don't like the flavor is because she uses onions in it (eg, I don't like same-sex couples getting married).

Ultimately, it is my distaste for onions that causes me to reject my mother's casserole. While I may state broadly, ""I don't like how it tastes"" that doesn't change the fact that it's because I don't like onions.

A baker may state broadly that they don't like non-traditional weddings. But the reason they reject this wedding in particular is because it has onions in it.

Sorry, lesbians. It has lesbians in it.

&gt;The discrimination is based on the type of wedding

The type of wedding is determined by the orientation of the couple.

You can't disentangle these properties. The baker rejects the wedding *because it is a same-sex couple*. 

&gt;Nope. The customer is the person making the purchase. Go look up the definition like I just did.

Again, being one step removed doesn't excuse the fact that they are targeting a same-sex couple for discrimination.

&gt;Consider the following: back when it was legal to discriminate based on race, a white person could walk into a ""whites only"" restaurant and order a sandwich and announce that he planned to give it to a black man. The racists didn't care who ate their food. See the difference? This guy is not doing that.

Okay, so not only does this seem like it's wrong -- in that I'm sure more than one racist restaurant owner *would* deny service if it were going to be given to a black guy, what I think you've actually done here is provided another analogy against your point.

Do you believe that *today* it would not be discrimination if a restaurant owner refused to serve a white customer *because* the customer announced his intentions to bring the food to his black friend? Do you think that would fly?

&gt;The baker has a problem with his labor supporting a ceremony that he objects to for religious reasons. And he has an undeniable human right to make that objection.

He has the right to voice his disapproval. He does not have the right to refuse service on the grounds of orientation.

&gt; It is exactly, without any difference, the same objection these artists are making. If the baker is forced to bake a cake, then those artists can be forced to compose for Trump, and you don't want that to happen.

The President is not a protected class.

&gt;If you could come to terms with that fact, you'd realize that I'm right here.

Can you stop saying condescending shit like this? I'm really running out of patience for it. ""If you would only accept that I'm right you'd stop arguing with me."" That adds nothing to the discussion and it makes me wonder if you even acknowledge that you could be wrong about something.

&gt;No, that doesn't follow from my argument. The baker did not refuse service to lesbians.

Your argument was that creating ""literally anything"" is an act of speech, and the implication is that acts of speech aren't subject to anti-discrimination laws. This is exactly what follows from that argument."	1	0	stop arguing comment					[deleted]	"radialomens @ 2017-12-29 01:08:47 :

You would be asking them to provide a product they do not already sell. The baker sells wedding cakes -- but only to straight couples. That is discrimination on the grounds of orientation.

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 09:28:50 :

&gt; The baker sells wedding cakes -- but only to straight couples.

If this statement wasn't true, then your entire argument would fall apart.

And it turns out, *the statement isn't true!* The truth (as I understand it) is that he sells anything to anyone. The truth (as I understand it) is that he was more than happy to sell cakes, pastries, whatever, to straight or lesbian couples. What he refused was **not** ""sell to a lesbian couple"" but rather, ""bake a cake for use in a particular ceremony.""

--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 09:36:03 :

You can’t defend discrimination with partial services. He made cakes for weddings, and he refused to make a cake for their wedding specifically because they’re a same sex couple. Being willing to sell other goods to gay folks doesn’t change that fact. Withholding a single service is still discrimination based on orientation.

--------------------------------

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 09:44:27 :

&gt; You can’t defend discrimination with partial services.

Are you ignoring the fact that I just refuted your central point? Your claim was: The baker sells wedding cakes -- but only to straight couples.

That claim appears to be false. The truth (as I understand it) is that the baker sells wedding cakes to anyone.

Anyone. Any ...one.

You are making a claim that he is discriminating against people - that he is discriminating against some**one** and that claim appears to be false. The sexuality of the people ordering the cake appears to be irrelevant. The baker would have sold anyone, regardless of their sexuality, a wedding cake for use in one kind of ceremony. And the baker would have refused anyone, regardless of their sexuality, a wedding cake for use in another kind of ceremony.

Therefore, the sexuality is irrelevant and your statement is false.

--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 09:54:48 :

If the couple sent a go-between to handle the cake buying and the baker chose not to sell the cake when he learned what it would be used for, he is still discriminating against the same-sex couple even if all his interactions were with, say, their mother or their hetero wedding planner.

By refusing to provide his products for a same-sex wedding, regardless of who goes to his shop to make the order, he is still guilty of discrimination. This sort of distinction that you’re making up here doesn’t exist. 

Businesses cannot draw lines between “a straight wedding” and “a gay wedding” or “a white birthday” and “a Hispanic birthday.” They sell cakes for weddings and birthdays. And if the protected-class identity of the people throwing the celebration is the reason the baker uses to refuse service, they’re discriminating.

If you provide cakes for weddings, you must provide them for same-sex weddings. To do otherwise is discrimination.

--------------------------------

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 10:00:25 :

&gt; he is still discriminating against the same-sex couple

That's only true if the following is true: ""hi, we're a lesbian couple and we're having a birthday party, please bake us a cake"" - and the baker refuses.

Do you think that's true? Do you think the baker would have refused that request?

&gt; Businesses cannot draw lines between “a straight wedding” and “a gay wedding”

Can they draw lines between ""a trump rally"" and ""a clinton rally"" in your opinion? If someone walked into a shop and said, ""hi, I need a cake for the trump inauguration"" does the baker have the right to refuse?

--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 10:06:22 :

&gt; That's only true if the following is true: ""hi, we're a lesbian couple and we're having a birthday party, please bake us a cake"" - and the baker refuses. 

As I said, partial service does not excuse partial discrimination. Being willing to serve a gay birthday party doesn’t mean that you can refuse a gay wedding.

&gt; Can they draw lines between ""a trump rally"" and ""a clinton rally"" in your opinion? If someone walked into a shop and said, ""hi, I need a cake for the trump inauguration"" does the baker have the right to refuse?

Not a protected class.

--------------------------------

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 10:11:30 :

&gt; As I said, partial service does not excuse partial discrimination.

Service to a lesbian couple refutes your claim of discrimination against lesbians.

It's clear to me that you aren't hearing anything I'm saying, so let's try to do this as a simple logic problem. Let's say a person has two attributes, a letter and a number. There are four possible combinations, and a baker provides or denies service in the following cases:

- A1 - provides service

- A2 - denies service

- B1 - provides service

- B2 - denies service

Question: on what grounds does the baker discriminate?

&gt; Not a protected class.

Is that just, in your opinion? Why or why not?

--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 10:20:21 :

&gt; Service to a lesbian couple refutes your claim of discrimination against lesbians.

Do you honestly believe this? Can a property manager reserve certain properties for white-only tenants as long as he rents something else to black people who come looking?

Your logic puzzle doesn’t prove anything. First of all, it isn’t even accurate. To fill in these business orders, we’d have:

Straight birthday - yes

Straight wedding - yes

Gay birthday - yes

Gay wedding - no

In that case, they’re still discriminating based on orientation. Just because they don’t discriminate against gay people in EVERY case doesn’t mean they aren’t using orientation as their basis for refusal of service in THIS case.

&gt; Is that just, in your opinion? Why or why not?

For real? I’m on mobile. Google “protected class” and read the Wikipedia page.

Edit: I’m likely going to go to sleep now

--------------------------------

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 10:23:46 :

&gt; Your logic puzzle doesn’t prove anything. 

I think you avoided addressing it because you know it dismantles your position.

&gt; &gt; Is that just, in your opinion? Why or why not?

&gt; For real?

Oops, I just realized that I worded that poorly. What I meant was, do you feel that distinction is *just* (as in, morally okay).

--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 10:28:30 :

I didn’t even avoid it, I showed you how it broke down. You seem to have avoided the landlord comparison, though.

Yes. 

--------------------------------

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 10:39:40 :

&gt; I didn’t even avoid it

I think you did. I'll repeat the question: on what grounds does the baker (in the logic puzzle) discriminate? You may answer either ""letters"" or ""numbers"" Any other answer is avoiding the question.

&gt; Yes.

So to be clear, it acceptable to allow discrimination based on one type of political view, but deny it based on another type? Why? How do you make that decision objectively (meaning, don't just give an example, but point to an underlying principle)

--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 19:38:21 :

Sure, I’ll play along. In that example you discriminated against numbers.

Now, do you see how when I filled out your “logic puzzle” with the real world examples, it doesn’t even match your alternating pattern? Instead of yes-no-yes-no it went yes-yes-yes-no. 

And again, **do you believe that a business can discriminate partially if they offer partial services?** Can a landlord reserve certain properties (ie wedding cakes) for white tenants as long as they allow black tenants to rent other properties (birthday cakes)?

&gt; it acceptable to allow discrimination based on one type of political view, but deny it based on another type?

No, what I’m saying is that I don’t believe any political view should be a protected class.

--------------------------------

nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-29 21:08:59 :

&gt; In that example you discriminated against numbers.

Correct. In that example, letters are a person's sexual orientation, and numbers are a type of religious ceremony.

- A1 = straight customer, traditional wedding - provides service

- A2 = straight customer, non-traditional wedding ([example 1](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/23/two-heterosexual-irish-men-marry-to-avoid-inheritance-tax-on-house), [example 2](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41413297)) - denies service

- B1 = gay customer, traditional wedding (for example, a gay wedding planner buying a cake for a traditional wedding) - provides service

- B2 = gay customer, non-traditional wedding - denies service

The discrimination is based on the numbers, which represent the type of wedding, not on the letters, which represent the person's sexuality. The baker did not discriminate based on sexuality.

&gt; when I filled out your “logic puzzle” with the real world examples, it doesn’t even match your alternating pattern?

That's why you should have just answered the question right away. You had it wrong. The above list is correct.

&gt; Can a landlord reserve certain properties (ie wedding cakes) for white tenants as long as they allow black tenants to rent other properties (birthday cakes)?

No, that is not, nor should it be legal. Neither renting a property nor living in a house is a political act or an act of speech. By contrast, creating (literally creating anything) is a creative act, and therefore speech. If you want an example that is more parallel to what actually happened, imagine an architect (that is, imagine someone being asked to *create* a house, not just rent one out). An architect has a right to refuse to design a building if he objects to the use that building will be put to, just as a baker has a right to refuse to bake a cake.

Note also, since you said, ""reserve certain properties (ie wedding cakes)"" that you're still missing the point. The baker does **not** have the right to refuse to sell an item in his store. He does not have that right anymore than the landlord has the right to refuse to rent a property. Fortunately, *that's not what happened in this case*. The baker did not refuse to sell an item, he refused *to create an item* - and he has that right.



--------------------------------

radialomens @ 2017-12-29 23:17:36 :

&gt;A1 = straight customer, traditional wedding - provides service  
A2 = straight customer, non-traditional wedding (example 1, example 2) - denies service  
B1 = gay customer, traditional wedding (for example, a gay wedding planner buying a cake for a traditional wedding) - provides service  
B2 = gay customer, non-traditional wedding - denies service

By calling these weddings ""traditional"" or ""non-traditional"" you're masking the fact that the baker explicitly stated it was because it was for a *same-sex* wedding. Everything about the ceremony was going to be just like any other wedding except that the couple getting married was same-sex. And that, by the baker's own testimony, is the reason he refused them service.

&gt;The discrimination is based on the numbers, which represent the type of wedding

The discrimination is based on the fact that the wedding is a *same-sex wedding*, not that it is ""non-traditional.""

Additionally...

&gt;gay customer, traditional wedding (for example, a gay wedding planner buying a cake for a traditional wedding) - provides service  

The customer is the couple getting married. Like I said earlier, it doesn't matter whether they have a go-between in the form of a parent or a wedding planner, the client is ultimately the couple getting married, and if it's because of their identity as a protected class that the baker refuses the job, he is in violation of anti-discrimination laws.

&gt;No, that is not, nor should it be legal. Neither renting a property nor living in a house is a political act or an act of speech. By contrast, creating (literally creating anything) is a creative act, and therefore speech.

Nope, the courts and I disagree with you on that. Indeed the bakers made that argument, but if everything that the couple asked for (or would have asked for) would have been fulfilled for a straight couple (eg. the flavors, the decorations) it isn't a matter of creative expression. If they have something against the proposed *design* of the cake (eg, I don't do rainbow cakes, not for you, not for anyone) then they could argue freedom of speech. But they didn't have a problem with the design, they have a problem with the same-sex wedding it's going to be used in.

&gt;imagine an architect (that is, imagine someone being asked to create a house, not just rent one out). An architect has a right to refuse to design a building if he objects to the use that building will be put to

If the architect refuses to design, say, a prison? Sure. But I think that if you want to argue that an architect can refuse to design a house, for example, when he learns that the client is gay, you're going to need to back that up.

Can an architect refuse to meet someone's specific requests (eg vaulted ceilings, brick facade)? Yeah. But if he would have provided those options to a straight client and refuses on the grounds of the house's future occupation by gay people, he is again in violation of discrimination laws.

&gt;Note also, since you said, ""reserve certain properties (ie wedding cakes)"" that you're still missing the point. The baker does not have the right to refuse to sell an item in his store. He does not have that right anymore than the landlord has the right to refuse to rent a property. Fortunately, that's not what happened in this case. The baker did not refuse to sell an item, he refused to create an item

That doesn't make a difference. He refused to do the labor that he would have done for a straight couple, and he refused on the grounds of their orientation.

Edit:

I have to add, based on your statements like ""creating *(literally creating anything)* is a creative act, and therefore speech"" any restaurant could refuse to serve black people today. Well, I guess they'd have to sell them a soda or something. Cooking a burger is ""a creative act."" This is one reason your definition is invalid.

&gt; By calling these weddings ""traditional"" or ""non-traditional"" you're masking the fact that the baker explicitly stated it was because it was for a same-sex wedding.

A same-sex wedding is non-traditional. By calling it non-traditional, I'm not masking that, I'm broadening the category. I am absolutely certain that a religious person would object to a polygamous wedding for the exact same reason he objected to a same-sex wedding.

Once I disabuse you of the false claim that sex is the issue, you'll see that you have no reasonable argument here.

&gt; &gt; The discrimination is based on the numbers, which represent the type of wedding

&gt; The discrimination is based on the fact that the wedding is a same-sex wedding

The discrimination is based on the type of wedding. The baker has a right to refuse to perform a service for that reason.

&gt; The customer is the couple getting married.

Nope. The customer is the person making the purchase. Go look up the definition like I just did.

Consider the following: back when it was legal to discriminate based on race, a white person could walk into a ""whites only"" restaurant and order a sandwich and announce that he planned to give it to a black man. The racists didn't care who ate their food. See the difference? This guy is not doing that.

&gt; the courts and I disagree with you on that

In as much as that's true, the courts and you are wrong. Appeal to authority isn't going to get you out of this one. The arguments you're making in this thread are all lies. You keep falsely claiming that he refused to sell to lesbians. The truth is, he refused to participate in a ceremony by performing labor for it. He would have refused even if it'd been two straight men getting married

&gt; they didn't have a problem with the design, they have a problem with the same-sex wedding it's going to be used in.

The baker has a problem with his labor supporting a ceremony that he objects to for religious reasons. And he has an undeniable human right to make that objection. It is exactly, without any difference, the same objection [these artists are making](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/musicians-who-want-donald-trump-to-stop-playing-their-music-a7151171.html). If the baker is forced to bake a cake, then those artists can be forced to compose for Trump, *and you don't want that to happen*.

&gt; if you want to argue that an architect can refuse to design a house, for example, when he learns that the client is gay, you're going to need to back that up.

Fortunately, I don't want to argue that because it's completely irrelevant to this case. It's amusing to me that I have to keep repeating this: he was happy to bake a cake for lesbians. Their sexual orientation is irrelevant. If you could come to terms with that fact, you'd realize that I'm right here.

&gt; He refused to do the labor that he would have done for a straight couple

That's a lie. He would have refused a straight couple if they asked him to bake a cake for a gay wedding.

&gt; any restaurant could refuse to serve black people today

No, that doesn't follow from my argument. The baker did not refuse service to lesbians."	"nicethingyoucanthave @ 2017-12-31 15:38:20 :

That simply isn't true. Religious people (and I say this as an atheist myself) believe they have been given a specific recipe for casserole from almighty god (who doesn't actually exist).

Their objection isn't because you added onions, it's that *you changed the recipe at all*. Thus, religious people would object to any ""non-traditional"" marriage simply on the grounds that it's different than what the sky god prescribed.

Please give examples of ways that the market can reduce the effect of conscious or unconscious racial bias if the populace is uninterested in doing so.

Let's say we have blue and green people. Blue people have the money and the power. Green people don't. There are many businesses which only allow blue customers. There are some businesses that only allow green customers, or both, but they are lower quality or value. Some blue-only businesses may want to allow green customers, but they are afraid of losing blue customers.

In what ways can a free market improve the situation, if the power is invested in the status quo? What are the sequence of events?

Or, in this case, how can the market prevent employers from discriminating against black servers, if customers really are more uncomfortable with them?

&gt; How is it complicated? Where do we end the objection to racial bias?

You are making a textbook example of a slippery slope argument.

The objection to racial bias ""ends"" when other considerations outweigh it. Allowing it as a consideration does NOT mean (and I've been emphasizing this the whole time) that it supersedes all other considerations. That's what it means to have a value system.

The Domino's ruling doesn't say, ""It's racially biased, therefore it's bad."" They weigh the racially-biased effects against the very real burden on the business (i.e. the fact that people prefer clean-shaven employees), and decided that, _in this case_, one outweighs the other. Sometimes it'll go the other way around: the racial bias effect might not be as bad as the burden to the company.

So what about the poor white family in West Virginia, compared to the wealthy white family in California. Do they both have priviliage? One more than another? Becasue I think you can make an arguement for priviliage based on wealth, but just making an assumption like all white people have privilege does not go into the details, because poor white people dont like being told about their privilege, when they get no practicle value from it. If someone is struggling, and they get told there the lucky ones, they are going to be unhappy. All it does is paint things with a broad stroke.

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-06 15:06:14 :

I think poor white people do still have privilege that they get practical value from.  It's clearly not enough to pull them out of poverty, but that doesn't mean it's not there.  The problem here is when people think of the word ""privileged"" they think of snotty nosed rich kids, which is not how the term is meant at all in the phrase white privilege.

White privilege doesn't mean every white person is better off then every non-white person, and it doesn't mean that every white person has had the same opportunities as every other white person.  It doesn't mean that no white person got where they are through hard work or that no white person deserves their success.

White privilege means two things to me.

1) If you look at people in similar circumstances, both poor or both rich, both smart or both dumb, both healthy or both ill, etc, then on average white people will fair better in those circumstances then non-white people will because white people don't have the added difficulty in life of dealing with racism.

2) If you compare the circumstances of different people, then on average white people grow up and live in better circumstances then non-white people because their circumstances are largely controlled by the circumstances of their parents and their parents were likely affected by these issues, as were their parents parents, etc.

Now in both 1 and 2 above I state a fact, then I say ""because"", and I offer an explanation for that fact.  The facts as stated are not subject to opinion.  They are objectively either true or false, they have been studied, and the results of any properly done study that I'm aware of are in the positive.  Those facts are true.

The explanations for those facts (the part after ""because"") I can't claim are objectively true.  We can't really measure causality in science, just correlation.  But I think those explanations are very reasonable.  I reject explanations that imply that white people are objectively, or genetically, or whatever, better people; I believe people are equal and once I reject those explanations I can think of no others for why white people statistically (i.e. on average) fair better than non-white people.  My conclusion is that it's because of white privilege.

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-06 15:56:24 :

I'd like to see data showing that white people do better than minorities of similar socio economic status because I've always seen the opposite.

JStarx @ 2018-01-06 18:08:00 :

I've never seen *any* study that said, for example, that blacks do better than whites under any economic circumstances.  Do you have a link?

As for studies that show the opposite.  If you control for education level [there's still a wage gap](http://www.epi.org/publication/african-americans-are-paid-less-than-whites-at-every-education-level/).  [This article](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2015/01/15/five-bleak-facts-on-black-opportunity/) cites sources showing that blacks in poverty are less likely to move out of poverty than whites and blacks in the middle class are more likely to end up poor than whites.  I'm sure google can turn up more examples if you'd like them.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-06 18:45:31 :

I'm unable to find the data I saw.  It was years ago, but it was about justice system outcomes for poor whites being far more similar to blacks than rich whites.

Even given your data, which is interesting, how do we come to the conclusion that this is due to racial discrimination?  Almost certainly not all of it is.  

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-06 19:25:23 :

What other sources do you propose for the disparity?

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-06 21:29:23 :

How people get paid is very complex.  There's all kinds of social dynamics that make you more or less likely to get hired, or a raise.

Malcolm Gladwell's outliers discusses, at length, how a person's environment leads to different outcomes.

Particularly he points out a study showing how parents of different socio economic class teach their children to deal with authority differently.

If you're less likely to ask for a raise, your group will be paid less, for example.

If the culture you're raised in makes it more likely to have work place conflicts, you'll get all kinds of consequences.

I don't know if either of those are true, but there are lots and lots of possible alternate explanations.  Racial discrimination is certainly part of the gap, I've no doubt.  Claiming the whole gap is due to it without looking at the myriad other influences is simply an example of bias.

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-06 22:18:43 :

None of the issues you suggest are innately tied to skin color, so even if those issues are found to be major factors (which I agree is entirely possible) their disproportionate effect on non-whites over whites is still likely a result of racial bias.

If, for example, minorities were less likely to get raises because they are less likely to ask for them you still have to ask why are they less likely to ask for them?  If minorities are less confident at work due to the feeling that society values them less isn't that still an issue of racial bias in our society?

At the end of the day a disparity exists and I think that is in of itself proof of racial bias and discrimination in our society.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-06 23:04:51 :

The point is that cultural issues aren't innately tied to race while still being extremely correlated with it, thus confounding your statistics.

There are lots of reasons why someone might be less likely to ask for a raise.  A lack of confidence is certainly one of them.  But different cultures value different things.  That leads to different outcomes. 

This is a complex subject and to say that because any gap exists it's due to racial discrimination is facile at best and extremely unhelpful.

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 01:00:07 :

Again, you're just passing the buck back to avoid the issue.  If the root cause is a cultural issue then you're still left to explain why minority cultures are disproportionately affected.

When I was in undergrad a local bar decided that it would no longer let in customers with saggy pants or flat brimmed baseball caps.  It was a pretty blatant attempt at discouraging black people from coming in.  By targeting clothing choices they could claim it wasn't about race but it was clear to the community at large that targeting ""black culture"" is just as racist as targeting black skinned people explicitly.  It's the same thing with Trumps travel ban.  They target countries, not religions, but it's clear to most of the public, and it was clear to the courts, that the intent was to disproportionately affect muslims.

Saying that it's about culture doesn't mean it's not about race.  You're right that it's a complex issue, but it's still clear that the root problem is racial bias.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 03:59:03 :

The things that you list are racial bias, true enough. That doesn't imply the wage gap is entirely due to racial discrimination.

You're just assuming the root problem is racial bias. I said they might be less likely to ask for raises and you jumped to the conclusion that it's because they feel less confident due to racism.

The existence of a wage gap does not tell you what causes it.  Without more research concluding what causes it is assumption.  This is a textbook example of confirmation bias. 


--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 05:03:33 :

&gt; That doesn't imply the wage gap is entirely due to racial discrimination.

To be clear, I said racial bias, not racial discrimination.

&gt;you jumped to the conclusion that it's because they feel less confident due to racism.

I didn't jump to any conclusion, I *clearly* offered that as an example, not a conclusion, to illustrate that issues that don't appear to be directly caused by discrimination can still be issues of racial bias.

Before you accuse others of confirmation bias please at least read their posts carefully enough to understand their point.  My point is not controversial, in fact it's nearly tautological.  If there's a difference between races then there is a force that acts disproportionately negatively on some races vs. other races.  That is by definition racial bias.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 13:39:58 :

Bias is a type of discrimination.

You clearly gave an example of how it could still be caused by racial bias?  Then you didnt actually address my point at all and it was irrelevant.

&gt; If there's a difference between races then there
&gt; is a force that acts disporportionately negatively
&gt; on some races vs other races. That is by definition
&gt; racial bias. 

Not really.  If my groups culture teaches me to not ask for raises, I'm going to get fewer raises.  That's me and my groups decisions determining the outcome.  Which is very different from people in an out group causing the difference.

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 13:55:45 :

&gt;You clearly gave an example of how it could still be caused by racial bias? Then you didnt actually address my point at all and it was irrelevant.

I have addressed your point.  You claim that the issues could be tied to culture and not race, my response is that if the cultural issue disproportionately affects minorities over whites then the cultural issue **is by definition** a racial issue.

&gt; If my groups culture teaches me to not ask for raises, I'm going to get fewer raises. That's me and my groups decisions determining the outcome.

If the out group has determined cultural norms that exclude minority cultures then the out group has caused this difference.  Refering to my previous example, even if your intent is not to prevent blacks from entering your bar and it *really is* to prevent saggy pants and flat brimmed hats the fact that this action overwhelmingly inhibits only your black customers means it's racist.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 14:53:34 :

No.  Just... No.  If it's a cultural issue, it's a cultural issue.  Trying to make it into a racial one is just silly.  Race and culture are different things.

If you're part of a different culture there will always be differences in expected behavior.  That's what culture is.  To say that that is racist is to misunderstand what racism is. 

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 15:28:39 :

And yet earlier you agreed that banning baggy pants and flat brimmed hats was racial bias.  Those things are cultural, not racial.

Race and culture are certainly different things, that doesn't mean they are unconnected and you get to ignore one when talking about the other.

If your actions disproportionately affect one race over another then your actions create a racial bias in our culture.  Your intentions are irrelevant.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 16:06:45 :

That's because no one is going to ban those things without the intention of discouraging blacks. It's the whole point

You don't ignore them, they're confounding variables.  Cultural causes are not racial causes.  You're insisting on a root racial cause without any evidence for it.

Cultural issues will always disporportionately effect people outside of that group which will make it look like a racial thing but it's not. 

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 17:28:05 :

&gt;Cultural causes are not racial causes.

If it effects racial bias in society then that's that.  I don't care how well intentioned your rules are, if they screw over minorities then they're racially biased rules.  Your intention is irrelevant.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 18:30:14 :

It's not about intention.

If it's a cultural thing a black person from the us would have a different experience than a black person from Canada, or Africa, or wherever.  If that's true it is NOT racial.

Is that clear enough? 

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 18:36:10 :

Irrelevant, racial bias is not required to be independent of context.

You agreed that banning baggy pants and backwards caps would be racial bias, do you think it would still be racial bias in an african country where those clothing items do not correlate so strongly with being black?

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 19:38:01 :

If a black persons experience is dependant on what culture they are a part of, it's not a racial factor. A racial factor has to be dependant on a person's race, not their culture.

Obviously a policy banning baggy clothes in a country where no one wears them would not be racially discriminatory.

The clothes policy is a bad example because it's one that is deliberately meant to target black people while getting around discrimination laws.  It has nothing to do with what we're talking about 

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-07 20:31:10 :

&gt;If a black persons experience is dependant on what culture they are a part of, it's not a racial factor.

&gt;Obviously a policy banning baggy clothes in a country where no one wears them would not be racially discriminatory.

Yet earlier refering to the baggy pants example you said:

&gt;The things that you list are racial bias, true enough.

So you are contradicting yourself.  By your own admission something can be racially biased in one culture but not another.



--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-07 22:30:39 :

I'm not contradicting myself, you just don't understand what I'm saying.  You're conflating two things.

The baggy clothes are specific to the U.S. because it allows racists to specifically target blacks.  It wouldn't be racist if the motivation was different, though.  Like a mechanical environment where baggy clothes are dangerous, for example.

That's different from a culture that teaches people not to ask for raises.  That means people from the same race will have different experiences based on what culture they're from.  That means that that specific influence is not racially motivated but cultural.

I can't explain it any more clearly.  Cultural and racial factors are confounding variables in the research and are important to try to tease out.  They're not the same.

I'm not even sure what you think I'm arguing. 

--------------------------------

JStarx @ 2018-01-08 03:54:04 :

&gt;I can't explain it any more clearly.

Took the words right out of my mouth.  If it affects racial groups differently then it creates racial bias.  I think you're confusing racial bias with racist discrimination.  It seems like you don't understand that racial bias is a larger phenomenon which can be just as damaging to minorities.

--------------------------------

Raijinili @ 2018-01-08 04:43:37 :

I think there is a disconnect here between ""blame"" and ""fix"".

I believe JStarx is trying to say that racial bias is a problem that needs a solution, and u/Ast3roth takes racial discrimination as an issue of morality and fault.

Let's look at the [Domino's beard ban](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/us/beard-ban-ruled-unfair-to-blacks.html). Do you agree or disagree that the ban was a problem that needed to be fixed, and whether the answer to that question has to do with its race-related effects?

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-08 13:07:03 :

I was unfamiliar with the beard ban case before this.

I agree that in this case a medical exception seems to be a good ruling.

I don't agree that a beard ban needs to be gotten rid of entirely.  I also don't think this answer has anything to do with race.

--------------------------------

Raijinili @ 2018-01-08 19:50:36 :

I said ""a problem that needs to be fixed"". Making exceptions counts as an attempt to fix it.

Do you believe that the disproportionate effects on black people is ignorable, and that it's purely a medical issue?

Given that race is a legally protected class, and medical issues don't form protected classes (at least not at this level), do you agree or disagree with using race in the lawsuit?

If it is, in the future, demonstrated that Domino's hirers are less likely to hire people that may need shaving waivers, do you believe that's a valid argument against the beard ban? Note: An argument being _valid_ only means that it is reasonable to use, not that it is enough to make a decision.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-09 00:01:38 :

First of all, I think protected classes for private businesses and citizens are generally a bad idea.  I see no evidence that government is capable of reasonably addressing problems like this. 

Second, given we do allow the government to get involved, and the limited scope of the ruling, it's probably the best we could hope for.

Third, simply disporportionately effecting blacks, on its own, I don't think is reasonable to use.  This is a good example of why I think it's far too complicated of a subject for such a simple argument.

Being clean shaven has a lot of well established connotations.  Cleanliness, civilization, etc.  There are a lot of people that want to see their service people be clean shaven.

Saying that because more black men choose to have beards than whites so their hiring opportunities are more limited is saying black cultural decisions are more important or valid than whites. Not only is that not true, it's very much not the kind of decision we want courts making.

--------------------------------

Raijinili @ 2018-01-09 04:40:05 :

&gt; First of all, I think protected classes for private businesses and citizens are generally a bad idea. I see no evidence that government is capable of reasonably addressing problems like this. 

The market can't, either. Market is driven by those with power and money. If power is disproportionately distributed, it is very difficult to correct things through the market.

&gt; Third, simply disporportionately effecting blacks, on its own, I don't think is reasonable to use. This is a good example of why I think it's far too complicated of a subject for such a simple argument.

What's complicated about it? We know it disproportionately affects blacks. We can reason that, if these sorts of policies run unchecked, blacks will have a harder time in the job market than whites, and it's in a sense ""unfair"". We know that non-blacks will generally be ignorant of medical (and other) issues affecting black men, and thus they may enact policies which will ""unfairly"" affect black men. We know that policy-makers are more likely to be white men.

The beard ban is one example. Even in hair, there's another example: what hair styles are considered professional. Afros, dreads, and cornrows are considered unprofessional, but black hair is statistically different from white hair, and needs to be taken care of in different ways. The reason that they're considered unprofessional is that stereotypical professionals don't wear them... because professionals are usually not black. And stereotypical criminals wear them... because stereotypical criminals are usually black (or Latino). Non-black policymakers typically won't know that it often takes more money and effort for blacks to conform to these policies, for biological reasons. All this suggests that the policies are problematic.

&gt; Being clean shaven has a lot of well established connotations. Cleanliness, civilization, etc. There are a lot of people that want to see their service people be clean shaven.

And a lot of people want to see their service people not look like a criminal. This isn't racism, it's just true. It isn't their fault that black people, for some reason, fit into the criminal-shaped hole in their brain more easily than white people.

But let's say that there's a policy that uses an AI to determine who looks more and less like a criminal, based on polling data. That will have a racial bias (effect), despite there being no racial bias (cause) intentionally or subconsciously put into place. The racial bias (effect) comes from the subconscious racial bias (cause) of people. Would you agree that the policy is problematic? ""Problematic"" is not to say that it's a veto, but simply a reason against.

&gt; Saying that because more black men choose to have beards than whites so their hiring opportunities are more limited is saying black cultural decisions are more important or valid than whites. Not only is that not true, it's very much not the kind of decision we want courts making.

They are as much ""choosing"" to have beards as (to take a hyperbolic example) people ""choose"" to live in a poor neighborhood. Sure, if they tried really hard, they could get out, but it would take them more time and effort than someone who already lives in a middle-class neighborhood.

[Check out the Google Images on razor bumps to see what happens if affected men do try to shave.](https://www.google.com/search?q=pseudofolliculitis+barbae) There are ways to get around that, but they would have to buy different products, which may be more expensive. I saw someone make fun of a product that was formulated for black hair, and they then learned that it really was necessary to do so.

--------------------------------

Ast3roth @ 2018-01-09 17:59:36 :

Of course the market can. That's what it does.  Its also why monopolies aren't stable without government intervention.  Firms that try to tilt against the market get punished quickly.

How is it complicated?  Where do we end the objection to racial bias?

Businesses don't want to operate in more dangerous neighborhoods.  That disporportionately discourages access to these firms.

Films often don't target minorities.  Most of the industry ignores them except for insultingly token lip service.  This is more than just bias.

Blacks are less likely to have finished high school so requiring a high school diploma or college degree for a job disporportionately effects them.

The cultural norm of dressing up for a job interview.  Suburban sprawl means people with cars have an advantage in being able to get to a job.

There's any number of potential ways you can frame ""racial bias"" and there's no obvious end to the thinking.

Your AI hypothetical, I have no problem with.  I'd say maybe their policies should be clear so potential customers can make an informed choice, though.

No one has a right to work at a firm.  Sometimes market forces make people lose out.  An imperfect situation does not imply that we need a governmental solution or that a better governmental solution is possible."	"Ast3roth @ 2018-01-10 17:52:45 :

Please.  You're making extremist arguments but acting like they're reasonable.

Markets are driven by money and power?  What is government driven by?  Government action has enormous issues that make its use problematic over market action.

When the effect is diffuse on one side and concentrated on the other, collective action problems make it very difficult to ensure government action is equal.  See copyrights, patents and things like the sugar industry.  Americans pay approximately double the price for sugar than the market would due to government action.

Markets kill firms that do a bad job.  Whereas governments layer complexity on complexity.  See the book kldugeocracy for a great discussion of the issues inherent in the government.

You can call it a slippery slope argument but precedent is explicitly how courts work and the idea of lawfare is the idea that you can manipulate the system by accumulating precedents.  You can also read the book ""influence: the psychology of persuasion"" which has a great section on how these kinds of things can lead people to make much larger decisions than they would otherwise.

Tax lawyers and lobbyists are professions that are entirely wasteful because their only purpose is to manipulate regulation.

We can just examine reality to see if what you're saying is true.  The market is entirely driven by money and power and thus screws over the poor, according to you.

Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the U.S. and specifically targets low income consumers.  The company demonstrably benefits them.  Why would such a large and powerful company do this, in your paradigm?  Mark Perry does a calculation every year for how Wal-Mart makes thanksgiving dinner affordable, if you're curious.

Raijinili @ 2018-01-11 02:43:10 :

&gt; Please. You're making extremist arguments but acting like they're reasonable.

I'm sure that your understanding of my words give rise to extremist arguments. I would like you to quote the lines you think are forwarding extremist arguments, and then put them in your own words, to see how you understood them.

&gt; Markets are driven by money and power? What is government driven by?

Money and power.

If that surprised you, it's because you missed a key word. You said that the government can't address the problems, and I said, ""The market can't, **either**.""

Your arguments against government are irrelevant to my question: How can the market solve those problems if the holders of money and power are uninterested in doing so?

&gt; You can call it a slippery slope argument but precedent is explicitly how courts work

It is a slippery slope argument. You are saying that allowing one thing will allow bigger and bigger (or smaller and smaller) versions of it. ""Where does it end?"" is characteristic of slippery slope arguments.

Precedence is a mechanism in the court system, but it's not uncontrolled precedence. If a court rules that 40 grams of cheddar cheese is better than 10 grams of chocolate, it means that 50 grams of cheddar cheese is better than 9 grams of chocolate. It does not mean that 10 grams of cheddar cheese is better than 200 grams of chocolate. That's not how precedence works.

Precedence is not a slippery slope. It establishes a comparison between fixed quantities of two or more things. It does not mean that all quantities of those two things will take the same comparison.

&gt;  You can also read the book ""influence: the psychology of persuasion"" which has a great section on how these kinds of things can lead people to make much larger decisions than they would otherwise.

You realize that a completely free market is the end of a slippery slope, right? ""Look at how markets outdo government in these areas. Therefore we should go all the way to the end: free market, no government interference."" You are unironically showing how individuals are persuaded to go from small steps to extreme views by being an example of it.

Fortunately, while individuals can be convinced like that, society is some weighted average of its individuals, and we rarely succumb to the slippery slope. Arguments about unchecked slippery slopes are rarely relevant, because society has built-in checks.

&gt; We can just examine reality to see if what you're saying is true. The market is entirely driven by money and power and thus screws over the poor, according to you.
&gt; Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the U.S. and specifically targets low income consumers. The company demonstrably benefits them. Why would such a large and powerful company do this, in your paradigm? Mark Perry does a calculation every year for how Wal-Mart makes thanksgiving dinner affordable, if you're curious.

This is a straw man.

1. I did not conclude that it screws over the poor. You are doing that thing again, where you are arguing against people not in front of you. I am saying (analogously), if it _does_ screw over the poor, and the money and power don't care, then there's no market mechanism to fix that.
2. My hypothetical emphasized that the money and the power is interested in maintaining the status quo. In the real world, a lot of money and power is interested in helping the poor.
3. I was asking you for a _mechanism_ which could allow the market to reduce discrimination. Giving real world EFFECTS (statistics) does not give a CAUSE (mechanism).
4. Even if the market is driven _entirely_ by power and money (again, you're making extreme interpretations), the poor are not powerless. They have voting power, unions, etc.

It's really frustrating talking to someone who is more interested in using me as a substitute than to talk with _me_.

Anyway, here is the mechanism by which Walmart can act in the way you describe, given the assumption that the market is driven by money and power:

* Walmart can only sell so many turkeys to a few wealthy families. Therefore, it must aim for a large customer base. There is a limited amount of benefit it can gain from each individual source of money.
* Walmart is not targeted at the VERY poor, the ones who can't afford food. They don't have the power to influence Walmart.
* Even some of the VERY poor can buy food. They do have power.

    This is due to government intervention. In this case, government gives the VERY poor the power to influence Walmart. [Fortune says 18% of food stamps went to them in 2013.](http://fortune.com/2017/06/30/walmart-food-stamp/) [This document](http://www.eatdrinkpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/FoodStampsFollowtheMoneySimon.pdf) claims that: ""In two years, Walmart received about half of the one billion dollars in SNAP expenditures in Oklahoma"" (2009-2011).

    However, it's not relevant to my point WHY they can afford food, and I'm not interested in arguing for government. I just want to note that this isn't a good example of what the free market can do. Also, as a publicly-traded company, it has a duty to its investors to maximize company value, so _anything_ it does must be intended for the good of the company (e.g. public image), and any beneficiaries are incidental. Another reason why it's not a good example.

Now you give a mechanism by which the market corrects for discrimination when the power and money wants to maintain the status quo."

Thanks for trying."	0	0	stop arguing comment					"I find that this can be seen upon as greed or egotism, hower I simply see it from an economical standpoint.

When you're in a relationship, and you split up, you normally divide things by who it belongs to, even if there is a major difference or similarity in income. I bought the TV, I should keep the TV. You bought the couch, you should keep the couch.

This suddenly change when you enter marriage. The division is now 50/50, even though the contribution could be 90/10.

I come from en economic background, so I just see it as asset placement. The one who contributed the most, should have the most in a settlement.

I know there is such a thing as an enabler. If one partner allows the other partner to work more or be more effective, this can contribute to the overall utility of the home. I.e. the example of the 60's family where there is a houseworking woman and a working man. The woman does all the work at home, so the man can focuses on his work, bringing home income. However this model can't be accurately projected into the present world, where both men and women work equally and split house chores.

So I would find it completely valid if a woman, on average over the period of the marriage, contributed double what her husband did, she should receive double the amount of assets as him. The same goes the other way around.

Take an example of a firm on a stock market. There are 100 contributors to the firm (100 shareholders), 90 of these hold a total value of 9% of the firm i.e. 0.1% each. The remaining 10 hold a total value of 91% of the firm i.e. 9.1% each. If the firm closes down, the assets of the firm shouldn't be split in 100 equal parts. No, it should be split by contribution to the firm. The same goes if the firm produces a dividend, the dividend should be split according to contribution and not equally. This is also how firms legally work.

By splitting it equally it removes the incentive to invest more, why should I invest more than the bare minimum if I'm only able to receive the average under all circumstances?

Now take this back into the relationship, if my spouse produces x amount of income and ""invest"" it into our shared life (Contribution), why should I invest 2x or 100x? I know it's an extreme example, but it gets the point across. Only if I know that I can keep the difference, I have an incentive to invest. Everything else is irrational.

Please take in mind that I'm not up for the ""You bought this, you keep this"" mentality in a marriage, since you could have split your income in-equally i.e. I buy groceries for the month, and you buy the table and chairs we need. If one only buys all the necessary items like food and general supplies, this should be seen just as much of a contribution as buying a table and chairs, under the assumptions that these equal in cost. I'm only focusing on contribution.

As I said, I've not taken any sociologic or politologic assumptions into my thoughts, only the economical aspect.

Hope you can help me out here. I've presented my views to friends and family over the years and most of them sees this as greed or like I have egotistic views. I simply can't see why I should contribute with twice as much as my spouse and expect to share equally. Or how I cannot feel guilty by contributing half as much as my spouse and expect to receive equally. 

This is clearly hypothetical."	"Nicolasv2 @ 2018-01-29 12:36:21 :

Problem is that a lot of contributions are difficult to assess. 

House chores has to be done. How much should this be taken in account in the ""full economical"" point of view ? Hours at minimal wages ? Hours at your current wages in your work ? 

What if you got children ? You both wan them, but it's obviously the wife that is going to be pregnant, have to take some maternity leave etc. Maybe she'll miss a raise because of that, can you account it in contribution model ? 

Basically, the 50/50 split is saying ""we both contribute to our family in different ways, and as quantifying it is really too complicated, we consider we do half each"". 

*TL;DR*
If both of you are persuaded that one partner is going to contribute way more than the other, then a prenuptial agreement will be necessary. But people tend to consider than a relationship where there is a main contributor and a ""freeloader"" is not a healthy relationship, thus are retro-propagating this impression onto the agreement, which looks like ""ok, we are marrying knowing that we are in a dysfunctional relationship"", and it looks weird.

--------------------------------

Tarron @ 2018-01-29 13:18:46 :

Relevant point, thank you. Some contributions are difficult to asses, which can influence the ""model"" of contribution. This of course gives the model a certain misspecification, but I'm not really ready to reject it. As you said: if both of you are persuaded that one partner is going to contribute way more than the other, then a prenuptial agreement will be necessary. But I don't really see this freeloader example as valid here, yes, if one person intentionally doesn't give an effort into contributing it can be a problem. But, for example, if I am marrying a uneducated person with low job qualifications, this person could still work twice as hard as me i.e. putting in the effort, while still making a fraction of my wage if I am a highly educated person with a well paying job. 

I catch your drift here, there is a difference in prioritization that could be valid. The whole point of a relationship shouldn't be contributing via capital. 

So, just for fun, would there be a better measurement here? Maybe time spent contributing? i.e. if I work 40 hours a week and contribute 100% of my wage, I would put in 40 hours of contributed value. Next comes common goods, like picking the kids up from school, washing dishes etc. I know this kind of equation shouldn't be done, but it's still a valid way of operationalizing contribution, isn't it?

--------------------------------

Nicolasv2 @ 2018-01-29 13:41:07 :

&gt; But I don't really see this freeloader example as valid here, yes, if one person intentionally doesn't give an effort into contributing it can be a problem.

Even if one is unintentionally not contributing to the couple, it can be a problem for the one giving everything in a one way direction, isn't it ? 

&gt; for example, if I am marrying a uneducated person with low job qualifications, this person could still work twice as hard as me i.e. putting in the effort, while still making a fraction of my wage if I am a highly educated person with a well paying job

Yes, but in these cases, it would be easier for your relatives to say ""you are writing a prenuptial agreement, are you sure you love her"" to make you reconsider your mariage than saying ""she is not of the same socio-economic background than yours, these kind of couples with poor people are bad idea and never work"" which sounds pretty unpleasant to say.

&gt; So, just for fun, would there be a better measurement here ? 

Time spent seems a bad idea to me, as I'm french, and I see the drawbacks of such a reasoning in a lot of companies. People are obsessed with how much time they are at the office instead of how much they are really contributing. And obviously, you should prefer someone who do his job in 2 hours, and stay 2 at the office, than one who do half in 8, but stay 12 in the office. 

Efficient time spent would be good, but that would be overly difficult to measure. Maybe doing macro-estimations of the happiness each task give to the couple, and then dispatching that way. You can say for example that having big income gives you 10 points of happiness. Fully raising kids gives you 8, while keeping house in a good shape is 2, and eating well is 4. Then you divide this so that each one provide half of the needed happiness to your household. 

--------------------------------

beldaran1224 @ 2018-01-29 16:52:40 :

How is the freeloader example relevant to a prenuptial? When you marry someone who has vastly different income/work ethic, etc, you can account for this in a prenuptial agreement. Courts often take a very lopsided view of things and may not properly account for all of the factors. Who knows better than the people who lived it what works for them?

Furthermore, being able to navigate such an agreement is a fantastic test for marriage. Such complex situations mirror those seen when you share a life together.

&gt; How is the freeloader example relevant to a prenuptial ?

Because either you think that your vastly superior income is balanced by non-economical compensation given by your spouse (whatever it is kids raising, house chores, public image making etc.), either it is not.

In 1st case, you are saying ""well, I want to take all the non-economical advantages the marriage will give me, but once we divorce, I want to give no economical compensation over what I won"", which is pretty unacceptable from my point of view. In 2nd, then yea you are in a freeloader situation, as your spouse gives you nothing in exchange for what you are bringing. But in this case, agreement is not the problem, mariage is.

--------------------------------

beldaran1224 @ 2018-01-29 19:09:57 :

It may be unacceptable in your opinion, but that is so irrelevant, it's not even funny. The only people's feelings of acceptance that matter are the two signing the contract. Not sure why you think your feelings matter in someone else's relationship.

--------------------------------

Nicolasv2 @ 2018-01-29 20:08:01 :

&gt; It may be unacceptable in your opinion, but that is so irrelevant, it's not even funny

Don't understand where the funny part comes from. 

Anyway, I disagree with your statement for two reasons: 

We are discussing about whatever prenuptial agreement should have a negative stigmata or not, not whatever it should be forbidden. Thus, personal opinion is highly relevant, as we discuss about opinion other people than the spouses are having about it. 

Second reason is about this part.

&gt;The only people's feelings of acceptance that matter are the two signing the contract.

This is obviously false. A lot of contracts are forbidden by law, even if both parties want to sign it. And that's often the case with abusive contracts. And what I was describing previously clearly looks like an abusive contract, and as such could and should be forbidden.

--------------------------------

beldaran1224 @ 2018-01-29 21:05:27 :

1) ""its not even funny"" is an expression

2) Whether something should have a stigma or not should be determined by the harm it causes. Having a prenup does not harm, not having one can and *does*. It isn't about your opinion, its about whether things are right or wrong - which again, your opinion isn't relevant.

3) Obviously false? Hardly. Prenups are not abusive, not even a little. Do you have even a sliver of a reason for suggesting they are, or are you basing it off of your harmful and poisonous view of marriage? 50% of marriages end in divorce, clearly, society's view of marriage is *wrong*.

--------------------------------

Nicolasv2 @ 2018-01-30 08:03:36 :

&gt; Whether something should have a stigma or not should be determined by the harm it causes;

Personal opinion here. I may agree with you, but following your logic, it isn't relevant. You see the problem ? If you are debating over opinions, you can't just remove the ones you don't like with a ""your opinion isn't relevant"", or else you will never be able to exchange.

&gt; It isn't about your opinion, its about whether things are right or wrong 

Do you realize that there is no absolute right or wrong, it all depend on each person/country set of personal values ? Back to square 1, personal opinions.

&gt; Prenups are not abusive, not even a little

When you see the number of voided prenups, a part of them are. 

&gt; or are you basing it off of your harmful and poisonous view of marriage

Personal attack, could you refrain from doing that, or if necessary for the debate, put up sources on what part of my view is proven as poisonous and harmful (side note: I haven't talked about my view of mariage, so it's ambitious to debunk it anyway).

&gt; 50% of marriages end in divorce, clearly, society's view of marriage is wrong

In that case, don't marry if mariage is wrong. I don't see what the problem is. Mariage is a specific institution with a given set of rules, considering that as soon as you marry, you are considered as ""a team"", sharing the good and the bad. If you don't want it, just don't go inside this institution, no one is forcing you ...

First, guns aren't the problem.  27 of the largest 28 mass shooting incidents were committed by fatherless sons.

&gt; Gun ranges should be scarce and expensive due to low demand. Etc etc. Only then will the gun problem be solved.

You make the argument to get rid of gun ranges, but then you state:

&gt; Not to mention that even if you are able to draw your weapon in time, you're probably not going to hit your target, statistically.

So you are ok with people owning guns, but you want to get rid of the one safe environment where they can take their weapon and practice how to use it properly?

&gt; Guns shouldn't be seen as the go to self-defense method, martial arts should be.

So if you are a victim of a home invasion against 3 armed intruders, your solution is to Bruce Lee your way out of it?  A little common sense please?

There are far more defensive gun uses where the gun isn't even fired compared to instances where guns are used to commit a crime / do harm.

Are you familiar with Kennesaw, Georgia where by law at least one person in every household must own a gun and where they have the lowest crime rate in the country?

&gt; In 2001, violent crime rates were about 60% below national and state rates. Property crime rates were from 46–56% below national and state rates.



--------------------------------

Critical7world @ 2018-02-22 18:16:59 :

Not OP, but I just want to point out using a single law in a single city of barely 30,000 people is a poor way of making parallels with nation-wide statistics. Sure mandatory gun ownership could help drive crime down, but then so could a half hundred other things. I could just as well make the claim Japan is so crime-free because of its lack of guns, but in reality, the cause of crime is never so simple.

--------------------------------

jgagnon_in_FL @ 2018-02-22 18:21:00 :

Its a data point that should not be ignored.  Do you have a valid argument to explain such a disparity in crime that refutes the premise that gun ownership was not responsible?  Again, guns are not the problem and this is a perfect example of WHY they are not the problem since they are used MORE OFTEN in defensive gun usages compared to OFFENSIVE and harmful situations.  When you create these Gun-free zones they create a breeding ground for mass shootings, the solution is to have select armed personnel to minimize the damage done when these events happen.  Just like brandishing a weapon prevents crime without firing a shot, having known armed personnel on site will DISCOURAGE these mass shootings from picking juicy targets where maximum damage can take place with ZERO RESISTANCE.

--------------------------------

Critical7world @ 2018-02-22 19:10:21 :

I don't want to argue about gun control, nor do I think arguing about it would change either of our minds about it.

On the data point argument, generally, factors such as vastly lower population (compared to most large cities), higher than average median income, and around (if not slightly lower than) national level % poverty rate, all could have (and probably did) contribute to a low crime rate. And that's without accounting for stuff like unemployment rate, the education rate, the general geographic location, etc...

jgagnon_in_FL @ 2018-02-22 20:03:13 :

You really do know NOTHING about Kennesaw, GA.

http://rense.com/general9/gunlaw.htm

&gt; Several Kennesaw officials attribute a drop in crime in the city over the past two decades to a law that requires residents to have a gun in the house.
 
&gt; In 1982, the Kennesaw City Council unanimously passed a law requiring heads of households to own at least one firearm with ammunition.
 
&gt; The ordinance states the gun law is needed to ""protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.""
 
&gt; Then-councilman J.O. Stephenson said after the ordinance was passed, everyone ""went crazy.""
 
&gt; ""People all over the country said there would be shootings in the street and violence in homes,"" he said. ""Of course, that wasn't the case.""
 
&gt; In fact, according to Stephenson, it caused the crime rate in the city to plunge.
 
&gt; Kennesaw Historical Society president Robert Jones said **following the law's passage, the crime rate dropped 89 percent in the city, compared to the modest 10 percent drop statewide.**
 
&gt; ""It did drop after it was passed,"" he said. **""After it initially dropped, it has stayed at the same low level for the past 16 years.""**

--------------------------------

Critical7world @ 2018-02-22 20:41:57 :

I never claimed to know anything about Kennesaw Georgia, I just said it alone is certainly not enough evidence to go by to make nation-wide policy. Nor do I think statements by some political officials is a real counterargument to what I am saying. You can dig up quotes by people associating lower crime with anything if you try hard enough. Doesn't mean that is the only thing to go on.

Wow, so now you are disputing crime stats in a city where crime dropped 89% after legislation required gun ownership in every household AND STAYED AT THAT LOW LEVEL FOR THE NEXT 16 YEARS.  You truly are dense.

Every time this issue gets brought up, it feels like people are underestimating the range of human physical diversity. Assuming we're talking about people who have transitioned and medically (hormonally) align with the sector they're competing in, I don't see any issue.

Someone who was assigned male at birth but is now female, is as guilty of having an unfair advantage as another girl on a team who just happens to be much taller/heavier/faster/stronger than their teammates.

Don't we all know girls who are better at certain sports than a huge number of guys we know? Don't we all know guys who are worse at certain sports than a huge number of girls we know? C'mon.

There is no debate. Men are athletically superior to females, which makes it unfair to pit the genders against one another in this kind of competition

Which is why it would be more correct to have transitioned trans men compete with other men, and transitioned trans women to compete with other women. We know now after studying it, that physical ability is basically the same (as much as you can say that in science) post-transition

That’s not my call to make, but if I had to make it, maybe I’d agree with you; I liked the old definition.”


Edit: I think you’re right about it being a “linguistic shell game,” and that’s *exactly why* I advocate using the clunkier term “race-based prejudice.” They can’t dispute what that phrase means without undermining their own “racism = prejudice + power” formula. Get rid of the shells and stop arguing about what the word “racism” means or should mean, and start discussing whether the new law is racially prejudiced. The linguistic debate is a distraction from the policy discussion, and the policy discussion is more important.

Not everyone using the new definition does so disingenuously, and this is a good mechanism for clarifying to the good-willed what your position actually is. It clarifies for your would-be allies and undermines the go-to criticism of your rivals."	3	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]	"Polychrist @ 2018-03-12 22:03:21 :

I’d like to clarify a couple of misunderstandings for you before I try to change your view.

First: 

&gt; I don’t know what to call this group of people that share this belief.

“Sociologists.” You can call them sociologists, or armchair sociologists, because sociology is where the “racism= prejudice + power” equation came from.

Second: the caveat:

&gt; ...if the person in power is white

Isn’t a true part of the equation, but I understand why you would think that it is. The thing is, “power” here is usually understood as *institutional* power, which means that the local race with the most societal power is the one capable of racism. Although in western society this generally means “white people,” the term itself is still considered universal because it implies that a white person cannot be racist in China (where they’re institutionally discriminated against).

And to this extent I think that you’re right. There is too much quibbling over terminology when racial issues are on the table, and the new (not *that* new, it’s been here since the 70s but it’s still far from universally taught) definition for racism isn’t what people using the term mean by it.

In a way it’s similar to how herbal remedies used to be called “medicine,” but today “medicine” generally refers to something much stronger. The terminology is just shifting and it’s leading to confusion. Some people use the new technical definition and deride those still calling herbs “medicine,” while others say “herbs have always been medicine, why are you redefining what ‘medicine’ is?” And this means that when people use the new terminology, they’re doing it because they think it is  *more correct*. **They do not use the new definition for purely selfish and prejudiced reasons.**

But again, I think you’re right that hinging a debate on the definition of “racism” is logically insufficient and serves as a logistical barrier to true discussion. Lately I’ve been advocating that we (those of us who prefer the older, “racism= prejudice due to race” definition) concede the term at least within the context of debates and instead use “race-based prejudice” when we want to call something biased against the currently institutionally-empowered race.

So if a new law says: “employers must hire minorities before whites unless they can provide documentation as to why the minority applicant is unable to perform the job,” you might want to call this a racist policy. But what you really mean by that is that it is a racially prejudiced policy. So I think it would be to your advantage to say the latter.

If you call such a policy racist, you’re right, lots of people (especially on your side of aisle) will jump on you and say that such a policy can not possibly be “racist.” “It’s *anti*-racist!” They’ll say, “it takes *away* from the race with the most institutional power!” And they’re not wrong. At least, not as they understand the term.

Now, *should* we be redefining racism? Maybe. Maybe not. I once heard Larry Elder say that, “if you don’t think a black man with a brick beating a white man to death has power over him, I’m not sure what you think power is.” Or something along those lines. Should “racist” have to imply institutional power? That’s not my call to make, but if I had to make it, maybe I’d agree with you; I liked the old definition. 

But people aren’t *wrong* or *racist* themselves for using the new definition. So because of this, I think your position is wrong. Chalk it up to a miscommunication caused by two sides each seeking a monopoly on what the six-letter syntax is allowed to mean. It is, really, a war over language and definitions, not the *meaning* behind the words. The option is still there to say what you mean without reliance on a word stuck in no-man’s land.

--------------------------------

robobreasts @ 2018-03-12 23:34:47 :

&gt; And this means that when people use the new terminology, they’re doing it because they think it is more correct. They do not use the new definition for purely selfish and prejudiced reasons.

It used to be that ""phone"" meant ""landline phone"" and ""cell phone"" meant mobile device.

But now ""phone"" means ""mobile phone"" and ""landline"" means landline phone.

That change makes sense because the use of cell phones exploded.

But ""institutional racism"" is a perfectly fine way to describe ""prejudice + power"" and ""racism"" is a perfectly fine way to describe ""prejudice based on race.""

There is no need to change ""racism"" to mean only ""institutional racism.""  Further, the people I see pushing this change really do appear to be doing it purely to say things like ""black people can't be racists.""  But they are saying that to people they KNOW are using ""racism = prejudice based on race"" so it's a dishonest linguistic shell game.

Because they aren't saying, ""Yes, black people can be racists the way you are using the word, which is the historical definition.  But in modern sociology racism means institutional racism...""

They're saying ""your definition of racism is wrong and you are wrong.""  It's a way to be right ""by definition"" which is the shittiest of all ways to try to win an argument.

I mean, I'm against both racism and institutional racism, and I think the people trying to redefine racism are doing a disservice to racial discussions by trying to insulate ""their side"" from any possible charge of wrongdoing.  That's really how it comes across.

I mean, I do computer stuff, but if you call a mosquito a bug, I don't tell you, ""Well, *actually*, a bug is an error in computer code"" like you're using it wrong.

I feel like the people using the new definition need to be understanding and accommodating and recognize they are using a NEW word, and not act like it has always meant that.

If they win, and 50 years from now racism does mean only ""institutional racism"" then they'll have a point.

But right now, they really don't.  Sociologists don't get to define regular English words by fiat any more than computer scientists do.  If they're jargon is popular and catches on, then the language will change, but they cannot just decide it on their own.

If the majority of English speakers disagree with me, then well, I'll be outvoted.  Language is the purest form of democracy.  But I'm *pretty sure* that rank-and-file people still using ""racism"" to mean ""prejudice based on race"" and don't want to start saying ""prejudice based on race"" because it's clunky.

And I'm pretty sure a number of folks are confused about the same word meaning two different things and they say ""black people can't be racist"" and aren't really making any distinction between the meanings... which some might wonder if that isn't part of the point."	"TrueGrey @ 2018-03-15 23:17:35 :

Damn, this thread really unravelled the knot here.  Well said.

I love how everybody ignores how they've conveniently erased ANY term from meaning the traditional definition of racism, but when you replace it with ""race-based prejudice,"" at least we can still reference it without having SJWs screeching about their new definition in reply and derailing the discussion."

While I agree with banning autistic and retarded since they are often used by the right as insults, I don't agree with banning stupid or dumb.

My reasoning for this is that words like autistic very clearly refer to a specific group of people, and as such, they're slurs. The n-word is only used in reference to black people. That's why it is a slur. As I see it, words are only slurs if they can only be applied to certain individuals based on bodily characteristics. If I were to call someone an ass, that's not a slur because it can be applied to anyone, regardless of their abilities, race, or gender. Stupid and dumb both imply that someone is less mentally capable than someone else, however the context for the words are usually much different and only apply to specific moments. People apply those words to individual actions, like 'wow, that was a dumb thing to do' and other times will call someone stupid because of an action they performed, such as with 'that person is stupid as all hell' (after seeing them run in front of traffic, or something). 

Furthermore, retard and autist are both shortened version of retarded and autistic, and both of these words refer to people with different developmental traits. They are used outside of insults to literally refer to people medically. Stupid and dumb, however, aren't attached to any sort of medical condition. They aren't shortened versions of 'stupidation' or 'dumbtism', they're their own words that refer, generally, to doing something irrationally. Often times, they are interchangeable with words like silly, though they carry a slightly different meaning, which is why they are used.

I'm a socialist, and I agree with ableism in general. The purpose of this post isn't to try and convince me that ableism is or is not a real issue, or that I should avoid all ableist words and phrases. I'm asking other leftists why stupid and dumb specifically should be used when, as I see it, they are usually harmless and aren't used to demean specific groups of people.

Having a low IQ isn't necessarily a mental disability or proof of mental ineptitude. Having a disability might mean you have a low IQ, but having a low IQ doesn't mean that you have a disability.

Obviously the law needs a cutoff IQ for legal disability (IQ 70) but I hope you aren't suggesting that morally it's okay to demean the less abled as long as they aren't legally classified as disabled.

I'd also avoid the word ""normal"" in that usage to suggest people with disabilities are abnormal...

The literal definitions of normal and abnormal are conforming to or not conforming to a standard. The standard for humanity is 'not having a disability' so having one is literally abnormal. I don't see how those words of all things can be offensive. Yes, people with disabilities are abnormal. If I cut my arm off tomorrow then I would become abnormal because most people have arms.

I hope you're not suggesting that morally it's okay to quantify people by their IQ's, by the way.

But words like dumb and stupid are rarely ever said with those people in mind. If and when I've used it it has been in reference to a specific action someone performed.

Stop arguing against things I am not even mentioning. Democracy either won't work in America because of logistics. That's why America has nothing to do with this discussion: My original proposal was that this only affects democratic nations. 

&gt;That's basically Athenian democracy

[It really isn't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy)

It's the exact opposite. I can understand the misunderstanding, however.

&gt;Even though people may disagree with politicians decisions doesn't mean it isn't better that politicians have the ability to make decisions.

That is not what is being removed here. Politicians have the same power."	1	0	stop arguing comment					"#The proposal

For any democratic system, any bill or local decision should be able to be vetoed out by the citizens of the state/city/county/etc

#Why:

In local level, this can easily be used to prevent corruption inside city planning and construction work. It also gives citizen more power and choice: The citizen can veto more factories and apartments from being planned.

In bigger picture, this rule change can prevent anything from EU restrictions (if even by forcing the country's representitives to vote certain way) and prevent laws the main populus heavily disagrees with.

#How:

When a certain amount of the populus, from 30-10% sign up a veto petition, the law change cannot pass until the poll is done. All citizen (depending on the should be able to vote ""yes"" or ""no vote"" (not sure if there should be ""no"" vote) in the local poll stations. The votes then choose if the decision is vetoed or not. In most ideal world, this vote should also include a checkbox to impeach the politician(s) who ran the bill in the goverment, to prevent trying to get the decision through multiple times and give incentive not to go test your luck as politician.

Of course, this veto should not be able to be used against emergency powers or anything of such magnitude, for obvious reasons.

EDIT: I would also add taxes to the list of things that can't be vetoed.

EDIT: The 30% might be too small amount for local elections. A big union of workers could easily overturn any law that hurts them, especially if most workers are in that field.

There's lots of reasons countries don't use Athenian democracy. I'll focus on just one. Logistics.

There are so many laws being passed and having a national vote to veto every law would be an absolute shit show. Even presidential elections every 4 years are kind of shit shows that cost a lot of money, disrupt everyone's Tuesday, and there's usually some controversy about missing ballots and voter fraud. If we can barely make a vote happen every four years, how do you think we could make a vote happen (potentially) for every law passed? Most laws that are passed are opposed by 30% of people.

Also, we'd need to levy a big tax to pay for all these nationwide veto votes (elections are hella expensive). That's a bill I would veto!

&gt;Hurting most of the populous does not help anyone in a democracy&gt;

Now you're assuming that laws that people can't agree on necessarily hurt them. The fact is, decisions must be made in government.

It's already been proven that men are quite literally physically more capable than women. This isn't some some of sex issue, it's just a simple fact of life. Just like how women can give birth to a child, a man can throw a ball a little bit better than women. Men have been proven to just be better physically. Since the 80's, both the top\-class male and female athletes have competed in the Olympics, and their scores are always around 90&amp;#37; of that of men at the top level. An explanation held across many studies is increased hemoglobin count due to increased testosterone in men's bodies, which increases the amount of available oxygen consumption in men. This is absolutely not sexist men trying to feel superior about their gender or anything, this has been proven through observational studies already.	12	0	stop arguing comment					"So the following conversation is being ascribed to Rafael Nadal as a part of some interview.

*Q: “In tennis, should women earn as much as men?”*

*Nadal: “It’s a comparison we shouldn’t even make. Female models earn more than male models and nobody says anything. Why? Because they have a larger following. In tennis too, who gathers a larger audience earns more”.*

This is an English translation of a statement printed in an Italian language magazine for an interview that probably happened in Spanish, so it's quite possible his actual statement was not the same.

To me, this statement makes perfect sense. If Maria Sharapova or Serena Williams attract more viewers (or are able to sell more expensive tickets) than Andy Murray, they should get more money \- no question about it. To me it seems like feminists want to push for equality in places where they are at a disadvantage, but want to do nothing about situations where they are at an advantage, are likely to be paid more, or are more likely to be hired in the first place (models, porn stars, massage therapists, hospitality industry jobs, and so on).

But some feminists I follow, whose views I otherwise respect, are unhappy with the statement without specifying any valid reason.

I'd love to hear the other side of the story on this one.

***Edit***: this blew up way beyond my ability to handle all your replies! The only consensus seems to be that the quote, in isolation, is not wrong, but the broader issue of gender pay gap is anything but this simple. The examples of US women's soccer and UFC were enlightening and something I didn't know previously.

I don’t think anywone would say that it’s wrong that more popular  athletes get more money, but is it not worth knowing whether the conditions under which they compete are equal?

The qoute uses a free market logic where the best product is rewarded more, but if tennis did not exist then there would be no demand, it is not something that comes naturally to humans. Surely it is then worth asking why there is a difference.

--------------------------------

_smartalec_ @ 2018-06-10 12:34:40 :

That's a fair argument.

But aren't women at a natural disadvantage when it comes to sports? The baseball pitch speed record, for example, is 169 km/h for men, and 111 km/h for women.

A counter\-argument I could make is, men who can pitch more than 100 km/h should get paid the same as women who can pitch more than 100 km/h. But men in this category would be considered average while women at this level would compete in elite tournaments.

In any case, I absolutely agree that we should look at the root causes behind the difference in viewership. If they are addressable and lead to an equal demand, women would automatically get paid more. I do not see it contradicting with the statement Nadal made.

Edit:

&gt;I don’t think anywone would say that it’s wrong that more popular athletes get more money,

You'd be surprised by the kind of arguments I'm stumbling upon on Twitter. I'm scrolling through multiple popular threads genuinely looking for a sane counter\-response but all I see is irrationally agitated folks.

The ceiling of play for men’s professional baseball is much higher, not because a woman can’t throw a baseball that fast but because she doesn’t need to. Men’s baseball has been around for 150-odd years, and has had that long to become a massively established name that attracts talent worldwide. As a sport (or anything) gets bigger, they attract more talent which inevitably rises to the top.

UEMcGill @ 2018-06-10 13:48:06 :

A woman will never be able to throw at the same level as top competition in baseball.  She is not built the same way as a man.  She will *never* be the same as a man.  The oft sited grip test study, or Marine Corps Physical test, etc. women on a raw strength are not nearly as strong as men.  Biology has seen to it that men have testosterone coursing through their vanes from puberty until death.  

Take basketball.  In the US it is on par with men and women.  Title 9 says that for every men's scholarship there needs to be a women's scholarship.  Yet in all of college basketball, I've only seen a woman dunk once.  Men and women have the same opportunity in school, the same number of spots, yet the elite athelete's will always be male.

No publisher is going to come to your house and confiscate your game disc just because your not following their rules that you didn't agree to. Now stop arguing semantics or leave.	1	0	stop arguing comment					"I'm going to sound like a spoiled brat who's cutting his nose to spite his face but I don't care. I'm not here to change what people think about me I'm here cause I want you to change my mind about PC gaming. That said let's begin.

I don't think consoles are better than PC. I know that PC is ""objectively better"" However I hate that even though PC is better I still can't have my cake and eat it too. I just ~~hate~~ abhor it's disadvantages with purple passion and red fury. My first problem is digital games. Digital PC games have made physical games on all platforms an endangered species. Why? Because of convenience. Progress for the sake of convenience instead of quality is stupid. I'm an audiophile, videophile, archivist, and preservationist. One of the things AA and AAA developers do to digital games is compress audio, video, and other data so that you can fit more than 10 games on hard drive or solid state drive. I think that's BS, if a game is 50 gigs it should stay 50 gigs, if a game is over 100 gigs it should stay over 100 gigs. I want no worse than ""good"" not ""decent"" ""good."" I still buy CD's, records, laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-Ray. I watch and play most of my classic movies and games on CRTs. I even get movies on VHS and betamax. Analog audio and video has always sounded and looked better unless you're listing to FLAC or watching it on a DCP. That last one is only better if the film it was shot on was 35mm instead of 605 or 70mm. You also can't collect PC games. They don't appreciate in value, you can't display them beyond small ass digital cover art, they don't have rarity Worst of all you don't even own them thanks to DRM. They are horrible for archiving and preservation too because you don't actually own them. And don't say ""you don't own physical games because of IP laws..."" Wrong I don't own the game but I do own the copy of my game and that can't be revoked. Using flat DVD cases I can also store more AA and AAA games in my broom closet than on a 2 TB hardrive or solid state drive. Out of 10000 games on Steam only \~200 are DRM free. Also, don't direct me to GOG. Most of those games are indie shovelware and super-weeb games that haven't been patched since Barbie's last square meal. No rarity, no value, no ownership, no display, no deal.

Second thing I hate, the prices. You can say that they are cheaper in the long run but that depends on how you buy. I'm poor, I live in the slums of Sector 5. Some out in the cosmos, be it God, Mother Nature, or a conscious manifestation of the universe wants me to be poor. To stick it to them, I spend all extra expenditures on things that increase my net-worth. People on r/pcmasterrace say settle for decent, cheap, or low-end parts and upgrade as I go along. By the time it takes me to do that I could spend all the time it takes me to build a high end gaming rig I could be picking and repairing, or collecting books, movies, games and other media. Spending 6\~12 months working on building a PC is a stupid $#!+ hobby because it would decrease my net-worth while I'm doing it and the profits I get from the after wouldn't be enough to compensate (I'm not happy unless profits are at least 10&amp;#37; higher than what I spent). If I'm buying a PC it's going to be high end, it's going to last me a decade or more, and I'm going to buy it all at once. The tower and part's inside over $1000 USD give or take inflation. I only want the fastest ports and buses, the fastest and most powerful processors, and the highest amount of RAM and writable memory. It also needs a Blu-Ray drive. A good monitor will be $100\~200 USD, a gaming mouse and key board plus other peripherals will cost me 30$ each, and I'd get warranties because If a single thing breaks I'm getting it replaced or every cent refunded. Yes I am the kind of person who cares more about his net worth as a financial statistic than my sentimental worth as a person. I also think that if PC is objectively the best platform than I am ethically entitled to the best experience. Also I don't care if PC games **can** be cheaper thanks to steam and GOG. I hate Valve's business practices, and I don't want to wait 6 months to 5 years for the price to be marked down or it becomes DRM free on GOG. I play games when they are relevant, classic or retro, or when I'm interested. Speaking of which I don't play indie games unless the devs or pubs spend at least $100K on marketing.

Third thing I hate is the lack of portability. Don't bring up GPD Win because it's an unergonomic mess, and don't bring up laptops because they are way too expensive for what they are worth. I love all my handheld consoles. My game gear, my GBA, my 3DS, My PSP, my PS Vita, and my Neo Geo Pocket Color. I need something ergonomic that I can take out of my pocket, turn on, and play. You can't do that with a laptop of any size. A laptop is something I'd take with me to work or school and play on when I have free time. I know I said quality over convenience but the latter still matters and a laptop isn't convenient at all.

EDIT: I should make clear. I know that handheld gaming devices will most likely never be the same caliber as PCs and home consoles so I'm willing to make a compromise for them since the portability outweighs the disadvantage."	"Unfortunate2 @ 2018-06-20 08:17:25 :

&gt;Digital PC games have made physical games on all platforms an endangered species. Why? Because of convenience.

Convenience for most buyers, and cheaper for devs. The devs get more money by reducing or cutting out the extra costs of selling physical copies. There's the packaging and disc itself, then they need to sell it to a distributor who has to take a larger chunk because they're employing workers to move and sell the game. There's more people taking a chunk of the profit so they can afford the higher cost needed to sell it. That isn't the case online, allowing distributors to take a smaller part of the profits, and giving the devs more to cover the cost of making the game, maintaining the game, adding to the game, and working on the next game. They couldn't give a damn about convenience if the profits were similar. 

Physical games are dying because it's now incredibly easy to distribute the same thing for cheaper digitally.

I think you are mixing some things. Downloads are obviously compressed, it makes no sense to download things uncomprossed, that's just a waste of bandwidth. The same is true for saving things to a DVD, they need the space, so they compress it on the DVD and extract it to your hard drive.

The point I'm trying to make is that there shouldn't be any compression on PC when PC is capable of so much more. I understand compression for handhelds, consoles, and smart devices but why not allow users to choose between compressed and uncompressed installation?

Look, the reason I keep saying ""for all intents and purposes"" is because nobody gives a shit (pardon my French) about the law beyond piracy. It's like making out, loitering, and cursing. All of those are illegal to do in public but people do them in public anyways. Sometimes in front of cops, and sometimes cops are the ones doing it. So long as you don't distribute illegal copies or open an unregistered library or arcade that gives anyone and everyone unrestricted access to it, nobody cares. The producers, nor distributors, nor the publishers are gonna stop me from doing whatever I want with it unless they are losing money. I can burn it, I can trade it, I can sell it, I can reverse engineer, I can make copies (so long as I don't distribute them), I can find a way to rewright code. I can buy out an entire store's stock and start giving them to random people. They don't care what I do with the game **so long as they don't lose money even if what I'm doing is illegal**. If they don't enforce the law then the law is irrelevant. I'm not saying words don't have meaning I'm saying the meaning doesn't matter unless the entitled want it to and right now the entitled don't want it to. So I'll say this one last time until the SWAT comes busting down my do for not playing the game the way it was meant to I'm gonna claim to own the damn game.

Britain is not socialist oh my fucking bologna sandwich I cannot imagine you just said that. They are the global capital of liberal democratic capitalism. I'm blown away right now that you consider Britain to be a socialist economy.

Fascism does not mean 'jailing a man for a joke.' please Google the term. It's a political system, not an individual policy position. Stop arguing in bad faith.

I mean this with genuine love; If you think sexism, anti gay, and hardline pro-life are dominant views in the USA you are very deep inside an echo chamber. You will have a much happier and fulfilling life once you have a more realistic worldview and start being grateful. 

The media and politicians have a blatant incentive to make you angry and vastly exaggerate the extent of your victimhood.

That’s what I’m talking about. I have gay, black, latino, Muslim, and female friends that support Trump. You probably do too but they keep it to themselves because you obviously don’t.

Also, it can be helpful to break down a party/ideology into sub divisions so that we don’t conflate sub groups that have conflicting views. So for me, I understand that on the left neoliberals are very different than Bernie supporters or actual socialists. 

(These lists are not perfect) On the right; there is a (small?) ultra conservative evangelical group, there are many right leaning moderate libertarians, tea party small government types, and a kind of pro-Trump, anti-establishment group that is very critical of any non-MAGA Republican. 

The places you get your information from have a very strong economic incentive to vastly exaggerate the amount of racists, sexists, and homophobes in the world. These things certainly exist but scale is everything. There is much ignorance on both sides.

A good scientist will do their best to disprove their own conclusions to check their own bias and make sure they’ve considered everything.

So maybe a good start point would be “to what extent are Trump supporters racist?”  Come up with an appropriate and realistic definition ahead of time.

r/askthe_donald might be a good place to start. Maybe something like; “I’m under the impression that Trump supporters are pretty racist but I’m looking for information that suggests otherwise to ensure I have the full picture. How do you define racism and could you share some sources and arguments with me as to why they aren’t?”

This isn't science. I'm not testing the theory that gay people deserve to live free of discrimination. And, if I were, there are no arguments out there that I haven't heard.

I have studied political theory, and recognize all the countries in the world outside of the US. The US is a radical right wing nation where our political parties are shifted quite to the right. The democrats are universally considered a center-right party everywhere outside of the US, we've just experienced several decades of propaganda redefining our society.

Can I ask what your definition of neoliberalism is? I mean I've never seen anyone outside of the US/anyone who has studied politics who considers it anything else than center-right.

vacuousaptitude @ 2018-06-27 23:13:28 :

You're repeating propaganda, not data. 

Tens of millions are dying every year right now from preventable causes that we allow to continue because they aren't profitable. There is no less censorship in a capitalist economy than a communist one. In the US communists were imprisoned and/or assassinated by the government during the cold war. Bombs have been dropped from airplanes onto striking workers in America by American police. American citizens are in those concentration camps we have on the border right now. 

Capitalist America had human slaves. Capitalist America had segregation. Capitalist America committed genocide against the native Americans. Has invaded dozens of countries to overthrow democratically elected governments. 

Yes the Soviet Unions socilaist revolution failed, it became a state capitalist society under Stalin. And he did a lot of horrible thing that shouldn't be forgiven. 

But you cannot say these are features of leftist economics. When even worse harms are happening all the world over right now. 

I didn't call you names. Don't out words in my mouth. I called you uninformed. Which you seem to be. You also seem very much to view the world in black and white. Socialism bad capitalism good.

StupidFrik @ 2018-06-27 23:46:25 :

You see the problem with that is that slavery happened in most places at one point. You act like capitalism had anything to do with slavery. You make me laugh by saying IM the one spewing propaganda, that's exactly what you're  doing. 

Communism led to 30,000,000 deaths alone in Soviet Russia.


Not to mention the people at the border are NOT US citizens. They hopped the border illegally so they are not citizens. That's pretty uneducated. Communism is a leftist idea. You also mention how America conquered countries. You mean like how Russia conquered Germany and hurt those who didn't even associate with the National Socialists, or like how it was Britain and France who killed the Indians? How about how in Britain, a socialist society, a man nearly got sentenced to prison for making a joke? Sounds quite fascist to me. Communism fails everytime.


 Look at NK for an example, all of the country is in poverty. The leader kills them if they say anything bad about him. You say ""concentration camps"" at the border
1. Half those ""heartbreaking photos/sounds"" were staged as literal propaganda.
2. Did concentration camps have billiard tables and guards to care for them? No?

3. The border stations don't kill people, communism does.

4. Remember the gulag? An ACTUAL concentration camp.

I do not see the world in black in white. I don't see the opposing opinion as mustache twirling baddies like you do. im not as uneducated as your strawman leads you to believe.

Cheers.

What about Trian Basescu, who killed two million. Maybe your best bud North Korea, who executed people based on their belief. What about Mao Zedong? He killed 45 million of starvation alone. The great purge? 1 million dead. Communism may have killed 148,000,000 alone. I can go on and on. No need to call names. You call then concentration camps but no one has been gassed or executed like what the Nazis or Communists did. The billiard was for the kids too. 

You never brought up my point that most sad things about these borders centers was staged for propaganda. I have links to prove that most photos suggesting kids were put into cages or that sad girl were all faked.

To me racism is racism. Do people think because white people have historically been terrible to black peoplepr that some white people are racist that it justifies racism against them? That's not going to fix anything. Two wrongs don't make a right, it's that simple.
"	"king_nine @ 2018-08-04 15:03:12 :

This is a common misunderstanding that stems from two different definitions of the word ""racism."" One comes from everyday language, and the other comes from an academic context.

Your paragraph at the end, rhetorically asking if historic racism by white people ""justifies"" current racial prejudice against white people, is using the normal colloquial use of the word racism. This means: *racial discrimination between individuals.* When one person judges another purely on the basis of race, by this definition, it is racist, and therefore on this level racism against white people is wrong.

However, oftentimes when people use the word racism, they use it in a sociological sense. This has a  slightly different definition: *racial discrimination between groups.* This deals with historical facts about race relations and how those facts got us to where we are in the present. Unlike in definition 1 above, individual actions that happen by themselves are only important based on how they relate to this history. 

For example, take the issue of blackface. By definition 1 here, blackface may or may not be racist. If someone paints their face to look like another race, this in and of itself may not be offensive. But obviously we cringe at it today, and this is because we have some intuitions about definition 2. Blackface, historically, has been used in the US to mock and denigrate an entire race of people, and this perpetuated a culture that wanted to keep black Americans second class citizens. ""Whiteface,"" while bizarre, would not be as offensive, because it lacks the historical context of oppression.

That last bit is the key. Racial discrimination against white people can be very rude and unpleasant on a personal level. But the word racism often implies things beyond the personal, and into the historical or societal. As tempting as it is to say ""replace the word white with the word black and it becomes offensive, therefore this is racist against white people,"" we have to consider that US history has treated white people and black people differently, and that this is part of the very definition of racism.

Tl;dr racism has a historical component that makes discrimination against white people less harmful

--------------------------------

Tedesche @ 2018-08-04 15:25:12 :

Differences in historical context are important to note, but I think denying that something is racist, simply because it’s directed towards a group that has not historically been oppressed is wrong, and largely just an attempt to deny them the right to claim racial victimhood. It’s still racism, it’s just that it may not have the same impact as other types. Furthermore, people who say racist things about whites are still racist. Denying that racism is the right word to use for it, quite frankly, is racist IMO.

ShaoLimper @ 2018-08-04 15:38:51 :

I agree with you. /u/king_nine definition is a complete load in my opinion. It sounds like an excuse by someone that lives by the lives of their ancestors and not in the modern world.

They basically make it sound like ""your ancestors didn't suffer, so you should..."" racism is racism no matter your race or colour.

Tedesche @ 2018-08-04 15:57:17 :

I don’t really understand why it’s so hard for some people to wrap their heads around equal treatment. That people were treated differently in the past is not a justification for treating present-day racism differently now, based purely on who it’s directed at and the history of their race.

Varying levels of sympathy for the plights of different people is normal. Are you as sympathetic to white, male victims of systemic discrimination as you are to any other group? 

All that matters is that one believe people should be treated equally, rather than make racist/sexist rationalizations for why its not as bad to treat some groups poorly compared to others. "

This provides a powerful incentive to a CEO to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. The downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low-skill workers, with CEOs making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage. Therefore, I think that as well as being tied to stock, CEO salary should also be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers	"Highlyasian @ 2018-08-09 13:58:34 :

This has been tried before, and it just didn't work. Ben &amp; Jerry's operated under this model and as it grew it was unable to attract capable talent to lead it given the 5x rule because of how growth scales.

You also have to remember that organizations are shaped like pyramids and the impact of decision making gets bigger the higher up you go. Lets stay with Ice Cream and look at 5 levels:

* Hourly Employee in a Ben &amp; Jerry's Store
* Manager of Ben &amp; Jerry's Store
* District Manager of Ben &amp; Jerry's Northeast
* VP Of Product Management Ben &amp; Jerry's International
* CEO

The hourly employee's work is really limited. If he does an amazing job, he makes a few customers happier and the store may become more profitable because they gained repeat customers. If he messes up an order or gives poor service, the damage is limited to the customers he interacted with during his shift. Lets say this employee will serve 20 people in a shift.

The Manager's work is slightly less limited. Everything this manager does affects the store and all of its customers that passes through from opening til closing and they make much more important decisions like ordering inventory. If they order too much of a flavor that won't sell they lose money when they toss it out, and if they don't stock enough of a popular flavor they miss out on sales. Everything the Manager does impacts the hourly employees underneath them. Lets say that there's 10 employees in his store.

The District Manager's work is less limited. Everything this DM does affects ALL the stores in his district. If he pushes them to order a certain flavor or run a promotion, it could result in an increase in sales or loss in profit. Lets say he has 20 stores in his district. That means his decision impacts 20 managers which has 10 employees under them, so 200 employees get impacted.

VP of Product Management's work is far reaching. Lets say there's 5 districts in the US and the product that his team develops gets pushed to the stores. That means that all 5 districts with 200 employees, which is 1,000 employees are impacted by the decision he makes. A bad flavor could mean that 1,000 employees that each serve 20 customers could result in 20,000 dissatisfied customers.

Lets stop here and compare. A decision from an hourly employee can only impact 20 customers negatively or positively. A VP's decision impacts 20,000 customers. However, you can see how as you go up the organizational hierarchy, the decisions made by people at the higher levels have a far reaching impact to everyone below.

And at the top, the CEO's decision impacts the entirety of the company. Whether or not to invest hundreds of millions in expanding to a new market, billions to acquire a new-hip competitor, these are decisions that impacts everyone in the organization. The stakes ARE 300x than what the hourly employee has to worry about.

This is why companies are willing to shell out lavish salaries for CEO's. Because the difference in a leader can make the difference of billions for a Fortune 500 company because of how many people are under them. The reason why CEO salary growth has grown so much is because the scope of their decisions has grown as companies go global and expand. Meanwhile, the scope of an hourly employee has not changed as the company has expanded.

One company doing it by itself won't work. OP is talking about a regulation that pay has to have some type of consistency within a company.

--------------------------------

Highlyasian @ 2018-08-09 14:30:30 :

This kind of regulation is just gonna lead to a lot of circumvention and a lot of wasted hours in doing so. Companies will re-structure so that the executive leadership is in another company by themselves and everyone else is within another company under the same parent company. If you try to regulate that, a company that exclusively hires and maintains multi-million dollar salaries and contracts out CEO's as consultants will prop up and fill the demand for executive talent.



--------------------------------

PotRoastPotato @ 2018-08-09 14:36:23 :

Any law can be circumvented. That's a very weak argument. It's not trivial to move operations overseas, and the average CEO isn't going to just move to another country.

There are lots of very, very talented American executives for whom living in the USA is non-negotiable.

PotRoastPotato @ 2018-08-09 14:51:33 :

To be completely frank I think your examples are absurd. No one's going to outsource their CEO position to a consulting firm. 

Just because you can think of ways to try to get around a law doesn't mean the law shouldn't be passed.

But let's say for a moment you're right.

If it's so easy to circumvent, then why not pass the regulation? You're saying it wouldn't matter anyway.

Highlyasian @ 2018-08-09 15:09:03 :

&gt; If it's so easy to circumvent, then why not pass the regulation? You're saying it wouldn't matter anyway.

Your reasoning is illogical. Regulation is not the natural state, you're literally suggesting regulation for the sake of regulation instead of accomplishing a purpose. 

Regulation that doesn't accomplish its intended purpose is just an inefficiency that wastes people's time and money. 


&gt; No one's going to outsource their CEO position to a consulting firm.

Walmart values CEO leadership at least at $22 million in compensation. Executive VP's are $10mil+.

If we do a 500x cap on the bottom, then that will be $7.5 million, which excludes their entire leadership team. At that point, Walmart is better off forming a consulting company ""Walmart Consulting"" staffed with corporate leadership where they won't be limited by compensation and have them be the ""real CEO &amp; team"" that just consults for Walmart.


--------------------------------

PotRoastPotato @ 2018-08-09 15:21:29 :

The regulation should make something like ""Walmart consulting"" illegal. That's also what judges are for, to determine if certain actions constitute a violation of law. Add the phrase ""paid directly or indirectly"" somewhere in the regulation. It's a commonly used phrase in business law. 

You are saying that just because it's hard to write a good regulation, means we shouldn't try.

I won't entertain arguments about the difficulty of drafting effective regulation because most laws and regulations are difficult to draft. 

--------------------------------

Highlyasian @ 2018-08-09 15:28:49 :

In which, you'd just find Tramlaw Consulting being an unaffiliated company in every legal sense with no corporate ties to Walmart, but conveniently staffed with people that have decades of retail corporate experience from Walmart, and their largest client that just so happens to be Walmart.

There's a finite amount of legal reach judges can have. If you say that this is a breach of the law, then you're pretty much saying the government can dictate anything between two private parties.

--------------------------------

PotRoastPotato @ 2018-08-09 15:36:16 :

Use the phrase ""paid directly or indirectly"" in the regulation. There are much better legal minds who can get much more precise than me. I'm not going to entertain the argument ""it's hard to write effective regulation"" because all laws and  regulations are hard to write effectively. With your mentality no law would be ever written. 

--------------------------------

Highlyasian @ 2018-08-09 15:54:45 :

The problem isn't the precision of the law, it's what enforcing it would entail and represent. At that point, there's no difference between a salary cap and just saying the government will tax at 100% and redistribute wealth as it sees fit.

Stop arguing in bad faith."	5	0	stop arguing comment					Something that is often attributed to the success of the modern company and economic growth generally is the tying of CEO salaries to the stocks of their respective companies. This provides a powerful incentive to a CEO to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. The downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low-skill workers, with CEOs making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage. Therefore, I think that as well as being tied to stock, CEO salary should also be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers	"DillyBeast @ 2018-08-09 14:07:04 :

Take someone famous for example like Steve Jobs. He started from the bottom up, worked in his garage and spend much more on his company than just 8 hours a day. He even had relationship issues for working and being too dedicated. Was told that his company was going to fail, and was even fired and hired back into his own company and you are telling me that a collage student janitor should be paid the same as him for his first job? If your vision would be the case nobody would ever want to take the harder route and just work at a job that was already established, numerous amounts of fantastic companies would not even exist.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, technically. Not particularly relevant.

&gt;Couldn't it be possible that the Kochs give money to foundations that believe the same things they do, rather than the foundations push Koch propaganda to get money?

Sure, if we weren't talking about one that was also ***founded*** by them. But we are. It was literally named the Koch Foundation back in '74. 

&gt;It's not like they are puppeteers controlling the whole thing.

Well, they do have a very close relationship with more than half the board, and it's not like they didn't literally try to pull a puppetmaster act back in 2012. 

&gt;Crane contended that Niskanen's share belonged to his widow, Kathryn Washburn, and that the move by the Kochs was an attempt to turn Cato into ""some sort of auxiliary for the G.O.P.... It's detrimental to Cato, it's detrimental to Koch Industries, it's detrimental to the libertarian movement.""

So yes, that's a little villainous. A smidge.

&gt;Why is the Koch money... any more dirty and corrupt than the left wing money...?

I directly compared it to a Soros-funded think tank. Stop clutching your pearls.

--------------------------------

compensatedshill @ 2018-08-09 18:02:46 :

Ralph Waldo Emerson doesn't currently fund the Atlantic.   The Kochs don't currently fund Cato.  Maybe 10% of the funding comes from them.

I'm also not freaking out about Soros funding things.  People tend to financially support that dogma with which they agree.  They aren't cartoon villains who find think tanks and force them to publish propaganda.

My point is you or anyone else bitching about the source because of who (Koch or Soros or anyone else) funds a small % of them is being dumb.

You stating that doesn't make it fact.  Think tanks and magazines can be equally biased.  And shit, magazines even more so because they aren't expected to have the research rigor that a think tank does.   Magazines can be incredibly biased.  To act like the Atlantic or any other periodical is above reproach is hilarious.  The Atlantic is ABSOLUTELY coming from a political perspective and everything they present is frames by that.  Just like Reason or the Wall St Journal or the Village Voice

Of course the Atlantic isn't above reproach. But it's not their job to produce disingenuous talking points and wildly spin research; their job is reporting and commentary, laid bare on the surface without intent to deceive anyone about their motives.


The CATO institute is on a fundamentally different level of political bias, they literally exist to produce lies and spin truths. That is not a side product of their bias, it is *their main purpose*.

Kalean @ 2018-08-09 23:41:18 :

&gt;So again, NO REASONABLE PERSON could POSSIBLY come to a different opinion than you about net neutrality? 

I don't know. Do you consider yourself reasonable? Let's give it a shot.

&gt;Either they agree with you or they are lying/stupid/corrupt?

Let's find out.  The article says that the 2015 regulations enabled the FCC to enact pricing controls on ISPs.  This is provably false, as section 51 of the [regulation in question](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf) reads as follows.

&gt;In finding that broadband Internet access service is subject to Title II, we simultaneously 
exercise the Commission’s forbearance authority to forbear from 30 statutory provisions and render over 700 codified rules inapplicable, to establish a light-touch regulatory framework tailored to preserving those provisions that advance our goals of more, better, and open broadband. We thus forbear from the vast majority of rules adopted under Title II.

In other words, the FCC's Open Internet order emphatically does not bring the full weight of Title II down.  They forebear price regulation, for example, meaning they actually forfeited the power to regulate pricing. 

Do you think that makes the Cato Institute stupid, or lying?

&gt;Your OPINION is not fact. No matter how knowledgeable you think you are on an issue.

No, but my fact is fact.  Please do not conflate it with an opinion. I have just shown you otherwise on this specific example.

&gt;Intelligent, informed people can come to completely different conclusions about the same issue.

Only to a limited degree. If someone cuts my head off, and a trustworthy doctor inspects my corpse, no intelligent, informed person will then say ""he could still be alive"".

No intelligent, informed person can say that the 2015 rules did not exercise forebearance. The rules are freely accessible and crystal clear.

This is because facts matter. I am aware of all of the relevant facts about the 2015 net neutrality reclassification as it pertains to this article. Therefore, my opinion is valuable on this subject, and has a weight. 

Now. Do you disagree with me in this limited, narrow example?

--------------------------------

compensatedshill @ 2018-08-09 23:49:55 :

Your interpretation is an opinion, not a fact.  You are conflating facts with opinions not me. 

When your assumption is that an entire organization of hundreds, if not thousands of people must be corrupt or stupid to publish what you claim is a lie and have been doing so for decades, it means either you are about to win a Pulitzer for exposing a massive fraud, or you are making a hilariously juvenile assumption.

I guess the first step is probably to reevaluate your assumptions.

--------------------------------

Kalean @ 2018-08-10 01:31:16 :

&gt;it means either you are about to win a Pulitzer for exposing a massive fraud

This was known as early as '98 by my understanding. I'm not unearthing anything.

Now... My interpretation? Elaborate. Because it sounds to me like you are saying the FCC's forebearance on Title II, which is an objective fact, could be interpreted to mean they did not forebear, which is an objective falsehood.

I'm not trying to trick you. This is not an attempt to lead you down a narrow and windy road.  This is me asking you if you can acknowledge a simple fact. 

I literally linked you to the regulation. It factually bars them from using all of title II except that which they did not forebear.  

If you don't understand the document I'll be happy to delve deeper into the sections they did not exercise forebearance upon.  But if you simply refuse to accept that what I'm saying is based on factual data, when I've linked you that factual data, then maybe you're the one with some odd assumptions.  

Facts exist.  

FCC forebearance is one.

I'll grant you the premise that the story of Noah is more figurative than literal, and that the ark is a metaphor, but that doesn't imply that a giant flood itself is either figurative or a smaller local event.

There are numerous massive historical floods, things we would probably describe as ""biblical in nature"" even today. We know they have happened in the past, during times when humans were likely occupying various areas, and they   are far, far larger than a small local event.  Technically, these are known as ""outburst floods"" and several have happened throughout history, including in places like the Red Sea.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outburst\_flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outburst_flood)

--------------------------------

Gutsick_Gibbon @ 2018-08-10 04:26:40 :

I agree! Massive floods aren't unheard of. But the Red Sea is considered local in comparison with the true biblical flood: one that covered *all land* and obliterates all life. So while you are definitely correct that these big floods happened, they were not global. 

--------------------------------

cacheflow @ 2018-08-10 04:29:21 :

When all the land for hundreds of miles around you is flooded, and tens of thousands of people die, that is the entire world, especially in the times of prehistory.

That's not some small, local event.  And we know these outburst floods happen in history, they aren't unheard of.

--------------------------------

Gutsick_Gibbon @ 2018-08-10 04:35:23 :

Again, this is a possibility as there is some evidence of a large flood impacting the Mesopotamian Region that was the result of an ancient dam break. But my CMV has no problem with this, in a worldwide scale, that region is considered local. Even if all life was wiped out there. I have a problem with a **worldwide flood**, again, that covered all the land and acted as a mass extinction event with a near 100% fatality rate (greater than our currently known leader, the Permian ""Great Dying""). There is nothing supporting that event. 

--------------------------------

cacheflow @ 2018-08-10 04:41:00 :

I agree with your premise, let's assume that there was not a worldwide flood.

My argument is that there is a middle ground between worldwide flood, and small, local event.  Its entirely possible that some outburst flood basically wiped out most life in some major portion of the world, giving rise to a myth.

The Red Sea is about 170,000 sq. miles, larger than the state of CA.  If all of California ended up underwater in seven days, we wouldn't call that a ""small, local event"", that's a massive geological shift.

--------------------------------

Gutsick_Gibbon @ 2018-08-10 04:51:19 :

I believe that could very well be the case. Anthropologically we see cultures exchange myths ""accidentally"" all the time. The Hebrew people, prior to the writing down of the stories in Genesis, were slaves to the Babylonians (the originators of the Epic of Gilgamesh, a similar flood story). It is plausible they acquired the story from them. But assuming the flood was large and regional, maybe ""worldwide"" to the people experiencing it, it is not global in the sense we know today. However, as a former church goer, I remember they taught the story as a full scale cataclysm that obliterated all life on Earth, not in the region.

--------------------------------

cacheflow @ 2018-08-10 04:55:46 :

Well, let’s say I believe it was a massive regional flood, orders of magnitude larger than anything you or I have seen in our lifetime.  I disagree with your claim that it is entirely figurative, or “small, local”.  Possibly the largest flood mankind has ever witnessed.

Am I mislead or pushing religious propaganda ?

--------------------------------

Gutsick_Gibbon @ 2018-08-10 05:01:49 :

Certainly not, but then, you aren't suggesting what I stated I had a problem with. A very large regional flood is not global. The recent hurricane in Puerto Rico killed over a thousand people. One could argue it was cataclysmic for Puerto Rico. But even though the people of this small island saw this enormous natural event as nearly apocalyptic in nature, no one today is going to call it global. The same goes for every large natural disaster. An event I would consider global and cataclysmic would be the KT extinction between the Cretaceous and the Paleogene, it killed some 75% of species on Earth. This would be akin to the Global Flood that is taught in some Abraham Religions.

You aren’t engaging my point.  My argument is that you say “small, local” when I’m saying massive regional.

* There's no agreement over what natural rights are, which weakens the case for them existing. Often life and liberty are the main rights called natural, but even they clash in almost every aspect that can be named.

* Many actions preformed by humans in the past and present are seen or can be seen to violate natural rights, but were/are perfectly acceptable in their society. This goes against the idea that anyone can understand them with reason.

* Many parameters outside a person's control dictate their ability to cash in on their rights. Country of birth, socioeconomic status and more can (and often do) determine not only what you do with your life, but also what you *can* do with your life. I don't think you can call it a natural right if you can never fulfill it; if you've never had it, you didn't get it from nature.

My main thought - you can't see natural rights in existence, you can only see human-given rights. The only reason to believe you have any right is if you believe in a deity or religion that claims you have them. Belief in natural rights is exactly that - belief.

The veneer of religion is what gives them their gushpanka. To someone who believes in god or some other system of belief, that god (or whatever) is real. As real as the police officer that can put you in jail if you break the law.

That sounds nice in theory but in reality, it proves hollow.

And it's easy to prove.

If a religious person truly believes that the afterlife is the greatest thing ever, why don't they do whatever they can to pass on and get there?  They don't.  They cling to life as if it's the only thing that matters.  They cling to religion too, as a crutch to make their material existence more meaningful.  If they truly believed, they would care a lot less about what happens to themselves materially.

Here's a classic example.  Christians believe the bible is the ""inerrant word of god"", and here's a passage from the New Testament:

Mark 16:17-18: *And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.*

The bible un-ambiguously says believers can drink poison and handle deadly snakes and won't be hurt.   But you almost never see believers do this.  Because deep down, they know totally believing that stuff is foolish.

The bible is a collection of disparate script *fragments* spanning more than 1000 years, in at least 6 different languages, compiled by political committees over several hundred years.

Perhaps that was meant *only for those on the mountain?*   This kind of arbitrary exegesis has been used for centuries to justify peoples own agendas.

&gt; I was trusting you had at least basic knowledge of the Bible. Four disciples, really? 

I was trusting you were mature enough to have a conversation without having to resort to ad hominems.

&gt;the argument you gave that He was is incredibly poor. The gospels are wisdom for us, you don’t become invincible if you become a Christian, this whole discussion is so ridiculous. 

Finally something we agree on.  This discussion *is* ridiculous.

That anybody would think a bronze age storybook that promotes everything from slavery to genocide, has any consistency or moral wisdom to impart that cannot be better gleaned from other less questionable sources.

Stop attributing any great significance to that goofy historical fiction.  If only to save you the mental energy you constantly exhaust trying to rationalize that any of it is consistent.

&gt; So instead of debating the ideas of the book you merely attack the book when you are disproven?

\1.  We're not ""debating the ideas of the book""

You are arbitrarily declaring that your interpretation of the passage is the ""one true interpretation"" and not entertaining any alternative ""idea.""

For example, I even had the consideration to engage your argument that Jesus' words were specifically meant for his disciples by inquiring about his use of the third person instead of the first person.   But rather than defend your argument against my valid counter-point, you instead, grabbed your ball and started to head home by saying I don't know what I'm talking about.

If you're going to dismiss me wholesale, I'll do the same to you.

\2.  I have not been ""disproven"".   You simply declared your unsubstantiated opinion to be magically superior.

&gt;As for my “ad hominem”, the discussion is over when it revealed that one party can’t discuss the subject because their knowledge on the subject is objectively incorrect.

And then you double down on your incorrect assumption.

&gt;How am I expected to make argument?

You could start by recognizing that there is no definitive interpretation of the bible.  Hell there is no definitive translation of the bible.  Hell, there is no original source for the bible.  Everything is pulled from different contexts, so perhaps you should start off your argument not pretending to know the unknowable.   And then having the audacity and hubris to suggest anybody who disagrees knows nothing of the subject.

&gt; So you’re saying that because there is no “definitive interpretation” that you can assert whatever you like about the book and it applies because the Bible exists in some sort of limbo or what?

You seem incapable of seeing the middle areas between points.  It's not ""you either believe my interpretation or any 2-year-olds opinion is just as valid.""   That's childish.  This is called a false dichotomy.  

The middle ground is to recognize the reality of the situation, that nobody knows for sure, and be open to the possibilities, as opposed to dismissing anybody who disagrees with you as being ignorant.

As such, the term ""disciple"" has multiple interpretations.  It can mean a specific person, group of people, or a metaphor for anyone who believes in Jesus' mythology.   You seem to suggest when it suits your argument, the term only has one meaning: yours.

I suspect that your sexual judgement is based exclusively on your own personal experience, and you may be far from an acceptable average sample of humanity.

Sexuality varies dramatically from culture to culture.  It's much more likely that cultural norms have an affect on sex and relationships than the actual # of partners people have.  

This is a very complicated dynamic that cannot be addressed by a simple formula.   AND it's time we stopped shaming sex as something that should be kept in the dark.  There's nothing wrong with responsible sexual exploration.  Having many partners doesn't mean you're less willing to commit to one person any more than eating different cuisines means you'll never be satisfied with any single kitchen.

Or if you want to go in the other direction, perhaps all these stats are an indication that monogamy is overrated?  Perhaps the idea that two people should have sexual exclusivity is an outdated social construct?   There's a lot more to commitment than whether or not you have exclusive rights to one other person's genitalia.

If your highest priority in life is maximum amount of orgasms then sure.

&gt;There's a lot more to commitment than whether or not you have exclusive rights to one other person's genitalia.

No but faithfulness is usually a cornerstone of successful relationships, once that is gone most relationships fall apart or enter back into monogamy. Unless your priority is maximum amount of orgasms then monogamy is going to be your best bet to having a happy relationship. 

--------------------------------

Pilebsa @ 2018-09-18 19:44:10 :

They do.  But if you're fixated on how many people your partner has slept with and that has weight on the health and well being of the relationship, then you have some psychological problems unto yourself that you need to settle before getting into a relationship with other people.

&gt;No but faithfulness is usually a cornerstone of successful relationships

*Trust* is the cornerstone of successful relationships.   Faithfulness is just one of the many ways some people measure trust.  But not all relationships attribute ultimate meaning to monogamy or sexual exclusivity.

Also for the vast majority of people trust and faithfulness are intertwined, the few relationship that don't are usually full of weirdos or were damaged beyond repair. They would have an excuse if they lived in a polyamourus society like many Islamic countries but they don't.

Pilebsa @ 2018-09-19 15:04:59 :

&gt; TIL every society that values chastity is full of mentally ill people

Let me ask you something...  what's the big deal about chastity?   How selfish and insecure are you that it bothers you someone else has rubbed genetalia with your mate before he/she ever knew you existed?    

Yes, that is mental illness, if it's *that* important to you.

I'm curious will you refuse to eat fried chicken with your mate if they ever ate it before?  Do you have to be the only person who serves them fried chicken or else the whole dining experience is tainted?

&gt;Also for the vast majority of people trust and faithfulness are intertwined, the few relationship that don't are usually full of weirdos or were damaged beyond repair.

Trust and faithfulness are intertwined if there's a trust agreement centering around faithfulness.   But faithfulness is just a means to an end, and not the real substance.   That's trust.

Note that I'm not promoting polygamy or knocking monogamy.   I have mostly been in monogamous relationships my whole life.  But I don't think how many partners my mate has had, has any great relevance to the quality of our relationship, and if you do, I suspect you have a lot to learn about healthy relationships.

The importance of ""chastity"" is an offshoot of coupling as a type of ""security"" or ""acquisition.""   This flies in the face what a healthy relationship really is: a partnership.  People who have specific expectations of what their partner's sexual history should be (or that they have none) are the same type who want property they can own that hasn't been ""used"" by anybody else, as opposed to a mutually-respectful relationship."

More often than not they hide behind the guise of “Freethought” and often view themselves as superior. They belittle and bully Christians all while shaming Christians for the doing the same things.

No it's wrong. The reason so many others are stating it too is because you're using it in an exotic way. Agnosticism as you've described it is a flavor of atheism. 

--------------------------------

Kedazsa @ 2018-10-23 13:09:21 :

No, it is not. I just posted this and I will share it again with you. Dawkins made a spectrum of theistic probabilities in his book The God Delusion when he mentioned the man who coined the term agnostic in the 1860s. 

1. Strong theist. 100% probability of God. In the words of C.G. Jung: ""I do not believe, I know.""

2. De facto theist. Very high probability but short of 100%. ""I don't know for certain, but I strongly believe in God and live my life on the assumption that he is there.""

3.Leaning towards theism. Higher than 50% but not very high. ""I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God.""

4. Completely impartial. Exactly 50%. ""God's existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable.""

5. Leaning towards atheism. Lower than 50% but not very low. ""I do not know whether God exists but I'm inclined to be skeptical.""

6. De facto atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. ""I don't know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.""

7. Strong atheist. ""I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one.""

I am a solid 4.0 there. I do not lean one way or the other. I am neutral. Huxley said “Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle ... Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.”

So Agnosticism is its own brand of ice cream. Atheism is actually a flavor of Agnosticism with Theism being the second flavor. Gnosticism would be the other brand of ice cream for the folks that know exactly what they want. It also has the same two flavors, atheism and theism.

Part of the purpose of exit polls is as a safeguard against tampering with election results.

So it seems like an independent research does the exit poll, but does it specifically for news organizations. 

Also, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll), news organizations will voluntarily not release exit poll results for a state until after voting is closed for that state. So I'm not sure how much of an issue OP's view really is, although I share the sentiment."

Increase in profit margin and demand is literally all that matters in determining supply. Farmers will absolutely produce more if the profit margin per animal increases. It's objectively true.

Cats and dogs are naturally carnivores, sure dogs can survive on vegetation as a supplement but they rely on high densities of protein to sustain muscle mass, as their natural predatory activity required strength and speed. You can get this in vegetarian form, but it come in less density and some vegetables make dogs throw up. Also, dog food is usually made from the offal of already slaughtered animals that have been killed for the human food industry. Making dog food vegetarian won't stop animals being slaughtered, instead it will just let more go to waste.

&gt;Anything that increases the profit margin of an animal's carcass will increase its supply. It's just basic econ.

But the human meat market won't diminish. The demand is already there and the reason that the animal is killed in the first place won't go away. A farmer isn't going to buy another pig just to make dog food. An increase in profit margin doesn't matter if their is no demand for that animal to be killed. If the animal is worthless for pet food, it will still be killed to feed humans. 

&gt;Your first bit is a bro science level of understanding about nutrition that you literally just made up.

Except, animals digestive system *are* adapted to the type of food they eat. We don't eat grass because our digestive systems aren't adapted to extract nutrients from it. We can't break it down the same way cows can. Efficient rates of enzyme activity rely on several factors, one being the surface area that they can work on. If food is not broken down sufficiently, then less surface area is exposed and less nutrients will be extracted."	"[deleted] @ 2018-12-01 14:16:07 :

No one on late night TV is getting laughs with witty defenses of Trump or Mitch McConnell. When someone does make a funny and insightful joke at the expense of a Democrat, that person is usually a liberal themselves, as some brands of humor are reflective and self-deprecating, and because their fellow liberals are also capable of some of the same hypocrisy and idiocy as conservatives. 

Jim Jefferies got famous off the back of a bit skewering the second amendment, and I’ve personally witnessed conservatives laughing at and enjoying parts of it. I’m not aware of anyone who hilariously defended unfettered gun rights. 

Even the political cartoons and memes on the right suck. It’s all just simplistic “ha-ha, those liberals are easily triggered by our beliefs” circle-jerking, or else it’s just blunt cruelty.

Awarded a delta for the first person who brought up Tim Allen and Roseanne. They are valid responses given the wording of my OP, but not what I’m looking for in terms of actually changing my view. What I’m looking for are examples of people who can deliver compelling and funny conservative political commentary to a mass-media audience. Tim Allen and Roseanne played conservative-leaning characters to match many of their conservative ideals, but in my opinion their shows were ultimately about coming to terms with a liberal reality. I’m looking for a conservative equivalent to Stewart, Colbert, Meyers, etc, who can provide funny content for a mainstream audience that works as a defense of their politics. The Blue Collar Comedy tour was also mentioned: I’m not disputing that conservatives can be funny when talking about other things.

Yes, I know the math is unrealistic... that's why I said **LETS PRETEND**. When my girlfriend tells me ""let's pretend I'm a nurse and you're police officer tonight in bed""... that doesn't mean she actually thinks she's a nurse and I'm a police officer. You do understand that, right?

I think there is fundamental flaw in your reasoning. Think the following thought experiment.

1. Person believes chocolate is ultimate flavour of ice cream. Better than everything else.

2. Person eats strawberry ice cream.

Both statements can't be true at the same time. Either person sees merits in other ice cream flavours or he doesn't believe chocolate is superior. You can't hold idea of superiority and act against it.

--------------------------------

sclsmdsntwrk @ 2018-12-11 07:05:37 :

What? Of course both statements can be true at the same time, what are you talking about? They're not mutually exclusive. Something being better than everything else doesn't mean everything else is bad or that you'd never appreciate something else.


For example, I think the godfather is the best movie, better than everything else. Yet I watch other movies.

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-11 07:14:50 :

Then you must accept that there is *value* in watching other movies. That other movies offer you something that 'the Godfather' doesn't offer. If nothing else then variety.

That means that while 'the Godfather' might be the best movie, we must have other movies and shouldn't push other movies off the shelves because they are not 'the Godfather'. But that must mean that other movies have something that the best movie doesn't have and are therefore better in that regard.

Maybe they have better acting, filmiology, special effects. Now because we can rank movies according to many criteria it is up to *individual values* to choose what criteria they hold to be important. Someone else might say that rank should be acting, filmiology and then special effect but other one say that special effect are most import aspect and rank should be special effect, filmiology and then acting. Even if these two person can objectively measure each aspect thanks to their *individual preference in values* they would rank each movie differently. Meaning there cannot be ultimate movie.

Who's said anything about ""objectively""? Sure, objectively there can't be an ultimate movie. But subjectively there can be. And taste in ice cream and movies and how you value different races is completely subjective.


I don't understand. Do you think racists are racists because other races are *objectively* better than others?


I really don't understand what your point is?

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-11 07:45:26 :

Going back to my first post.

If person thinks 'The Godfather' is superior film (subjectively) they can't watch any other movies because other movies doesn't offer anything better. This means that person is discriminating other movies.

If they on other hand watch other movies, that means that other movies have something to offer that 'the Godfather' doesn't have meaning 'the Godfather' cannot be ultimate movie. It have to have some flaws. Other movies do something better than 'the Godfather'.

You can't hold the idea of superiority and not act on it. Either you must accept that your best has flaws that others do better or you must discriminate others. In your subjective view this might not seem wrong (because everything else is worse) but in objective sense it is.

Yes? I don't know why you're injecting ""ultimate"" in some weird kind of metaphysical sense? Obviously something can be better than something else without being better in every single conceivable way. We're talking about subjective opinions here.

And asian supremacist can recognize that blacks are taller on average and thus better at basketball and still think asians are superior to blacks because of x, y and z.


&gt; You can't hold the idea of superiority and not act on it.


Yes you obviously can. Superiority does not imply perfection. 


&gt; Either you must accept that your best has flaws that others do better


Yes, I accept that my best has flaws... but it's still the best. There is no contradiction between saying ""X is the best in this category"" and saying ""X isn't 100% perfect"".

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-11 08:58:56 :

But if you admit that your race is not superior (like the original post that I base all my argumentation on) in every single way you must accept that you must have other races living among you in a larger society. If you believe that race X is good at x then you must have race X in your society. This leads to situation where there are lot of different races in your society.

Argumentation doesn't chance is you pick a smaller community (let say a workplace). If some people are better suited in certain tasks then you must have large variety of people so you can tackle large set of tasks. The whole argumentation of racism falls apart when you remove someone as superior.

My whole argument have been that you can't say that something is superior and think that something is better than the aforementioned superior thing. There is a clear logical inconsistency in this.

Disclaimer. Race is fundamentally unscientific classification and I don't personally believe in existence of race and therefore this whole discussion in my personal view is mute.

If race A is not the best then there are races that are better in some sense. If you want to have the best society you must include these different races.

*must* if you want to have the best society/country. You don't really need to have but then you are living in inferior country because it doesn't have best people in best places.

&gt; No, there's no logical inconsistency at all. Something being the best does not imply it's the best in every single aspect. You're just setting up an absurd strawman.

But if it is not best in all things then it cannot be superior. There is something equally good or better out there. And I admit that there are hundreds of aspects which you can rank people and depending how you prefer each aspect your ranking would be different. But because your ranking is different each time none of the options is clearly superior.

&gt; must if you want to have the best society/country.


But ""best"" society/country is entierly subjective. 


&gt; But if it is not best in all things then it cannot be superior.


Yes it can. 

Let's pretend there's two people on an island. And they're trying to determine who is the better fighter. X has 0.0001% more stamina. Y is better at everything else, taller, stronger etc. and wins every fight. Who is the best fighter on the island?


&gt; There is something equally good or better out there.


That does not logically follow.


&gt; And I admit that there are hundreds of aspects which you can rank people and depending how you prefer each aspect your ranking would be different.


Sure, but we're not talking about an objective ranking. It's a subjective ranking. I get to decide what criteria I use to rank whatever I want to rank.


&gt; This discussion is ""Can you be racist and not be discriminatory at the same time?"". And thinking that A&gt;B (racist) and sometimes picking B&gt;A (not discriminate) is not a logical option.


Yes it is. You can think whites are better than blacks on average because they are white (racism). And still recognize that one specific black person is better than one specific white person.

For example, if a racist gets shot and is rushed to the hospital. He can recognize that the black doctor is probably better att providing him medical care than the white janitor, while still thinking whites on average are better than blacks because of their race.

Now you are comparing apples and oranges. Doctors and janitors. Real question is would he pick a white doctor that is available or black doctor that is available. All other aspects must be equal except the race or else you are not basing your choice on race.

It is not discrimination to go to white doctor if there are no black doctors available.

And I just must point one thing out. Can't help myself.

Average homicide rate in the U.S. was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. This means that one asian would be killing 2.450 people per person in US. This one asian is killing everyone twice (some people three times) a year. That some dark asian voodoo shit right there. I presume you are not asian because you are so bad at math.

Picking janitor or picking a doctor regardless of race is not racism. But if you base **any** choice on race that means you are a racist. People with black friends can be racist if they choose to discriminate blacks in hiring process or any other aspect of their lives.

But I feel like we are going further away from original topic. That being that racism and discrimination are the same thing. If you believe in superiority of some race and base any action on this believe then you are discriminating.

But you are not picking B over A when you are picking doctor over janitor. Being a doctor have nothing to do with race. You are not picking the the black doctor because he is black (B). You are picking them because they are doctor.

Profession is not a race and picking someone because of their profession is not racial discrimination. Picking a white doctor (A) over black doctor (B) is discrimination because you are not basing your pick based on qualification (being a doctor) but on race (being A).

&gt; But you are not picking B over A when you are picking doctor over janitor.


Yes I am. The doctor is black and the janitor is white. Am I not picking a black person over a white person when I pick a black doctor over a white janitor? 


&gt; Being a doctor have nothing to do with race.


Exactly. That's the point.


&gt; You are not picking the the black doctor because he is black (B). You are picking them because they are doctor.


Yes! You're starting to get it. I'm picking the black doctor because I expect that he would do a better job than the white janitor. Right? I can do that and still be a racist. Right?


Now imagine I have to decide between a black plummer and a white plummer. I think the black plummer is great at his job and less expensive and the white plummer has a history of causing water damage and costs more. I can pick the black plummer and still think white people on average are better than black pepople.


Again, I think that A&gt;B but sometimes I pick B&gt;A.


Aaaanyhow, this clearly isn't actually going anywhere interesting or productive. So good bye!

No you are not. You are not picking black person over white person because you don't have white option on the table. You came for a doctor and you are picking a doctor.

You are presenting a case where white is not a option and say that you are not racist because you didn't pick a option that wasn't available.

Picking a white X over black X is discrimination. Picking black Y over white X has nothing to do with race. It about Y&gt;X not black&gt;white.

--------------------------------

sclsmdsntwrk @ 2018-12-12 08:41:06 :

Should we take it slow and make the list again?

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-12 08:47:19 :

Sure.

1. A&gt;B (white &gt; black; my race is superior; racism).

2. B&gt;=A (non discriminatory action where person picks something regardless of race)

3. X&gt;Y (Doctor is better than janitor)

Point 3. have nothing to do with points 1 and 2. If we do this in combination.

A = white, B = black, X = doctor, Y = janitor.

1. A &gt; B

2. X &gt; Y

3. AX &gt; BX (white doctor is better than black doctor)

4. AX &gt; BX &gt; AY &gt; AX (Doctors are better than janitors regardless of race)

5. BX &gt; AX (Picking a black doctor instead of white doctor; non-discriminatory action)

And we again fail do non-discriminatory action if we believe whites are better than blacks.

And what is stopping a white racist from doing this if he thinks the black doctor is a better doctor than the white doctor?

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-12 10:25:29 :

&gt; And what is stopping a white racist from doing this if he thinks the black doctor is a better doctor than the white doctor?

If you pick black brain surgeon for brain surgeon over white general practitioner then it becomes again janitor/doctor case. But if you pick black doctor because he is better because he is more intelligence because blacks are more intelligence then it becomes discriminatory just with extra steps.

It all boils down to why the black doctor is better?

Longer education -&gt; not a fair comparison

Better specialisation -&gt; not a fair comparison

Different skin color -&gt; racial discrimination

More intelligent -&gt; Depents. Do you belive he is more intelligent because he's black or is there different reason.


You can't start comparing apples and oranges. Two different types of things. Janitors or doctors, brain surgeons or cancer specialists. If you do this it no longer a race question. You will have to have to equal things but different race.

--------------------------------

You used word ""better"". Why do he think he is better?

We also have to consider that there are different levels of racism. Starting from ""I wouldn't allow my daughter to marry"" to ""we should exterminate every"". I have been using ""segregation level"" of racism in my example.

--------------------------------

sclsmdsntwrk @ 2018-12-13 06:15:18 :

I don't know, I don't think it matters. But pick whatever reason you like. He read their yelp reviews, he had a vision in his sleep or a fortune cookie told me. I don't care.


&gt; We also have to consider that there are different levels of racism.


I literally couldn't care less. Frankly I can't think of anything that would be less relevant.


&gt; I have been using ""segregation level"" of racism in my example.


Okay? So are you going to answer the question?

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-13 06:17:44 :

Well I gave you multiple reasons and are those reasons racist discrimination or not. With discrimination the reason is all that matters.

And level of racism dictates what kind reasons person would consider. So both of these are key ingredients when determining how discriminatory racist is.

--------------------------------

sclsmdsntwrk @ 2018-12-13 06:29:49 :

&gt; Well I gave you multiple reasons and are those reasons racist discrimination or not. 


Yes I know. But that wasn't the question. Should I repeat the question a third and final time?


What is stopping a white racist from hiring a black doctor because he thinks the black doctor is a better doctor than the white doctor? Notice how I'm *not* asking you what reasons you think are discriminatory or not... because it doesn't matter.


&gt;  With discrimination the reason is all that matters.


Sure, no idea how that's relevant. But yes.


Out of curiosity, or rather since you don't seem to be actually engaging with my argument, what do you think my position is exactly? What assertion precisely are you arguing against at the moment?


&gt; And level of racism dictates what kind reasons person would consider. 


Okay? Great.

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-13 06:41:36 :

If person believed that blacks are subhuman and are not allowed to exist in God given earth then there is no way that they would pick a black doctor.

If person believes that black and white shouldn't marry or have kids and that this taints the pure white blood then they might pick a black doctor.

See how the level of racism effect choices? Racist can have black friends but then they are not racist against friendhood. If you are racist there is certain aspect in your life that you don't want other races to attend. And in this aspect you are discriminatory.

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-13 06:47:11 :

If he believes blacks are subhuman are not allowed to live in the same country then there is no way that he would ever hire a black doctor no matter how good they are.

Yes, you said that already. I asked *why*?


You really seem to have a problem with answering direct questions. I didn't ask you if you think he would hire a black doctor. I didn't ask if you think it would be likely that he hire a black doctor. I asked what is stopping him from hiring a black doctor who he thinks is the better doctor?

--------------------------------

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-13 06:58:56 :

If person doesn't allow blacks to live in same community, he doesn't allow black doctors to live same community and therefore he wouldn't pick a black doctor.

If he would pick a black doctor this means that he would allow black doctors meaning he wouldn't be racist.

I used term hire because I considered buying services as hiring (like you hire carpenter or hair dresser). I admit that it could sound bit misleading.

That still doesn't answer the question, I don't know why he'd have to hire a doctor from the same community... I wasn't aware of any natural laws to that effect. But I guess there's not an answer coming so I'll just give up.


I understand that you don't think he would hire a black doctor. The fact that you repeat the same thing in different ways doesn't answer the question.


Anyhow this was a complete waste of time. Good bye

Z7-852 @ 2018-12-13 07:14:53 :

Community can be city, state or country. I assume when person goes to doctor he goes to his nearest and prefered doctor in their community.

I just don't think we understand (or want to understand) each other. My reasoning is that if person thinks some race is inferior then their doctors are inferior and cannot be better. I just don't know how black doctor can be better to person who thinks that blacks are always worse. This logic just don't work. Something worse cannot be better.

sclsmdsntwrk @ 2018-12-13 07:51:14 :

And that reasoning is incorrect. A racist can recognize that Usain Bolt is the fastest man on the planet. And still think blacks are an inferior race. Most of them do.


&gt; This logic just don't work.


Of course not. Because it's a straw man. Saying ""Whites are better than blacks"" is not the same thing as saying ""every single white person is better than every single black person at everything"". I don't know why you insist on conflating the two when they're not the same thing."

&gt; 
&gt; 

The worst of those things are not temporary. The best of the negative affects of pregnancy are temporary.

I still think you're trivializing pregnancy.

There can be permanent and other long term changes to a womans body, she has to basically change her whole lifestyle for a good part of those 9 months - avoid alcohol, coffee, go to Doctors, morning sickness. She has to stop work at a certain point, she has to buy new clothes, incontinence is a real issue. She has to stop certain activities and sports, she can't fly at a certain point.

These are all very real reasons why someone would want to say 'I don't want to be pregnant'. I think they are valid reasons, they are good reasons. 

&gt; This is not life and death and pales in comparison to killing a human.

A foeuts is not a human life.

Even if it is a human life, it has no rights to use someone elses body to stay alive. 

If you want to take anything from what I am posting, take that statement. 

&gt; Would you rather go through a painful phase or not get a chance to live at all. I’m asking about you personally.

I don't think its a very good question at all. 

Would A go through a painful phase for B not to exist? Surely these scenarios are 'would you go through a painful phase for a reward later', the same person going through the bad to deal with the good.

Personally, I am putting the mothers right to use her body as she sees fit over the rights over any other human being or foetus. 


&gt; Btw, you’re taking a huge assumption by casually dismissing the fetus as “a clump of cells” when significant portions of the scientific community consider it as human life. This reckless mentality is incredibly dangerous.

Ok.

I will stop arguing that point.

But to clarify again.

Even if you consider a foetus a human life - it does not have the right to use someone elses body against their will to survive.

Your right to life stops when you need my body to keep living.


"	2	0	stop arguing comment					"First off, considering all the tools available to prevent pregnancy, you would have to screw up pretty bad to get knocked up. So provided that the sex was consential, you were already quite irresponsible from the start.

Then, despite not knowing with 100% certainty whether what’s inside you is a human life, you decide to roll the dice and believe that it’s not. You then proceed with the possibility of murdering a human because you think it’s “probably” not. How is that not reckless?

In matters of life and death, shouldn’t we always play it safe? Shouldn’t saving a human life take precedence over avoiding inconvenience? I think people should do what they want with their body except for when what they do with their body results in murder. It’s about priorities.

I’m open to having my view changed."	"NotGuyFawkes @ 2018-12-25 02:52:38 :

&gt; In matters of life and death, shouldn’t we always play it safe? Shouldn’t saving a human life take precedence over avoiding inconvenience? 

Inconvenience?

Are you aware of the physical toll pregnancy can take on a woman, permanent side effects, 9 months of being host yo a baby... Even death!

And you say ""avoid an inconvenience""

In order to ""save your life"" you're telling on the rights of the woman. She has the right to decide whether another life form uses her body for 9 months. No one has that right. No one can demand another person donate blood, or donate a kidney - even to save a life. 

And you say ""sorry lady you gotta risk the complications of pregnancy to save this potential child"".

Even if you give equal rights to the unborn foetus, and the mother. Both have right to life, both cannot demand the other to keep them alive.

&gt; I think people should do what they want with their body except for when what they do with their body results in murder. It’s about priorities.

By that logic a person can force someone to donate blood to save their life.

Or a kidney. 

You say murder, I say letting the foetus die. 

You are giving the foetus MORE rights than the woman. The foetus had the right to life and the right to use someone else's body for 9 months. 

--------------------------------

DrakierX @ 2018-12-25 04:56:04 :

Did I misspeak when I said it’s an inconvenience?

This doesn’t compare to being forced to donating blood to help the population. We’re talking about a women killing a life of her own offspring because she chose to have sex and given the success rate of 99.9% of combined condom and pills, likely didn’t use proper preventative measures.

I’m not diminishing the physical suffering during these phases (albeit some suffer less than others), I’m saying it doesn’t compare to killing an innocent life. 

Would you rather go through a painful phase or not get a chance to live at all?

NotGuyFawkes @ 2018-12-25 20:09:28 :

&gt;
&gt;[ ]
 
&gt; I’m not diminishing the physical suffering during these phases (albeit some suffer less than others)

I think so.

I think the list of side effects, symptoms, possibility of permanent changes and even the risk of death deserves to be labelled with slightly greater concern than '9 months of inconvenience'.

You do understand that women die in childbirth? In 2018, in modern, Western hospitals. 

That is still a risk yeah? And even if everything goes perfectly a woman's body can be permanently changed.

I would characterize that as much more than an 'inconvenience'. 

&gt; Would you rather go through a painful phase or not get a chance to live at all?


I am saying that you are approaching it from the wrong point of view.

You keep saying 'given the success rate', well you can still play all the right moves and lose though. Accidents happen. 

&gt; This doesn’t compare to being forced to donating blood to help the population.

I am using blood donation as an example. 

As it stands today, every human has the right to bodily autonomy. I have no right to your blood, your kidney, part of your liver. 

Even if you were the only person in the whole world that could save my life, through a simple and 99.99999% safe procedure - I, nor the State could force you to donate blood to save my life.

You have the right to say no.

When you are denying the woman an abortion, you are giving up that right for her.

You are saying she MUST allow another life to use her body for 9 months in order to survive. If the feotus cannot survive outside the womb, so be it. We seperate the mother and the feotus, both go about their own ways. See what happens.

No one should be forced to use their body to save another life.

I think you are too focused on 'omg it's a life we have to save it'. Which is fine, but I am suggesting that it doesn't matter. If saving a life means trampling on the concept of bodily autonomy, denying that right to a living, breathing human being in favour of a clump of cells / foetus / future human being - I will pick the living breathing human being every single time. 

If one picks a thought experiment. Say you are in an abortion clinic, for some reason. A fire breaks out. You think 'man i have to get out of here'. But then you notice a case full of 1000 embryo's, ""Man i have to save these"" you think. Then you notice a 2yo child. You can only save one. Which one do you pick? Obviously the child.

Not a great one, but its a thought experiment. To your ""innocent life"" comment. It's not an innocent life. It is a foetus.

Consider also that you cannot even take organs from a dead body. A corpse has the right to bodily autonomy in a way that you are attempting to deny a woman. 

&gt; Would you rather go through a painful phase or not get a chance to live at all?

Easy. I would rather women have the choice to pick and choose when they have children.

I acknowledge pregnancy is a life changing event - both physically and 'life' (financially, family situation).

Given women this choice allows them to only bring children into the world when they are ready - which (in theory) would bring about better outcomes for both children and parents.

DrakierX @ 2018-12-26 08:59:24 :

Your thought experiment analogy is not a great one indeed, I agree. It’s save one life and kill the other, and doesn’t apply at all to the abortion situation.

You totally didn’t properly answer my question so I’ll ask it again: Would you rather go through a painful phase or not get a chance to live at all. I’m asking about you personally.

She's not killing her own child.

She is making a choice that another living thing cannot use her body for 9 months.

Every single human being has this right. Dead bodies have this right.

You wish to deny this right to a pregnant woman. 


&gt; You don’t think it’s a good question because you misinterpreted it. It’s asking would A go through a painful phase or would A not live at all. You are A.

In that case - i would never have known any different. 'human babies in the womb' are not conscious, they have no memory of their time in the womb, abortion can be performed prior to any heartbeat or other sides of a living, sentient being.

&gt; I appreciate you for no longer making that assumption.

&gt; So given that it is a human,

Nice try. I said I wouldn't argue it, not that I totally and utterly concede the point and agree with you.

Again I will clarify.

Given that it is a human being, it **STILL** has no rights to her body. 

If I have blood that can save your life and only I have it - can you force me to donate to you?!/

Yes or no. You've asked for my personal opinion on these things, here's one for you.

Can you force someone to donate blood to you?

Compared to pregnancy, donating blood is a breeze. 

&gt; The worst of the negative effects are temporary. What do you think are the worst negative effects and which of those are permanent?

Sorry. Am i completely misinterpreting things?

Pregnancy can cause death. This is a fact.

Pregnancy can have permanent negative consequences for a woman.

I would say these are the worst negative parts of pregnancy, and definitely not temporary. 

Even if they are only temporary - this is another philosophical question.

How far should one human being go to save another's life? I have done First Aid training, I would like to think if needed I would do CPR. But I am not willing to donate my life savings to a childs operation. Where the line is, I don't know. When I donate blood, they ask you 5 times during the process, 'are you sure you want to continue? You can leave at any point'. Saving someones life with your own blood is entirely voluntary and you can stop at any point and no one will give you any grief.

Suggesting that you don't want another person / maybe not a person inside you for 9 months? Ooooh lawdy gurl you better do what you're told.

Would I give up 9 months of my life to have a friend connected to me via tubes just to save their life? no.

That's unreasonable. 


Either bodily autonomy is absolute or it is not. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion

Another thought experiment, this one better than the last, articulated far better than I could have. 



--------------------------------

DrakierX @ 2018-12-26 23:25:55 :

Yeah I think you must be missing something. The worst parts of pregnancy are temporary. You’re probably less likely to die from pregnancy than driving a car. Anything can cause death. That is a fact.

She is responsible for creating the human life; therefore, killing her child is irresponsible.

What if you’d only need to be connected to your friend for 1 week. Is that unreasonable? Would you rather kill your friend than have it hard for 1 week?

--------------------------------

NotGuyFawkes @ 2018-12-26 23:48:18 :

&gt; Yeah I think you must be missing something. The worst parts of pregnancy are temporary. You’re probably less likely to die from pregnancy than driving a car. Anything can cause death. That is a fact.

Being pregnant has a higher risk of complications than not being pregnant. Abortion is safer than being pregnant. 

Do you know that abortion is sometimes recommended for the safety of the mother?

Pregnancy can cause permanent issues that are not death. This is a fact.

Do you understand this? Pregnancy is a severe physical toll on the human body, that many women wish to say 'no thanks'. 

&gt; What if you’d only need to be connected to your friend for 1 week. Is that unreasonable? Would you rather kill your friend than have it hard for 1 week?

Is it my choice? or is it forced upon me?

Are you asking me if I would do it to save my friend, or are you asking if the State can force someone to do it against their will?

Because that is what this debate is about. Not shoulds, not coulds, not 'in a perfect world'. It is whether or not you are legally banning (thus forcing) a woman to carry a baby to term. 

You can say all you wish 'oh if my child was in need of a kidney I would certainly donate it', and that's great. But again, this is not what the debate is about. It's about if the law can compel you to donate said kidney, or.... to donate use of a womb for 9 months.

So to your question.

&gt; Is that unreasonable? Would you rather kill your friend than have it hard for 1 week?

Yes, it is unreasonable for someone to legislate that one human being must use their body to keep another human being alive, even for one week. Even to donate blood. 

Yes, that is extremely unreasonable.




&gt; She is responsible for creating the human life; therefore, killing her child is irresponsible.

If you hold this view so strongly, why are you here?

This is a place for us to challenge your view. Your view that killing a human is wrong, and I am attempting to change it by showing that regardless of whether or not a foetus is a human, regardless of whether or not you consider abortion killing a human - the right to control of your own body trumps all of that.

You seem to not be willing to challenge arguments on that vein and instead keep saying 'killing is wrong'. I get that's a very emotionally charged topic and DONT KILL BABIES gets a lot of press, but i've already said many times that it is irrelevant.

It matters not a single iota whether a woman has a foetus / baby inside her, or if she is carrying Joan of Arc inside her, or if she is asked to donate her heart to Luke Skywalker on the eve of Return of the Jedi. 

She still has the right to decide what goes on inside her own body.

To quote Batman, ""I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you"". 

If a woman has decided that a living creature inside her is unwanted and there was some magical way to transplant it out and have it live in an artificial womb, I might be onboard with you. But until then, the tenants got to get out. 

Let's totally ignore anything and stop saying 'kill her child'. 

Let's talk about bodily autonomy. That has been my point this whole time. 

 

--------------------------------

DrakierX @ 2018-12-27 00:26:19 :

I feel like your issue with the term “her child” and instead calling it a “living creature” is you trying to avoid facing the idea that this is a human life.

Forget the government’s stance in this hypothetical. I’m asking you what you’d do if your friend is suddenly connected to you for up to 1 week. Do you think killing your friend is reasonable under this circumstance?

&gt; I feel like your issue with the term “her child” and instead calling it a “living creature” is you trying to avoid facing the idea that this is a human life.

No. 

I have said, it doesn't matter.

Using those terms is trying to create an emotional response to what is a rational question. Or if I am being a dick, so people can claim the moral high ground ""Oh look at the abortionists they are KILLING CHILDREN"".

But I'm not here to be a dick, so i'll stick with the emotionally charged line.

&gt; Forget the government’s stance in this hypothetical

Ok, but the rest of your sentence still doesn't jive with me.

The question here is not about 'would ya loan your mate $50 if they were in a pickle', it is far closer 'should strangers be allowed to take $10,000 from you if they need?'

We know how long pregnancy is, we know the restrictions you have to go through. Why don't you use the actual dates for your analogy to make it so much more realistic?

And again its not about 'would you help' or 'isn't it great if children could live?'

Would you donate $50 to help a friend? A stranger? Would you donate $10,000?

Would you kill a person to save 6 people using their organs? Great odds there. Heart, 2 x kidneys, lungs, split the liver. 

Who has rights to your body? Yourself, or other people? If only you, why are you denying this right to a woman?

Are you open to changing your view? What would change your view that pro-choice is reckless and irresponsible?

If we completely stop with the whole 'killing' then, we are simply left with the far more important concept.

Bodily autonomy.

That comes first.

And so far all you have talked about is 'oh would you kill your friend'.

Whether or not I CHOOSE to save my friend in your example is completely and unrelated to whether or not my friend has the RIGHT to my body. 

I think that's a fundamental concept that you are not understanding from my comments. Forget the Government, sure. Sure. Done. There still exists a woman, and a feotus / baby / parasite (I can use parasite, an organism that lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host's expense because the term is apt), that she may or may not want. If she doesn't want it - she should be perfectly able to get rid of it if she so wants.

I choose to donate blood. No one else has the right to it without my leave. 

So if I woke up connected to my friend, for ""only"" one week and they needed me to live. I could choose to cut myself off. I could also choose to stay connected and save their life. 

Regardless of my choice, they still had no right to my body, my blood, my liver, my poop (fecal transplant is a thing. It's best from someone in same living area too, so your spouse could ask for your poop). 

Now if your view was ""it'd be pretty great if all children could be born"" sure we could agree.

But your view is that pro-choice is reckless because it kills children.

I disagree.

Anti-Abortion is reckless because you are trampling on the rights of women to do whatever they want with their own bodies. 

https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html

This man donates blood and has very rare antibodies in his blood that saves lives. LOTS of lives. Lots of Childrens lives.

Now you keep alluding to ""this guy should save kids right"". Which is fine. 

But that isn't the point of this abortion debate. 

The point is does anyone other than this man have a RIGHT to this blood? If you say no, no one does then i don't see how you can be ok with abortion as the concept is the same (don't tell me they're different, its just an example).

If you said 'yes all these children have a right to his blood, common decency and all he should save their lifes', then I guess we're done as we disagree on a fundamental concept. 

This man had a choice to donate blood, to give his body to others.

A woman should have the choice to donate her womb, to let a foetus grow.

Ooh a cheeky smile, you've won.

Well done.

You've come to CMV to change your view and you're not even having a go.

We are debating whether or not a woman should have a choice. 

And you're asking which one I will chose.

Not the real question, which is ""should people be able to choose A or B"", but your question is ""which of A or B do you want"".

Do you see how that's fundamentally the wrong question?

If I say I choose my to save my mate, does that validate your abortion stance? ""Oh look this guy would choose his mate, therefore he would not have an abortion and abortion is murder and wrong"".

When choosing is precisely the foundation for (hang onto your hat here) Pro-Choice.

So, (i'm finished here after this btw), the fact that you're asking me which choice i will make.... you're already giving me the right to choose. Ergo... you are pro-choice in this matter. 

Easy win eh.

Checkmate liberalz. 

Again even if hes my mate, its a shitty example.

My choice has nothing, NOTHING to do with the fact that my mate has zero right to my body. 

I can still yes 'yes i'd save him' and be ok with other people having the choice yes or no. My own choice does not affect other people having a choice.

Big difference between pro choice and anti-abortionists. I want other people to be able to choose. You want others to conform to your view.

As I said though, good day.

Well , morality is subjective , but I am making the assumption here that we share the same morality in this subject . In other words we can't argue for morality objectively but we can argue about common points we both share about it . So if we agree taking land by force and expelling the native population out of it and then continuing to deny that people existed at a certain point which leads to the destruction of an entire nation is immoral then we can agree on that , if we don't agree then I guess I would see you as a horrible human being but yes , morality is subjective and you can think it is moral .

And Palestinians inherited the land as individuals who owned farms houses villages ... Jews came with the claim all the land is racially inherited to the entire group .

And you think it was just always that way? You think that no Jews were ever driven from there? You don't think that some of the Jews' claims to land might be made on the exact same basis (direct rather than racial inheritance)? You stance really just feels cherry-picked and full of holes.

No one is denying both sides have legitimate claims, they actually both have a right to that land and they should both live there .

&gt;Here's a real head scratcher, what is the appreciable difference between ""fake"" happiness and ""real"" happiness?

Let me paint you a little word picture. Imagine a woman on the floor of her home, lying on a soft, colorful blanket, playing with her adorable baby and they're having a great time. It's a bright, sunny day outside with blue skies and fluffy clouds, the home is warm and comforting, there's the scent of cookies in the air. Mother and child are laughing. Every maternal mechanism in her body is in overdrive, her body is being flooded with dopamine and oxytocin because of this idyllic experience of the perfect day with her and her baby.

Now, let's pull back from this scene and into the real world and we realize there's a woman curled up on a dirty floor in a corner. She's got next gen VR-tech on that's allowing her brain to experience what I just described fully - as if it were happening legitimately. In the real world she's lying in her own piss and shit and she's emaciated because she hasn't eaten in days, her clothes are filthy, her hair is matted and she reeks to high heaven. Her breath is a deadly rattle because she's suffering from pneumonia from exposure and blood is draining from her lips because her gums are split and inflamed because she hasn't brushed her teeth in weeks. In between the wheezing breaths you hear a little laugh. A horrible, monstrously distorted version of the happy laughter of mother and child in the VR simulation.

Now, tell me there's no difference between 'real happiness' and 'fake happiness'.

--------------------------------

MrSnrub28 @ 2019-01-16 16:17:57 :

Your example did not illustrate the difference at all. Let me counter your example.

Let's say you're currently, unknowingly, hooked up to a VR machine. Tomorrow you're given the option of being unhooked and throwing *everything* you've ever known about this life away and living a life that is nothing but toiling in squalor. Literally just standing around in excrement shoveling it into a furnace without any other human interaction until you die of starvation.

Do you walk away from everything you have right now to shovel shit? Your friends? Your family? Do you go to the ""real world"" and toil until your swift death?

Let's take this a step back. Let's say that our entire universe is being simulated on some unknowable alien's computer somewhere. Does that mean no humans have ever experienced real happiness?

What is this woman's life in the real world? It doesn't sound great. What is the problem if she's happy somewhere else? Why do you value ""real"" happiness over ""fake""? How do you even know what you're experiencing right now is ""real"" happiness?

Here's another hypothetical for you - when you were a child the doctors examined your brain chemistry and deduced that you would spend your life miserably depressed. Nothing would ever bring you joy or real happiness. Your brain would never produce its own dopamine and oxytocin due to a rare genetic disorder.

So they invent a device that takes over that function for you, and they implanted it inside of your head and you have no idea it is there.

If this was the case, have you ever been happy?

As for your last absurdity, that would be medical intervention to correct a physical defect - which I stated in my first post as perfectly fine. The question of whether the person is really happy or not is moot because at the very least they're getting the opportunity to lead a normal life.

&gt; What's wrong with taking a break from reality for a little bit? 

You're really going to have to define what you think 'take a break from reality' means. You keep using it without an agreed-upon definition. Daydreaming, regular dreaming and fantasizing are all means of escaping reality. As is reading a book or watching a movie. I've never said people shouldn't be able to do that. Humans are blessed with imagination and it's an essential dimension to our lives. It is not akin at all to popping a pill and spending 20 minutes with your brain on fire. 

&gt; I can hold down a job, pay my taxes, call my mom, fix my car, fuck my  girlfiend, and smoke a joint. It's all good. It's all reality. I laugh, I  cry, I live my life. 

If you can do all that, you can do all that without using drugs. Unless you have a legitimate medical need, then altering your mental state chemically to achieve artificial happiness is pathetic. You can be just as happy without it.

&gt; Being stimulated by drugs is a natural mechanism of neurochemistry too. 

No. It's not. You can get a square peg into a round hole too if you have access to a hammer. Doesn't mean it's supposed to be there."

Not true. While almost all societies have developed recreational drugs of some sort, in most cases the process was difficult and the supplies poor so they were restricted to ceremonial or religious use. Large scale consumption of recreational drugs is a very recent development. The only thing that would even qualify would be marijuana use (and only certain types from a few spots in the world could even get you high) and its potency was barely stronger than tobacco. Alcohol consumption wasn't always widespread and even when it was the potency was usually very low and it was accidentally protecting societies from waterborne disease.

Sex making you happy is built in to the system. It's there to encourage you to do it more. False comparison. Waste of time.

There are a few things to unpack here.  You didn’t specify, but I’m going to assume you’re American because the internet, so my apologies in advance if my answer doesn’t make as much sense in your national context.

First, as a matter of history and historical scholarship, *you* aren’t held responsible for those things.  Broadly speaking, even “white people” aren’t held responsible, unless we’re specifically considering an issue where racial constructs were important like slavery and segregation in the US or apartheid in Africa.  

That said, first Europeans and later “white people” in their specific context don’t come out looking so good in rigorous historical study.  All people are assholes, but the Europeans, mostly western Europeans, managed to systemize, industrialize and intellectually justify their assholery, and then leverage it to accumulate enormous wealth and power.  

For example, you’re correct that we shouldn’t view native Americans as some singular and naively pastoral and peaceful people, and no good history does that anymore, but European interaction with those cultures was still fundamentally different than how those cultures interacted amongst themselves and the Europeans themselves developed the distinction between Europeans and natives that carries over into our modern discourse.

Again, that’s all somewhat irrelevant to whether you should feel like you are berated for that history, because history itself doesn’t hold you accountable for anything that happened 400 years ago.

The second level here is cultural identity.  Your use of the phrase “heritage” is a good one.  How do you lay claim to your heritage and what comes with it?  Your language and tone suggest that you feel some personal connection to that history, which is why you feel personally “berated” when people attack it. 

That’s fine to feel that personal connection, that’s a natural part of cultural identity.  But if you’re going to take pride in the accomplishments, then you also need to accept the baggage.   If we focus on American identity, for example, it’s important to wrestle with a heritage literally built on the ideal that all men are created equal, but that regularly failed to live up to it.   

If you’re going to feel personally attacked by having that conversation, you should toughen up some and have more faith that your heritage can withstand the conversation.  If you worry that your pride in your heritage *can’t* withstand a hard nosed look at the baggage that came with it, maybe you should consider redefining the heritage you lay claim to.

Finally, there’s dealing with the living consequences of that heritage.  Focusing on the Aztecs and the African slave trade makes this all sounds like white people are asked to be held accountable for things that happened hundreds of years ago.  That ignores the threads running from those histories to the present day.  

It’d be easier to “get over” slavery, for example, if slavery hadn’t been followed by a century of active political, cultural, economic and physical repression with consequences that carry into the present day.   Those consequences exist regardless of whether you believe racism remains an active and powerful force in American society.  Should I feel “berated” when someone expresses frustration and anger at how those crimes affect their community today because I personally had no direct role in them?  *Shrug.*  It’s hard for me to begrudge those living with the consequences too much when I can literally point to ways my place in society is better today because of that past.

--------------------------------

human748926 @ 2019-01-20 12:51:09 :

Well I'd like to point out that by berated I mostl meant how Europeans were shamed to open borders to migrants and refugees which we were not prepared to take. Or the reverse racism that we start to observe in America with the rise of the idea of white privilege. Or the racism in South Africa where they take land for white farmers to give to black farmers (although granted this does strive from the point). Anyways I am against the idea that today's society is not equal, there are no laws or regulations stopping or impeding minorities and by looking in the past and blaming whites we are only slowing down societies development by creating a further racial divide. Granted that minorities are at a disadvantage due to their past but they are on a level playing field and assuming that all whites get some kind of privilege due to their race is counter productive.

you felt shame, not all europeans even with hindsight.

I'm european and I welcome them, yet you felt (we were) shamed into welcoming them.   You are projecting your view as it were representative of all these people.  It is true that some europeans felt shamed, but not all europeans.  

--------------------------------

rheus @ 2019-01-20 13:55:46 :

Many Europeans did feel shamed. If the problem was as easy as helping people, there would be way more support for it. 

I believe the problem lies more with culture than anything else. 

It would be easy for europeans to help europeans. It would be easy for europeans to help americans, japanese, and people from other cultures that are to a higher degree compatible in many ways. And even people from some culture regions that are not on the surface compatible, but adaptable like India/Sri Lanka.

Not to say that there aren't good people all over the world, there are, but there is a higher order mindset in many cultures that makes the transition very difficult.

rheus @ 2019-01-20 14:26:04 :

I was very specific about culture. 

Let's try to discuss this and figure out what we misunderstand.

Some cultures, short or long lived, have a higher degree of fundamentalism. Couple that with righteousness and you get a toxic mix. Couple that with percieved poverty and it gets explosive. Nazism is the perfect example. 

Were all german people horrible human beings? No, just a fraction, but the chain of dogmatic mindset perverted the german society, making some good people do horrible things. See others as of less worth. Dehumanized. 

What I'm saying is that we have to be aware that these dogmatic views still thrive in some cultures, and we have to be very careful it does not spread.

- 2 dead, 4 injured in Houston Texas, January 28; two shooters were killed."	"wraithcube @ 2019-01-30 23:52:50 :

So let's maybe start by defining our terms.

There's no solid definition of ""mass shootings"". Some sources claim 154 mass shootings in 2018, but [this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9o6uDO18sLxBqPwl_Gh9bnhW-ev_dABH83M5Vb5L8o/edit#gid=0) from motherjones has 109 total from 1982-2019. So how big of an issue it is will depend on how you define it.

As far as the scope mass shootings are actually a small percentage of gun deaths and injuries. By far the highest cause of gun deaths and injuries is self inflicted through suicide. So as far as an emergency goes mass shootings aren't even the highest priority as far as gun violence. It's even below stabbing. It just happens to be the scariest with all the headlines.

Then you've got what do you do if you declare a national emergency. Presumably you have to take additional steps to prevent things. Calling in the national guard for safety at sports games concerts and schools? There's nothing to really do in declaring an emergency.

Now as far as immigration being the lowest in 20 years is factually wrong. [This chart](https://www.nap.edu/openbook/21746/xhtml/images/p-37-1.jpg) shows the percentage of immigrants that make up the population is about as high as it's ever been. If you want to talk about illegal immigration that's hard to measure but it's also [not the lowest](http://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FT_18.11.28_FactsIllegalImmigration_USunauthorizedimmigranttotal_new.png) (i'm unsure of the last couple years of numbers)

Having dealt with that section of it I'm going to go a slightly different path than you might expect. Neither are national emergencies. National emergency provides broad power to the executive branch to deal with a pressing issue and neither qualifies.

The odd thing here is that liberals actually seem to be more ok with trump declaring a national emergency than conservatives. No really. From [Charlie Cooke](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/trump-national-emergency-declaration-constitutional-twilight-zone/), [Jonah Goldberg](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/impeachable-fence/), and [David French](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/defenses-of-trumps-emergency-declaration-defy-the-plain-language-and-clear-intent-of-the-law/) conservatives fall somewhere between hating the idea of this happening to thinking it's unconstitutional. It would be a huge presidential power grab, probably get held up in the courts, then either ruled unconstitutional or allow for a future president to declare a national emergency over like your tweet says gun violence or perhaps global warming.

So why would liberals be ok with it? It gets stopped in the courts. No wall gets built while it's in court. If it's not overturned perhaps a president kamala harris declares 3 immediate national emergencies on taking office over guns, climate change, and banking regulation.

So really the only people that want a national emergency are some of trumps base and perhaps future thinking liberals? It's actually unclear if it's even something trump would want or if he's just shooting his mouth off.

~ Edits ~

So some common criticisms of my post that I'd like to address (too many comments to respond individually). 

There really aren't any liberals advocating for Trump to declare a national emergency. My thoughts that they'd want to are mostly conjecture, though if you listen to podcasts you'll find some liberal groups like vox's the weeds have similar takes. And if you ask them if they'd be ok with a president declaring a national emergency for climate change or healthcare you'd get a thoughtful ""possibly"". But as it's not pressing noone is going to be taking active stances on a divisive future question.

Now a lot of people are bringing up whether this is about immigration or illegal immigration. The post itself only says immigration so I thought that's worth addressing. I'm not actually addressing whether immigration itself or the levels are good or bad (there's way too much nuance into how much immigration and what kind of immigration to dissect here). Merely that it's not at the lowest it's been in 20 years (dang 1999 was 20 years ago? wtf happened to time). You could say that trump did get to set immigration levels for 2018 and 2019 but if you have 210,000 one year and 10,000 the next to the average person that's not really a low as it's still the equivalent of 110,000 per year. It's why looking at percentage of the population of immigrants is usually a bit of a better look when you are talking long time frames. Top that off with the 1930s through 1990s were all significantly lower than the post 2000s.

If we are talking illegal immigration again it's super hard to measure. People here illegally don't typically want to stand up and say ""hey count me in that poll"". Granted the vast majority of these are visa overstays rather than border crossings so a border wall doesn't actually do much there. If you want border crossings I'm unsure of where to even find close to accurate numbers, but caravans of people also pretty a-typical events. And for people wanting to point out the caravans are asylum seekers, only about 6% of those asylum applications get approved.

I feel like most of that is missing the point however. It's a comparison between mass shootings vs immigration. Which immigration and illegal immigration have far wider effects on the economy and workforce and public services despite how horrific and terrifying singular shooting events are. In declaring a national emergency it's about what additional actions the president can take. In dealing with immigration legal or illegal there's plenty of policies and actions that can be undertaken. However, there's not much doing that for shootings will do. So for a 1000 person caravan you'll have 60 valid asylum seekers and 940 would be immigrants.

And just for the sake of it I'd like to point out nowhere in this post did I actually take a position on what immigration levels are good or bad. It's also irrelevant to the OPs post which requires to a degree we assume it's bad for the sake of the argument. If it's not a problem it's not worth a national emergency. If it is a problem it's still not worth a national emergency.

“No evidence” federal law always supersedes state law wherever it is within the rights of the federal government and immigration is one of those things. The executive branch is the enforcer of federal law and he was selectively deciding not to prosecute cities that were blatantly disregarding federal law. Everything else was legislating through executive order which again is bypassing congress and is not something the president is supposed to do therefore authoritarian executive overreach.

You don't appear to understand that the AG is the person who decides what to prosecute federally, not the president.

You also dont understand what a sanctuary city is a city which doesnt volunteer information to feds. There is nothing illegal about that. It isnt their job to police immigration. This is why Trump hasnt prosecuted sanctuary cities either, no president can.

Regardless of the rest of your post (which I might agree with some of what you’re saying), the President holds 100% of the responsibility to the people for what the AG does. Your first sentence is absolutely ridiculous. If the AG doesn’t do what’s legal or best for the country it is the President’s job to deal with it. Any cabinet member’s actions are the president’s orders.

If you are appointed by the President, report to the President, and can quickly be replaced by the President, the AG is an agent of the Oval Office and carries out the directives of the president. To say the president is not responsible for everything that the AG produces is mental gymnastics to support your claim rather than understand a basic government organization chart..."

The point is that someone here illegally shouldn't be here in the first place. Thus, a murder committed by an illegal immigrant could have been prevented if they hadn't immigrated illegally. 

Additionally, if this would-be criminal applied to enter the country and their background check showed they were a criminal, they'd be denied; we shouldn't be allowing criminals to enter the country where they will, presumably, commit crimes.

Acting in a bad or dishonest fashion.

Pretty low.  Unless you were starving.

When you steal, you victimize someone, causing them material loss.

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-06 21:50:29 :

So they've established a rule saying they don't want to be stolen from. By breaking that rule, you victimize them based on the criteria they've set forth dictating the behavior that will result in them being victimized. In other words, ""don't steal from me because I said so.""

Are there other rules that you would think lowly of someone for breaking?

--------------------------------

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-06 21:55:45 :

&gt;In other words, ""don't steal from me because I said so.""

No, this is not even close.  The correct version is:

""Do not steal because stealing causes measurable material harm to someone.""

&gt;Are there other rules that you would think lowly of someone for breaking?

Lots of them.  Killing or injuring someone for example.

Crossing an imaginary line is not one of those acts.  Just like being a witch isn't.  As human civilization matures, we drop stupid rules and become better for it.  I like the fact that people are not being burned at the stake anymore.  I'm fairly confident that our children will be glad that there aren't arbitrary and non-nonsensical imaginary lines in the sand anymore.

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-06 22:09:55 :

Wait, stealing doesn't cause material harm. Stabbing someone causes material (physical) harm. Stealing involves a material object that someone has an immaterial attachment to. Perhaps I have an heirloom that has sentimental value. Stealing it would cause me emotional harm and have no physical (material) effect.

Maybe rethink your criteria a bit.

--------------------------------

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 08:33:17 :

Again, a right is not a physical entity. It's a concept.

You have the right to own physical objects, but the right itself is not a physical object. Thus, unless the theft of something results in physical harm to the owner, stealing causes no physical harm.

Pedantic.  Stealing from you harms you in measurable ways.  If I steal your car, you can't go to work.  If I steal your money, you can't feed yourself.  That is why we have laws against stealing.

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-07 14:33:10 :

That's right, no physical harm.

It still deprives you from something you own, which is harmful to you.

But the HARM is not physical.

--------------------------------

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 15:40:32 :

Yes it is.  You don't have a necklace anymore ;)

What's the point of this pedantic question?

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-07 15:43:38 :

You said one ought not steal from people because it causes them physical harm. I challenged that notion by saying that theft does not always cause physical harm, thus there must be some other, greater reason why we shouldn't steal.

Tell me, do you think there is a difference between physical harm and mental harm?

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 16:22:18 :

&gt;You said one ought not steal from people because it causes them physical harm. I challenged that notion by saying that theft does not always cause physical harm, thus there must be some other, greater reason why we shouldn't steal.

You're arguing about pedantic difference in language.  Losing an object/property that belongs to you is harmful/bad for you.  The reason society does not tolerate stealing is because it harms its members.

&gt;Tell me, do you think there is a difference between physical harm and mental harm?

I have no idea what you're asking.

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-07 16:29:18 :

It's not a difference in language, it's a difference in the entire concept. Physical harm is very different from mental harm. A family member dying does not cause you physical harm. It causes you harm of a mental/emotional nature.

Having a necklace stolen also does not cause physical harm. It causes emotional distress and violates one's right to property.

My entire point is that the reason we don't steal is because it violates a principle/right that has nothing to do with whether or not you've caused someone physical harm. 

The same can be said of illegal immigrants: they are violating a principle (the laws of our land) that, while not causing physical harm, is still wrong.

Yes, causing physical harm can be wrong, but there are more ways to be wrong than just by causing physical harm.

--------------------------------

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 17:02:46 :

&gt;The same can be said of illegal immigrants: they are violating a principle (the laws of our land) that, while not causing physical harm, is still wrong.

We don't make laws because we're bored and we like to mess with people.  We make laws because it serves a purpose.  Laws against stealing serve a purpose.  Anti-foreigner laws are oppressive and do not serve a purpose.

At some point owning slaves were legal.  I'm glad people did not respect that law out of principle.

Immigration laws serve the purpose of maintaining the construct of a country with citizens and the rights given to those citizens.

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 17:11:03 :

&gt;Immigration laws serve the purpose of maintaining the construct of a country with citizens and the rights given to those citizens.

Again not true.  Allowing people to travel freely does not infringe any of your rights.  The only thing anti-foreigner laws protect are the delicate feelings of nationalists who get offended at the sight of foreigners.

&gt;What do you think protects people's right to property? Not all countries grant the same rights.

True, but I don't see why this is relevant.  In fact, this is an argument for not following laws/rules blindly and using your own good judgement.

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-07 17:18:01 :

Wait, so if people can travel freely, how do we decide who gets to benefit from rights granted by America? In America, I'm allowed to own weapons. In Mexico, weapons are illegal. Thus, by crossing the border, my American rights are infringed upon my Mexico. If you don't have a border, you don't have a country.

From an immigration standpoint, if you aren't a citizen, you are using the infrastructure that citizens pay for with taxes. By being here illegally, you are stealing from everyone who has paid to build the country.

--------------------------------

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 17:24:59 :

&gt;If you don't have a border, you don't have a country.

There are no borders between Germany and France.  And it is better this way :)  Less bureaucracy is a plus.  Likewise there are no borders between New York an

&gt;In America, I'm allowed to own weapons. In Mexico, weapons are illegal. 

I don't see how this is relevant.  When you cross from New York to New Jersey, the local laws/regulations change.  Everything from gun laws to minimum wage can be different.

&gt;From an immigration standpoint, if you aren't a citizen, you are using the infrastructure that citizens pay for with taxes.  By being here illegally, you are stealing from everyone who has paid to build the country.

Also not true.  Immigrant, legal or illegal, pay taxes.  You own social security administration say that illegal immigrants are a net positive for the social security system because they pay taxes but can't receive benefits.  [I wrote about it a while back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9vm0vw/trump_signs_executive_order_denying_asylum_to/e9fo9cz/)

If anything, you owe an apology to immigrants because they are suffering under *taxation without representation*.  I remember people getting upset about that a while ago ;)

--------------------------------

blender_head @ 2019-02-07 17:30:57 :

That report was only talking about social security. What about the other areas our tax dollars go toward? Education, housing, infrastructure, healthcare, defense? Does it make sense that they should be able to take advantage of aspects of our society that they don't contribute to?

miltondepeyracpeyran @ 2019-02-07 20:37:22 :

No one is taking advantage of anything.  If you immigrate to somewhere, you pay taxes like everyone else. (whether it is income taxes, property taxes or just the sales tax)

Immigrants all around the world are a large group of people who pay taxes, but don't get any say in how those taxes are spent.  I call that unjust.

There is more than one type of tax.  And immigrants pay all kinds of taxes like everyone else.

&gt;I'm simply focused on everyone following those laws that are in place.

Which is how I was interpreting it. I apologize if that was off base, and as I am in favor of affirmative action as well we can stop arguing here anyways.	2	0	stop arguing comment					"As a minority, albeit one who gets the shit end of the stick when it comes to college admissions (Indian), this is something that I have had a lot of trouble coming to a conclusion on.

It's hard to be a minority. Really, really hard. This is something I am unwilling to debate, and will not change my mind on this matter. I have suffered a great deal of racism and prejudice in my life just because I look different than most people, even if I'm not considered by admissions officers as ""aggrieved"" enough to deserve a leg up. Because of this, I know what it's like to face discrimination as a person of color.

But two wrongs do not make a right. Dr. Martin Luther King dreamed of a country where his children would not be judged ""by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character"". This is what I believe America should stand for, whether it comes to pursuing job opportunities, making use of the financial system, and, also, applying to college. This, in my opinion, is non-negotiable, regardless of any ""good"" that this could have on society.

And this is precisely why I have been so conflicted on this matter. Affirmative action has done a lot to benefit African Americans, Latino Americans, and women in this country. And having a diverse set of people on campus certainly has its benefits. I am willing to acknowledge both of these. But with all of the admissions scandals that have come to light in the last few months, as well as the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard, I am beginning to lose my sense of compliance with the system.

Take this for example. An admissions officer at Harvard made the following note on an Asian-American applicant: ""Oh, typical Asian student. Wants to be a doctor. Nothing special here."" And then these people turn around and say ""oh, we take all aspects of an applicant's profile into account"". They are lying through their teeth. Shame on that officer. I am sick of seeing so many of my friends and family face so much discrimination due to something that is out of their control. We work so hard in life to succeed, yet we are punished for being ourselves. It's time to draw a line in the sand.

My viewpoint is as follows. Under no circumstances, whatsoever, should colleges take race into account when choosing to or not to admit a student. Nothing should compromise racial discrimination when it comes to college admissions. If this negatively affects other minorities, tough shit. If this decreases the racial diversity of college campuses, tough shit. If this means that college campuses will be filled with a bunch of ""typical Asians that want to be doctors"", fucking deal with it.

Please, someone, give me a convincing argument to think otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your contributions. I'd like to ""mass response"" with my opinions on some of the more-discussed topics:

* Eliminating legacy admissions: I'm with this 100%. Statistically, it might even completely solve the problem without anyone suffering discrimination, even white people. This, in my view, is probably the best solution right now.
* Making up for centuries of discrimination: Doesn't matter. The people in the present did not contribute to the wrongdoings of their ancestors. It's difficult because the people that need to be held accountable are dead, but this doesn't mean we discriminate back against people who weren't even born yet.
* Why Asians outperform other races: Has almost nothing to do with culture, and mostly everything to do with immigration patterns.
* Affirmative action levels the playing field: So does abolishing legacy admissions. So does improving public education. So does getting rid of gerrymandering and racist zoning laws. There are plenty of ways to solve a complex problem, so a lack of creativity is no excuse for injustice.
* It’s not about disadvantaging Asians, it’s about giving an advantage: college admissions is a zero sum game, since there are a limited number of seats. This means that you can’t lift one group up without disadvantaging another.
* It's okay to disadvantage some people because they still benefit from their ancestors' actions: No it's not. It's not their fault.

EDIT 2: You have changed my mind. Kudos to [Andoverian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Andoverian) and [photobummer](https://www.reddit.com/user/photobummer) for the ""proof by contradiction"". Good job.

A bit more about my background, first of all. I'm a grad student in Electrical Engineering that's taken plenty of machine learning and artificial intelligence classes. One of the things that we talk about a lot is that AI, while it seems like it would be more impartial than humans, is not. It is completely dependent on data collected by humans, and humans are biased. In fact, they're even worse than humans, since for the most part they lack the capacity to have self-awareness that humans do.

I mentioned this in one of the comments below, and the ones that I just shouted out pointed out that this is precisely the reason why we need affirmative action. Because humans are biased, and bias needs to be monitored. This really connects the question at hand with something that I've spent a lot of time studying, which is why this realization has hit me so hard. Perhaps I'm blaming the wrong mechanism. After all, **what I'm really angry about is that Asian and Indian Americans are being discriminated against**. But this is happening because affirmative action is being used against us, not for us. I believe that affirmative action should be used to remind admissions officers that it's not okay to reject an Indian student on as blatantly shallow of a basis of ""being a typical Indian"".

Here's my revised thesis: **Affirmative action itself is not the problem - it's that it is not being used to combat biases against Asians and Indians.**

Thank you to every single one of you who contributed. I've responded to many of you as I could the past day, and have given deltas to those who gave arguments that genuinely gave me an interesting, unique, and convincing perspective, but I am going to leave this case to rest for now. I'm still passionate about discrimination and how it plays out with affirmative action, and perhaps someday I'll make another CMV regarding how Asians and Indians are treated in college admissions. Until then, though, I'm happy that we were all able to have this discussion."	"A_Soporific @ 2019-03-25 05:27:34 :

Are you familiar with the bot used to scan applications to weed out ""unfit"" candidates. Despite not using race it began to turn out badly unbalanced results strongly favoring white candidates despite no bit of the programming directly causing that. It seems that there is a lot of implicit bias built into the objective data. So even if you build a model to remove humans from the loop entirely there needs to be a final check to make sure that representation occurs and reliance on objective data doesn't return unacceptable outcomes.

I would approve of the use of race as this final check in college admissions to ensure that students meet and interact with people of a diverse background. After all interacting as peers and friends is the easiest way to check racism by revealing the deeper commonalities and personhood of people of other races.

--------------------------------

the_FUEGO_ @ 2019-03-25 06:13:49 :

Machine learning algorithms are not unbiased. They're completely dependent on data produced by humans. This is a huge problem in the field of AI right now, and in fact I believe that it's extremely important to pay attention to race when designing classification algorithms to correct biases in training data introduced by humans.

Having race as a final check is as bad as using it in any other part of the admissions process. X - Y - Z = X - Z - Y.

   

--------------------------------

A_Soporific @ 2019-03-25 06:38:11 :

So, you're saying that we shouldn't check to see if the admissions process is turning away qualified applicants based on non-obvious interactions between data and criteria that end up being a cypher for race, even if that wasn't the intent of the people developing the process?

We should wait until the process turns out an inappropriate response, people get hurt, and people conclude that everyone involve intended to exclude them and then examine the system for errors, rather than attempt to preempt a problem?

Kyrond @ 2019-03-25 11:17:21 :

That's what OP said. We do need to have a system that does *not* have biases.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2019-03-25 12:14:57 :

What if the bias is so ingrained in the data that the only way to account for it is to explicitly look at race?

--------------------------------

Philophile1 @ 2019-03-25 13:32:06 :

Data having bias does not mean that it is not saying what you want it to say. Data having bias means that the people who built the dataset chose attributes which favors one outcome or another. In your example this means that the data used in college admissions favors white people, when in reality it is just a biased data.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2019-03-25 13:43:21 :

I have two problems with that argument:

A) if you’re selectively designing an algorithm to avoid racially biased data, how is that significantly different than taking race into account? The whole point of using an algorithm should be to set out the criteria that are important *independent* of race.

B) it is entirely possible (likely, I’d argue) that the racial bias is present in many or all measurable factors that are relevant to college admissions. It may simply be there is no way to factor out race without directly accounting for it. 

--------------------------------

Philophile1 @ 2019-03-25 15:51:58 :

The algorithm design does not take race into account. The data would take race into account. 
Bias in data means when you collect the data you are collecting data that favorably looks upon one group or another. Ideally you would want to get data that has no bias.
Since you train the neural network on the data, the algorithm then gets some sort of bias.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2019-03-25 15:53:33 :

That doesn’t really address either of my points, though. 

--------------------------------

Philophile1 @ 2019-03-25 16:29:06 :

you clearly just don't understand basic data science. Like your racist comments simply don't really make sense in the frame that OP is talking about. He is talking about biased data. BIAS is the definition that one side is favored. I was explaining how data bias works.

Are you saying that white people are better than every other race and the data shows that? Because that what it sounds like right now.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2019-03-25 16:31:34 :

I think you’re seriously misinterpreting my comments. I’m arguing *in favor* of considering race in admissions. I’m saying that the systemic racial bias in our society has made it very difficult to find relevant data that strips out race entirely, and that cherry-picking data for the express purpose of ignoring race is no different than considering race to begin with.

&gt;I cannot stress this enough: I do not give one measly fuck about the troll's feelings or gaming experience. They deserve to be penalized. They are the ones intentionally trying to ruin it for others. So the only guy we disagree over is the 5th guy, and I gave you my answer about him above.

I don't care about your personal opinion towards trolls, I'll be honest. Why have only 3 people enjoy the game to its full extent when you could let all 5? You're just being selfish.

&gt;It's a team-based game with friendly fire on all the time. So trolls can mess with other players a number of ways even while muted. They can shoot their gadgets, barricade walls and doors the other person wanted to leave open, blind them with flashbangs, or just straight up teamkill them fewer times than trigger the penalties.

Wow, sounds like gameplay sabotage - something I openly said that I do not condone. 

&gt;I never suggested any such thing. 

Obviously you didn't. I was just using it as an example put into a different perspective.

&gt;And trolls are the single biggest reason people stay quiet online.

Says who?

&gt;They don't have to do so verbally. You are completely ignoring that trolls are specifically there to antagonize other players. That is their ""game,"" it is the reason they are online. So they will find other ways, and they can get damned creative about it. I was playing EA sports NHL online, in a mode where each gamer takes over one player on the ice. The guy playing the goalie decided he wanted to troll us. In the real NHL, if the goalie touches the Puck in a specific area, it's a penalty on the defense, but the goalie himself doesn't serve it. So he would just constantly violate the rule and we would be stuck in the penalty box.

That is game sabotage which I do not condone. "	1	0	stop arguing comment					"For some context, I am a strong believer in the freedom of speech and I think that it should apply to video games in the same way that it applies everywhere else. The current methods of action being taken by game developers and automated systems it to mute or ban any players that say anything considered to be offensive by their standards. Muted players are either temporarily or permanently unable to say anything to others after their punishment, and banned players are actually prevented from playing the game.

&amp;nbsp;

I am strongly against this. I believe that they should drop these punishments and instead allow for players to exercise greater control over what content they wish to see. Many games already allow for players to block communications from other people, and this could easily be expanded: any players that are constantly reported or flagged for offensive behavior could be assigned a label as being toxic and players would then have the option to automatically mute communication from these ""toxic"" players, while still allowing others to speak with them by default.

&amp;nbsp;

I believe that people should be allowed to say what they want to say, and, in many cases of video games, players only act toxic to blow off steam, mess around, or get a rile out of others - not to demonstrate true racist/sexist/offensive beliefs or ruin the enjoyment of the game for others. The game should be played how people want to play it and restricting players from launching their favorite game or enjoying all its features because of something they said is bullshit; furthermore, I don't think creating standards for what communication is allowed is okay, because it is all up to a matter of personal preference on what is acceptable and unacceptable to say.

Those seem mutually exclusive to me -- the act of riling up someone is precisely to distract them from the game is it not?

But what if the way some people want to play it is to directly interfere with how someone else wants to play it? Setting aside toxic chat for a second, I can think of plenty of more clearcut ways that some people want to play a game by ruining it for others;  Intentionally team killing, blocking your teammates(e.g small doorways), intentionally throwing the game, blatantly cheating..  


Do you think people should be free to do all of these things because its how they want to play the game, or just that they should be free to verbally abuse people but all these other ways of ruining the game for their team should not be allowed?  


  
\&gt;  I don't think creating standards for what communication is allowed is okay, because it is all up to a matter of personal preference on what is acceptable and unacceptable to say.   


IMO the answer here is to differentiate between official servers and unofficial servers, and to actually let community members run their own servers like they used to be able to.  Want to have the experience the game dev is pushing for? Play on official servers. Want to be a toxic asshole? Join a toxic asshole community server. Want to see who has the best aimbot? Play on a cheating-only server, counterstrike had a ton of those.   


The root of your issue, IMO, is that games these days generally only offer a matchmaking service and official servers only, so there is no room for unofficial unsanctioned gameplay the way there used to be with community ran servers. It was much easier to find a community that matched your playstyle when you actually had some agency in deciding where you wanted to play, rather than just clicking ""find match"" and being paired up with some random people on a server with no one monitoring it.

Making people mad can be strategic to winning because you typically perform worse when you're angry. So that could even be a valid way of playing to win in some cases; however, anyone can mute said player to prevent that from happening. I'm just saying that it shouldn't be blanket mute, but rather for players that specifically opt to block said communications.

&gt;But what if the way some people want to play it is to directly interfere with how someone else wants to play it?

With the chat system I suggested, you could bypass this. I don't condone other forms of toxicity like the ones you mentioned and agree that those players should be punished.

&gt;IMO the answer here is to differentiate between official servers and unofficial servers, and to actually let community members run their own servers like they used to be able to.

For games that have this feature and don't have dead unofficial servers, I suppose. But many don't and either way I still believe that there's a better way of handling toxicity than simply slamming down a ban hammer or stripping them of their ability to talk to ANYONE.

Intentionally antagonizing your opponent is regulated in almost any competition. In football, it's a personal foul. In soccer, in can draw a card. In basketball it's a technical. In hockey, it can even lead to the guy dropping his gloves and punching you in the face.

I agree that there should be player controls as well, but there's no reason why they shouldn't try to head off toxicity before it starts.

Professional competitive sports and e-sports are completely different from casual play.

--------------------------------

IlluminatusUIUC @ 2019-03-28 16:23:12 :

With the exception of hockey fights, those rules are enforced all the way to the lowest amateur levels. Sometimes even more strictly.

If anything, antagonizism should be more 'acceptable' at higher levels than casual play. These are professionals, after all. Certainly some horrid things are yelled from the stands at pro games.

But it's not acceptable there. Why should it be at lower levels with amateurs playing for fun, some of whom are kids? 

--------------------------------

Jeremy0015 @ 2019-03-28 16:30:10 :

In a video game with my suggestion, you can choose to automatically or manually mute anyone who may antagonize you. You don't have that CHOICE in real-life which is why it has to be regulated. 

--------------------------------

IlluminatusUIUC @ 2019-03-28 16:38:26 :

If it was ""strategic"" or ""valid"" as you say, it wouldn't be banned at nearly all levels of competition. 

--------------------------------

Jeremy0015 @ 2019-03-28 16:56:42 :

Again, real-life is different from video games and pro leagues are different from casual gameplay. Also the use of it as strategy is a rare example - my point still stands in general.

--------------------------------

IlluminatusUIUC @ 2019-03-28 17:20:28 :

What point are you making? The other poster pointed out that it's mutually exclusive to intentionally rule people up while claiming it's not to distract from the game. You said it's a valid strategy. I pointed out that it is not a valid strategy, to which you changed and said it's rare.

Is it valid or not? If a player gets penalized and eventually ejected for antagonizing in real football, why shouldn't they be penalized and ejected for doing the same in video game football? 

--------------------------------

Jeremy0015 @ 2019-03-28 17:33:46 :

The point I'm making is the one in my actual CMV post. This is just an extension of it focused on the fact that shit-talking can be used by players to tilt others to their advantage. I acknowledged that that strategy is banned in competitive play and the real-life world, but that's highly different from casual gaming.

&gt;Is it valid or not? If a player gets penalized and eventually ejected for antagonizing in real football, why shouldn't they be penalized and ejected for doing the same in video game football?

Because in video game football you can mute the player. You can't forcefully strap duct tape to the mouth of the opposing quarterback and call it good in real life, you would be forced to hear their shit talk unless someone stepped in to stop it. It is completely different.

--------------------------------

IlluminatusUIUC @ 2019-03-28 17:44:18 :

&gt; I acknowledged that that strategy is banned in competitive play and the real-life world, but that's highly different from casual gaming.

You keep throwing out this difference like it matters. It also contradicts your OP where you said you want free speech to apply in video games the same as it does everywhere else. When people point out that this doesn't work in real life, you just say games are different somehow. 

If it's not a valid strategy in the NFL, it shouldn't be valid in Madden. You seem to be agreeing with this point. Intentionally antagonizing your opponent is bad for their game and they have the incentive and power to ban it. 

At this point, I'm not sure what is left to point to. Companies have no legal obligation to allow trolls on their game. They have no financial incentive to do so, banning trolls is better for business. They have no PR benefits to allowing them, most fans want them to crack down on toxicity.

All your left with is vague platitudes to justify allowing trolls, and frankly I don't give a fuck about them. They have made quite clear that other players' feelings don't matter to them, and I return that.

It may not be a valid strategy to do this in either case, but I believe there is a fundamental difference in how it is handled. The real-world is different from a game and can't afford to be treated the same because video games have more possibilities of dealing with it.

&gt;Companies have no legal obligation to allow trolls on their game. 

Never said they didn't.

&gt;hey have no financial incentive to do so, banning trolls is better for business

Proof? I'm going to copy and paste a response to this belief I made earlier:

&gt;Here's the 5 person example expanded:

3 people dont want to see toxicity

1 is toxic

1 doesn't mind it and just wants to talk to people

If you let toxicity run free, 3 of them will be pissed off. That's bad. If you mute toxic behavior forcibly, now 3 are happy, but the muted player and the one that doesn't mind are negatively impacted. That's 2 players upset. However, let's say you let the three players that don't want to see it automatically hide it. They're happy. The toxic player can continue talking. He is happy. The player that doesn't mind can see it as well, he is happy. Now all 5 players are happy, as opposed to 2 or 3.

I have no proof it would work this way, but you have to proof it wouldn't.

&gt;All your left with is vague platitudes to justify allowing trolls, and frankly I don't give a fuck about them. They have made quite clear that other players' feelings don't matter to them, and I return that.

I'd encourage you to read all of my statements on this matter because the only reason I have to keep saying the same things is because people keep making the same arguments in the first place without saying anything meaningful enough to change my opinion. 

--------------------------------

IlluminatusUIUC @ 2019-03-28 18:09:06 :

&gt;It may not be a valid strategy to do this in either case,

Exactly, so if it is not a valid way to win, the only remaining reason to do it is to piss off other players. Game devs don't want their players to leave the game upset, so they move to ban trolls. 

&gt;The real-world is different from a game and can't afford to be treated the same because video games have more possibilities of dealing with it.

I added this in an edit as you responding, but this contradicts your OP. In your op, you wanted freedom of speech online handled the same as everywhere else. This is how it is handled everywhere else: by punting trolls out. 

&gt;Proof? I'm going to copy and paste a response to this belief I made earlier:
&gt;

If the 5th guy can only be happy by talking to trolls, he should join games that allow for trolling. They exist, that is basically EVE Online in a nutshell. 

I'd also point out that that 5th guy is going to be having what the other 3 hear as a one sided conversation with a troll, which is likely to get him muted too. 

Further, if the game is one based around teamwork (your posts suggest you're complaining about Rainbow 6 Siege) then automuting the troll just leaves the team in a worse place. Eject the troll and replace him with a normal player and the experience improves for all 5 in the game.

&gt;I have no proof it would work this way, but you have to proof it wouldn't.

I have been gaming online for decades, and trolls will find a way to troll no matter what you do. Their entire point is to piss you off, so if they can't do it with chat they will do it in other ways.

How do you differentiate between someone who is trying to actively troll people and shit on their experience and someone who just says things that are considered offensive once in a while? Because muting or banning them if a blanket action that doesn't care about what purpose or intent was involved. 

&gt;I added this in an edit as you responding, but this contradicts your OP. In your op, you wanted freedom of speech online handled the same as everywhere else. This is how it is handled everywhere else: by punting trolls out.

You're just arguing semantics. I referenced freedom of speech as context for my opinion because I fully support people being able to say what's on their mind. You can punt trolls out in your football match, sure, but there's different ways of handling it in a video game and comparing professional sports to a match of counter strike is just dumb.

&gt;If the 5th guy can only be happy by talking to trolls, he should join games that allow for trolling. They exist, that is basically EVE Online in a nutshell.

So we should kick out players that don't mind offensive language from our game and force them to play shittier games they don't want to play. What is this mindset?

&gt;I'd also point out that that 5th guy is going to be having what the other 3 hear as a one sided conversation with a troll, which is likely to get him muted too.

Well one, it can happen but it'd probably be rare, and two, they can mute them or unmute them if they truly want to. It isn't hard. Why only give benefits to those 3 players and penalize the other 2 rather than benefiting all 5?

&gt;Further, if the game is one based around teamwork (your posts suggest you're complaining about Rainbow 6 Siege) then automuting the troll just leaves the team in a worse place. Eject the troll and replace him with a normal player and the experience improves for all 5 in the game.

I don't even play RS6 and I don't know in specific how it works. If someone joins the game and they are muted by the developers, what's the difference between them being automuted by a system instead (and a system that they can HAVE THE CHOICE TO UNMUTE THEM IF THEY WANT AS WELL)? If that isn't how it works and only bans are applied, then either incorporate chat shortcuts / pings or don't apply the system because a competitive game of that nature might get to a point where muting would be too harmful. 

However, for a lot of games, I GUARANTEE that you will get paired with players who just don't use their microphone in the first place. So they are JUST AS USELESS as someone is muted. But you're not going to just ban anyone without a microphone, right? But that's what you're suggesting.

&gt;I have been gaming online for decades, and trolls will find a way to troll no matter what you do. Their entire point is to piss you off, so if they can't do it with chat they will do it in other ways.

Sorry, I'm not so experienced with trolls. Tell me how a troll can bypass the automatic mute feature in-game and still harass other players verbally unless they choose to unmute him or her?

&gt;How do you differentiate between someone who is trying to actively troll people and shit on their experience and someone who just says things that are considered offensive once in a while? 

Does it matter? If you're the one stuck in the game when #2 decides it's time to be offensive, it's not a big difference at all. That being said, I haven't seen any game without a progressive temp ban system that escalates to a permaban with repeated violations. If someone gets permabanned on the first offense, it's usually for cheating.

Freedom of speech has legal significance, and if you keep using the word without acknowledging what it actually means, it undermines your claim. You don't want freedom of speech handled the same online, you want *more* freedom of speech online, where people do not suffer the most severe consequences for it.

&gt;You can punt trolls out in your football match, sure, but there's different ways of handling it in a video game and comparing professional sports to a match of counter strike is just dumb.

&gt;That wasn't my point and I don't see how the second part about ban systems is even relevant. 

Then what was your point? Are people who are only occasionally offensive somehow less blame worthy when they act that way? I brought up temp bans because presumably if they just let it slip once out of weakness, they wouldn't be permabanned. 

&gt;Stop arguing semantics, I don't care.

You started this CMV talking about how much you believe in freedom of speech, but you don't care what it means? 

&gt; I shouldn't have to change the game I am playing to one I don't enjoy simply because I want to talk to and play with my friend who may be considered toxic. That is bullshit.

Tell your toxic friend not to be toxic or deal with the consequences of his actions. If I were you, I'd stop making friends with toxic players and you won't run into this problem.

&gt;I don't care about your personal opinion towards trolls, I'll be honest. Why have only 3 people enjoy the game to its full extent when you could let all 5? You're just being selfish.

The *troll* is the one being selfish, because he can't keep stop spewing shit all over the game. And so the game devs ban them, and the bulk of the player base sheds not one tear over it.

&gt;Wow, sounds like gameplay sabotage - something I openly said that I do not condone. 

They often go hand in hand, so devs hand out bans to prevent verbal harassment from becoming game sabotage. You might condemn it, but that doesn't change that it happens.

It’s funny you say that because you have completely missed the best argument for legal abortion, so I’m guessing you don’t actually know the facts. The lead in being that abortion is undoubtedly immoral—as is killing any living thing—but that we don’t follow natural law because it leads to emotional decisions. So if the morality argument is out the window then what’s left? Well the only other way to look at it is as a deterrent or a safety measure. Well the rate of abortion is the same whether it’s legal or illegal, and it’s much more dangerous when it’s illegal because people are getting “back alley” abortions instead of getting them in clinics. So logically having it be legal is the only solution. 

&gt;It’s the woman’s choice, just like i stated with male masturbation. If you can’t see that then im not sure what you’ve been readinv

And this argument is just such a bad one. It’s embarrassing that it’s being used, and that’s literally why there’s an abortion “debate”. 

&gt; I don’t see why any men other from the father should have any say in what a woman does with her body. That’s why im limiting them.

No one should have power over anyone else’s body. But a fetus isn’t a part of the mother’s body anymore, it’s it’s own entity residing inside of the mother. 

&gt; I’m a male too, im just not a disrespectful person towards womens’ clear issues with over-controlling white men

You need to stop arguing with your emotions. Shaming someone into agreeing with you doesn’t work. Fun fact, people did in more when you aggressively attack their position. In the future you should use facts and sources instead of opinions to try to persuade someone.

Every analogy you use, well you’re right, doesn’t make sense. That’s because you’re either easily swayed to use bad examples or you’re arguing in bad faith. 

For example, men should be allowed to masturbate right? That kills lots of living organisms (living sperm cells). What if women were trying to push for you not to allowed to be? How do you feel about that example in particular? Wouldn’t it make sense to give a man their body autonomy instead of restricting it? What’s so different about a woman not wanting to deliver a baby, a very life changing experience, than a man not wanting to stay horny (which is not at all as significant an experience as having a fuckin child)? The woman should be allowed to abort, and the man allowed to masturbate. Unless you support a ban on male masturbation? 

I’m a man by the way, but if you’re seriously buying those talking points...come on think critically

immatx @ 2019-05-19 09:26:15 :

Even beyond the terrible comparison between a fetus and sperm, this is a straw man. OP wasn’t saying abortion should be illegal or men should determine whether it is or isn’t, OP is saying that men should have a voice in the discussion.

&gt;Which i clearly stated, they shouldn’t for the same reasons women shouldn’t have a voice in male masturbation.

This wouldn’t be democracy. That’s why I disagree. 

&gt;And why is fetus vs sperm a “terrible comparison”

Because it doesn’t have a full set of chromosome. Whether you consider sperm alive or not, it can’t be considered human because of that. And we don’t really care about the deaths of non human lives.

How is an embryo or fetus more human the a sperm cell? No brain activity, no self preservation. Cool it has the chromosomes, what does that actually mean to you? Does that mean downs syndrome people arent human since they dont have the same chromosomes? Could a sperm and egg cell not be considered human life if they are literally the most necessary components?

What about kids already born, do we care about them? Why are there kids in the foster system, and we’re trying to force more to be born

How is popular vote not democracy? We technically don’t even live in a democracy, so logically you should vote for the party that believes in it, aka democrats. And the democratic party is stupid too.

Most people are pro choice. Democracy says abortion should be legal. What do you really believe in?

Would you care more if i killed a puppy in front of your eyes, or some biological mass that doesn’t even seem alive?

Im not a psychopath i would save the puppy

Because an embryo has double the chromosomes of a speed cell. It’s a sperm cell plus an egg. I don’t understand why I have to explain this.

&gt; Does that mean downs syndrome people arent human since they dont have the same chromosomes?

No having one extra chromosome is not the same as having half. You’re also looking at an abnormality versus the standard, which is wrong for a whole other reason. 

&gt; Could a sperm and egg cell not be considered human life if they are literally the most necessary components?

Is bread pizza? Is sauce pizza? Is cheese pizza? No, none of those are pizza individually. 

&gt; What about kids already born, do we care about them? Why are there kids in the foster system, and we’re trying to force more to be born

Completely irrelevant to what we’re talking about, which is already off course.

Can you explain what each chromosome represents differently from a human? How many chromosomes need to be missing? Is sperm not a production of the human body? Hmm just like an embryo. 

Im not seeing the point of your pizza analogy, fetuses and sperm are not pizza or bread. Although i suppose they can be treated similarly, as none of them have any consciousness or independent viability

Exactly how is “saving” kids from being aborted not related to the ones who dont even have family? There are plenty enough kids in the world, conservatives should focus on them before they start treating non functional biological masses the same and suddenly caring about the biological masses’ lives over foster kids

Half the population’s vote is pro choice? But you’re ok eliminating them?

Let me actually say, *more* than half the population in america is pro choice

And pro lifers dont need to get an abortion, you’re literally taking away rights from half the people, while pro choice only gives rights

Clearly, or this would have been finished a long time ago. It’s about parts that come together to make up a whole. But each individual part is not the same as the whole.

The cause and solutions to the two issues are completely different. It’s just not a comparable situation. But good for you for being so invested. Maybe you could start a movement to get families to adopt instead of having kids. 

&gt; Half the population’s vote is pro choice? But you’re ok eliminating them?

No, I’m not. EVERYONE should have a voice. That’s what I’ve been saying the entire time. You’re the one who tried to cut off half the populations voice based on sex. 

&gt; Let me actually say, more than half the population in america is pro choice

According to a 2018 graphic it was dead even, but since the younger generations lean more pro choice that’s probably true now. 

&gt; And pro lifers dont need to get an abortion, you’re literally taking away rights from half the people, while pro choice only gives rights

This is not what the abortion debate is about but ok.

A character attack, interesting. You realize I have not once said what my stance is? Other than saying I’m pro democracy that is. 

You’re still skating around the point I made though. Why are you for limiting half the populations voice based on sex?

Ending a life is immoral.

Same as a baby. Dead rather quickly. Unless there’s someone else to take care of it, in which case alive, like a baby.

Guessing that’s a typo. You’re right, it isn’t inherently immoral. But most times that are relevant it is. 

&gt; You know about moral relativism right? 

Of course. Absolute morality isn’t logical. But because getting into individual values is a bit sticky it’s easier to just use standard morals.

You might want to do some research. I believe around 4 months in (probably a little off) they can survive in a proper environment.

Are you just unfamiliar with natural law? I thought I already went over this. Opinion != morals. We don’t make laws based on morals. That’s what natural law is. Jesus some people just don’t read I guess.

Now you’re just trying to move the goal posts. Miscarriages aren’t exactly rare. 

I’m really not sure what you’re trying to argue here.

Morals change depending on time period, and are absolutely reflected in law (murder, torture, abuse, etc.)

But is a baby with father’s support reported nearly as often as miscarriages? Probably for a reason. Embryos are not viable without a mother, and as you’ve pointed out...even then they aren’t often viable (about 25% of pregnancies result in miscarriage iirc)

Infant mortality is not close to 25%

There’s people who like to suicide bomb too. And that’s also irrelevant. If you’re saying that because you believe people never do things they deem immoral then either you’re incredibly stupid or like 11.

See above comment. Also the rates for all three of those would rise if they were made legal. Maybe not so much torture but definitely the other two.

People as a majority believe murder is wrong and should be illegal. That’s pure democratic thought by the wants of the people, based off of their morals.

Sure that’s part of it. But its mainly because it’s an infringement on personal rights. Additionally it has the added effect of being a deterrent. Whereas if you look at the war on drugs—which is entirely morals based and not logical at all—you see where the problems start to occur. The morality behind it isn’t why it works. Post hoc btw. The actual point of a justice system is to protect the rights of the citizens. That’s all.

Most of the rights have nothing to do with morality. First amendment half. Second no. Third no. Fourth arguable. Fifth yes. Sixth no. Seventh no. Eighth is too subjective and is basically ignored so no. Ninth I guess. Tenth no. 

Yes but technology advances through time. One hundred years ago that wouldn’t be possible. In one hundred years we should have artificial wombs fully working (timetable is 10 years iirc). So does the time period determine when someone becomes a person or not?

Like I said before, you’re using the wrong arguments. The only factor that matters is what the effects of it being illegal would be."

In my view, the hope isn't necessarily to decrease the crime rate per say, as much as to decrease the amount of damage per incident. 

A gun which can hold up to 6 bullets cannot do as much damage as a gun with a capacity to hold up to 200 bullets. 

A gunman opening fire and killing 3 people is tragedy. A gunman opening fire and killing 50 people is a national disaster. 

That would be my justification for limiting the maximum capacity of firearms - which would be a type of gun regulation.

The colonies were hard up and didn't want to fund an army so they made the second amendment to have a militia ready to fight in case England came back for more or if Spain decided to get squirrelly.   By having a well-regulated militia ready to defend the homeland in times of need they could save money on having a standing army.   It was a half measure towards national defense.

SirRollsaSpliff @ 2019-05-21 06:40:03 :

This ignores much of the Federalist Papers discussions on the subject.  The founders were just as worried about England as they were about their new government growing too strong. Many of them were deeply worried about the corrupting force of power. Just as they wanted checks and balances amongst branches, so too did they want an armed populace to be a check from government tyranny.

Your assertion that individuals cannot resist a military is, quite frankly, goofy. They've been resisting the best trained and equipped military in the world for almost *two decades*, and will continue to do so. And that's just the most recent example.

I haven't moved any goal posts, and either have you. We've simply failed to agree on where they are before arguing. That's on both of us. How can we judge whether the US/Allies military had success in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq? 

I'm not trying to argue about the success of any policy or strategy, only tactics. Maybe you know more about the critical procedures that failed, I'll hear you out. I can't argue whether or not the conflicts were worth it (actually, I'd argue they weren't), but I think we fail less missions and lose less battles than the insurgents. This is all in the context of whether or not assault rifles are a reasonable weapon to go to war with and hope to win against a modern military force with history's biggest bank roll.

I was over there, friend. Guess what I carried with me all day every day?

(I'll give you a hint: I didn't have an F-16 slung over my shoulder.)

History's biggest bankroll, and all the modern technology in the world accomplishes exactly zero when you're fighting a hidden foe.

The terrorists aren't lined up on a battlefield wearing uniforms - they're regular folks who've been told their whole lives about Western meddling, and then the most visible example of Westernism shows up and starts killing their friends and relatives. So they grab the shitty old rifle they've had in the family for decades and start fighting back. But America can't carpet bomb an entire village just because we know *someone* in there has been shooting at us. So, yeah... We fight back with assault rifles. And we don't even know whom to fight. And even if we ""win"" by killing the guy who's trying to kill us, we just piss off another group of friends and family.

The magic bullet is getting the fuck out of the Middle East. If a government starts killing its own people, or killing someone else's people, that's when the greatest military in history should get involved.

Missions and battles... The insurgents don't have missions. Their mission is to kill Americans. To convince us to leave? To earn favor with Allah? To impress the older boys? I can't say.

They don't fight battles. They can't win a battle against us. What they can do is create a homemade bomb, blow up our vehicles, then come swarming over a hill and engage us with small arms fire (those ""assault rifles"" you keep bringing up).

Exactly what law do you think Saddam could have passed that would have changed this? Ultimately, your claim seems to be that America would be a safer place without... something. I don't know if you dislike ""assault"" rifles or all firearms, but you seem to believe very strongly in it, whatever it is.

That's all you trying paint me into a box for whatever reason, but that's not me. I'm just saying that the defense against an oppressive government argument for the 2nd ammendment is obsolete. Insurgencies are not well regulated militias.

I actually agree with you in your sentiment but i'll take a stab at it.

Point #1- hidden costs
there are many states where ""surprise bill"" laws are in effect meaning that providers cannot send a random bill for a large amount months after the fact. What most people don't know is that they can call the hospitals and negotiate their bill down/settle with the hospital. They'd rather get something than nothing.

Point#2- Out of network
This is fundamentally incorrect. Just because a provider is out of network doesn't necessarily mean they won't be covered. I've been reading more and more about people going to the ER or to deliver their baby and one tech or one provider wasn't in network. In many cases, out of network benefits simply imply that you must submit the bill after the fact and let your insurance determine if the procedure was medically necessary (which is where i start agreeing with you more and more, honestly, because trusting a company like that with your personal health is really shitty). 

Point#3- For Profit
This could in theory be a good thing. If a health insurance company is for profit, they would have incentive to ensure the care they pay out for gets the most bang for their buck, so to speak. This value based system that many insurance companies are switching to should hold providers accountable for care that was misdiagnosed or didn't care. Health Care providers could do a great public service-if they pushed for it- to drive down healthcare costs and drive up patient wellness if they have underlying financial reason to do so. That's also why most preventative services are now free (also thanks to the ACA) as there is a greater understanding about preventing and catching illness before it becomes a greater (financial burden).

Point#4- The government already has laws in place about how much they will pay for certain services and how much of a discount they will get. Providers actually don't like taking the government plans because they don't pay as much as private insurance companies do....
which might null my entire post.

I hope this posts helps to Change your view, but ultimately I don't know if your view should be changed. Maybe post this in r/popularopinion instead.

Point #1 many states is not every state. So millions of Americans are falling prey to this practice regardless. And the fact that this law even has to be in the books is a big indicator to me that the situation was way worse before and we need to move forwards.

Point #2 So in terms of out of network the fact is that if you call any doctor's office in the U.S the first question they ask is ""What insurance do you have?"" Depending on the company that you give they'll either say we don't take Cigna or we do. If they say they don't and you still want to go there either you go and pay out pocket or you call your insurance and wait for them to approve of your visit. This is often times not resolved in days but in weeks or even months. 

#3 We are not talking about theory anymore we are talking about practice. 
The fact is that we as Americans pay the highest prices for healthcare in the world and it's not even closed. Seriously why are we often times paying thousands of dollars for drugs that cost a couple of dollars in other countries?

#4 The fact is that it's actually a good thing that the government pays out less because it's more efficient. With the government the doctors don't have to fill out insurance forms that may lead to the insurance companies denying coverage. When insurance companies do deny coverage the hospital has to then go and collect the money from the government anyway or from the individual. So the fact that they pay out more is a bad argument when you realized that they payout far less frequently.

#5 if you tend to agree with me then why are you on the fence? I'm really interested to know so please reply.

They cost thousands there, too.  We just make up the difference as one of the market economies available.

If governments were forced to pay the cost of those medicines, or if the drug companies actually started flexing their muscle a bit, their pricing wouldn't look as good.

The fact is that drugs aren't that expensive to manufactured at all. The only thing keeping the pharmaceutical companies charging us these ridiculous prices is the fact they bought out the patents for the drugs that they sell. Drugs that they often times didn't even developed like insulin. 

The argument you brought up is just excuse fabricated by the pharmaceutical companies to ensure that we keep the status quo. The fact is that they bought U.S politicians into keeping those laws in place.

This just isn't true, and I don't know how you came to this conclusion.  The high prices come from the R&amp;D required to bring a drug to market, along with covering the cost of failures.  

&gt; The fact is that they bought U.S politicians into keeping those laws in place.

To be clear, there has never been any evidence of this being true.

The current chief of staff to Joe Biden's Campaign is a former Healthcare  Lobbyist. Pharma and Health care lobbyist advertise on CNN, MSNBC and Fox which gives the channels an incentive to spread misinformation through its anchors. 

They literally spend 4.5 billion dollars annually lobbying Washington, the majority of politicians are in parts funded by these companies and you know that. Go to OpenSecrets and you will see that politicians are 100% being funded by big Pharma and the Health care industry. And you can say that just because they give them money doesn't mean that they'll do their bidding but that's you ignoring the why those companies decided to fund them in the first place.

--------------------------------

ClockOfTheLongNow @ 2019-08-04 16:21:58 :

It's a conspiracy theory because it implies a reverse course of action.  Companies ""fund politicians"" because the politicians already support their causes and they want the politicians to be in and stay in office.  Politicians aren't changing their tune because their campaign coffers are filling up.

Here's what a former Cigna executive has to say about how the insurance companies seek to influence politicians.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceX8TwYllS0

This is not unlike how the fossil fuel companies seek to prevent government action on climate change. Please don't try to deny that these companies have a bested interest in keeping the status quo. 

I'm not saying politicians are changing their tune, I'm saying that they're hand picking the politicians that they want to present to the public in the first place. They choose the people that already agree with them, give money to them and offer them a platform to reach voters while ignoring candidates that don't have money and may want to pass laws that will hurt these companies.

Yup, this doesn't happen either.  Candidates get on the ballot through moving up the ranks or through the party system, and they get support based on their policies and positions.

Your conspiracy has no legs and no evidence.

Wouldn't you agree that the Koch brothers fund politicians that they see as pro-fracking, pro-oil or climate change denialist? 

Don't you agree that the money that the Koch brothers decide to give to has their message vastly amplified and gets to a lot more voters? 

Money pretty much runs all of politics. That's the reason that you never hear about the Green Party because they have no big money backing them. And I'm not saying that you should vote Green I'm only saying that if the Green Party had the same funding that the Republican Party has it would be a far more successful party. 

So this isn't a conspiracy it's just the way the system works. If it isn't then why do politicians spend so much of their time fundraising? How does the system work if you're right and money has absolutely no influence on politics?

I believe that they fund politicians that agree with their point of view.  Your conspiracy theory is that the politicians agree with their point of view because they're getting funding from people like the Koch Brothers.

&gt; Money pretty much runs all of politics. 

Basically 100% false.  Finances have no impact on the day-to-day and do not drive the agenda.

&gt; If it isn't then why do politicians spend so much of their time fundraising? 

Campaigns cost money.  A lot of money.  And the government has put in place laws that make it difficult to fundraise, requiring these politicians to call more people than they'd need.

T_1001 @ 2019-08-04 19:38:43 :

Ok so to recap.


1. Companies like Cigna, Google, Facebook, Exxon Mobile, Comcast, At&amp;T and others do choose what politicians they want to fund. Politicians that we agree share the same views as those companies. 


2. The money that they give the politicians makes them extremely more likely to get into office. 


3. When they do get into office they pass laws that will benefit the very same companies. 


It's not a conspiracy it's the way the system works.

--------------------------------

ClockOfTheLongNow @ 2019-08-04 19:46:16 :

&gt; The money that they give the politicians makes them extremely more likely to get into office.

Not really.  Money is not as much of a predictor as many want to believe, in part due to the relatively small number of competitive districts out there.

&gt; When they do get into office they pass laws that will benefit the very same companies.

This is where you lose me, right here.  They're passing laws that they believe in, not that will necessary benefit the companies.

And by saying ""that's how the system works,"" you imply wrongly that it's the money driving the bus.  It's not.  It's the policies.  That the policies are supported by those with money is irrelevant.

T_1001 @ 2019-08-04 19:53:19 :

To your point that money doesn't matter I tend to agree. publicity matters far more than money. But you buy publicity with money. 

Let me ask you something.

If the Green Party had the same funding that the Republican Party has, the same opportunity to get on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN; would they still be as irrelevant as they are or would the money help the party grow? 

If you don't agree that money buys influence then please explain to me how it doesn't.

Because I can give you the Republican Party positions without looking it up. I know this because they have been great at advertising their positions. They have been great because they have all the resources that they need to do so. The infrastructure is there because they had the money backing them to do it.

You just prove my point that the fact that you do not know anything about the Green Party is directly related to the fact that they have no money behind them the way the democrats and the republicans have. 

You do recall republicans being in charge of all 3 branches of government for nearly two years. 

In that time they were for repealing the ACA.

Pro-life

Anti-regulation. I.E putting oil executives at the head of the EPA and Ajit Pai a former Verizon executive as the head of the FCC.

They're for cutting taxes. Although the actual tax plan that they pass will actually raised taxes for the average American who makes less than 80,000$ a year.

They're also for closing the borders. 

Anti-gun reform. 

They are pro coal and pro oil. Which basically makes them climate change denialist. The fact that the current administration pulled out of the Paris agreement is a testament to that.

They are for Gerrymandering and disenfranchising voters. I.e Refusing to pass legislation that will leave a paper trail for every vote that is pass.

In terms of Trade they are on both sides of it. on the one hand they're putting tariffs on china but on the other they signed Nafta 2.0 so it's really hard to say what their position really is.


And they're absolutely pro-war. The fact that John Bolton and Mike Pompeo want to go to war with Iran and continue to fund Al-Qaeda is proof enough. 


So I mean we can discuss the positions all you want but the fact remains that they have money and they use that money to spread their influence. The fact that both you and I are both familiar with that message should speak to that.

I haven't proven anything.  I can't speak recently to the Green Party platform because I haven't researched it as of late.  Not because they don't have money.

&gt; You do recall republicans being in charge of all 3 branches of government for nearly two years.  In that time...

--------------------------------

T_1001 @ 2019-08-04 21:24:42 :

Pro-life

Pro Gun

Pro war

Pro-closing the border

Pro tax cut for the rich AKA trickle down economics. 

Pro Abolishing social security, medicare and medicaid?

Pro Christianity.

Anti-muslim

Pro-gerrymandering 

What platform am I missing?

the Green Party example was only to point out the discrepancies in what is reported by the corporate own media who disproportionately allocates time for Republicans and Democrats to spread their talking points all while ignoring other parties. Point is I don't have to go out of my way to research the positions of the Republican Party but you do have to go out of your way to research the positions of the Green Party.

By the way you're talking about the media I can tell that we can both agree that they're pushing their own agendas. Where do you get your news? Is Fox News not a part of the media as well?

My point is that the 3 major networks CNN, MSNBC and Fox News are all in their own different ways portraying a bias that serves to keep the status quo. Why is it that they can spend weeks focusing on Trump's tweets when there are serious problems going on in our country? it's all sensationalism. Bottom line is that I don't care about what the president tweeted I care about the laws that he's proposing get passed. And honestly in the case of health care the Republican Party had 2 years to propose an alternative to the ACA and they simply didn't get anything done. 

So again what platform of the Republican Party that doesn't align with the platform of the Democratic Party am I missing?

I have asked many people. They often say that they can’t remember or that they don’t want to misquote him and so they say nothing.

I only need one single racist comment or act from Donald trump in order to change my view. 

The act or comment must be discriminatory and must be directed either at a specific race, and/or must be discriminatory and be directed at a specific person based on the belief that one race or more races are superior to another race or more races.

This is much different from the post that was made about a month ago with the title “Donald trump is a racist”, because with this it will actually be possible to change my view.

Edit: I’m honestly trying really hard to find just one thing. While I’m waiting for someone here to change my view I will continue looking for evidence myself.

Edit: you can’t prove he is racist by simply saying that everyone is racist. You can only guarantee that someone is racist by pointing to a specific action or comment of theirs. I acknowledge that everyone has bias and prejudices, but not everyone is racist.

No I wouldn’t say he inspires racists but even if he did inspire racism, he’s only racist if he intentionally inspires racism.

For example, I’m black. If I rob a bank and someone sees me do it. They might think, “oh wow, that black person just robbed a bank! I’ve never seen a white person do that, so it must just be something that black people do. Maybe we shouldn’t let black people into banks anymore.”

Just then I inspired racism, but it wasn’t intentional, and that doesn’t make me racist.

You analogy really confuses me if you want to paint trump as a goid man, because in it, you admit to doing sonething seriously wrong, i.e. robbing a bank, so to be analogous, you also must admit that trump did something wrong to inspire racism, i.e. his rhetoric. To compund on this the bank robber dies not care if he makes the world a worse, more racist place, ad he is acting in his own self interest, to get money. So for you analogy to be accurate, trump, would also be negligent to the consequences of his actions, to pursue his own self interest, which is to be president. Assuming we hold the leader if the free world to higher standards than bank robbers when it comes to racial impact, I would not use your analogy to defend your view.

In addition his fathet was arrested for supporting a KKK rally, which trump also denies, despite public documents of the arrest. This strikes parallels to neo Nazi's who deny the holocaust

With respect, heed your own advice.  It is clear from your post that you do not understand Liberalism as a movement.   Most of your descriptions of liberalism as well as 'what liberals say about &lt;topic&gt; are either over-generalized statements, political talking points or outright fabrications.  Please, for the sake of the Great Commission, stop arguing in this manner - especially on the internet.  

\----  


**If you'd like an example, let me re-analyse one of your own:  'Is it wrong to murder/rape?'.**  

*Generic Christian Position:*     
God has said murder is wrong.  Jesus further elaborate that wishing another person was dead - hating them - is also wrong.  Therefore, we should not murder.  (However, the deeper theology of the matter delves into the fundamental sanctity of life as well as the fact that all people are made in the image of God.)  Regarding rape, the law is less explicit (at first glance).   However, two approaches recommend themselves - that sexual activity is limited to marriage and more importantly, that all Christians are called to treat others as they would be treated, to the point of loving enemies.  Both of these rule out rape.    

&amp;#x200B;

*Generic Liberal Argument:*    
First off, no liberal will say ""we can't say what's wrong and right"".  Instead, the liberal argument refers back to a set of fundamental human rights taken to be true for all humans- in this case the right to bodily autonomy.  The liberal argument against rape is simple - no one has the right to use the body of another person without their consent.  Ergo, one is not permitted use the body of another person for sexual gratification (rape).  Similarly, all individuals have the right to continue living.  Thus, it is wrong to take the life of another person as ut would deprive them of their life and their bodily autonomy."	3	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]	"richfun55 @ 2019-09-04 01:35:53 :

I've read it.  My criticisms stand. You cannot build a solid argument on flawed foundation.  Your entire argument is constructed on completely false definition(s) of liberalism, libertarian-ism, and indeed fascism.  Had you written a post on the paradox of tolerance/intolerance within modern day liberalism and/or progressivism, your arguments might have carried more weight.  However, the inaccurate, misleading and downright confusing manner in which you've lumped together disparate ideologies, religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and political systems renders any arguments built on such a premise useless. 

\----  


What follows is a critique of sections of your post which rely on the aforesaid flawed definitions.  In each, I've highlighted where your over-generalizations or false assumptions about liberalism lead to nonsensical or incorrect conclusions.   


&gt; This idea of secular government, at its core, is flawed. Today's so called ""secular governments"" only forbid killing, stealing, raping etc. not because some group of humans observed each other in the ancient times and from their own intelligent capabilities, there was some ""come together"" and they agreed on these things, but because religion.   


This is historically - not to mention legally - inaccurate.  While many modern legal systems contains laws *inspired* by the morality at the time of their creation, *their current form and justification has nothing at all to do with religion***.**  **Instead, most laws make reference to a system of ethical and legal principles encoded in a Constitution** (or similar document); such documents tend to be *Humanist* rather than religious in inspiration and content.  The entire system hinges on a series of rights and liberties accorded to all peoples.  **More deeply, these systems hinge on just the kind of ""coming together"" you reject in your argument, rather than on the reading of any particular religious text.**  Liberal (and indeed Libertarian) societies explicitly reject religious justifications, demanding instead arguments based on the aforesaid 'constitutional' principles.  While historians and academics rightly point out the religious origins of *certain ideas and/principles* within these documents, these systems now function independently and without reference to the religions that inspired them.     


Your next argument compounds this error:    


&gt; We base laws on our morals.  (False) If it's moral to kill, then there wouldn't be any laws regarding not killing, or - just killing.  (Also false) And morals come from religion, whether you agree with it or not is irrelevant. Because even so called individualists/atheists take these moral values for granted and try to justify it with ""nature"" (false) or some other system, (true!) which completely takes out the idea of God. And if you take out the idea of God, you're rejecting the idea of ""Objective truth"". (false) And that is what mostly these Liberals do. They reject the idea of God (False or True) and not only God, but also the idea of objective truth! (False)  


 Many Liberals, Atheists and Libertarians **have no issue with the concept of objective truth - when applied to repeatable, testable models and measurement of reality.**  They **do however reject the concept of objective moral truth**.  However, this does not mean that such individuals cannot constructive a cohesive, society-wide system of ethics (or a kind of secular morality).  I recommend reading up on various ethical systems.  Many of these systems are based on reciprocity - avoiding actions of which one would not wish to be the subject.  Theft is outlawed so that all may be secure in their own property.  Murder is outlawed so that all may themselves remain alive.   While these principles may echo statements found in all religions, they do not draw their authority from them; instead, they draw their authority from the will of the population to maintain their own property and persons.  Again, while these systems may be in your view weaker or flawed when compared to Biblical morality, this does not mean they (1) are non existent or are (2) baseless.    


Later on in your post, you again present illogical and near-irrational arguments based on a shaky foundation.  For example, in the following quote, you equate moral judgements concerning ""walking around naked"" and ""murder and rape"" :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You can't distinguish the difference between above mentioned moral values. Both are related to morality (right and wrong, good and bad). You can't say to someone in first case that they don't have the right to be the arbiter of moral goodness or badness and few moralities later make yourself the arbiter of the case, because ""you believe so"".   


As other commentators have pointed out, this is a ludicrous comparison.  The first deals only what is seen by others - while the second deprives the victim of life and/or bodily autonomy and human dignity.   Not even the Bible equates these two issues.  The first is mentioned in the Ten Commandments (murder);  while the other is mentioned far more obliquely.  In fact, the Bible itself makes reference - within the Ten Commandments and the teaching of Christ - that *believers are to look away from that which might cause them to sin,* which places part of the burden of action on the person who sees another person naked.    


For your reference, to determine why liberals would claim the right to intervene in one case but not the other, we need only reference the fundamental rights contained within their ethical systems.  Regarding dress codes, the liberals rejects the idea that we should limit the actions of another (their bodily autonomy) in order to 'protect' ourselves from the 'harm' of seeing others in a partial or total state of nudity.   The 'harm' is regarded as so minor - and so easily avoidable by the would-be viewer - that the bodily autonomy of the 'nudist' is regarded as more important.   (As an aside, the absurdity of the idea that 'liberals want everyone to walk around naked further weakens your argument.)  By contrast, in outlawing rape and murder, liberals again invoke the principle of bodily autonomy which would be horrifically compromised by either of these actions.  Bluntly, your two examples only make your point less cohesive and convincing as you've set up a false dichotomy to which you present a completely fallacious liberal 'solution'.    


**TL:DR;  You cannot make a solid argument if you base it on inaccurate information.  If you wish to effectively criticize modern liberals, progressives, libertarians, atheists and others, you need to learn a great deal more about each group and their associated philosophies.   Only then will stand a chance of convincing them of the error of their ways.**

WhiteColidon @ 2019-09-04 09:33:09 :

- Instead, most laws make reference to a system of ethical and legal principles encoded in a Constitution

That is exactly my point. After the enlightenment, rather spread of Liberal doctrine, instead of religion, people started to take same positions as religious people did, but the justification changed from religious texts to ""reason"" and ""logic"", which doesn't stand up when tested. The idea of explaining every moral right, such as: don't kill, don't steal, don't rape etc. from egoistic stand of point, or even nature's stand of point - is flawed.

There is no empathy in nature, there is just survival. The most holy person in such state of affairs is the most cruel one.

Take murder for example:
*Why is murder wrong?*
Because it harms another person and takes away their life.
*Okay, why is that bad?*
Because it takes away his potential and life.
*Right, but why is that action bad?*
Well, because in nature itself we need to survive and when you kill your own kind, you won't survive.
*No, you're just the one being killed, the person killing has nothing to lose, but everything to gain. So why should he not kill you and steal everything from you? What is the reason? Because killing each other is bad and not only bad, not good for everyone? It most definitely is good for the poor person with nothing to lose doing it*

The fact that today's ""secular"" government's rule's and their executors ignore religious context and not only ignore it, just straight up think they had this revelation once where they came up with these rules and laws is, again, flawed. The trails always lead us to source, and the source is religion.

The concrete examples don't matter. You're taking it too literally. It is plain simple: Are those two problems moral problems? I would say so. Do the so called ""Liberals"" (at least in my country) believe that we don't have the right to force our beliefs and morals onto others? They most certainly do. Do they also reject the idea of objective truth/morality which is the justification of forcing your beliefs on others? They do. So now the question is: Why do these so called ""Liberals"" appoint themselves to be the arbiter of moral goodness in one case and not in the other? Why am I forbidden to force me beliefs onto others and they're not? Both of these are moral problem (right/wrong in this case, I would assume. You can also argue from ""does nudity in public have bad effects on society?"").

Never stated they wanted everyone to walk around naked. It's a fact that normalizing a behaviour increases the amount of it and the act of a specific action normalizes specific behaviour.

You stated their ethical system very well and what they believe in, but I'm talking from morality's point of view. It doesn't matter what they believe or not, if you reject objective truth/morality, which gives you the right to impose your beliefs onto others, not that it's 100% correct, but it's more consistent, than saying objective truth/morality doesn't exist, nobody has the right to impose their beliefs and morals onto you, and, oh, hey! let me impose my belief system onto you.

I do need to read more classic material on this topic. But this is what I know atm and the knowledge is proportional to logic being used.

Or perhaps religions, when developing their own moral codes, were simply using a flawed version of secular reasoning to come up with decent ethical principles, and any reasonable person will come up with conclusions that are somewhat similar.

Here's a hypothetical scenario. Let's say one day, God speaks to you directly. He reveals Himself to you and says ""Hello WhiteColidon, I have decided that now it is objectively moral for you to rape and kill. There's a group of children outside. You need to start raping and killing them, or you will have committed a moral sin according to me, the sole source of objective morality in the universe.""

In this hypothetical situation, what would you do?

If you'd feel any hesitation about raping and murdering, doesn't that suggest that there is something wrong with those actions *beyond* religious commandments? If, for some reason, God wouldn't command you to do those things, doesn't that suggest that there is some source of morality beyond God?"

I mean I’ll vote but I do agree that the difference is negligible. I agree that it is the right thing to do but I disagree that it’ll lead to considerable change simply because people are inherently selfish.

Sayakai @ 2019-09-18 03:15:30 :

Not particulary. People are being trained to be selfish, but we're empathic by nature.

&gt; No one wants to pay the extra money to inconvenience themselves with organic food or cleaner energy unless they genuinely are passionate for the cause

If it's little more, they will. If it's considered a good thing and bring them status, they will. And if more individuals take those options, they turn into less of a hassle because they're offered more frequently. Remember how much of a pain living with lactose intolerancy used to be in the west, and how that has changed. Those success stories can be repeated.

--------------------------------

Jeremy0015 @ 2019-09-18 03:20:49 :

Do you have evidence for the first claim? Because I wrote a research paper on this and found the exact opposite. Evolution wise it only makes sense for people to be selfish to ensure their survival.

—

As for the second point, that’s with only certain people that genuinely are passionate like I said. I highly doubt people are willing to pay even a dollar more for organic simply because they want to save money and the fact that they’ll have more money to spend later is far more significant in their life than whether they made a minor difference in the world.

Lactose intolerance is an actual issue in humans though, plus it affects like the majority of the population. The same can’t be said about environmental issues because it either doesn’t impact us directly or won’t before we are dead

Tino_ @ 2019-09-18 03:31:08 :

&gt;Evolution wise it only makes sense for people to be selfish to ensure their survival.

If that was actually the case the species would have never evolved and if it changed tomorrow the species would cease to exist in a matter of years. Co-operation is one of the fundamental reasons why humans are so successful and without co-operation literally everything we have today would have never existed in the first place. Obviously never doing something that is self interested is also a bad thing to do because people will take advantage of you and you will never really advance, but the idea that selfishness is the key to survival or even the key to society is a little odd...

--------------------------------

Jeremy0015 @ 2019-09-18 03:34:21 :

Think about it this way: every act someone does whether it’s completly altruistic or not is inherently motivated by selfish reasoning (either intentionally or unintentionally). For example, an act of donating to charity could be motivated by a deep-rooted desire to feel good about oneself to improve happiness and self-esteem, it could be used to make oneself appear generous to others, and it could be used simply because one wants to do generous things to secure a better life after death

&gt; On Trump: there are so many valid criticisms of his presidency that it could fill an entire book. But rather than picking an issue and doing research (literally any one of them), people latch onto his mannerisms and attitude instead.

100% confirmation bias. There are top posts every day in popular political subreddits calling out the trump administration for actions and behavior that is detrimental to our planet, country, citizens. 

More directly to your point... if someone on reddit still supports trump as of today, there are only a few possible reasons for that. Thoughtful thorough discussion on reddit is not going to change their mind. This may not be the case for interacting with his supporters one on one in real life, but the type of person to come to reddit and post comments in support of trump are just flaming. 

If anything you could say don't feed the trolls because that is what they want ... etc..etc.. 

But if you think attacking or mocking the intellect of a trump supporter on reddit is somehow wrong because thoughtful discourse could sway them, that ship has sailed. I would 100% agree with that prior to and just after the election.. but again at this point only certain type of people are coming to reddit (r/politics) especially to post pro-trump comments.

I went to https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/joe-biden/ and looked at Joe Biden's views. Here is what I came up with:

- legal marijuana
- $15/hr minimum wage
- banned assault weapons
- legal abortions
- equal sentencing for crack cocaine crimes
- eliminating private prisons
- free healthcare
- free college
- less spending on military/war
- student debt relief
- tax carbon emissions
- move off of fossil fuels
- looser immigration -&gt; citizenship policies
- more taxes on billionaires
- better relationships with other nations

People vote Democrat because they want some or all of those things. Some or all of those things can be seen as ""more fair"", ""more empathetic"", ""more civil"", etc.

If Trump is inverse Democrat, it is very interesting why anybody would vote for him.

Who in 2019 would vote *against* a woman being able to have an abortion?

You support Trump for maybe some of the same reasons I partially do in my mind.

1. $15/hr minimum wage comes with economic negatives
1. Who is going to pay for all of this free health care? Billionaires? Is it really the American dream to become a billionaire, just to have to support the ""lazy""?
1. A bunch of illegal immigrants coming into your country really isn't a beautiful thing if they are criminals

&gt; But the most common basis I understand is that they see a fetus as life with personhood - aborting that fetus is MURDER to them.

That is a very religiously rooted way to look at things, and it is almost 2020, where religion historically hates gay people, thinks women should be in the kitchen all day, etc.

Yes, or as someone else has said, stop arguing emotionally *in this discussion*. You can feel whatever, but this is a place for civil discourse (and I should know, since I have had posts removed because of this).

That said, I don't have time to fully react to your comment, so just a quick reaction to the arguments regarding pedophilia:

1. I didn't say you mentioned God, *I* mentioned that God didn't decide that number, to rightfully point out that it is an arbitrary line. I think you agree with me and you're unnecessarily reacting to the analogy. When someone mentions God in these discussions, it is about the setting of moral absolutes, which is only possible under such a being actually existing and implementing those moral codes.

2. As for nuance in accountability, that's the thing, all nuance can be countered by a devil's advocate stating why is that nuance important, when no informed consent directly means no responsibility (on the part of children) is possible in cases of pedophilia? I argue for nuance, but a devil's advocate doesn't have to."	0	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]	"edwardlleandre @ 2019-10-08 07:30:18 :

&gt;Im not a paedophile but This explains why paedophila is fine: Firstly kids can consent because consent means:permission for something to happen or agreement to do something (from google)And you cant say they cant understand what sex is because you could just explain to the child what sex is and ask them if they want to do it or not. We already explain sex to prepubescent kids and teach kids things at school which proves kids can understand and learn too if you explain or else how else would they learn about new things.

The issue isn't consent. It is informed consent.

A child does not have the life experience, or even the  physiological structure in their brain to make the sort of informed choices we're talking about when it comes to something like sex. I could explain to a ten year old that donating one of their kidneys to a stranger would drastically improve, possibly even save that person's life, but even if they consent it is not informed consent, because they cannot adequately weigh the pros and cons of the situation. And, as you mentioned below, it would be trivially easy to groom a child into agreeing to something like this.

Incidentally, one of the other major issues unaddressed in this issue is that of power imbalance. For the some reason a boss shouldn't sleep with his subordinate, an adult has undue influence over most children, and children they have any measure of control over in particular, which further fucks the idea of actual consent.

&gt;And you cant say they shouldn't have sex because because theyre brain isnt developed fully yet because your brain doesnt stop developing at age 25 so even at 16 youve not fully matured and people still have sex at earlier ages and kids still have the ability to decide what they want and have reason. As ling as they get taught what it is and its explained and they agree its fine

This is an apples, oranges and watermelon comparison. Yes, the brain of a sixteen year old is not as developed as a 25 year old, but compared to that of a minor such as say, a ten year old, it is night and day. And we still don't let teenagers have sex with adults for the same reason we don't allow younger children to do so, because they cannot make informed consent.

&gt;The age of consent is just a law it doent mean its right or wrong. In other countries where the age of consent is lower people dont riot and see it as normal which proves society has just brainwashed you into thinking what right and wrong instead of listening to your own reason. If the law was oppressive would you still agree with it.and ive already explained As long as its not forced and they agreed to do it its fine

You do understand that children are fucking stupid, right? When I was ten years old I did plenty of things that, looking back, were positively suicidal in terms of risk. But I could not properly weigh the risk or reward. If I had an adult intentionally trying to manipulate me into doing something, they would be able to do so with relative ease, but that sure as hell doesn't make it okay.

The age of consent laws don't make something right or wrong, but in fact, are reflective of what we as a society view as right or wrong. We think pedophillia is wrong because of all of the significant and well known negative side effects of sexual abuse of minors, and because of their inability to have informed consent.

&gt;Also paedophiles are born that way and its their sexual orientation so its not their fault they like kids. another e.g of this is when people were oppressing gays before and thought it was wrong and the same things happening to paedophiles.

The problem with this line of thinking is that one of these things hurts people. Homosexuality can be engaged in between two consenting adults without any negative side effects. Pedophillia cannot.

You are correct that it is not a pedophiles fault that they are sexually attracted to children, and I have genuine sympathy towards them. But that sympathy ends at the point that they try to act out, in the same way that there are men who have a sexual urge towards violent rape, or beastiality, or any number of other paraphilias that lack consent or cause serious harm.

It may trigger some people, but it's important to ask these questions, difficult as they are, and not resort to *moral feelings* as a substitute for sound reasoning and calm judgment.

To that end, the idea of informed consent being impossible for minors is troubling when applied to other areas, and even in having sex itself. The idea that they couldn't have agency in this one area and then expected to have agency in others (i.e. trying children for all sorts of criminal activity) is wildly inconsistent, and so is the notion of *when* exactly a person gains that agency (we all know 18 years, 0 months, 0 days is an arbitrary number and not a true number for most people, yet we all act like that line holds some moral meaning instead of understanding agency in degrees and contexts).

BishonenPrincess @ 2019-10-08 08:34:09 :

There are ways to study these things though without going to a reddit post.  There are countless studies, TED talks, and more that address all of the issues that OP made.  OP didn't bother to help themselves first.  Which is frustrating.    
Furthermore, I know it can vary, but typically children are treated differently in court than adults are.  That's why we have a court specifically for children.  When children are tried as adults, I also think that's pretty bullshit.    
Consent laws will vary as well.  What really matters is the power dynamic.    
It's the same reason why it's wrong for an employer to try and have a relationship with an employee.  Or a teacher with their student, even in college.    
At 18, a person has the ability to leave home, vote, drive, and run their own life.  Before that, they aren't.  So entering a relationship with someone who doesn't have the same freedoms that you do is an immediate power imbalance.    
Personally, I think the age of consent should rely more on power dynamics and life stages than actual numbers. But pedophilia refers specifically to prepubescent children.  That's a long way away from that 18 year mark you're talking about.

--------------------------------

sunglao @ 2019-10-08 08:43:24 :

Why can't reddit be an avenue for such a discussion? So what if there are other avenues? What do you know about OP in the first place?

Calm down, stop getting triggered by polite discussion into a difficult topic. We are all anonymous here, you're being irrational if you start off attacking the motivations of people you do not know.

Edit:

&gt; Furthermore, I know it can vary, but typically children are treated differently in court than adults are.

That has the same problems I mentioned before. How can children be responsible for anything when informed consent is literally impossible? They are just being manipulated into doing the crime.

&gt; Consent laws will vary as well.

By state, usually, not by degree of age difference or actual mental development or the nature of the relationship. Geographical differences doesn't matter in this discussion.

&gt; At 18, a person has the ability to leave home, vote, drive, and run their own life. Before that, they aren't.

Yeah, God decides that? That's an imaginary line.

&gt; But pedophilia refers specifically to prepubescent children. That's a long way away from that 18 year mark you're talking about.

Precisely why nuance matters, yet most judgments are based on arbitrary numbers like the age of content or legal adulthood.

*Seriously?*  

That's not how that works, *obviously*.  And I'll feel however I want about people defending pedophilia, thanks.  

Using reddit as an avenue for discussion is fine.  But people should always try to educate themselves before formulating opinions and having discussions.  Think of it this way, if I want to have a discussion on the the shape of the Earth, I should probably know what it is I'm talking about before declaring an opinion and asking people to change my view.  It's like saying ""The Earth is flat because you don't fall off of it.""  Look up gravity, and then get back to me, shitbird.    
Same thing goes for OP.  I don't know shit about OP other than this one post.  And from this one post, I know that OP did not actually bother to study this shit themselves.  Otherwise they wouldn't have made the stupid points that they did.  These points have been greatly dissected and analyzed in countless studies, articles, and lectures.  So what if I'm being anti-delta?  

I made no mention of God, so get out of here with that strawman bullshit.    
Also, you make no attempt to realize nuance in the fact that children can be held accountable for certain actions while not being able to make informed consent in an imbalanced power dynamic of adultxkid.  *And then* you tell me that nuance matters.  For someone arguing for nuance, those are some black and white arguments you're tossing around.  

Children can be held accountable in some ways.  If a child breaks a rule, they get grounded.  They are being held accountable.  If a child tries to kill another child, they'll be required to get therapy.  If a child kills another person in cold blood, they'll probably be institutionalized.  These are to protect both the child and those around the child.  How that's comparable to children being able to give consent to an adult?   


Regardless, don't tell people who are triggered to ""stop being triggered.""  Especially if they weren't even talking to you.    
It adds nothing to the conversation, ignores the reality of what actually being triggered does to a person, and definitely won't help them calm down.  I know that the word is now used to mean ""mildly upset"" or ""irritated"" or even ""angry.""  I didn't think that when I said that arguing in support of pedophilia legitimately triggers me, I'd have to make the distinction that I'm not just talking about being ""upset."""

&gt; If we take the premise that government (and by extension the politicians and bureaucrats who run it) should be doing the most good for the most people, there's plenty of objective facts to show what's most effective.

The government should absolutely not be doing the most good for the most people. 

Consider the ramifications if it did. You could be snatched from your bed, murdered, and have your organs harvested to save the lives of two people needing kidney transplants, two people needing lung transplants, one person needing a liver, one person needing a heart, etc. 

One death would occur, but several lives would be saved. Is this the world we want to live in?

You could be enslaved if it were deemed to be beneficial to society. Your home could be taken from you in order to house multiple families if it were deemed to be good for society. 

Your entire post rests on this premise but it is incorrect from the start. The government's job is *not* to do the most good for the most people.

You are right I know and I will stop arguing facts I can't change."	2	0	stop arguing comment					"An ignition interlock is a device that requires a driver to blow into a built-in breathalyzer before the car will start.  They also require the driver to blow into it at random intervals while driving.  This is to ensure that the driver didn't just have someone else blow into it to start the car and then drive away drunk.  They are typically installed on the cars of people who have received multiple DUIs, but I can't see any reason why they aren't mandatory on every vehicle.  Having this as a requirement would practically eliminate drunk driving.  Let me address some potential counterpoints in advance:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **It would drive up the cost of cars.**  Yes, it would but we all agreed that seat belts need to be mandatory in vehicles since they save lives.  This increases the overall cost of cars, but it's worth it.  The same can be said for airbags or any other mandatory safety device that has been added to cars over the years.  Also, most new cars have a ton of superfluous safety features that won't help much if you are driving drunk or someone who is drunk crashes into you.  Why not add a feature that will actually make a huge difference?
2. **People would find a way around it.**  Yeah, sure people will try to hack them and bypass them, but that's not really a good reason not to do it.  A lot of drunk driving is not premeditated, so most people would not bother messing with theirs.  Also, a cop during any traffic stop would be able to check if the device has been tampered with and could issue a ticket for having an altered device.
3. **Periodically blowing into a device is distracting and dangerous.**  Yeah, maybe, but driving drunk is way more dangerous, and I think you're gonna have a really hard time arguing that this distraction would cause more harm than drunk driving currently causes.
4. **It infringes on personal freedom.**  Drunk driving is illegal.  You do not have the freedom to drive drunk, so no freedom is being taken away.
5. **What about all the cars already on the road?**  Here is how I'm envisioning the rollout of this policy.  A law is passed that requires all new cars produced from 2022 on to be outfitted with an ignition interlock.  This gives manufacturers time to add this feature to the production process.  All title transfers from 2025 on must show proof of the installation of an ignition interlock to be approved.  This gives consumers 5 years to get one installed on their car.  All state inspections (required for title transfer in the US) and all vehicle emissions inspections will require the presence of a functioning ignition interlock in order to pass.
6. **But that will make buying even a used car more expensive.**  Technically it will make selling a car more expensive.  When you sell a car, you have to make sure that all safety features are working anyway.  For example, in order to transfer a vehicle title, the seller must make sure that the vehicle can pass a state inspection which checks for things like cracks in the windshield, problems with the airbags, etc.  If the vehicle fails the inspection, the seller must repair the part that caused the failure to pass the test before they can sell the car.  In a decade or so almost all cars on the road would be fitted with ignition interlock devices, and drunk driving would be nearly impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  I'm getting a lot of comments regarding point #3 where people seem to think that periodically blowing into this device is going to cause more deaths than drunk driving currently does.  Sorry, but no way.  Drunk driving kills about 29 people every day in the US\*.  Distracted driving (which includes taking your eyes off the road, taking your hands off the wheel, or even taking your mind off driving) accounts for about 9 deaths every day in the US\*\*.  So, I think that periodically blowing into a device while driving would account for less than 9 deaths per day, while mandatory use of an ignition interlock would decrease daily drunk driving deaths significantly.  

Though I have given out some deltas for good points and obstacles to my plan that have pointed out, my view remains unchanged as none of them seem insurmountable or prohibitive.

Zionism is anti-semitic. First, it implies that ones identity as a Jewish person is dependent and defined by ones view on the existence of a Jewish state. There are plenty of Jewish people that are anti-Zionist. Secondly, Semitic people are those that have historically spoke Semitic languages including [Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and Amharic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Semitic). Palestinians are also Semitic people, Zionists try to brand any criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic, which in function leads to the erasure of Palestinians as Semitic people.

Israel is an apartheid settler ethnostate committing genocide against Palestinians imprisoned in the world's largest open air prison that is Zionism put into practice. This didn't start with the Likud party, it started with the creation of Zionism and Israel. Israel functions as a client state for United States imperialism, they exist so we can project military power in the Middle East. Criticism of Zionism and Israel is not anti-Semitic, it is anti-oppression, anti-imperialist, anti-fascist, and anti-genocide. Anti-Semitism is a shield that Israel uses to justify its oppression and genocide of the Palestinian people.

Freedom *to* do something always has to be balanced around other people's freedom *from* some things. 

For example, your freedom *to* travel has to be balanced around people's right to clean air and to live free *from* pollution - so we settle on a balance there, travel is not banned, but vehicles have emission standards. 

Similarly, your freedom to alter your mind has to be balanced around people's right to live in a society that is not a zoned-out semi-apocalyptic wasteland of drugged out zombies. So there has to be *some* balance there, we allow some drugs, but not all, just like it's permissible for you to emit some pollution, but not an unlimited amount.

Think I'm being over-dramatic? As Western countries show, at least 1/2 and maybe as many as &gt;3/4ths of people provably can't handle the temptation of cheeseburgers and candy. In light of that, how many people do you think could responsibly handle heroin?

Nobody has to take drugs and for most people, legalisation wouldn't make drugs all that easier to come by. If someone wanted to try heroin right now, it wouldn't be too hard to get hold of it within a few days anyway.

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it

Portugal decriminalised drugs almost 20 years ago. They've had less overdoses, less HIV cases, less drug-related crime. In 15 years they reduced their HIV cases to less than 4% of what they were.

And that's just decriminalisation.

&gt; If we legalise instead of decriminilise, why would you expect the opposite effect? That seems very wrong to assume, no?

Why not? Tightening the regulations on smoking has resulted in a dramatically decreased tobacco consumption. Unlimited freedom for Philip Morris was not the way to go there - from that we can clearly conclude that more restrictions can help reduce harm as well.

There's absolutely no reason to assume that less restriction will inevitably result in less societal harm.

Therefore, I'd argue that it's obvious that there's some *sweet spot* in between unlimited freedom and the current asinine system - which is what I've been saying all along.

You haven't given an example yet of how one person taking drugs negatively effects an entirely separate, unrelated person.

Did we not talk about participating in a society, instead of living in an island of one? Everything would be affected by prevalent use. You'd pay more in taxes, more in economy in general, the rate of accidents of all kinds would increase etcera. etcera.

If it's acceptable for me to bear all these costs, why isn't it okay for you to buy a mask with an air filter to filter out my rolling coal?

&gt; You mean other than the real-world example I just gave you, that you conveniently ignored, where less restriction resulted in less societal harm?

I did not ignore it. Please do not present false statements.

I have, in fact, taken it into analysis. When you combine that ""more restriction = less harm"" on smoking and ""less restriction = less harm"" on Portugal, you can expect for the resulting graph of restriction-to-harm to be a a U-shaped curve, with a *sweet spot* of minimal harm somewhere between the two. You see how I used the same phrase of a *sweet spot* now as in the previous post? I did not ignore anything.

Now, do you have some evidence that the graph is linear instead, where less restriction inevitably results in less harm? Because data based on our combined examples sure seems to point to a U-shaped curve instead.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-05-20 12:43:28 :

&gt; You'd pay more in taxes

Why? Portugal do not pay more taxes than the UK, neither does Holland, where marijuana consumption is legal.

If anything, it gives the government another taxable revenue stream. 

&gt; more in economy in general

I'm not sure what you mean by this, because the economy cannot be ""more"" or ""less"", it's bigger or smaller. I assumed by more, you meant bigger, but that would be a good thing? So I'm not sure what you mean here.

&gt; the rate of accidents of all kinds would increase

Again, why? Portugal saw no marked increase in accidents of *any* kind, never mind every kind. 

It seems like you're just making arguments up as you go along, it might be helpful if you source these claims.

&gt; When you combine that ""more restriction = less harm"" on smoking and ""less restriction = less harm"" on Portugal, you can expect for the resulting graph of restriction-to-harm to be a a U-shaped curve

That's not logical though. You're referencing one single drug thst was never illegal anyway, and only looking at the effects in number of smokers. I'm taking a near-perfect case study of the exact thing we're discussing, where virtually all measurable impacts were positive.

It's like me giving you a forest of trees and saying ""look, trees are green"" and you have one shrub in your garden and say ""nah, this one's blue, therefore half of all trees are green and half are blue"". 

You're exaggerating the strength of your example, while downplaying the strength of mine."	"[deleted] @ 2020-05-20 13:24:46 :

&gt; Stop using Portugal as an example to defend full legalization, when they merely decriminalized the use.

I acknowledged that it isn't exactly the same. Thats why I described it as a *near*-perfect example. But I don't understand how you can honestly think that Portugal's example is either the same as, or less valid, than your smoking one.

I'm also not arguing a strawman. I'm saying thst decriminalisation of all drugs quite clearly led to positive results in virtually every area. Why wouldn't you expect legalisation to *at least* have the same effect? 

Let's not forget the example of prohibition. The complete ban of alcohol only resulted in a decrease of around 30% of people drinking. Sure, that's a lot! But considering it went from totally legal to totally illegal, that is not a huge decrease. 

Since prohibition ended, has society decayed and crumbled? Do we live in some sort of dystopia where every person you meet is drunk all of the time? No, so why would or happen if we legalise other drugs? 

&gt; Yeah, near 50% of people smoked in the 40s in the US, now it's about 20%. This is a colossal difference on a massive societal scale.

Your example is ONE drug. Surely you can see how it's not really possible to extrapolate this to discussing the complete ban of dozens of drugs? 

It's also been measured over a period of 80 years, and you're attributing it entirely to restrictions? So you're just ignoring the fact that in the 1940s, the majority of people didn't even know that smoking was bad for you?

&gt; I acknowledged the strength of your example, that's why I incorporated it into my analysis

No, you massively downplayed it. How can you feasibly argue that the two examples are equally usable?

I'm using the example of an entire country decriminilising all drugs. That is literally as close as you can get to the legalisation of all drugs, without it being exactly that. 

You're using the example of one country putting heavier restrictions on the sale/use of one drug. Your example does not include all drugs, nor does it include making the drug fully legal, fully illegal, or decriminilising it. 

&gt; For someone who accused me of ignoring valid points(and you were wrong) you sure don't seem to mind doing it yourself.

I'm not saying your example isn't relevant. Nor did I ignore it, I addressed it head on and explained to you why it is not equally as valid as the example I gave. 

Neither example is perfect, but if we're talking percentages, Portugal is around 90% of the way toward what we're talking about, and US smoking laws are about 20% of what we're talking about at best. 

It's just ridiculous that you're trying to describe one as *just as relevant* as the other. 

You also again completely ignored my points rebutting your statements of taxes being raised, ""more economy"", and more accidents.

--------------------------------

grautry @ 2020-05-20 13:34:50 :

It may be one drug, but it was one drug that was *fully legally available*. Ie. if you want to argue about some perfection of examples here, there you go. Fully legally available drug, the goal you want to argue for and aspire to, except for all drugs.

If you had to break something, would you rather have a steel rod or a bundle of sticks? You're arguing that a bunch of imperfect examples(the decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal) are superior to one *ideal* example(fully legal tobacco and the consequences on an unrestricted market).

I'll take the steel rod, thanks.

&gt; So you're just ignoring the fact that in the 1940s, the majority of people didn't even know that smoking was bad for you?

Counterpoint: people have known that junk food is bad for you for decades. It's not secret knowledge. Hasn't done much to stop over-consumption.

&gt; You also again completely ignored my points rebutting your statements of taxes being raised, ""more economy"", and more accidents.

Not exactly. I explained that I see no point in arguing against a strawman - but yes, I will firmly declare that I am simply done entertaining arguments based on pro-decriminalization examples from you.

Argue for legalization or I simply cease to reply. I have absolutely zero interest in defending *a position I do not hold*.

&gt; I'll take the steel rod, thanks.

So where is this steel rod? Because you're saying that smoking is a perfect, singular example. In that case, you should be able to tell me where smoking went from legal to illegal. Because remember, *you want perfect examples only* and we're talking about legal vs illegal, not legal vs moderately restricted and not decriminalised vs illegal. 

So in order for smoking to be a perfect example, we'd need compare total legalisation of smoking, and smoking being fully illegal.

But your example is increased restrictions, not the complete and total ban. Therefore, by your own argument, it is not a valid example. 

If you can completely disregard Portugal's near-perfect example, there is no logical reason for you to hold up US smoking laws as a supposedly perfect example.

&gt; Counterpoint: people have known that junk food is bad for you for decades. It's not secret knowledge. Hasn't done much to stop over-consumption.

But junk food isn't a drug? Nor has it ever been made illegal? I guess we'll have to completely disregard this example too.

&gt; Not exactly. I explained that I see no point in arguing against a strawman - but yes, I will firmly declare that I am simply done entertaining arguments based on pro-decriminalization examples from you.

That's fair, I'll refrain from using any non-perfect examples as reference points, I just expect you to do the same.

So now, we're back to square one, where you said:

&gt; Everything would be affected by prevalent use. You'd pay more in taxes, more in economy in general, the rate of accidents of all kinds would increase

As your justification for why making drugs fully legal is not a good idea. Before I rebut these arguments (using perfect examples only). I'd ask you to source these claims first (using perfect examples only) because otherwise, you're just making it up as you go along.

--------------------------------

grautry @ 2020-05-20 13:54:43 :

Nope. 

As I mentioned, you're acting like a total ban and full legalization are the only options and you pretend that everything that's not a total ban supports your position, while disregarding that I'm in support of decriminalization and regulation, which is why my examples are relevant and why in fact Portugal supports my case.

You know, the sweet spot I mentioned over and over again.

I'm out, I'm not interested in arguing about a position I don't hold.

It conveys a lot similar to facial expressions, yet no one argues to explain what emotion you’re using on your face.

You have indirectly called me narcissistic and arrogant for using emojis, but at least admit your responses are from a general annoyance. I don’t believe I’ve ever been called a narcissist and tend to try to help people understand. You seem content without using emojis, so please point your frustration at someone who isn’t willing to converse with you about their use. 

Arguing you don’t want to understand because it is too fast for you, is in itself, selfish. If you don’t want to use them, that’s your prerogative, but people communicate easily with emojis.

What do those three ""facial expressions"" mean in this example. I honestly have no idea except *maybe* that you're rolling your eyes in the second one. The other two are *entirely* unclear. 

Seriously, the ;-) one is almost always used to mean ""just kidding, sigh""... but what the hell does that mean in a *question*?

And I literally have never seen, nor can I discern the meaning of the last one. What the hell is that thing?

And that's the problem with emojis... they mean something different to everyone that sees them, and not everyone will ever know every one you might use.

It is an argument if you're claiming that the wink actually communicates something that is worth using the emoji for. 

I understand what ""winking"" is in real life... and it has a couple of dozen different meanings depending on context, exactly how it is performed, other body language, and a ton of cues that you're not communicating with an emoji. So the problem is that it doesn't really clarify what you're trying to clarify by including it. An emoji is the *crudest* possible example of a wink, and is almost meaningless. 

You may understand what you ""mean"" by it, but without additional information your recipient will not.

Instead, when you are communicating in written form, it is up to the writer to write *clearly* about what they mean.

You're kidding about the question? But what does it even mean to be kidding about that question? Do you mean you *don't* think facial expressions contribute to the meaning? Is it a rhetorical question? You're flirting with the reader? Is it an ""inside joke"" of some kind?

My interpretation: you literally just threw that in there without even thinking about what it means, because it makes absolutely no sense.

And, BTW, I still have no idea whatsoever what that last emoji even is supposed to represent.

Maybe that's what *you* meant by it, but can't you see that there are numerous things that a ""wink"" means in personal communication, including all of the things that I mentioned? A wink emoji does *not* always mean ""cheekiness""... it means so many things it's almost meaningless unless the sentence itself helps you understand what it means. 

Example: ""Hey, sexy!"" ;-) is *clear* about what the wink means. 

""Surely you're joking, and don't call me Shirley"" ;-) is *clear* about the slight sarcasm of the statement, and that it's a joke. 

In this context? Again, the only thing that actually makes *sense* is that you threw it in there as an example without actually thinking about what you were intending it to mean, because it means nothing.

Even if it's ""cheekiness"" as you say, what the hell is being ""cheeky"" when asking ""What do facial expressions contribute to communication that words cannot?""... You seem to think it's super clear what that means, but it isn't. At all.

Just want to point out that in real life, when someone winks while telling you a sentence, their interpretation of why they winked may not be similar to your interpretation. It goes along with practice in communication. I believe you stated early something similar, in that body language and tone also become factored in. 

People who use emojis apply the same method. You may not always interpret the intent of a particular emoji, but with practice and context clues, understanding of the person your texting, it becomes clearer. When you practice often enough and have specific people who communicate in the same manner, it becomes similar to a conversation in person with facial expressions and body language.

I’m not sure I would trust your definition of *actual* emoji use if you do not use it. I am able to go from conversations with you not using emojis to conversations with emojis, and can tell you that it’s not one specific meaning per emoji. You technically made that argument, and it’s correct. My point is that it’s similarly used like facial expressions in real life. “Cool kids” (your term not mine”) understand it for the same reasons you understand and can interpret facial expressions.

--------------------------------

hacksoncode @ 2020-05-28 18:36:46 :

Human beings can do this because they evolved to be able to, in order to get along in groups.

That's *also* why we develop *common* languages that change slowly enough that *everyone* understands them at a baseline level without having to keep up with fashion. 

And why ""fashion"" languages like emojis are *so fucking annoying* to anyone that doesn't feel like keeping up with the fashion. 

If it were a couple of super-standard emojis that everyone understood, and which fit into contexts where they have reasonably understandable meanings (you know, like ""words"" in ""languages""), I doubt we'd be having any of this discussion. 

Honestly, though, what the hell does ""💅"" mean, and why should *I* have the burden of going and looking it up just in order to understand someone's piss poor writing in a forum read by a general audience rather than an SMS they can send solely to their ""cool kids"" friends?

That evolution in communication doesn’t stop just because you don’t like the form of communication. Emoticons were used before emojis, and are a form of communication similar to tribes/Egyptians using pictures and hieroglyphics to form sentences. Emojis is just a more detailed version. 

💅🏻Has been explained to you already. You not wanting to understand it doesn’t negate that fact. Again, it is still subjective to the context clues of what is being said. 

In a general sense, it is usually when someone isn’t bothered by the conversation and find it boring or unnecessary, and would rather be doing something else. It’s similar to the expression a woman gives when she starts looking at her nails when she is done with the conversation. She rather be doing her nails than have to hear what you’re saying, so she is looking at her nails.

On the topic of Michael Brown, you are being disingenuous. You and I both know the majority of the public are not even aware of the conclusion of that case. Why? Because media outlets sensationalized his shooting and hardly even reported the aftermath. I can't believe you can genuinely believe that there is no bias in the media when reporting on matters of police brutality. 

My issue with the focus on police brutality is how long people have discussed it while completely ignoring all the other problems. Stop arguing a strawman. I am not claiming that you can't address multiple issues at once. What I am saying is the media is basically putting all their focus on police brutality and racism when they discuss issues black communities face in the US. Many people are so misinformed that they are convinced Police brutality is the biggest problem affecting black lives today when by all objective and statistical measures, it is not.

However, to insinuate that his unfortunate death is due to racism and not at all because of George Floyd's own actions is ignorant and disingenuous. The man was a career criminal. He was high on meth, phentynol, and had also robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint. When he was arrested, instead of obeying and complying like a normal person, he behaved like a man on drugs (which he was) and tried to fight against the officers and run away. None of this would have happened if he had simply accepted his arrest like a normal person. 

People are dying and businesses are being destroyed in these protests for what? To honor a scum bag by all accounts, who may not have deserved to die, but pretty much caused his own demise. Regardless of skin color, if you behave the way George did when under arrest, you will be treated with force. Race had little if anything to do with his arrest.

It infuriates me that no one even talks about the innocent men and women killed in these riots such as Officer David Dorn who was killed im the line of duty, yet they are immortalizing a career criminal in the media.

George Floyd's Death is being used as a political tool to push an agenda and perpetuate the belief that most/all white cops are racist, when in fact the VAST MAJORITY are good cops.

EDIT: I want to clarify that IMO George Floyd's death was UNJUSTIFIED and the Officer involved definitely behaved inappropriately. I am simply fed up with the portrayal that George's death was entirely racially motivated and not at all caused at least in part by his own criminality.

EDIT 2: I agree that attacking George Floyd's character and giving the perception that I believe his death was justified due to this was a mistake and have changed my mind about this. The reason I brought up his character (or rather lack thereof), is because it annoys me that the media is portraying him as a saint and ignores all the innocent deaths caused by the protests.

You're kind of all over the place in your view of Floyd's death, so it's hard to know what you believe. Was he murdered for a good reason? Was the police conduct reasonable?

Nobody (or practically nobody) is arguing that all white cops are racist, rather the argument is that police use unjustifiable force against black people disproportionately -- and also that police use force unjustifiably against all sorts of people too often.

Placing more importance on addressing police brutality rather than addressing rising crime rates among black youth and a myriad of other issues is disgraceful.

Clouds_are_wet @ 2020-07-05 19:21:13 :

Give me one example where biased mainstream reporting broadcast something other than the truth. We aren’t being *told* to be outraged. The outrage comes from video after video of cops clearly being unnecessarily violent. 

&gt; What do you think kills more black people in America, police brutality or black on black crime?

And? 

&gt; Placing more importance on addressing police brutality... is disgraceful.

No it isn’t. Who said we have to address the issue with the highest body count first? Police are supposed to protect and serve and they are doing the opposite of that on a regular basis. We do not have to wait for a certain death toll before we can do something. The African American socio-economic situation that leads to black-on-black violence is a vast, complex issue. It’s a bit of a red herring like if you were to say “why don’t we address word hunger before we try to go to mars?” Police brutality is a very simple and easy-to-address issue *comparatively*. 

&gt; You're being brainwashed by the media and fed lies that the biggest issue faced by black people today is police brutality

Wrong. We do not think it’s the **biggest** issue. We think it’s the most pertinent issue. **Death toll isn’t all that is factored in.** We should also care about how heinous the issue is. It is deplorable that in the US, the police are regularly the antithesis of their purpose.

--------------------------------

AceFiveSuited @ 2020-07-05 19:58:02 :

The bias lies in what the media DOES NOT REPORT. No one reports the times when a black man shoots a cop and kills him (although this kind of thing happens with FAR more regularity that cops shooting black men), no one reports how 70% of household in black communities are led by single mothers. The media only reports incidents that fit their narrative or even reports disingenuously. For example, a lot of people don't even know that forensic evidence proved that the shooting of Michael Brown was completely justified, yet no one talks about it. Because they want to perpetuate the idea that more black men are shot unjustifiably than justifiably, which is far from the reality. 

If Black Lives Matter, than shouldn't the objectively more destructive issues be addressed and considered more important? Police brutality is comparatively easier to address how? By what measure can you claim this? My point is far more attention and efforts are being placed into trying to solve police brutality than it deserves when it comes to the measurable impact it has on black communities. 

Your final point that addressing the arguably more heinous act of police killing black men trivializes the deaths of hundreds of black people murdered by other black men every week in the US. Why is it more important to address police killings when both are equally preventable?

--------------------------------

Clouds_are_wet @ 2020-07-05 20:09:39 :

&gt; No one reports the times when a black man shoots a cop and kills him

Why is that relevant? This isn’t about keeping score. We already hold cop murderers accountable. **The issue is that COPS are not being held accountable.**

&gt; no one reports how 70% of household in black communities are led by single mothers.

How does that conservative distraction/talking point relate to police violence?

&gt; Michael Brown was completely justified

That was widely reported. You assertion is wrong. 

&gt; Because they want to perpetuate the idea that more black men are shot unjustifiably than justifiably, which is far from the reality.

You need to understand **proportionality**. If a higher percentage of black people are shot unjustifiably than any other race is, then it does not matter if the total number killed unjustifiably is less than the total number of black people killed justifiably. 

&gt; Police brutality is comparatively easier to address how?

Because that’s a much easier problem to address. They are government employees that are funded with tax dollars. We can write legislation to change hiring, training and equipping police. Addressing how the *government* is acting is always going to be more easier as well as more pertinent than addressing a systemic social inequality. 

&gt; My point is far more attention and efforts are being placed into trying to solve police brutality than it deserves when it comes to the measurable impact it has on black communities.

Then you aren’t hearing me when I say that it’s not all about body count. It’s also about how reprehensible the problem is. And police doing the opposite of their societal purpose is too reprehensible to hand-wave over. 

&gt; trivializes the deaths of hundreds of black people murdered by other black men every week in the US.

No it doesn’t. That’s like saying addressing gun violence in America trivializes the deaths of millions who for every year from heart disease. That’s stupid. 

&gt;Why is it more important to address police killings when both are equally preventable?


Because they are **not** equally preventable. We as a society can control what police do A LOT easier than we can control what individual citizens do. Come on, dude.

I brought up the other issues to highlight that police brutality is a relatively small problem when compared to everything else plaguing the black community. 

Michael Brown's justifiable shooting was widely reported? now you're being disingenuous if you ask BLM protestors   about the Brown shooting, nearly all will be unaware of the conclusion and simply recall it as another tragic example of police brutality. 

A higher proportion of blacks in general are also shot by police justifiably. Doesn't it stand to reason that perhaps addressing the high crime rate within the black community will help reduce unjustifiable deaths? It's not all caused by systemic racism is my point. Saying black people are only victims and do not contribute at all to the police brutality issue is simply not true and to try to address only one side of the problem will not work. 

Additionally, if you act and behave as if addressing gun violence is MORE IMPORTANT than addressing the heart disease, then guess what you're trivializing the issue of heart disease. In a similar vein, acting like police brutality is the most pertinent issue to address, when by all objective measures it is not, trivializes the real problems. 

Your last point is debatable. If educating and training police officers is so easy, then why isn't it easy to educate and teach regular people? I'd argue that both are equally challenging

--------------------------------

Clouds_are_wet @ 2020-07-05 20:58:24 :

&gt; I brought up the other issues to highlight that police brutality is a relatively small problem

And I’ve explained multiple times that the “size” of the problem is not all that matters. 

&gt; Michael Brown's justifiable shooting was widely reported?

We both know about it don’t we? Google it. 

&gt; A higher proportion of blacks in general are also shot by police justifiably.

That’s not how numbers work. Its an “either/or” thing. There are two options, justified and unjustified. **You can’t have a bigger category in both areas if they both have to add up to 100%.** If the ratio to justified/unjustified for black people is 70/30, and the ratio for whites is 85/15, then it is impossible for black men to have a higher percentage of justified AND unjustified. 

&gt; Doesn't it stand to reason that perhaps addressing the high crime rate within the black community will help reduce unjustifiable deaths?

What does “address” mean? You’re vastly oversimplifying a complex problem. When it comes to dealing with police violence, it IS much more simple. Changing recruiting, training, equipping. 

&gt; then guess what you're trivializing the issue of heart disease.

No you aren’t. If we accept your logic then we as a society can only ever handle one thing at a time, or else we’re trivializing every other problem there is. That’s stupid. 

&gt;  If educating and training police officers is so easy, then why isn't it easy to educate and teach regular people?

Because the government doesn’t have the same power over people living their lives as they do people who volunteered to work for the government. That’s like saying “why should the government only address how the police are handling riots when rioters are also being violent?” Well, the government can control the police because they employ them."

For the love of God, learn how to quote text! Highlight what text of mine you’re responding to, copy it, type in a “&gt;” and then paste the text. 


&gt; Why is it then the police brutality issue is more important than all the issues then?

**Because it’s the most heinous**. The police are supposed to protect and serve. They are regularly doing the opposite of that. It’s the same reason we devote a lot of assets and people to catching a serial killer. You would not say, “what’s the big deal guys? He’s only killed 15 people. Way more people died in car accidents last year than were killed by this guy. Why aren’t we addressing road safety?” 

&gt; You and I both know the majority of the public are not even aware of the conclusion of that case.

How do you know? You can’t just *will* a feeling into existence. The news reported it. It stands to reason people know about it. 

&gt; I can't believe you can genuinely believe that there is no bias in the media when reporting on matters of police brutality.

Why don’t you show me an example then? Give me an example of a major media outlet getting the Michael brown thing all wrong. 

&gt; What I am saying is the media is basically putting all their focus on police brutality

It’s not the media’s job to tell people what to think. The media is not responsible for making sure everyone has a well-rounded assessment of all of society’s ills. The media is not wrong for focusing more on the most heinous issues. Again, back to my serial killer example. You would not say “why do they keep going on and on about this killer when we’ve got record unemployment!?”

&gt; police brutality problem is not really a systemic issue and mostly caused by a minority of bad apples.

So what? We shouldn’t change anything about our policing until there are the requisite number of bad apples? What is that number? How many bad apples do there have to be before good apples share responsibility for not intervening? Derrick Chauvin was only murdered by one cop, but three others stood there for 10 minutes and watched him do it.

Way more people died in car accidents last year than were killed by this guy. Why aren’t we addressing road safety?”

What so now black lives that are ended by white cops matter more than black lives that are ended by other blacks? Its only more heinous according to your definition. In fact, by my views, acts of 1st degree murder are far more heinous than the manslaughter or 3rd degree murder that officers are charged with. Also, you claim the police regularly do the opposite of protecting and serving. What do you mean by regularly? Do you realize out of millions of police interactions, an incredibly small minority result in anyone being harmed right? And even a smaller fraction than that involve anyone being killed or shot unjustifiably. Stop trying to argue a narrative that clearly doesn't reflect reality. Incidents of brutality are the exception, certainly not the rule.  
Also, the fact that you're comparing random car accidents to murders is laughable to me and goes to show how much you trivialize black on black violence. 

How do you know? You can’t just will a feeling into existence. The news reported it. It stands to reason people know about it.&gt;

How do I know? Because I literally found out only recently that Michael Brown was justifiably shot. When he was first killed, literally all of my friends and everyone I knew were talking about it both IRL and on social media. Yet when it was reported that he literally charged at the officer, no one, NOT ONE PERSON I KNEW, talked about it. Please open your eyes and don't believe everything you see on the news as representative of the state of reality. 

Why don’t you show me an example then? Give me an example of a major media outlet getting the Michael brown thing all wrong.&gt;

Once again, arguing a strawman. Nowhere did I state the media reported it WRONG. I simply said they underrerport incidents that do not fit in with their narrative. 

It’s not the media’s job to tell people what to think. The media is not responsible for making sure everyone has a well-rounded assessment of all of society’s ills. The media is not wrong for focusing more on the most heinous issues. Again, back to my serial killer example. You would not say “why do they keep going on and on about this killer when we’ve got record unemployment!?”&gt;

Once again, stop trivializing the issues black people face as unimportant. You're really going to compare unemployment to murder? Get a grip man.

So what? We shouldn’t change anything about our policing until there are the requisite number of bad apples? What is that number? How many bad apples do there have to be before good apples share responsibility for not intervening? Derrick Chauvin was only murdered by one cop, but three others stood there for 10 minutes and watched him do it.&gt;

I'm all for better training and more funding for police, but if you haven't been paying attention BLM wants to defund the police and shut them down. I never claimed there is nothing wrong with the Police currently, I just believe there are bigger issues at hand.

The pro-life position is inherently about legislation i.e. abortion should be illegal. It certainly wasn't a non-sequitur.	0	0	stop arguing comment					"A lot of Pro-Life people I've talked to, or conservative speakers that I heard talked about abortion always talk about how easy it is to buy a pack of condoms and prevent pregnancy. And in addition, I've seen conservatives oppose the ability for government to be involved in funding birth-control methods and also support the reason Supreme Court decision to let employers opt-out of purchasing birth control for their employees under the Affordable Care Act

Yet I'm confused why conservative people and Pro-Lifers arent more pro-contraception? The reality of the situation is two-fold:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A lot of younger people in serious relationships (but not married) are probably the people that have the majority of sex. These are two people that are already dating, already comfortable with each other, possibly living in an apartment, and having sex very regularly.
2. More casual, first-time hook-ups, use Condoms. Condoms (arguably the highest effective-to-cost ratio of any contraception method) are not 100% reliable, even with perfect use.

By accepting these premises, it's easy to imagine that people in the first category don't want to use condoms because A. It's a very high expense given the amount of sexual-activity B. They're more comfortable with each other, have been dating for a while and don't have to worry about STDs. Then, it would stand to reason, they that would pursue other methods of Birth Control that are more difficult to access than condoms. These methods, such as the Pill, IUD, and the Patch are more expensive and sometimes require doctors visit and non-insurance-covered payments.

In category 2, Pro-Lifers should be advocating for people to double-up on methods of contraception. However, in that case, they should probably advocate for the usage of the most effective and most convenient methods to be used, in which case they should be politically aligned with movements trying to make access to other birth control methods easier.

In conclusion, pointing to ""Condoms"" as a 100% effective and extremely convenient way of contraception is unrealistic given A. The characteristics of where the majority of sex happens and the context B. The actual raw percentage effectiveness condoms have. Therefore, Pro-Lifers should be on the frontlines, trying to argue for more funding of Birth Control method research, funding to make access to alternative and more effective methods of Birth Control easier to access, and finally, more effective sex-education to make people aware of which methods are the most effective at reducing pregnancy.

TLDR: If you accept the premise that a large, large people are going to have sex before marriage, and you think abortion is murder, then you should advocate for extremely convenient access to more effective forms of birth control to prevent the pregnancy in the first place. Not just point to Condoms and say problem solved.

Link to source on effectiveness of different methods of birth control:

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/14/sunday-review/unplanned-pregnancies.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/14/sunday-review/unplanned-pregnancies.html)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: People are asking for me to clarify my definition of pro-contraception and I think that is totally fair. By pro-contraception I mean less in the boat of:

""I tolerate the existence and ability for people to purchase...""

And more in the boat with, to quote someone from the comments:

""I think hormonal birth control and IUDs should be subsidized and considered part of all insurance plans, possibly condoms as well.""

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are making arguments about how it is *possible* for people to be Pro-Life and Anti-Contraception at the same time. I don't debate that idea, and I don't think there are any logical inconsistencies by doing so. However, I guess the intention behind my post is that I was saying in a political context (i.e. someone is running for a Federal position, or they are a political commentator), then it is a viewpoint that is difficult to defend given the reality of my above points."

I reject your premise.  I think we can do better than that.  But even if I didn't - you're also sneaking the assumption  that it's a bad thing for these people to have their babies anyway.  I think it's good to create a life

--------------------------------

SincerelyYourDog @ 2020-07-13 19:15:06 :

Fair enough.  But do you believe it's always good to create life in any given circumstance? Let's imagine a 21-year old, straight couple, who are lower income and are having sex because they are in a monogamous relationship, but not married. Do you support their ability to have sex outside of marriage? And if you do, would you think it is a good idea for them to have a child given that it will produce life, given their age, non-commitment status, and income?

--------------------------------

Wumbo_9000 @ 2020-07-13 20:41:31 :

Yes they should have the child.  No they should not be expected to thoughtlessly indulge every sexual desire, even if it's legal to do so.  And i'd consider simply wearing a condom to be pretty thoughtless, even if it technically counts as attempted birth control

LucidMetal @ 2020-07-13 20:47:31 :

Wumbo_9000 @ 2020-07-13 20:54:35 :

I just said ""even if it's legal to do so"". No one is being controlled unless you're trying to condemn the entire concept of morality as authoritarian and controlling.  Is that what you're doing?  Or is this just a dismissive and irrelevant cliche?

--------------------------------

LucidMetal @ 2020-07-13 21:07:39 :

Yes, your desire to prevent others from having sex is controlling.  No, I'm not dismissing it, I just completely and utterly don't understand what the motive is. 

I think you should be able to and approve of you practicing your religion but I would be vehemently opposed with you imposing your will on others. I don't think that previous sentence is a shared idea between you and me and I find that unfortunate.

I would discourage it, certainly.  Along with a ton of other behaviors.  Almost every parent does this.  Parenting is ""controlling"" in a sense but I'm not sure where you're going with this.  Everyone does whatever they please and we live happily ever after?  Even teenagers? Come on

--------------------------------

LucidMetal @ 2020-07-13 21:42:35 :

Well? How can you say you're not being controlling then though (assuming you had a daughter)?

--------------------------------

Wumbo_9000 @ 2020-07-13 21:53:39 :

Any moral belief you disagree with can be considered ""controlling"" in this way.  Every attempt at parenting, ever, has also been controlling.  What is the point you're trying to make with this gotcha?  Finish this discussion before gish galloping to something about bodily autonomy

LucidMetal @ 2020-07-13 21:57:14 :

No, just the ones that seek to control the behavior of others. I'm surprised you can't see a difference between these two types of behavior:

I believe it's wrong to do X, I will not do X.

I believe it's wrong to do X, I will prevent others from doing X.

Where X is some activity which doesn't restrict another's rights. The latter is controlling and is a problem.

Wumbo_9000 @ 2020-07-13 22:09:33 :

I'm not preventing anything.  We are talking about adults, not children, and I've said multiple times i'm discussing morality and not any kind of legislation.  My thoughts on the morality of this behavior were invited, as this is literally a discussion board, so I really don't understand your point.  We aren't talking about controlling anyone.  I don't even wish to discuss that topic because you clearly have some very strong opinions about it.  But please stop trying to force this non-sequitur"	"Wumbo_9000 @ 2020-07-14 02:13:50 :

Well yes it opposes doing certain things.  You can weasel words like controlling in to the discussion to make it sound bad without actually arguing it's bad.  But to actually argue it's bad is much harder.  Any claim of immorality can be considered controlling.  But if the claim is true then certainly goodness is of more importance than not feeling controlled?  Or no?"

I don't particularly like throwing away swaths of arguments as bad faith, but the arguments for the EC are so thin that it's hard to see supporting it as anything other than a shrewd political ploy. Here are my main reasons for supporting a popular vote rather than the EC.

1. In general, popular sovereignty is good.  It should take very powerful considerations to take elections out of the hands of the people.  I don't feel the need to argue for a popular vote system because it's so clearly the best option for a nation that claims to be Democratic. You can say the whole Republic/Democracy thing and I super-duper don't care. I know we are a Republic.  I passed high school civics.  We could have a popular vote system that chooses the executive and still be a Republic.  The EC is *almost* a popular vote system the way it operates now.  It's given the same result as a popular vote system 91% of the time.  The times that it hasn't have been random, close elections.
2. ""One person, one vote"" is a valuable principle, and we should strive to live up to it.  Simple arithmetic can show that a voter in Wyoming has around 3 times more influence on the EC than a voter in California.  This wouldn't be true if it wasn't for the appropriations act in the 1920's, which capped the number of people in the House of Representatives at 435.  In the EC as it was designed, California would have many more electoral votes now, and the gap between Wyoming and Cali wouldn't be nearly as large.
3. There is no fundamental value in giving rural America an outsized say in elections.  I've often heard that the EC was created to protect rural interests.  This isn't true, but even if it was, I don't see the value in giving small states more influence.  This is where I developed the idea that most of the arguments are in bad faith.  Particularly because the current kind of inequality we have now in the EC was never intended by the founders.   If you are supporting the EC just because it favors rural areas, and you also know rural areas tend to vote red, then you just have that position for partisan reasons.
4. The ""elector"" system is very dumb and bad.  Do we really want 538 people that we've never heard of to get the ability to overturn an election?  This isn't a group of able statesmen, the electors are largely partisan figures.  In most states, you don't even see that you are voting for an elector instead of for a candidate for president.  These are elected officials only in the most vague sense of the term.  The idea that this ceremonial body is some kind of safe-guard is laughable.
5. The concept of ""swing states"" is bad for democracy.  Focusing on groups of swing voters in 5/6 states leads to undue attention and money being used to persuade smaller groups of voters. It also creates a sense of votes being worthless. I was a Democrat in a deep red state for a long time, and it felt like my vote didn't matter because my state was going to go red anyway.  And that's going to be true for most voters, apart from the 5/6 swing states that are uncertain on election day.  It's hard to know if that is pushing turnout down, but it certainly isn't having a positive effect.
6. The EC makes elections less secure.  Instead of a popular vote system where it would take a hue effort to change enough votes to make a difference, rigging state elections in swing states could have a huge impact.  The targets for interference are clear, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida could be changed with relatively small numbers of votes.  This also makes voter suppression a tactic that can work on a national scale, if applied in the correct states.

EDIT: 

Alright, I need to get to my actual work-job instead of rage-posting about the electoral college. I've enjoyed reading everyone's responses and appreciate your participation. Some final responses to some underlying points I've seen:

1. Lots of people saying I just hate the EC because of Trump. I have literally hated the electoral college since I learned about it in the 6th grade. For me, this isn't (fully) partisan. I absolutely would still be against the electoral college if a Democrat won the EC and a Republican won the popular vote. I know you may I'm lying, and I grant that this isn't something I can really prove, but it's true. Feel free to hold me to it if that ever happens. My position is currently, and always has been, the person who gets more votes should be president.
2. The historic context of the electoral college, while important to understanding the institution, has an outsized influence on how we talk about presidential elections. I would much rather look forward to a better system than opine about how wise the system set up in 1787 was. The founders were smart, smarter than me. But we have 350 years of hindsight of how this system practically works, which is very valuable.
3. I was wrong to say all defenses of the EC were bad faith or partisan, I see that now. I still believe a portion of defenses are, but there are exceptions. The fact that most discussions of the EC happen just after a close election give all discussions surrounding the issue a hyper-partisan tone, but that doesn't have to be the rule.
4. If you think farmers are worth more to the country because they're farmers, I have some news to you about who was doing the farming in 1787. It wasn't the voters, I can tell you that much.
5. I'm sorry if I appeared brusque or unappreciative of your comments, this thread got way more attention than I expected. I'm re-reading my responses now and there's absolutely some wording choices I'd change, but I was in a hurry.

Hope you all have a good day. Abolish the electoral college, be gay, do crime, etc."	"chadtr5 @ 2020-07-21 13:17:01 :

&gt;The concept of ""swing states"" is bad for democracy. Focusing on groups of swing voters in 5/6 states leads to undue attention and money being used to persuade smaller groups of voters.

There is an upside to swing states, and personally this is the only justification for the Electoral College I find to have any merit.  Swing states reduce the role of money in presidential elections.

In a truly national competition, both campaigns have to buy TV time, hire staff, etc. in every state in the country.  This would be extraordinarily expensive, and candidates would be even more dependent on big donors. By instead concentrating the campaign in a few states, candidates don't need nearly as much money and don't incur as large a debt to big money interests.  This, at least, is a good faith argument.

The other argument about swing states, which may be less persuasive, is that voters in swing states tend to take their responsibility more seriously and be better informed.  A general critique of American voters is that they are poorly informed and vote impulsively or just on party labels.  Voters in swing states know they might decide the election and may take a more responsible attitude to learning about the candidates.  It also helps that the campaign is concentrated in their states, so they have more opportunities to learn.

&gt;""One person, one vote"" is a valuable principle, and we should strive to live up to it. Simple arithmetic can show that a voter in Wyoming has around 3 times more influence on the EC than a voter in California.

I agree with you here, but it's worth pointing out that the real offender here is the Senate.  The EC is somewhat disproportionate, but the Senate is **extremely** disproportionate.  Sure, Wyoming gets a little more representation in the EC but it gets **80 times** the representation in the Senate.

""In a truly national competition, both campaigns have to buy TV time, hire staff, etc. in every state in the country. This would be extraordinarily expensive, and candidates would be even more dependent on big donors. By instead concentrating the campaign in a few states, candidates don't need nearly as much money and don't incur as large a debt to big money interests. This, at least, is a good faith argument.""

While this doesn't change my mind, it is one of the better arguments I've heard and it is a good faith argument, though its an entirely unintended aspect of the EC. !delta

&gt; Back with you again. The Senate is absurd.

The senate is absolutely a necessary function of the US.  The reason that Wyoming is given so much power is because it has so little power in the House.  Meaning if we went just by population, the House could simply override anything that Wyoming wanted to do.  For example, if a portion of states wanted to perserve national parks, and the very urban states decided that they didn't, it would be much easier for the very populous states to simply eliminate parks because they don't see a value in it since they don't have national parks in the big cities.  Or imagine if the wealthy states decided that their income levels should be representative of funding, meaning that they dont have farms or as much in roads or railroads and they cut funding.  The senate is the barrier between the majority overwhelming the minority.

eidolon36 @ 2020-07-21 16:30:30 :

""The senate is the barrier between the majority overwhelming the minority.""

This is narrowly true, but what is the limiting principle? Would you be willing to give Wyoming 10 senators while keeping the rest of the states with only 2? If not, why? Shouldn't low population states have greater representation to prevent the majority from overwhelming the minority? I think your answer will be that at some point in a democracy an overwhelming majority has the right to implement their policies (if it is to be a democracy). So really we're just disagreeing with what that limit is. 

David Birdsell, dean of the school of public and international affairs at  Baruch College projected that by 2040, about 70% of Americans are expected  to live in the 15 largest states and so will have only 30  senators representing them, while the remaining 30% of Americans will  have 70 senators representing them.

If 30% of the population has a filibuster-proof Senate majority to impose their will on the other 70% other US population, then it will be fairer to say the minority has overwhelmed the majority.

If 6 people lived in Wyoming do you think they deserve 2 senators? What about 600 people? 6000? Where’s the cutoff? Why should they get to hold disproportionate power?

Especially now that house seats are locked in at certain numbers for each state small states gain power whenever people move away, which as someone pointed out soon 70% of people will live in 15 states. This is mostly a different argument but why should small states benefit from both sides of congress when the intention is to have one branch that benefits large states and one for the small ones?

Also, Wyoming would want to be part of the union because of federal funding, military defense, etc. They don’t stay here just because they have 2 senators. 

What if Wyoming and Montana combined? They’d still be a small state pop-wise but now instead of 1.5 million people (&gt;.5% of US population) controlling 4% of the senate they’d have a more proportional representation at 2%. Theres a lot to think about here

You're creating a strawman; no one said that the Senate was meant to be representative of people. You're trying to impose the principles that the HOUSE was established with onto a fundimentally different institution. 

You're also forgetting (or unrealizing) of a fundimental principle of federalism: the autonomy of political subunits. If Wyoming and Montana combined to create a large state, then the people within those two states are less well-represented within their state legislatures. It's a fundimental truth in large republics, and was a consideration that the Framers had, as evidenced in both numerous Federalist Papers and in Brutus I.

State legislatures are much MUCH more important than the Federal Government in terms of day to day operation of the country. People have much more interaction with state-backed law enforcement and justice systems, and usually follow more strict state laws (besides the hot topic issues like abortion and weed legalization, which have varying degrees of strictness).

This point is further down the comment chain, but the political deadlock of Congress is a feature, not a bug. If a sizable portion of the country can't agree on something (greater than a simple majority. Let's make the (very incorrect) assumption that all white people will have the voting behavior as Jim Crow-era south. (I use white people as an example since it's the largest set and most simple discriminator) If this were true and simple majorities were the only thing needed to pass laws and since white people are the majority, there'd be no way for the 19th Amendment to be ratified, or the Civil Rights Act to pass), then why should it affect the entire country? It would make much more sense for each region (or state) to pass it on its own, experiement to see if it works or not, and then let the rest of the nation follow. While political deadlock may prevent fundimentally good legislation from being passed, it also helps to prevent fundimentally bad legislation (besides the PATRIOT Act and related bills) from getting passed. Besides, if the bill were truly good, don't you think a state would pass it on its own so that its own people could experience the fruits of it?

This is a hilariously naive view of politics. Look at states that refused money for Medicare expansion.

A lot of people have said I am like the character Moss (for the uninitiated [https://imgur.com/gallery/k12ft](https://imgur.com/gallery/k12ft) ).  I have thought a few times about going to a fancy dress party as him, but this would mean I would want to ""brown face"" to complete the look (the actor Richard Ayoade is half Nigerian).  I have never done this and am likely never going to as it is perceived as racist/insensitive and I am happy to not offend.

I understand that white people used to blackface to unfavourably portray black people in theatre before black people were allowed to work etc. - I understand that going as a Minstrel to fancy dress is not on because of the connotations it carries. However, if it fits with a character that you admire and want to celebrate then there should not be any resistance.  I don't understand where the sensitivity comes from and I think the white wash (no pun intended) no-black face, ever, rule is draconian.

Things that may be useful to point out:

\- This question is not about ""***MY RIGHT***"" to be able to don brown face if I want - honestly it does not affect my life. I just don't necessarily agree with the whole premise.

\- Yes, I could go without the brown face and make it work, but it would just look like me in some funny trousers and I like to go all in with fancy dress.

HasHands @ 2020-09-01 16:35:13 :

Actual blackface, i.e. the reason modern blackface is perceived as racist regardless of execution, was done in an overly mocking manner. It was pretty much always combined with the minstrel type character that included additional makeup to make a mockery of black individuals. It had over-exaggerated features like over-painted lips and was intended to essentially be a mocking caricature of black individuals.

Today though, simply putting black face paint on your face isn't blackface. It doesn't inherently carry the intent behind why blackface and its association with the minstrel trope is considered racist.

I'd argue that putting black paint on your face today, even in the US, is not inherently racist. It crosses the line to being racist when you do it with the intention to mock or if you combined it with the additional minstrel makeup. Claiming that simply putting a specific color of face paint on regardless of context is somehow always racist or immoral is a leap of logic.

--------------------------------

_melted_ @ 2020-09-01 16:44:53 :

OK...no matter what, you cant do blackface in isolation from that past. in theory, you could put brown face paint on and be a tree, but in OPs context, they're talking about putting brown face paint on to look like a black person. dressing up as a black or brown person (not dressing up LIKE that person with your own skin tone, but AS that person with their skin tone) is always mocking because you're costuming something and thus trivializing something as profound as race.

--------------------------------

HasHands @ 2020-09-01 16:56:58 :

&gt; OK...no matter what, you cant do blackface in isolation from that past.

You absolutely can, especially because blackface is only offensive because it was intended to be a mockery. That's why the minstrel paint was included in the overwhelming majority of instances; it added to the intentional mockery. If that intent dissolves, like in modern use when you want to look like someone that you admire, it's suddenly not offensive anymore. Why would it still be offensive if the offensive part of it is removed?

&gt; dressing up as a black or brown person (not dressing up LIKE that person with your own skin tone, but AS that person with their skin tone) is always mocking because you're costuming something and thus trivializing something as profound as race.

I absolutely disagree. Mocking requires intent and desire to make fun of something in a cruel way. Dressing up like your idol because you want to be like them or look like them as close as possible is not mocking at all, it's the exact opposite. It's admiration and a desire to emulate in every facet. 

It's special pleading to apply this kind of logic only to race and not to anything else. We don't condemn people when they adopt every other aspect of an individual. Like if a woman dressed up like Ron Burgundy and painted on a mustache and dyed her hair, we wouldn't condemn her for adding ""unnecessary"" features. She did those things because she admires the subject of her efforts, not because she wanted to make a mockery of it and that's the crux of why blackface is offensive. It was *intended* to be a mockery. If you strip away the intent, as in not dressing up like a caricature of the person you're emulating, there's no reason to be offended by it.

--------------------------------

_melted_ @ 2020-09-01 17:04:42 :

&gt;blackface is only offensive because it was intended to be mockery 

see, i disagree. in this world, it is almost impossible, or at least rare, to get a racist person to actually admit they're racist. there's hundreds of euphemisms that people use to hide their racism behind. 

in addition, intentionality is not a good indicator of consequences. you might have the best of intentions when donning blackface, but it doesnt change the fact that it trivializes a person's identity. i would like some examples of blackface that is not mockery, because i cant think of one (except in the case of dressing as a tree, maybe) 

&gt;only to race and nothing else

no, i think the logic applies to ethnicity (not just race, but dressing as a ""gypsy"" aka roma) and religious groups. there's probably some others as well and probably plenty of grey areas. i said in another comment why gender is a lot more complicated, and i honestly dont know.

This isn't justification to essentially say ""well we can't be sure, so to be safe let's say it's always racist and leave it at that."" That isn't a good enough reason to condemn something.

The entire world's legal system depends on the concept of intent. Intent matters legally, socially, and in essentially every arena we find ourselves in as humans interacting with other humans. You can more easily forgive someone who has wronged you if they didn't mean to and I'd argue that this concept is innate to human nature. Your perception of an event immediately changes if the intent of the person is suddenly known.

Why does painting your skin a different color trivialize someone's identity? Are you advocating that people shouldn't consider skin color to be an identifying feature that someone has?

Thought experiment. Take [Blade](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000648/?ref_=tt_cl_t1), the vampire hunter played by Wesley Snipes. His skin has a darker tone than Will Smith's. Would [Will Smith](https://www.google.com/search?q=will+smith) wearing some kind of face paint or makeup be offensive when he dresses up like Blade if the intent is to simply look more like Wesley Snipes as Blade? I don't personally think it would be offensive and I would actually be more impressed with the dedication to detail that Will Smith would be portraying.

I also wouldn't consider [this](https://cache.desktopnexus.com/thumbseg/341/341762-bigthumbnail.jpg) mockery, or [this](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/e8/58/8c/e8588c281230860fd7649d105e13f2ff--halloweenmakeup-face-art.jpg), or [this](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ee/d0/0c/eed00c9bbc70bc81d6ef20bdfe975096--alexander-khokhlov-two-faces.jpg), or [this](https://i2.wp.com/www.renskeveldhuis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/img_1532.jpg).

ok i want to discuss intentionality some more. i do agree that one's intentions is directly related to the consequences THEY face, but not at all related to the consequences that the other party faces.

take the example of manslaughter vs first degree murder. the murderer is definitely more or less dangerous based on their intention and definitely face consequences personally related to their intentionality. but the murdered? they're dead either way.

that's how racism works. if someone doesnt intend to be racist, then they have a lot of potential to learn from their actions and pose less danger to POC than a klan member. but those who face racism face racism either way. both racists contribute to a racist culture.

if will smith darkened his skin to look like wesley snipes, that would be racist. learn about ""colorism"" and you'll see why my arguments about black face still apply.

i would argue the first example mocks dark skin in a really gross way. rather than hiring a black model with that skin tone naturally, they paint it on a white person as if thats the only way black skin can be editorial. the second example is more damning than the third IMO because it looks more like black skin tone on white skin rather than actual black&amp;white as hues like the third example. the fourth link is broken.

Murder isn't a good example because there are no feelings or perceptions involved for the recipient. Someone being prejudiced towards you feels different if it's overt vs. if it's accidental which still means intent is significant even for the recipient. That also means that blackface is offensive due to the intent and if you remove the intent factor, it's significantly less offensive if not inoffensive entirely.

&gt; if will smith darkened his skin to look like wesley snipes, that would be racist. learn about ""colorism"" and you'll see why my arguments about black face still apply.

... They are both the same race. How can you be racist against your own race when racism necessitates prejudice based on superiority? Colorism doesn't apply at all. They are the same race. Will Smith isn't doing something racist by changing the perception of his skin color. How is that possibly racist?

&gt; i would argue the first example mocks dark skin in a really gross way. rather than hiring a black model with that skin tone naturally, they paint it on a white person as if thats the only way black skin can be editorial.

Regarding the first example, I think you're heavily projecting some kind of malice. What if they wanted an obviously white woman specifically for matters of social progressivism? Why are you manufacturing intent for people in this scenario without context? Why are you jumping to the worst possible interpretation? Are you saying then that no black woman should ever paint her face white either and we should reserve all white-face needs for white people only? This is where your logic falls apart and it turns to a case of special pleading.

&gt;  the second example is more damning than the third IMO because it looks more like black skin tone on white skin rather than actual black&amp;white as hues like the third example. 

You're already framing every view from your already held perception that any artificial black tone on a white person's skin is racist. You're not looking at this objectively at all. Why is artificial black skin tone on white skin racist? You haven't justified that, only perpetuated that it's true.

&gt; the fourth link is broken.

The fourth link works fine for me on both my phone and my PC.

_melted_ @ 2020-09-01 21:49:15 :

&gt; Murder isn't a good example because there are no feelings or perceptions involved for the recipient. 

Even though I disagree, we can use a different example. If someone robs you because they hate you/is just malicious or if someone robs you because they're poor and down on their luck and they feel terrible about it but they have no other choice.... You're still robbed in the end. You still don't have your stuff. 

The thing is, racism isn't just one instance that affects one individual. Small instances of racism might not be observed by every POC, but the small instances of racism uphold a racist society. It doesn't matter what someone's intent it, if they're upholding racism in any way, then they're being racist. 

&gt; They are both the same race. How can you be racist against your own race when racism necessitates prejudice based on superiority? Colorism doesn't apply at all. They are the same race. Will Smith isn't doing something racist by changing the perception of his skin color. How is that possibly racist?

Dude, you can be racist to your own race. It would be internalized racism but anti-blackness affects everyone, and black people can still hold anti-black views. I can't remember the channel, but there is this one family Youtube channel where the wife is a lightskin black woman, and in a ""prank"" video, she made herself darker and acted ""ghetto."" That is a pretty obvious example of racism and colorism, but just because she's black doesn't give her a free pass to don blackface with darker skin. 

....

And sorry IDK the first time I tried to open the fourth link it didn't work but I see it now. I have explained why it's wrong to paint dark skin on white skin. Skin colour is not a costume. It's a profound source of people's identity. It is also a source of oppression. It cannot be temporarily painted on for whatever self indulgent reason like an editorial photoshoot, halloween costume, playing a character in a movie/play etc without trivializing or caricaturing POC. 

&gt;Regarding the first example, I think you're heavily projecting some kind of malice. What if they wanted an obviously white woman specifically for matters of social progressivism?

""Social progressivism"" via blackface is even worse than what I originally said. Imagine making a statement on racism and dark skin but only involving white people... Why am I jumping onto the worst possible interpretation? I see it as the only interpretation since it is blackface.... Any attempt to justify that editorial is reaching.

&gt; Are you saying then that no black woman should ever paint her face white either and we should reserve all white-face needs for white people only? This is where your logic falls apart and it turns to a case of special pleading.

Ah yes, the old reverse racism argument. Do you also think ""cracker"" is a slur? 

This is going to be my last comment in this thread because I'm actually pretty surprised that ""blackface is bad"" is controversial. Feel free to respond, I'll read it, but you clearly subscribe to a different ideology when it comes to race so I will no longer continue.

If you're not going to respond regardless, you should at least recognize that painting your face black is not blackface. Conflating the simple act of covering your skin with no malice or ill will with the intentional mocking and overt denigration of black individuals as a whole is a gross misunderstanding of what blackface even is and why blackface was offensive.

_melted_ @ 2020-09-02 17:32:38 :

you're moving the goalpost. 

the original point of contention was whether or not blackface is OK, not whether painting your face black is or isnt blackface. if you can show me one instance of someone wearing blackface -- not an art piece, but a costume of a black person -- and defend it, then we can continue.

--------------------------------

HasHands @ 2020-09-03 16:57:52 :

By your own admission, painting your face brown to look like a tree is okay, but painting it brown to look like a black person isn't. You've equated painting your face brown as blackface, so I've already showed you examples of blackface that aren't problematic.

Excluding art is special pleading. If the point of painting your face black is to look like a black person, it doesn't matter that it's art. You said it's always a mockery regardless of intent and I've showed you multiple examples that directly counter that. It doesn't matter if they are art, and if it somehow magically does matter now, then your position is untenable that it's always a mockery regardless of intent. If it doesn't matter that it's art, then you're still wrong because you said it's always mockery regardless. Talk about moving the goalposts.

&gt; i am not going to nitpick where the line is drawn between what is and isn't blackface. 

You've already nitpicked it! You said any instance of people putting brown or black paint on their face in order to look like a black person is both blackface and is always mockery. I disagreed and showed you examples that are not mockery, and you dismissed them for being art. 

I don't think actual blackface, e.g. actually intending to mock people by overdrawing lips to become a caricature of a black person, is defensible. It's obviously racist and that's why actual blackface is negative. It's not because it's darkened skin tone; it's because it was done with the intention to mock. When you remove that, it's not blackface anymore. That's why there's a specific term called blackface to describe that phenomena, it's not shorthand for putting black makeup on. I took issue with you saying that in any case of anyone putting black paint on their face, it's always mocking and that you consider the above to be blackface.

Do you consider the images I shared to be blackface? Because objectively, they aren't, so you should retract your claim that every instance of people darkening their skin is both blackface and mockery / racist.

So, if OP darkened their skin to look like Richard Ayoade it would *not* be blackface? If so, please show me a real life equitable example and defend it on the premise that it is not mocking black or brown people and thus is not ""blackface"" as per your definition.

HasHands @ 2020-09-04 16:16:05 :

I mean, yeah, that's correct. It wouldn't be blackface. It's not intended to mock, it's intended to emulate which actually stems from adoration, the exact opposite of mockery.

I already showed you real life examples. White women painting their skin darker as a form of art. That's not blackface."	"HasHands @ 2020-09-04 16:37:26 :

I think those are a bit tacky mostly due to execution, I don't think they are automatically racist though. It depends entirely on their intent. If they are intending to mock black people somehow with their costume, then sure, that should be condemned. Without knowing motive though, we can't automatically say it's racist because it doesn't fit tradition blackface with the minstrel makeup. Just being part of a costume doesn't make it automatically racist; actors and actresses use makeup every single day to change the tone of their skin so that they better represent the entity they are trying to portray.

&gt;  DRESSED SPECIFICALLY AS A BLACK OR BROWN PERSON WITHOUT THE INTENT TO MOCK OR CARICATURE?

I already showed you multiple examples. Your inability to recognize that or desire infinitely more examples because you think it doesn't apply when it's art is not my issue.

As an aside, Robert Downey Jr. played a white man turned black man in Tropic Thunder. He was playing a character who was a method actor that was so enveloped in their role that they got pigment augmentation so they could more authentically represent a black man. Robert Downey Jr. darkened his skin (not pigment augmentation) for that role and that was neither blackface nor racist to do so.

As an extreme example (you're going to hate this), there are white people who undergo pigment augmentation in order to look like black people. It isn't to mock black people, it's to look like black people. [Here's a video where a Youtuber interviews a guy who does exactly that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsCguRjUVqk) Again, there is no mocking intention, it's literally trying to look like a black person because they admire them or otherwise want to look like them. It's not malicious like blackface in the  twentieth century was.

""Blackface is a term used to describe a form of theatrical make-up used predominantly by non-black performers to represent a caricature of a black person.""

This is the essence of blackface and why it's offensive. The entire intent is to represent a caricature of a black person. The entire concept of blackface hinges on the intent.

--------------------------------

_melted_ @ 2020-09-04 16:46:54 :

&gt;I already showed you multiple examples. 

You showed me artsy makeup that toes the line. You did not show those examples in good faith and I should not have accepted them to begin with. 

Robert Downey Jr playing a black man in Tropic Thunder was definitely blackface. He played an (albeit subtle) caricature of a black man. 

Those people who turn their skin black out of ""admiration"" perpetuate racial stereotypes to a caricatured degree. That swedish lady and the dude in the video you showed make a mockery of not only what they think a black person looks like, but also what a black person acts like. Now, you're probably going to turn this around and say ""You're the one perpetuating black stereotypes if you think that's how black people act"" -- no, I don't think black people act like that, *those* people turning their skin black actually think that's how black people act. It's caricaturing, even with so called ""good"" intentions

Without knowing motive though, we can't automatically say it's racist because it doesn't fit tradition blackface with the minstrel makeup.

So if we can't know someone's intent, then we cannot judge their actions? Actions have consequences, as I have laid out before. With the example of murder, we can deliberate over someone's intent but we cannot deliberate whether or not they committed murder (if we have proof, witnesses etc obviously). In the same way, we can deliberate over whether or not they intended to make a mockery of black people but we *cannot* deliberate over whether or not they presented blackface -- which, by your own omission, is racist."

I think the idea that capitalism gives more people opportunity is a joke.

Some people even go so far as to say it is worth sacrificing social services for a large number of people in exchange for the infinitesimally small chance that you could become incredibly wealthy. As someone who truly believes in the equality of all peoole, I find this so hard to wrap my head around.

Here are some of my personal opinions on capitalism: It encourages people to undermine and take advantage of others, it institutes a zero sum game in which someone must lose for you to win and true capitalism makes money the ultimate arbiter of morality.

Here is some background on me: Both of my parents are white. One of my parents went from sewing their clothes out of dirty rags poor to upper middle class. At some point in their life they were making enough money to be considered a 1%, but just barely.

My other parent was raised in a middle class household and remained middle class.
Politically, I'm a socialist. I don't care much about how you think it would be difficult to pull off.

In fact, if anyone wants to make comments about how hard it would be to run a socialist government without corruption, you're going to have to defend the disgusting corruption (monopolies, bribes, organized crime) involved in a capitalist society that people don't seem to have a huge deal wifh.

Anyway, I know a lot of people say that capitalism has helped them. I am open to the idea that maybe it really could bring the most prosperity to the most people and perhaps it was just America that fucked it up so badly. I'm open to it. That's why I'm here anyway, so if i could find some rational capitalist supporters who aren't going to irrationally fear socialism then please respond to this post."	"MadeInHB @ 2020-09-15 04:26:26 :

Just because some people might have taken advantage of others doesn’t mean that’s the case for the entirety of capitalism. Capitalism is the trading of things that are mutually agreed upon. A company/business owner needs labor. I apply and they offer me a job for X amount of money. Plus any benefits. I have a decision to make. Either accept it or decline it and/or negotiate it.  But I am not being forced to take the job. If I take the job, I can gain experience and then apply for other companies/jobs and move up/make more. 

You said equality of all people. What exactly do you mean by this?

LatinGeek @ 2020-09-15 04:44:00 :

You're not being forced to take that specific job by that specific company, but the system you both operate under makes it so not taking any job means your quality of life goes down anywhere between 'can't make payments on commodities' to 'can't eat/have a roof over my head'. That is a much more compelling reason for you to take a 'bad' job than any reason a company would have to hire a 'bad' employee.

Not true. People think that going to a job means they are there as a career. Work hard, get experience and then move on. It’s that simple. 

Three things that people can do to pretty much guarantee they won’t be poor. 1) graduate high school. 2) have a job and 3) don’t have kids young and before you can afford them.  Those 3 things can almost guarantee a person won’t be poor.

Nailyou866 @ 2020-09-15 06:58:17 :

Right now we are staring down the barrel of one of the biggest economic crises that we have faced to this point. A large portion of the population can't afford their [rent](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/01/848247228/rent-is-due-today-but-millions-of-americans-wont-be-paying). over half of those people can't afford the VERY basics, such as [food](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/millions-of-americans-cant-afford-enough-food-in-the-pandemic.html). This isn't a failing on the individual. Yes, there is an ""outside"" factor that is making this much bigger than it otherwise might be, but I see that more as exposing a big, gaping flaw in out economy than it is just the fault of the pandemic.   


This isn't a minority, and it hasn't just started. Why should we not be working to fix the economy and make it more suited to our needs, and improving the general well-being in America? There are [several](https://checkyourfact.com/2019/12/24/fact-check-633000-homeless-million-vacant-homes/) empty houses for every homeless person in America. We could literally, not figuratively, but literally end homelessness right now. The food industry, including grocery, throws out [literal tons](https://rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/) of food each year. We could end starvation in America right now.  


And this is without touching on the scam that is the insurance industry. To see a problem and want to fix it isn't foolish. Just by ending the homelessness crisis, and the starvation problem, that doesn't ""make everybody happy and equal"". What we propose is more akin to letting everybody have a foundation on which they can begin to build their own fulfilling life.   


The problem I always have with those who resist even the slightest change in the system is that they tend to view the economy as this very rigid, perfect, and unchangeable thing. Why? We control the economy, in a sense. We can decide that there are forms of work that our economy doesn't account for right now. We can decide that there is a basic human need to food, shelter, and rest. We can mold our economy to model what we want it to. Any excuse to not improve the system is nothing but hot air.

Woah woah woah, there’s no evidence that alludes to Ford making false accusations. If anything, there is more evidence corroborating her story than Kavanaugh’s. In the end, Republicans simply thought that even if he did do it, it was a long time ago and shouldn’t be held against him. And they had the majority, so they got their way.

Now, Democrats weren’t saying Kavanaugh should be punished for the accusation. They were just concerned with letting such a controversial figure have a seat in the highest court in the US. There were plenty of other people to choose from. Why go with the guy who clearly has some issues following him? Is rape not an important issue? Were they just supposed to ignore the accusations and vote him in?

Before Trump, these would have been important issues that would keep anybody from having a powerful position, even if untrue. But after Trump was elected, apparently everything has changed as far as standards go. I mean, we can really say since Obama was elected, but at least with Obama, Republicans seemed to be concerned about integrity. Now it’s just about following Trump, since they have nowhere else to go. Look at Romney and the other Republicans who tried to oppose Trump even just a little. They are outsiders to their own party now, and they’re not anywhere close to moderates.

Is that such a good thing? A woman can say a man raped her, and whether she's lying or not he loses prospects of getting to a higher position in his company or, in this case, the judicial system.

Except not getting on the Supreme Court isn’t a punishment. Kavanaugh would have lived a great life afterwards.

HarambeEatsNoodles @ 2020-09-20 23:28:24 :

An accusation of rape is enough to start an investigation, which the other person argued was just made up by the left. And the investigation did not determine whether the rape happened, it was left unknown. Republicans either didn’t care that it happened, or they decided to trust the words of Kavanaugh and not Ford. But none of it was done based on “evidence.”

You are now contradicting yourself. You said Ford was lying, and now you’re saying she was telling the truth. Which is it?

It's not like minstrel shows are dark magic rituals, and every time you perform one, a black neigborhood explodes.

Minstrel shows hurt black people through *symbolism*, by expressing the white community's hostility to black people, and blackface continues to do that.

You are making a weird dividing line between ""real offense"", and ""learned offense"".

Black people in the 19th century also had to learn from context cues, what message various words and visuals are supposed to carry.

--------------------------------

Smudge777 @ 2020-10-05 11:01:02 :

Thanks for bringing this point up.  It's one I had considered, but you're the first to make this argument.

You're right that minstrel shows didn't directly hurt anyone.

However, the reason I see things as different now is because of the evolution of the practice of blackface.  Historically (If my understanding is correct), throughout the 19th century, blackface was most frequently used with the intention to ridicule, mock and demean.  What I would call 'innocent' blackface was less common or, at least, less publicized.  As such, it would be fair to assume that if someone you don't know has a darkened face, they're likely to be intending offense.


In the 21st century, the practice of using blackface to demean, mock or ridicule is (I think) rare.  So it is no longer fair to assume that if someone you don't know has a darkened face, they're likely to be intending offense.  Its much more likely that they're being interpreted as offensive without actually intending it.

If I'm mistaken about the commonness of truly mocking blackface (and I don't mean the idea that ""all blackface is mocking"") in the 21st century, then I'd like to know.  That's the intention if this CMV.

Sure, maybe they just faceplanted in tar and then put on lipstick without noticing it. 

But if they are intentionally doing what they and I would both recognize as ""doing blackface"", then they know very well what it's message is. 

Maybe they consider it sarcastic, or think they are making a political point, I'm sure that deep within their heart many of them don't feel angry or hateful against black people. 

But then again, many of the peopel watching minstrel shows weren't either, they just wanted to have a fun sunday afternoon watching the jigaboos do a funny little song and dance. 

The offense given, was always more about dismissiveness, and the selfishness of prioritizing shallow amusement over respect. 

""I'm doing this and I don't care that it is widely considered offensive and racist"", perfectly carries on with the intent of that.

&gt; But if they are intentionally doing what they and I would both recognize as ""doing blackface"", then they know very well what it's message is. 

What if they don't know?

What if they're a kid who has a bright idea to make their face black, and has no idea of the history of blackface?  They're ""doing blackface"", and it's intentional, but it's certainly not malevolent.

What if they're an immigrant coming from a place where blackface is unheard of, and they want to show their admiration for LeBron James by ""doing blackface"", unaware that it's culturally unacceptable?

What if they're part of a religion that darkens their face as part of a respectful religious tradition?

I hope it's clear to see that the fact that many/most people in a society thinks something is offensive doesn't make its intention offensive.  I hope it's also clear to see that it's important to allow for that distinction.

If we start with the preconceived notion that all blackface is offensive, then all blackface is offensive whether it is offensive or not.

Small kids are allowed to be ignorant. 

With adults, we expect a baseline understanding of cultural norms.

Ignorance can be corrected. If someone is *genuinely* ignorant and apologises and changes their behaviour after being informed then few will have a problem with that. The problem is that there's only a handful of edge cases where ignorance is plausible enough to give the benefit of the doubt.

--------------------------------

Tomas92 @ 2020-10-05 14:01:33 :

If ignorance of cultural norms can explain people doing blackface with good intentions, then that actually validates OP's point that being offended by it is a learned behavior. If it were naturally and inherently offensive to do blackface, then culture would have nothing to do with it.  
  
I don't agree or disagree with the actual content of your message, I just want to put it into perspective so we realize that it actually validates OP's point, not the other way around.  
  
If it were actually a learned offense, whether it's fine or acceptable to do blackface is a very useful discussion and very relevant to this CMV, and your argument is a very good one to justify that it's *not* fine to do blackface, but it's **not** the actual point being discussed in this CMV.  
  
I genuinely believe that we need to have all this context in mind for this discussion.

Your starting issue is this:

&gt;Opinions are taken as facts and facts are discarded as delusions. You can’t go to any sub Reddit right now without seeing this undeniable fact. 

What you're saying is: ""this free-to-join, anonymous, socially-curated website isn't somehow producing prejudice-free and balanced facts and news for me""

Well, of course it's not. By what mechanism could it possibly do that?

--------------------------------

Pillars-In-The-Trees @ 2020-10-06 15:59:30 :

I refer you to /r/askscience and /r/askhistorians.

Pillars-In-The-Trees @ 2020-10-06 20:21:16 :

You asked for a mechanism and I have you two examples, the population of reddit is completely irrelevant. Was I supposed to find a mechanism successfully utilized by a majority of subreddits?

Not to mention that askscience alone accounts for about 7% of your irrelevant number.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2020-10-06 21:19:52 :

We were talking about Reddit as a whole, so yes you were ‘supposed’ to identify a mechanism for the site as a whole. Inasmuch as I have required you to do anything - you’re free to go and spend your time however you most enjoy and not worry yourself with me at all. 

Of course good debate is possible in some places on Reddit; that wasn’t a contention I was arguing against. The OP was lamenting the state of ‘Reddit’ the website. The scale of it, the variety of contributors, the different rules, the various motivations of contributors are my point. Again, of course within that some islands will exist.

Pillars-In-The-Trees @ 2020-10-07 02:34:57 :

&gt;We were talking about Reddit as a whole, so yes you were ‘supposed’ to identify a mechanism for the site as a whole

Which is what I did. Your total population figures have nothing to do with whether or not a viable system can be put in place.

&gt;The scale of it, the variety of contributors, the different rules, the various motivations of contributors are my point. Again, of course within that some islands will exist.

This isn't even a point. The same mechanism used by the moderators of /r/askscience could be used by the site as a whole. Once everyone realizes there could be a better alternative they may steer further in this direction.

The problem here is that your argument essentially hinges on the idea that and form of organization is impossible. I don't necessarily expect the refund admins to do this sort of thing, but they absolutely could exercise more control if they chose to.

No. Not that it’s impossible, I’ve just agreed that it’s *possible.* 

The point is that it can’t be expected as a feature of a site like Reddit. This is a different thing, and from the above comment you agree with it.

--------------------------------

At this point I've entirely lost what you're getting at then. The methods used by certain subreddits to control their user base can be used on a larger scale.

&gt;What you're saying is: ""this free-to-join, anonymous, socially-curated website isn't somehow producing prejudice-free and balanced facts and news for me""

&gt;Well, of course it's not. By what mechanism could it possibly do that?

I provided you with said mechanism, and your response was that it isn't a large enough fraction of reddit, which again means nothing.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2020-10-07 14:41:16 :

&gt; At this point I've entirely lost what you're getting at then 

That seems quite clear. Let me try to put this a little better.

1. The OP is lamenting the way reddit is 'turning into facebook' by way of misinformation, lack of balance and the existence of bias
2. My point - the entire point I'm making - is that this is a feature we should expect of a website that is like reddit. I've already outlined the major features

Your point is that some parts of reddit do have good discussions and factual content. Which is true, and fine. In the same way as a stopped clock is right twice a day, and sometimes you bump into pleasant people in the street. This happens.

My issue is that the OP's expectation, that such a website should be like this \*as default\*, is mistaken. The features of the subreddits you're referring to rely upon moderators and administrators setting up specifically to create a forum wherein those discussions happen. Most of reddit doesn't have those administrators and moderators, substantially because \*many people wish to use the website differently.\* 

So, that's kind of it. I suspect you agree with me, but you're arguing against some point I'm not making. And - frankly - your tone is coming off as weirdly angry and a little hostile and I've no idea why. Maybe it's how I'm receiving it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I provided you with said mechanism, and your response was that it isn't a large enough fraction of reddit, which again means nothing 

Hopefully I've explained this in the comment above. I await your judgement on whether it still 'means nothing' with bated breath and nervous excitement.

--------------------------------

Pillars-In-The-Trees @ 2020-10-07 15:19:12 :

&gt;Your point is that some parts of reddit do have good discussions and factual content.

My point is that they have a mechanism in place to do such a thing. My point could just as easily have been made using another website or online resource. Wikipedia for example is a website that's considerably more populous than reddit and seems to also have such a mechanism.

&gt;In the same way as a stopped clock is right twice a day, and sometimes you bump into pleasant people in the street. This happens.

Again I'm trying to point out the *reliable mechanism* for attaining this environment, which is what you asked for.

&gt;The features of the subreddits you're referring to rely upon moderators and administrators setting up specifically to create a forum wherein those discussions happen.

You mean like the exact way the site was created in the first place?

&gt;Most of reddit doesn't have those administrators and moderators, substantially because \*many people wish to use the website differently.\* 

Actually it's because the previously mentioned sitewide administrators choose for it to be this way.

&gt;I suspect you agree with me, but you're arguing against some point I'm not making.

I don't think I do agree with you, and this started because I answered your direct inquiry for a mechanism that could be put in place, if the issue is scale and anonymity, I refer you to Wikipedia.

&gt; I await your judgement on whether it still 'means nothing' with bated breath and nervous excitement.

**YES.** Nothing about my point in any way relied on using a subreddit as an example. There's no possible meaningful data that can be extracted from comparing the population of my example to the population of reddit as a whole because the only thing that actually matters is the *mechanism that is in place*.

Reddit was designed to be the way it is, and if the administration chose to do so they could influence it in any number of ways.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2020-10-07 15:27:54 :

Wikipedia's a great example. The purpose of Wikipedia isn't social, it's informational. The purpose of Reddit isn't informational, it's social. That's an important difference.

Why is this important? Because people, when engaging socially, aren't always concerned about balance and bias and accuracy. And so the spaces that they create and curate for that purpose can't **reliably be expected** to have those features.

Could Reddit have set itself up so that people who didn't want to have subreddits that were tilted in favour of whatever view they hold wouldn't find that need served here? Yes, of course they could. But, then it wouldn't be a  ""free-to-join, anonymous, socially-curated website"" it would be a ""free-to-join, anonymous, centrally controlled website."" And some other website - remember Digg for example? - would have served that need. 

And, again, some subs do have the feature of being balanced etc. because the users and moderators of those subs choose to curate their content and submissions in that way.

--------------------------------

Pillars-In-The-Trees @ 2020-10-07 16:59:02 :

&gt;The purpose of Wikipedia isn't social, it's informational. The purpose of Reddit isn't informational, it's social.

That's completely subjective.

&gt;Because people, when engaging socially, aren't always concerned about balance and bias and accuracy. And so the spaces that they create and curate for that purpose can't **reliably be expected** to have those features.

There's no logic whatsoever in this statement. You're completely circling around ""things are the way they are because their purpose is to be what they are and I've determined that purpose subjectively based on what they are""

&gt;Could Reddit have set itself up so that people who didn't want to have subreddits that were tilted in favour of whatever view they hold wouldn't find that need served here? Yes, of course they could. But, then it wouldn't be a  ""free-to-join, anonymous, socially-curated website"" it would be a ""free-to-join, anonymous, centrally controlled website."" And some other website - remember Digg for example? - would have served that need. 

Those terms aren't mutually exclusive, reddit *is* centrally controlled. They're incorporated and everything. Wikipedia is no more centrally controlled than reddit, the difference being that what's said on reddit didn't actually have to be true.

&gt;And, again, some subs do have the feature of being balanced etc. because the users and moderators of those subs choose to curate their content and submissions in that way.

So you're saying you agree with the headline?

You're completely dodging the fact that you asked for a mechanism here. If individual subreddits can do it (as well as other websites) then so can the website as a whole. The users of /r/askscience and /r/askhistorians complain all the time about the strict rules, it's the moderators and admins who control the space.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2020-10-07 17:30:52 :

&gt;	That's completely subjective.

It isn’t, really. One is an encyclopaedia.


&gt;	There's no logic whatsoever in this statement. You're completely circling around ""things are the way they are because their purpose is to be what they are and I've determined that purpose subjectively based on what they are""

Here is the logic. 
1.	People don’t always prioritise ‘balance’ in their social interactions. Many people seek like minded people to agree with them. 
2.	Social websites allow users to cultivate spaces and experiences that align with their social preferences 
3.	therefore, a social website like Reddit that allows user curated experiences cannot be relied upon to produce bias-free experiences to users 


&gt;	Those terms aren't mutually exclusive, reddit is centrally controlled. They're incorporated and everything. Wikipedia is no more centrally controlled than reddit, the difference being that what's said on reddit didn't actually have to be true.

I agree it’s a spectrum. Some things are more centrally controlled than others. The less central control, the more the experience is in the hands of the users. This really isn’t controversial.


&gt;	So you're saying you agree with the headline?

Sorry, what do you mean?


&gt;	You're completely dodging the fact that you asked for a mechanism here. If individual subreddits can do it (as well as other websites) then so can the website as a whole. The users of /r/askscience and /r/askhistorians complain all the time about the strict rules, it's the moderators and admins who control the space.

Here is the point of confusion, it appears. My ‘by what mechanism’ question was about how Reddit could maintain user control of their experience - ie. low central control - as well as free access and anonymity and reliably provide a bias free and balanced environment. My contention is that this is not something that will arise from this kind of website *reliably* and the existence of some subs where it happens is neither here nor there.

I’m getting tired of repeating the same points here. We may need to just accommodate ourselves to the idea that we don’t agree on this.

--------------------------------

Pillars-In-The-Trees @ 2020-10-07 18:08:56 :

&gt;It isn’t, really. One is an encyclopaedia.

What kind of dishonest tactic is this? I was referring to whether or not people participate in reddit as a social experience. It's a link aggregation platform, nothing more.

&gt;Here is the logic. 
1.	People don’t always prioritise ‘balance’ in their social interactions. Many people seek like minded people to agree with them. 
2.	Social websites allow users to cultivate spaces and experiences that align with their social preferences 

This has no bearing on the argument at hand. Not to mention the numerous assumptions you've made. Wikipedia is as much a social website as reddit.

&gt;3.therefore, a social website like Reddit that allows user curated experiences cannot be relied upon to produce bias-free experiences to users 

I refer you back to /r/askscience and Wikipedia.


&gt;I agree it’s a spectrum. Some things are more centrally controlled than others. The less central control, the more the experience is in the hands of the users. This really isn’t controversial.

Again you're just completely disregarding what I actually said and painting it as something else. Reddit and Wikipedia are equally centrally controlled, just with slightly different styles and goals.

&gt;Sorry, what do you mean?

You're saying that reddit is similar to Facebook and that because it is a 'social' website it must therefore contribute similarly to the spread of misinformation.

&gt;My ‘by what mechanism’ question was about how Reddit could maintain user control of their experience - ie. low central control - as well as free access and anonymity and reliably provide a bias free and balanced environment.

Which again, I've provided examples for.

&gt;My contention is that this is not something that will arise from this kind of website *reliably* and the existence of some subs where it happens is neither here nor there.

I honestly cannot understand how you're still stuck on this.

**My usage of /r/askscience and /r/askhistorians as examples has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not they are a part of reddit, and instead are merely proof that such mechanisms exist and function.**

 Whether or not this system spontaneously poofs into existence doesn't mean anything when there are sitewide administrators that centrally control the site, the exact same way as Wikipedia.

&gt;I’m getting tired of repeating the same points here.

Well then maybe you should stop and actually read my replies for half a second.

joopface @ 2020-10-07 18:26:19 :

&gt;	What kind of dishonest tactic is this?

I’ve already mentioned your tone. This is getting tiresome. If you want a discussion, discuss. Stop throwing this kind of crap around. 


&gt;	I was referring to whether or not people participate in reddit as a social experience. It's a link aggregation platform, nothing more.

I disagree. I suspect your view is a minority one, but regardless I think it’s incorrect.


&gt;	This has no bearing on the argument at hand. Not to mention the numerous assumptions you've made. Wikipedia is as much a social website as reddit.

It is literally the argument I’m making, so it does have bearing. If you don’t disagree with this, then you agree with me. 

We’ll just agree to disagree on Wikipedia and Reddit. I think they’re self evidently different.


&gt;	I refer you back to /r/askscience and Wikipedia.

I refer you back to the words ‘relied upon’


&gt;	Again you're just completely disregarding what I actually said and painting it as something else. Reddit and Wikipedia are equally centrally controlled, just with slightly different styles and goals.

They have vastly different styles and goals, and significantly different ways that people interact with them and the reasons why people interact. The means by which content is shown to people, for a basic example, is different. Wikipedia has no ‘feed’ no upvotes or downvotes, no awards, no comments on contributions (except for edit discussions). 


&gt;	You're saying that reddit is similar to Facebook and that because it is a 'social' website it must therefore contribute similarly to the spread of misinformation.

I’m saying Reddit is similar to Facebook in some ways yes. And I’m saying a website that is configured as this one is can’t be relied upon to be balanced and unbiased.


&gt;	I honestly cannot understand how you're still stuck on this.
My usage of /r/askscience and /r/askhistorians as examples has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not they are a part of reddit, and instead are merely proof that such mechanisms exist and function.

Those examples exist because the users and moderators of those subs want them to. Other subs don’t. This is the nature of user curated content. That’s why those examples don’t prove anything.


&gt;	Well then maybe you should stop and actually read my replies for half a second.

I suggest you stop and consider why you’re adopting this weirdly combative tone with me. You know nothing about me, I’ve said nothing aggressive or nasty to you. I simply hold an opinion with which you seem to disagree. What’s going on?

Every single thing I write you misinterpret and repackage to the point that I haven't been able to communicate anything. Since this is so consistent no matter how many times I reiterate a point or explain the same things again and again you've lost the benefit of the doubt.

&gt;I suspect your view is a minority one, but regardless I think it’s incorrect.

Your statement was subjective, mine was objective. There isn't something to disagree with. Plenty of people would say reddit is a social website, but objectively it's an open ended link aggregator with a voting system and comment section. That's all it actually represents in the real world, whether or not it's used socially is up to the user. Way more people lurk than actively participate.


&gt;We’ll just agree to disagree on Wikipedia and Reddit. I think they’re self evidently different.

This is what I mean about circular logic. You're observing behaviour on a specific platform and then categorizing that platform as 'social' to the exclusion of all others. The whole point of Wikipedia is to be open to user contribution and discussion, the difference being reliance on facts. If you want an example closer to Reddit, I already mentioned /r/askscience, but because you can't seem to divorce the mechanism by which the subreddit functions from the subreddit as a part of reddit as a whole I can't make any progress whatsoever in this discussion because you insist such a system cannot possibly exist on a sitewide level because we cannot expect it to just naturally occur without any action on the part of site administrators at all.

&gt;I’m saying Reddit is similar to Facebook in some ways yes. And I’m saying a website that is configured as this one is can’t be relied upon to be balanced and unbiased.

So you're arguing ""it is the way it is because that's the way things are?""

&gt;Those examples exist because the users and moderators of those subs want them to. Other subs don’t. This is the nature of user curated content. That’s why those examples don’t prove anything.

Case in point about the dishonest interpretations. You say Wikipedia is self evidently different, but when I give examples that more resemble Wikipedia you insist that a sample size of 20 million is irrelevant compared to the size of reddit. There's no possible example I could give even hypothetically to match your incredibly strict criteria of a ""mechanism.""

You're mocking my tone but how can you possibly expect me to advance this discussion when every time you respond to me you're arguing with a straw man that doesn't even resemble what I said at all.

I’ve basically been repeating the same thing in different ways. I haven’t intentionally misinterpreted anything you’ve written. If you find me to be a bad discussion partner, other options are available.

Again, I disagree. I don’t think your view of Reddit expressed here is an objective one. Reddit differs from Wikipedia in many ways, one of which is the social aspect.

&gt;	This is what I mean about circular logic. You're observing behaviour on a specific platform and then categorizing that platform as 'social' to the exclusion of all others.

We’re talking about a specific platform. So, yes, I have observed behaviour here and I’m categorising it on the basis of that behaviour. I don’t agree this is a bad thing to do. 

&gt;	The whole point of Wikipedia is to be open to user contribution and discussion, the difference being reliance on facts. 

The purpose of Wikipedia is to produce articles that are as accurate as possible. The purpose of Reddit is to provide people with content they enjoy. Are you seriously saying you can’t see the difference here? 


&gt;	If you want an example closer to Reddit, I already mentioned /r/askscience, but because you can't seem to divorce the mechanism by which the subreddit functions from the subreddit as a part of reddit as a whole I can't make any progress whatsoever in this discussion because you insist such a system cannot possibly exist on a sitewide level because we cannot expect it to just naturally occur without any action on the part of site administrators at all.

You’re missing the point of my disagreement. Those subreddits are that way because that’s how the users like them. Other places - with different user bases - operate differently. 


&gt;	So you're arguing ""it is the way it is because that's the way things are?""

My original argument was that the OP’s expectations were misguided.


&gt;	Case in point about the dishonest interpretations. You say Wikipedia is self evidently different, but when I give examples that more resemble Wikipedia you insist that a sample size of 20 million is irrelevant compared to the size of reddit. There's no possible example I could give even hypothetically to match your incredibly strict criteria of a ""mechanism.""

I’ve explained my point several times now. I make no claim for it to be complex or unique. It doesn’t rely on the number of users - I mentioned *that* to show your subreddit examples weren’t representative of Reddit as a whole. 


&gt;You're mocking my tone but how can you possibly expect me to advance this discussion when every time you respond to me you're arguing with a straw man that doesn't even resemble what I said at all.

I didn’t mock your tone. I queried why you were allowing yourself to get so annoyed by this fairly basic discussion. I’ve made no strawman - I even laid my argument out in standard form for you. 

And I don’t ‘expect’ you to do anything. I’d be perfectly happy for you to go away and to never interact with you again. I’m entirely indifferent to you, except for the oddly aggressive tone you occasionally can’t help dipping into.

Oh, I thought you were the ones making the ridiculous argument that what ""holiday"" means is that every one should stay home for a day! Isn't htis what you are saying? Let me quote myself from another message above:

""It is obvious to everyone that there are essential workers that must work also on holidays, whether it's Independence Day, Christmas or what have you. OP's point is clearly not about those people, why do you keep asking about them? Talk about bad faith.""

&gt;You're only thinking of the things you directly interact with on a daily basis. I've worked through countless holidays over the years for absolutely essential reasons.

Yeah, that's what I said, see above. It is **obvious**, that there will be essential workers, which is how they are called, that must work during holidays,. This is true for every holiday, not just the proposed Voting Day. So you may now stop arguing this point.

The point is about everyone that is not an essential worker, you know, the majority of us. People that during a national holiday actually don't have to work. What is your argument for not making it easier for those people to vote?

&gt;As many people have discussed in this very chain, mandating early voting in all states would essentially accomplish this and more. Allowing people to vote when they want over a period of time would allow them to vote on their day off

Everyone also agrees, I hope, that early voting is a good thing, so again, what point are you addressing? The point is that, in the United States there is an official day for voting. And the point is that as of 2020, most people exercise their most basic democratic right on Election Day. Let me put it in a different way: what is there to lose by making Election Day a holiday? Potentially you gain a more democratic process by increasing turnout, what do you lose exactly that is more important than more democracy?"	1	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]	"waterbuffalo750 @ 2020-10-13 19:47:49 :

1. We can't automatically know where people live. Your exact address determines your districts, precincts, etc. You might vote at a different polling place and vote a different ballot than someone who lives across the street from you. People need to register themselves with accurate, updated information to make sure they get the correct ballot

2. Most places have early or mail-in voting. Polling places are open for 12 hours or more. These two ideas should already accommodate almost everyone. A holiday, however, leaves a lot of people out. The people who get holidays off are the same people that have time and access to polls before or after work. 

3. Depends on where you live. A lot of places have plenty of polling locations. Any time I've voted, I've never had a significant wait. I do agree with this point in the few places it's relevant.

Guccinoko @ 2020-10-13 19:55:01 :

I'm unsure as to how that refutes my point. Would they not do that under my system?

&gt; Most places have early or mail-in voting. Polling places are open for 12 hours or more. These two ideas should already accommodate almost everyone.

Justify to me why there should be *any* barriers to voting in person. Mail-in voting is important and so is early voting, but why not *also* make it easier to vote in person? Moreover, what if someone works during those 12 hours?

&gt;  A holiday, however, leaves a lot of people out.

How?

&gt; Depends on where you live.

Some jobs will have to stay open, like hospital workers, but you can still have a holiday. Those people would've been working anyway, so I fail to see your point here. A lot more people would be able to vote this way.

As long as their vote is being counted, why does it matter? And most states require that employees can leave work to go vote, so if they really don't want to vote absentee, they can currently go vote

You say ""a lot more people,"" but my point is that I think it would be a very small number of people that would be helped by this. Like I said before, people who get holidays off already have time available. And those who don't have time available still have means to vote.

Guccinoko @ 2020-10-13 20:13:24 :

It happens when they turn 18, not prior to an election, and they make it mandatory.

&gt; As long as their vote is being counted, why does it matter?

*Because maybe that barrier makes it so that they don't get to vote*.

&gt; And most states

Most isn't all though, that's sort of my whole point.

&gt; You say ""a lot more people,"" but my point is that I think it would be a very small number of people that would be helped by this. Like I said before, people who get holidays off already have time available.

I vehemently disagree. I think there are lots of people that work during voting day who don't go either because they literally don't have time, or because they only have an hour before or after work where they could go and they decide that they're too tired. They shouldn't have to exhaust themselves to vote.

I really don't like this attitude honestly. Trying to stay polite here, but if someone's only path to voting in person is after a 10 hour shift where they have to drive directly from work to the polling place, there's something wrong with that.

abooth43 @ 2020-10-13 23:10:27 :

&gt;if someone's only path to voting in person is after a 10 hour shift where they have to drive directly from work to the polling place,

The person you're replying to, and many others, have already discussed that this isn't most people's only option and agree that the few outstanding states should change to allow early voting so anyone can vote on **their** day off. 


&gt;I see absolutely no reason why they shouldn't be given the day off, and you haven't provided a good one

The healthcare industry needs to stay available. 

Police officers and firefighters. 

Someone needs to drive the public transportation, right? Voters need to get to the polls. 

Many utilities require monitoring and emergency maintenance. Gas leak? That needs to be taken care of ASAP, no time to call around to all the guys that live an hour+ away and mightve already hit the booze by now. 

A huge chain of critical supply runs on &lt;24 windows regularly. The fastners distributor I worked at in college had contracts with major energy and defense companies that would regularly need things delivered within 12 hours to maintain critical operations. Paying couriers big dollars to drive a few states over because no shipping company could be quick enough. 

The list goes on. The country cannot actually stand still for a day, it's just not feasible. 

And there's no reason for it. I don't **want** a forced day off to vote. I have plenty of time to do it, employers are required to give time in my state, and that should absolutely be mandated nationwide in my opinion. But it's simply not feasible or nessecarily to freeze the country.

Conductive response to the point at hand. Not everyone needs, wants, or can afford another day off. (Of course, this shouldn't be the case, but that's another CMV) Most everyone responding to OP in this thread seems to agree that employers should be required to allow time off for voting in every state. I'd even go so far to agree that they employers must **let** anyone take the day off. But by no means do we need to mandate that every single person stay home for a day to vote. 

&gt;Huh? It is very feasible. The country is ""frozen"" (not really) in every, well, holiday, lol.

No, it's really not. You're only thinking of the things you directly interact with on a daily basis. I've worked through countless holidays over the years for absolutely essential reasons. 

Some years it was plowing snow. Snowstorms happen on Christmas and Thanksgiving. Snowstorms don't prevent fires or medical emergencies. Services need to use the roads, so a large number of people need to be working to keep roads safe. 

Sure restaurants can close. People can plan around walmart closing. But I could sit here for hours and list components of industries that simply cannot stand still.

 Not to mention the even wider range of industries where the impact simply wouldn't make sense when there are far easier alternatives that accomplish the same end results. 


&gt; here is an idea, let's vote on Sundays like every other country in the world.

As many people have discussed in this very chain, mandating early voting in all states would essentially accomplish this and more without the countless implications to our lives and businesses that come with a standstill. Allowing people to vote when they want over a period of time would allow them to vote on their day off - be it a weekday or weekend."	"abooth43 @ 2020-10-14 00:12:37 :

&gt;OP's point is clearly not about those people

That was my impression from the post, but reading through the replies I'm not so sure. 

They specifically used a nurse working on election day as an argument. That's an **obvious** essential healthcare worker. 

I'm not here refuting that it should be made easier to vote. As I said, I think employers should be required to **allow** a day off if requested.

Additionally I believe in person early voting should be mandated everywhere. Honestly, there is no reason to require everyone to vote on one single day. It is a much simpler task to expand voting options across a range of time and variety of methods than it is to require a shutdown. 

OP has multiple times in this thread said that this would not be enough and suggested issuing fines to companies that remained open. It's simply excessive, there are easier means to the same end.

Sure call it a holiday, but treat it like other holidays - where companies pay overtime to keep essential employees instead of mandating a shutdown and fining businesses that stay open.

Ok. I may have also jumped to defend OP without being clear of his/her point. Requiring absolutely everyone to have a day off, including people like nurses, is just absurd.

The problem with requiring employers to allow for a day off, without making the day in question a holiday is that employers can surreptitiously punish those who do take the day off, or put benefits in place for those who don't take it. Regarding Election Day, if it is going to be kept on a Tuesday, it is important for the employer not to be allowed to expect people to show up.

Honestly, the best solution is simply to shift election day to a weekend. This is how is done everywhere else and that way, there is no need to invent a new holiday or whatever. As I am sure you know, voting day on Tuesdays is a relic from the agrarian past of the United States that doesn't make any sense in the 21st century:

[https://www.history.com/news/why-is-election-day-a-tuesday-in-november](https://www.history.com/news/why-is-election-day-a-tuesday-in-november)

I have nothing against everything you suggest regarding early voting. However,  Election Day is a necessity, there must be a specific date beyond which  people can't vote anymore and votes may start being counted.

--------------------------------

abooth43 @ 2020-10-14 00:55:36 :

Seems were entirely on the same page, just a mixup. 

I'm not against calling it a holiday, in the sense that it's treated like any other holiday.  Businesses don't get fined for opening on New Years day, but they're largely required to compensate for such in wages. 

I think much should be the case with election day, provided those that are compensated to work also have opportunities like early voting. 

&gt;However, Election Day is a necessity, there must be a specific date beyond which people can't vote anymore and votes may start being counted.

By a time range I didn't mean to imply open ended voting, there definitely needs to be an end date. I just don't see why we can't call it election week or election month and have in person polls open for multiple days. Tradition and all, but I'd expect  election day tradition would be easier to break than pushing a designated holiday. 

Then there is no pressure for everyone to get off at the same time. Employers can schedule with their employees for times/days to take off to go vote. Much like my place of work was scheduling rolling covid testing so we didn't have to shut down during the day and all go at the same time.

Glad were mostly on the same page though, most of my bone to pick was with the specifics of OPs point.

Have a nice one!"

So you believe black people have a predisposition to be criminals, and that's not a result of other factors like racism among cops, income inequality, or education?

More crimes might be committed by black people, but not because they are black people.  It's because many black people live in impoverished communities, are unfairly targeted by racist police policies like stop and frisk, and are otherwise disadvantaged in a variety of ways.

To directly contradict your point, we see articles about 'affluenza' on a regular basis.  Rich people get away with murder all the time.  

Also, arrests aren't convictions.

--------------------------------

Gotchawander @ 2020-10-18 20:46:29 :

No all I am saying is that black people commit more crimes on average, I am not saying why they do it, that could be for a variety of reasons.

But until we at least agree on basic facts, it's hard to come up with solutions.

--------------------------------

Telewyn @ 2020-10-18 20:56:00 :

Final solutions?

You are saying why.  You’re saying it’s not because police target black people over other groups.  

But police demonstrably have active policies that are indisputably racist in implementation.

As a result, black crimes are over reported.

--------------------------------

Gotchawander @ 2020-10-18 20:59:26 :

So are you saying the disparity in crime rates is all due to black crimes being over reported and in reality whites/Asians are also commiting crimes 70% of crimes like murders but they just aren't being reported? Or are you saying the police are fabricating crimes? Because those are the only ways to rebalance the crime rates

--------------------------------

Telewyn @ 2020-10-18 21:24:32 :

Im saying that drawing lines based on race is not revealing the underlying reason behind crime rates.

White crimes are underreported.  This is not a controversial statement.

Black people are framed by police or face trumped up charges due to systemic and personal racism.  This is also not a controversial statement.

You can’t say “black people are more likely to commit crimes” and then base any kind of policy on that, because the crimes aren’t committed because they are black.

Crimes are committed due to a host of social, economic and personal factors, race enters only as a correlation.

--------------------------------

Gotchawander @ 2020-10-18 21:34:42 :

Well I think we need to at least acknowledge that black people are more likely to commit crimes in America for a variety of reasons (which i don't think we disagree on). 

Then once we accept that fact, we can dedicate more resources on finding out why this is and stopping it. But if we never acknowledge this reality why would we target any resources towards this issue in paticular?

--------------------------------

Telewyn @ 2020-10-18 21:40:30 :

&gt;	Well I think we need to at least acknowledge that black people are more likely to commit crimes in America for a variety of reasons (which i don’t think we disagree on).

No.  There is a difference between “black people are more likely to commit crimes” and “more crimes are reportedly committed by people who happen to be black”

People do not commit crimes because they are black any more than people commit crimes because they are gay, or because they have birthmarks, or because they were born on a Tuesday.

--------------------------------

Gotchawander @ 2020-10-18 21:53:57 :

Lets just agree to disagree then because I fundamentally disagree with your first sentence.

“more crimes are reportedly committed by people who happen to be black” that is not a true statement, white people commit more crimes in aggregate than black people, it does not good when you try to hide behind weasel words like that.

All we need to acknowledge is that based on reported crimes, for any given black person, it is more likely that he will commit a crime than any other given non-black person.

--------------------------------

Telewyn @ 2020-10-18 22:17:01 :

No, you have some kind of fundamental misconception about the statistics you’re quoting.

Or you’re just arguing in bad faith and trying to be edgy.

It is absolutely wrong to say that
&gt;	based on reported crimes, for any given black person, it is more likely that he will commit a crime than any other given non-black person.

Because any given individual does not commit crimes due to their race.

You might as well say “for any given person wearing a balaclava in a bank, it is more likely he will commit a crime than any given person in a bank not wearing a balaclava”

Sure, it’s true, but did the person rob the bank because they are wearing the mask?  No.

Can you ban masks in banks?  Maybe.  You choose to wear a mask.

Can you ban black people from banks because any given black person is statistically correlated to more likely be a criminal?  No.  Because it’s just a correlation, being black has no bearing on whether you as an individual are a criminal."	"Telewyn @ 2020-10-18 22:42:16 :

But you are saying that.  You are trying to wield this statistic like it means a black individual is more likely to commit a crime.

But people don’t commit crimes because they are black.

So that’s not valid conclusion to draw.

The only thing this stat measures is racial inequality.

--------------------------------

Gotchawander @ 2020-10-18 22:45:38 :

Again black people are more likely to commit a crime.  I am not saying they commit the crime because they are black. 

Its like saying men are more likely to commit a crime then women, that does not mean people commit crimes because they are men. Men commit crimes and women commit crimes. Just like how black people commit crimes and white people commit crimes. Do we now say there is gender inequality in policing? No, all we are saying is that the average man is more likey to commit a crime than the average woman.

--------------------------------

Telewyn @ 2020-10-18 23:05:32 :

We do say there is gender inequality in policing, though.

Again, it’s not useful or correct to say black people are more likely to commit crime, because people don’t commit crimes because they are black.

It is correct to say a crime is more likely to be committed by a person who happens to be black, because grammatically, that has a different meaning.

In your example, saying men are more likely to murder than women does imply that people murder because they are men and not women.

It is more correct to say that a murder is more likely to be committed by a man than a woman, because the murder is the subject of the sentence, rather than the gender.

--------------------------------

purpl101 @ 2020-10-20 00:29:33 :

1. Black people more likely to commit crime

2. Crime more likely to be committed by black people

You're just shuffling the the words around, grammatically they are one in the same, the way you word it in the second one is just a ""nicer"", more politically correct way to say it. I don't think you get it. The statement that black people are more likely to commit a crime does not hold the answer inside of itself. Here's an example; lets say, for the sake of the example, one in fifteen kids are born with asthma. Pretending that I didn't pull that statistic out of my ass, would you say that the reason the kid who got asthma got it because he was ""one out of fifteen""? No, that's stupid. A lung disease doesn't originate out of us counting numbers. To claim that saying black people are more likely to commit crime is not in anyway coming to the conclusion that people commit crime because of the amount of melanin they possess and it is a completely silly, textbook logical fallacy if I have ever seen one.

Telewyn @ 2020-10-20 03:47:38 :

A fetus might not be called a human being because there's no heartbeat, or because there's no pain receptors, or later in pregnancy they're still not a human because they're still not self-sufficient, etc. I am not concerned with the **true answer** to this argument because there isn't one - it's philosophy along the lines of personal identity. Philosophy is unfalsifiable and unprovable logic, so there is no scientifically precise answer to when a fetus becomes a person.

Having said that, the mother then deserves a large degree of freedom, being the person to actually carry the fetus. Arguing over the philosophy of when a human life starts is just a distracting talking point because whether or not a fetus is a person, the mother still has to endure pregnancy. It's her burden, thus it should be a no-brainer to grant her the freedom to choose the fate of her ambiguously human offspring.

First off, I apologize for my mistake in misinterpreting your point. Before I say anything though I must admit I'm a little bit confused with your second paragraph in your reply to me. Maybe I’m misreading it but I'm not entirely sure what you mean when you say you hoped I would be worth responding to but also apparently not, as this is our first interaction...either or, I have to say that you are absolutely incorrectly reading my response and my intentions. My own virtues and qualifications are nothing to brag about, to be honest, they're probably better to be talked about as little as possible. It was just a blunder on my part. I didn't realize that I incorrectly interpreted your point, but it was really fun tearing into that man of grain while I had the chance. I apologize again, that was incompetence and maybe even laziness on my own part which would be embarrassing to some, but again, no real qualifications on my end here so just a daily dose of personal bashfulness for me. 

I didn't see your point the other day when I replied, and thought you were essentially dismantling the whole view based on a technicality - hence the example I gave. It's really frustrating to me when that happens and I sometimes see ""qualified"" philosophers or people talking on a big stage who will do this sort of thing where they dodge the larger points of a discussion by focusing in on a minor part, discrediting it in a frivolous manner which ends up turning the whole conversation into a circle that goes nowhere and is just a waste of everybody’s time. I realize now your valid point though. I see where you're coming from, the moral discussion can’t be completely ignored and as much as science can aid us in life and the discussion of morals; science itself does not act as a substitute for them in any and all regards. And I definitely support the delta now that I catch your meaning, I never ended up finishing my reply to OP about that anyway and luckily saved some face there. I also enjoy OP's additional response in their delta-award comment and would wonder what you have to say to that.  

My own take is speaking as an American citizen and projecting about The United States’ system (if you are in a different country, I apologize if my commentary here isn’t very relevant then): if people are going to be telling other people what they can or can’t do in a democratic republic whose Constitution defines, glorifies, and protects individual freedom with a supposed sacredness for ‘basic human rights’, then public laws that apply to all the citizens and dictate or restrict everybody’s individual lives and actions should be created in deference to these ideals. Any really that should be entirely unnecessary to say, however I find it disturbingly compelling to spell out. This idea of how to make legislation though, coupled with the fact that it is indeed necessary to consider morals when regarding abortion, makes things a little tricky when it comes to figuring out how exactly the law should be written. Religion has been the main source of moral guidance in humankind since forever. Nowadays though, religion holds much less influence over people, their actions, and their minds. Now, I’m not very fluent nor the best person to be claiming these types of things, but I think it’s at least pretty apparent that this is a factual statement just by knowing a little about history. For one, speaking generally, actually-regarded science (study, endeavors, theories, laws, and innovation - all based on the same **scientific method**) has totally upended the story of creation as specifically detailed in Genesis, the opening story o The Old Testament in the King James translation of the Christian Bible (the majority religion and it’s specific, corresponding divine text in the U.S., of course), and in doing so has deterred more and more people from devoutly following the religion. More specifically I think it can be pretty easily discerned that during the time when The Unites States of America was being forged and founded, it’s obvious that religion had a much stronger place and in a larger majority of people’s lives than our current year, 2020. I would say even in the 1940s and 1950s this was still true; a huge justification for the Allies’ war against the Axis powers of the world (among other more pragmatic, geopolitical, and worldly circumstances) was a sense of moral obligation to stop a real force of **evil**, a sense that became even stronger and more apparent after the true ramifications of the Holocaust came to light. So then, how does a group of people influenced and opinionated by differing religions discuss and consider morals together in order to craft good social laws that will govern and preponderate over EVERYONE’S individual and so-called ‘free’ lives? 

At this point, I’m tempted to go even more into a discussion just on morals and religion in general and how they affect and impact individuals, society, and civilizations; but I’ll try to stay more on course about just how I think the United States should approach making laws around abortion. When u/123987hello spoke about the moral side and conversation about abortion, ""I am not concerned with the **true answer** to this argument because there isn't one - it's philosophy along the lines of personal identity. Philosophy is unfalsifiable and unprovable logic, so there is no scientifically precise answer to when a fetus becomes a person.”, I liked where he was coming from. Relying entirely on morals, especially based on someone’s own personal religion of choice, is a terrible way to make a stance when attempting to convince a huge group of other, diverse people how to shape a governmental law that affects everyone as a whole because the **true answer** will be different depending on the individuals being talked to. So some people might have to adhere to someone else’s religion-induced morals even if it’s at odds with their own. However you also deftly pointed out that u/123987hello’s point here isn’t great either because science lacks in telling us specifically why we should have a regard for other life, but we still *need* to have that conversation. For example, science also cannot tell somebody WHY they shouldn’t go around murdering people. There is a reason that philosophy exists, why morals are important, and why we *shouldn’t* escape them in this discussion - whether people want to believe that or not (which I think is a better example to make that point relating to this context, your example that science can’t explain what makes any person a person at all even out of the womb is what threw me off leading me to think you were just trying to derail the conversation entirely - which again, I’m sorry about). Essentially it feels like heated popular debates about abortion can run along the lines of one party saying “Well, religion explains all of this (ours specifically \*cough \*cough) so *that’s* how we should decide the law of the land regarding abortion - an act that eliminates another human life"", meanwhile another saying “No, no. Not everyone believes in religion or even in one religion, so why should that at all decide something that impacts everyone? What we need to use to craft this law is science. Science is universal.” However, u/123987hello also points out that science CANNOT give us a precise answer to when life begins. So while it’s the general narrative in the U.S. when crafting social laws - (and albeit this is sometimes fictional and used as propaganda even since the very creation of our national charters and founding documents) - that we, each, deserve the maximum amount of personal, individual freedom in respect to and so long as it doesn’t directly impact other individuals trying to also have that same amount of freedom; science cannot be used as a tool in this scenario to tell us when exactly we can start regarding an unborn human as fully deserving of basic human rights, nor can religion give us an answer unless the entire country follows and agrees upon the same religious philosophy.

Sorry, I mistook you for another commenter. The second paragraph has no bearing on you, and while the first one seems to have worked, I would’ve elaborated had I realised it was our first interaction. 

With explanations out of the way, I’m not from the US, but you do strike an interesting question, that I think is relevant in most modern democracies, namely how we should decide on laws concerning moral issues when there is a decreasing amount of common moral ground. 

Philosophy can in some ways provide a solution. While intuitions play a role in philosophy, there’s still plenty of analytical methods available within that do provide results. Moral philosophy isn’t my strong suit, but it can enlighten moral issues and prove some positions superior to others in certain regards, and more often applicable, the incoherence of separate beliefs. 

Regarding OP:s answer, I’m uncomfortable phrasing it in the sense of someone being more of a person. They might’ve been more successful if they had kept arguing the epistemological angle, that we can be more certain of one being a person than the other."

Two issues.

Firstly, people disagree on what gender means. So invoking arguments around gender will result in nothing more than a word game.

Secondly, there is no such thing as a *protected* male sports division.
There are sports and there are women's sport. 

The women's sports category exists to give women a chance to play sports professionally.

This whole mess can be solved simply by redefining ""women's sports"" from a protected gender category to a protected sex category. 

Thereby eliminating the loophole created by the slippy term ""gender"".

rainbow_rhythm @ 2020-12-14 14:41:16 :

I guess sex would seem a little arbitrary at this point. Why is that a category and not other genetic factors? Sort of like how boxing is divided by weight classes or height. Why not pitch women of certain genetic traits (the ones relevant to the sport anyway) against men with similar traits?

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2020-12-14 14:49:40 :

There is a full chromosome variance and about 6500 genes (roughly a third of our genetic material) behaving differently between the two human sexes.

So, no, sex is not an arbitary single genetic trait.

rainbow_rhythm @ 2020-12-14 15:10:31 :

Downvotes are not for disagreement.

I'm saying dependent on the sport, like there are many women who may be physically very similar to many men, so why not have more mixed tournaments based upon that? Otherwise you've got two categories (male and female) with wildly different actual physical traits within them.

I downvoting you because you're spreading misinformation by comparing sex to arbitrary genetic traits.

Our species is bimodal and pretending it isn't is disingenuous.

Also I'm saying sex is arbitrary to sport, not the genetic traits. The genetic traits are the important part, not the sex.

I literally gave you my reasoning behind saying that, and you've ignored it for a second time.

Not all of those traits will be a factor in performance dependent on the sport. That's why some sports like shooting, dressage, or snooker will be mixed.

&gt;No, biological males significantly outperform women in most sports.

You just repeated what I said. 

&gt;Stop arguing in bad faith.

To argue in bad faith I would have to have some sort of hidden agenda. 

My agenda is that I'm wondering what would the merits and pitfalls of having more mixed sports that are controlled not by sex but the traits that affect the sport, and that I would watch it. You're acting as if I'm some extreme gender-equality zealot, talking as if I'm an authority on the subject.

&gt;Because there are good reasons WITHOUT arguing the merits of the death penalty itself. I gave one.

And, as I have stated, I disagreed with them and required justification.  

Popular sovereignty alone is not a justification, as we DO set up limits on that very practice if we so choose.  Just because the 5th Amendment allows it now, does not mean that we should keep it so.  We set up limits to areas where the government would have too much power over the citizens, and affirm them again and again. 

The same theory I am speaking of, of course, could also apply to the repeal of rights.  For example: as we could disallow the Death Penalty via Amendment, we could do the same with Speech via Amendment.

Therefore, I hold that the fact that a law can or could exist does not justify its value.  The processes it enshrines, the purpose it holds, and the effects it has are the only thing worth arguing.

&gt;Abortion is one - or literally any other question related to individual morality. Once you leave objective ideas and hit subjective ideas, this happens.

I mean, I live in a state where abortion is legal.  I want it to remain so.  I don't just get to say ""it's legal now, convince me"" and not elaborate when someone asks ""why it should continue to be allowed.""  And, when they explain, I can't just say ""not convinced"" and move one.

What changed my mind? I realized that not everyone who receives a Death sentence was even guilty of any crime. I realized that because we are humans, that means our Justice system is extremely flawed and we should not have the right to determine someone's execution. 

Since 1973, there have been more than 170 people completely exonerated from all Death Sentence related charges. There have been approximately 18 people executed and later found to have likely been innocent. This information has been a huge determination factor in my current opinion. It's scary to think that we are killing people who are completely innocent in the name of ""justice"". This is enough information to throw away Capital Punishment.

I am pro-death penalty in principle but generally against it in practice. My arguments are very utilitarian - financial mostly. It just costs more to kill a person than it does to keep them locked up for life. I don't even have to address the questions of guilt here (which is also a problem)

Most people who are convicted and get the death penalty are run of the mill criminals who did something heinous. They frankly are not worth the extra cost to execute vs letting them rot in prison. There are occasional exceptions but they are listed below.

The death penalty is special for special types of criminals. The DC Sniper. Any Spree Killer (school/church/other). Any domestic terrorist like McVeigh. They *are* worth the extra cost to execute. Their acts are a special kind of heinous and deserving of a special kind of punishment. That punishment is as much about punishing the criminal as it is sending a message to others about how we deal with those actions in our society.

To the same extent, I would not remove the death penalty during war either. There are several classes of person during war who could face execution as per the Geneva Convention.

Wierd_Carissa @ 2020-12-14 14:56:08 :

&gt;That punishment is as much about punishing the criminal as it is sending a message to others about how we deal with those actions in our society.

We have plenty of empirical evidence that the deterrent effect of capital punishment is either small or nonexistent (it's an ongoing debate with plenty of data issues -- at the very least it's certainly ""unresolved). You may want to reevaluate this as one of the chief justifications for your claim.

in_cavediver @ 2020-12-14 14:59:01 :

Could you explain the distinction between “sending a message to others” and “deterrence” then, please?

--------------------------------

in_cavediver @ 2020-12-14 15:20:11 :

Sure.

In society - governmental actions have meaning. By taking this stance on these types of crimes, it is sending a message to everyone. It has an impact on everyone in that society. It is a societal response to attacks on that society. In simple terms, its an announcement to everyone - you do this type of thing and our society will kill you for it.

The fact that the government CAN create meaning through its actions does not mean that the meaning is good.  It is only through determining what happens next can be say whether it is good on principle.

So, if you could clarify:

1. What are the desired reactions in the public?  (Thoughts; Actions; ETC?)

The fact that exists does not morally mean it is good policy.  All human rights and allowances for cruelty have disagreements, and have at times not been equal in all places and all times.

Therefore, even the fact that it is popular doesn’t mean it should still exist.  Your argument rests on this principle, which is false.

You need to demonstrate that the symbol is useful, not that people like it.  Democracy and popular sovereignty itself is not justification for the death penalty.

No, but for a society/government to take an action, it cannot solely be because people want it.  It has to be because what action is taken will have an effect that is desired, and that the action is not overly unjust.

&gt;To take this as far as could be: slavery and genocide have at times been popular and/or what people want. BUT, they are immoral, and should not be allowed regardless.

You don't get that morality is not universal. It is defined by the majority of society at any given time. Your continued appeals to it are meaningless. It is 100% obvious that a large part of the US does not view capital punishment as immoral. Your personal claim does not change that fact.

Sure.  But the government cannot, for instance, ban all political speech.  Because we decided ""no matter how popular an idea may be, the government should not be allowed to do something.""

That's what we are discussing, whether the law should remain as it is now (allowing the death penalty) or whether it should be amended.

When the US Constitution was written, they decided and debated what constraints should be on various entities.  It didn't emerge fully formed, but rather was many different debates of which a compromise was struck and it was written as such.

We can always change the constitution, and thus we can always have debates as to what the constraints or laws SHOULD be.  Everyone needs to make their case, and then decisions can be raised.

You can have whatever view you like. What you don't get to do is claim the 'moral high ground' or claim 'morality dictates this'. I don't care if it abortion or capital punishment. 

There is a very clear mechanism to stop capital punishment. Actually a few paths. All you have to do is convince the majority of the constituents in each jurisdiction to do it. One is to simple abolish it as a penalty via law. (but subject to change later of course). The other is through a Constitutional amendment. (much harder to change later)

Some places have done this - others have not. 

&gt;If no good arguments can be made for a position, should it remain law? Certainly not. Therefore, make your case.

--------------------------------

in_cavediver @ 2020-12-16 15:21:31 :

The policy question is simple.

Do people feel the extra cost involved is justified in serving justice as they personally feel justice should exist for specific crimes.

If that answer is yes - then the death penalty very much serves the purpose those people intended. When it is used, it is following the will of the people. 

You don't have to agree but there is no doubt for a person who supports it, seeing it used for specific crimes is a message that government is following their desires for Justice in society. 

I am personally not interested in arguing about whether it should exist. That is not nor has it been the question. It does exist in US law and it is legal in US law for jurisdictions to use it.

The question was 'Is there a good reason for the US to still have the Death Penalty'. There very much is. Parts of our society in specific jurisdictions have kept, despite attempts to abolish, the death penalty. That is a very good reason to still have it. The democratic will of the people did not abolish it's use. They had  the opportunity but chose not to.

I see where our disconnect is. 

I have been defining ""good reason"" as demonstrative purpose/intent/need.  An affirmative statement as to why this should be the case.

You have been defining ""good reason"" as explanation for its existence, not a defined purpose.

Laws need a justification to exist, no?  Laws are not arbitrarily executed, they are decided because they have a purpose or an intended affect.

When, as you have pointed out, the 5th Amendment was ratified the people of that era saw a purpose for it.  Does that same purpose remain?  If it does not, then the law should be changed/amended.

The law is interesting because it is a set of ""statements of action.""  The law is not a rock on the side of the road, but the car driving on it.  Every moment you are driving the car you are continuously choosing to continue on a path.

""Why are we driving east?"" - A question of reasoning.

There is nothing required beyond this.

Unless, as we have been discussing, there are reasons for it to not exist.

When a politician advocates for a change in policy, it is still contingent on those who oppose that change to demonstrate WHY they oppose, no?

Take for instance, the Brexit debate.  Staying in the EU was ""not advocating for change"" but that side still had to demonstrate a reason why to not change.  Does that make sense?

A reason is purpose.  If a change it proposed base on objections to previous policy/law, then to defend having no change you actually have to defend it.

No, not really. You seem to want to force people to justify why they feel some way or have a specific opinion as if you can 'defeat' that position and force a change. That is not how it works. The onus is on people wanting change to convince people to support the change. Only if enough people support the change will it actually happen.

The onus is on people wanting change to convince people to support the change. Only if enough people support the change will it actually happen.

I cannot think of a single issue where a response of ""no, don't change it"" is enough of a point to refute an idea.  Even if that's their initial response, they still do get asked ""why?"" 

Like, I have argued that the Death Penalty should be abolished, as it has no good reason to exist, but you seem to just say ""no"" and argue that's good enough.  That's not a debate.  We are supposed to be having a debate.

Again, no matter which change is being proposed, if you oppose the change, you have an onus to demonstrate why you oppose. 

""I am not convinced"" is not a point being made.  Make a point.

Because there are good reasons *WITHOUT* arguing the merits of the death penalty itself. I gave one.

Abortion is one - or literally any other question related to individual morality. Once you leave objective ideas and hit subjective ideas, this happens.

A person is not obligated to engage with you just because you want to. They can support the status quo because they like the overall situation and consider change not worth it. 

So no, they are not obligated to do squat.

It is *always* on the group wanting change to justify it."	"in_cavediver @ 2020-12-16 20:23:17 :

&gt; And, as I have stated, I disagreed with them and required justification.

Just because you personally disagree does not change the fact they exist and are 'good arguments' for others.

Therein lies the problem. You can personally state you believe there is no good reason for the death penalty. What you cannot state is objectively, there is no good reasons. 

&gt;I mean, I live in a state where abortion is legal. I want it to remain so. I don't just get to say ""it's legal now, convince me""

Actually - that is exactly what happens. The status quo is established. It will not change unless there is explicit support to change it. 

If, and I mean if, there is significant groundswell to change policy, then people may engage. The problem is for a lot of issues, there is not significant groundswell of people clamouring for change. Therefore, there is no point. 

A case example - the National Interstate Popular Vote Compact. There is minor at best support for this in my state. Despite the vocal minority, there is no serious discussion about this *at all*. It has no chance in passing in my state. 

That is the reality of policy discussions. Unless you have enough support, nobody really cares. I would tell you capital punishment fits that category in my state now as well. There is not significant push to remove it so its a non-issue to talk about policy wise.

&gt;If, and I mean if, there is significant groundswell to change policy, then people may engage. The problem is for a lot of issues, there is not significant groundswell of people clamouring for change. Therefore, there is no point.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is the reality of policy discussions. Unless you have enough support, nobody really cares. I would tell you capital punishment fits that category in my state now as well. There is not significant push to remove it so its a non-issue to talk about policy wise.

So your argument is simply that there is not significant groundswell to outlaw it?  Certainly that some areas keep it and some do not mean that it is up for contention.

Also, would this not mean that people in two states (say, Vermont and Alabama) would have nothing to debate about at all, as their situations are wholly different? Certainly that's not so, as one person can always end up in another state.

Would you hold the same for all policy discussions, no matter the gravity?  I mean, for instance, student loan forgiveness and gun taxes are on the docket.  Even if *seems* to be unlikely, doesn't it still require reasoning?

--------------------------------

in_cavediver @ 2020-12-16 20:44:33 :

You don't get it.

You are pushing for the change - you have to provide the arguments. You don't get to be upset when people tell you ""Its already established this way, we like it, and we don't want to talk about it. Come back if you get enough people to actually have a shot at changing it""

As for your other topics - there *is* groundswell on both sides of the gun debate. Parts of this were in both parties presidential campaigns. Amazingly enough - there is almost no debate on guns in my state. Why - there is very little chance of significant changes being made. 

Student loan forgiveness - not likely to happen but there is a strong movement to do it. It was part of national election campaign. 

Tell me again about groundswell of support to remove capital punishment in different jurisdictions and how far that has gone?

There are tons of legislation introduced at the state and federal level has ZERO chance of ever passing. Do you thing all of those mandate people engage with the people proposing it? 

Sorry - no.

Honestly, yes.  Why even put a bill up or bring up a thought if there is no purpose in it?  All bills presented should get an active vote and discussion.

This might just be a matter of opinion then.  I prefer to hear out any level of discussion, including the hypothetical.  You can see my post history to see how many forums I speak in have little real-world effect, but are places to discuss policy ideas.

Many of these hypothetical and morals  start as small ideas, but then grow and grow.  Gay rights started small, and so did the Tea Party.

Ideas can and should be discussed on their merit, especially in politics.  At least, IMO.

No they shouldn't. These are virtue signalling by politicians. 

If there is no support, you don't waste your time dealing with it. All it takes is a simple majority vote to move one of these bills into consideration. If they cannot achieve this - they are dead in the water. 

You seem fairly ignorant of how legislatures and politicians actually work.

&gt;Many of these hypothetical and morals start as small ideas, but then grow and grow. Gay rights started small, and so did the Tea Party.

Sure - but you are preaching to the choir for the most part. People who disagree aren't giving you the time of day because *you don't matter right now*."

Case in point: as we've had this discussion you've downvoted every single one of my comments but I haven't downvoted yours. Why? Because downvoting indicates you aren't open to discussion, instead of listening to understand you're just arguing. Stop arguing and start discussing things. I can't imagine what you'd be like having this discussion in real life. I picture you getting angry, forceful and loud which would just lead to me walking away.	0	0	stop arguing comment					"**UPDATE**

Hey, I hope this is allowed, but I wanted to clarify some things if that's okay!

First of all I want to thank all of you for your responses. 99% of you were  really patient and not mean at all, which I really appreciate.

A question I've been asked frequently is ""Have you ever been attracted to at least one?"" and my answer is an honest no.

After many of your comments, I've decided to look inside myself more. I believe 2 of you (maybe more, I'm sorry if I'm wrong!) suggested that maybe this has come from a bad upbringing with my father or other black men, and I've come to the conclusion that I think that may be the case.

While I fortunately have an excellent relationship with both of my parents, I *did* have a traumatic event involving black men. Two of them had stalked me. Now, at first I didn't want to say this could be the case. Because I'm also a CSA trafficking survivor, and the person who did that to me was white and I haven't lost my attraction to white men. And I was also raped on a separate occasion by a Hispanic man, and that hasn't changed my attraction to them, either. Both of those things are infinitely worse than being stalked, even though it doesn't invalidate how violated I felt. But maybe the stalking situation hurt me more somehow. Maybe somewhere inside myself I felt betrayed because they're the same race as me, and I grew up being taught that we're supposed to stick together and that black men are supposed to care for their women. My parents always warned me about white men. They never told me that a black man would be capable of hurting me. That's not their fault, but just something I realized and maybe that affected me as well.

I think that ultimately, even before what happened to me, I hadn't *yet* found a black guy I was personally attracted to, but I wasn't closed off to the idea that it would happen. But maybe that traumatic event affected me more than I realized and shattered the chances of that happening for whatever reason.

Anyway, I know how horrible and hypocritical this probably all sounds, but I hope everyone understands me more. I am still open to continuing the discussion!

*Also if I haven't replied to anyone, please don't worry because I will! I'll be going through all of the comments again today, awarding deltas, and responding to anyone I haven't yet. These are a LOT more comments that I'm used to and a little harder than I thought*

**END OF UPDATE**

This just popped into my head recently, but it's something that's been in the back of my mind for a while. If it matters/for context, I am a black woman and I am not attracted to black men and can't see myself ever being with one. I have a preference for white and hispanic men. It isn't something I actively chose and I didn't just wake up one day and say ""Hmm, I think I'll decide to only like white men from now on!"" 

However, I know that there's this whole thing about how it's racist to either not like someone because of their race *or* to be attracted to someone because of their race, because then it's ""fetishizing""! However, this same logic doesn't seem to apply to the LGBT community. Meaning that the general consensus is that you can't choose which gender you're attracted to. If that's the case, how is it not that you just can't choose who you're attracted to *period*?

Now, I may be coming across as an ignorant asshole here, but I truly don't really understand why this is so. If it's racist for me to not be attracted to guys of my own race (or others), why is it then not ""sexist"" if I was only attracted to the same gender? I really don't think that anyone can choose who they're attracted to, so I don't see why or how it can be construed as racist when being a racist is typically a conscious effort. I don't think any one race is superior to another. I'm not antagonistic towards people of a certain race. But I have been called racist and a race traitor several times because of my preferences."	"flawednoodles @ 2020-12-17 18:34:49 :

I think what people have an issue is that

1. For someone to actively just say they could never see themselves with any person of any ethnic or racial background seems a little weird. There are literally billions of people on the earth but for some reason you exclusively choose one ethnicity or racial group to exclude? You’re right, it is a preference, but it’s a very specific preference that’s just kind of a little weird. Because you are actively choosing not to partake in a relationship with another human being solely for some really arbitrary fact they literally cannot help.
 
i. e. Can you actually explain why it is you could never see yourself with a black man? Is there like an actual reason, or do you just not find Black men particularly attractive? If you don’t find black men particular attractive, that’s one thing, but to state you can never see yourself with a black man is kind of weird considering there are literally like thousands upon hundreds of black men you’ve never seen in person, i’ve never formally met, never had the chance to create a romantic connection, it just seems kind of bold to claim you could  never see yourself with a black man for some arbitrary reason outside of you don’t find them attractive. Which is a very large generalization for a very large subsection of people.

2. You can have a preference, yes, but it’s also fair to acknowledge that sometimes preferences are rooted in really negative connotations about a particular group of people.

Right, like it’s not inherently racist you’re right. But it also can actively be problematic.

--------------------------------

smallframedfairy @ 2020-12-17 18:39:14 :

I can't, shouldn't, and won't be in a relationship with someone that I'm not physically attracted to. That's why I say I could never see myself with one. No, they can't help it, but I'm not punishing them for it, just choosing not to date them (which is my right). Sorry in advance if this comes off as a little rude or haughty, I don't mean to be!

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-17 23:01:56 :

How could not be attracted to any out of the billions of black people, unless what you are unattracted to is literally just their black skin?

benjm88 @ 2020-12-17 23:12:36 :

OP is black it really isn't racism. Plus never said would never date a black man. People are allowed to have preferences

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 01:35:40 :

Let me ask you this then because I think you have expanded the meaning of racism.

If I said I would never date trans women in your personal opinion does that make me transphobic?

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 01:41:22 :

I’m not.

Yup. If you need a partner with specific genitals you are attracted to thats fine. But that’s entirely separate from being trans especially because of surgery

--------------------------------

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 01:46:56 :

I'm sorry but you are just wrong.

The fact that you fell right into my trap proves that.

On one line you say you aren't expanding the definition of racism but them in the second you do expand the definition of transphobic.

&gt;having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people.

I have no dislike or prejudice against trans people. But I don't want to date one, that doesn't make me transphobic, it's merely a preference. If I fell in love with a transwoman and later found out she was trans that's a totally different thing.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 01:48:27 :

Nope.

You didn’t lay a trap. You just think you had a point but you didn’t.

That’s a prejudice dummie.

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 01:53:09 :

No it's not. You are sounding like someone who drank too much ""woke"" coolaid and has moved to a wokeism extreme mindset.

One more question then. Can you admit you are a little racist but consciously aware enough of your own racism to overcome it?

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 01:56:50 :

It is. No it’s not isn’t an argument. You sound like someone who parrots buzzwords you don’t even understand.

Woke basically means you start to understand and see the hidden problems in society. Overly wokevis when you take it too far and start to see problems where they don't exist.

As for the second part. All I was saying is that sometimes less is more. I never asked about ""everybody"", I asked about you.

In OPs situation it could simply be that she grew up going to predominantly white and Hispanic schools and learnt a preference based on her peers.

I myself don't typically find Chinese women attractive, but it's weird because if they grew up speaking Emglish as they primary language then I do often find them attractive (when if I've never heard them speak).

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 02:22:58 :

I’m not seeing problems where they don’t exist. Sorry.

Dang if you took your own advice you could have just said to me, “I don’t actually have a point but I like to hear myself talk”

Yeah that’s likely... as is the case for most racists...

Yikes keep that fucking weird ass prejudice to yourself

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 02:30:16 :

&gt;Yikes keep that fucking weird ass prejudice to yourself

See there you go again. You're calling g people racist or prejudiced but you're expanding the meaning of the words due to your ""wokeness""


&gt;prejudice

&gt;an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason.

I already said I am sometimes attracted to Chinese women, I just happened do realize why it's typically when English is their first language. What language you speak activates activates different muscles in your face and slightly changes how your face looks. I'm deaf and most of what I ""hear"" comes from lip reading, and facial expressions. A native Chinese speaker to me looks ""harsh"" but Chinese person who grew up speaking English looks ever so slightly less harsh due the the difference in facial muscles used.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 02:34:07 :

I have not expanded the meaning of any word. Sorry. That’s prejudice

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 02:50:03 :

You’ve embarrassed yourself enough at this point

Note: you never explained __how__ I was being prejudiced you just stated that I was.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 03:03:40 :

Yup.

Because you have a preconceived notion of Chinese people based on complete nonsense.

--------------------------------

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 03:07:46 :

No.

I explained it to you.

&gt;based on complete nonsense.

You don't believe that the language you speak will affect the muscles in your face that you use? Even if you can't see it because you don't need to read facial expressions the way I do, you should still be able to use common sense and understand that the more you use a muscle the stronger it will be.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 03:11:35 :

Yes you explained it. It’s just complete and utter nonsense that you literally came up with after the fact to avoid cognitive dissonance.

I’m so different languages emphasize different facial muscles? Of course. Could you identify what language anyone primarily speaks just by looking at their face? You cannot, and if you say you can I will literally fund the study and pay you for your time with stipulation that you pay it all back when I prove you wrong

--------------------------------

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 03:21:28 :

&gt;Could you identify what language anyone primarily speaks just by looking at their face? You cannot, and if you say you can

That's not what I said. I said the facial structure changes and I see that. I see similar harsh features in certain people of other races. I also see it in some angry white people.

I've pointed this out to a few Chinese friends in the USA and we played a little guessing game with it. After a few tries looking at pictures of peoples faces online (native speakers vs those raised speaking English) and a few tries they also got it right most of the time. They couldn't explain what differences they were actually seeing, but they were able to say ""That looks like the native speaker"" and get it correct.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 03:23:46 :

So you don’t like harsh facial features. Remarkable and controversial! How you don’t see how your conflation of this with a race is just beyond absurd.

Great my offer still stands! You seem confident!

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 03:29:59 :

Having looked at your comment history and seeing that you consider people who voted for Trump vile, solely because their voted for a vile man, I can see you have a very black and white mindset. It's likely what's causing you to be overly woke. There's no room for grey.

&gt;People who voted for trump are absolutely vile

Sure some of them probably are but not all of them. There are Democrats who voted for Trump and Republicans who voted for Biden. There are also people who hated voting for Trump, but didn't like the alternative option. When most people vote in America they typically  do so with their own interests first and societies second, it's human nature.

Do you really think half the country are vile people? Be serious.


&gt;What you are describing is called the golden mean fallacy. Sorry.

Ie that really where you when you are not understanding or disagree? That's just childish. Please show were I strawmanned.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 04:05:18 :

Yes.

No I’m not close minded. I’ve arrived at all of my positions from carefully examining them. Most of my current beliefs were changed from my previous beliefs by having an open mind, and being to able to admit when I’m wrong. There is not one thing you have said that I am not understanding. Sorry.

People who vote for their own interests over societies interests are vile people. People who vote for what they only think are in their own interests, against societies interests are even worse.

Half the country are not trump supporters. But yes easily a third of the humans of this planet are absolutely vile ignorant bigots.

Not a strawman. Your entire point here is just the golden mean fallacy.

You fail to listen with the intent to understand which is why you think those who ""support"" him are vile. I've talked to Republican friends to try and understand their views and opinions. They're not as different as you think. You're likely to find that you agree on 80-90% of things, and the 10-20% that differs is very often in how to implement things.

About what?

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 05:15:47 :

I’m bigoted against bigots? You realize the paradox of intolerance was solved s long time ago right?

Wrong. You don’t know me or where I’ve come from, or what I used to believe, or the discussions I’ve had. You are assuming, that because I have convictions and denounce wrong things as wrong, that I must be close minded. This is a reflection of the golden mean fallacy which states that the truth lies somewhere in the middle. This is a fallacy. I’ve heard and listened to and understood every new right wing movement in the us for 30 years. I used to be a right winger. My entire family and surrounding community were all republicans. I do understand them. They are literally wrong about everything.

YOU may agree 90 to 80% with republicans, because you are milque-toast. I want universal healthcare, k-16 public education, proper sex Ed, a woman’s right to choose, housing first policies for the homeless, affordable housing for everyone else, end expanded labor and environmental regulations, and an end to the war on drugs, and reparations for the formerly incarcerated under racist drug laws. Which means I agree with them on nothing because they oppose all these things.

The truth doesn’t lie anywhere in the middle between us. Indeed, truth is not something their ideology or policies are concerned with at all.

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 09:39:17 :

I'm not saying I agree with 80-90% of Republicans. I'm saying Republicans, Democrats, Independents  Socialists or whatever typically have similar ideals, dreams, goals, and values.

If you took the time to talk to people you'd see that

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 11:48:26 :

That’s a distinction without a meaningful difference sorry. I literally just explained how in fact we don’t share any of the same ideals dreams goals or values.

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 15:24:43 :

I own a home, but most Americans will never own a home because of right wingers.

I have a life partner. If right wingers had their way not everyone would be allowed to find their life partner.

Having family and friends is not an ideological issue.

Sure. If right wingers had their way not everyone could have a family and starving children can starve.

You haven’t thought about any of this for more than a second but you are desperate to have a point.

--------------------------------

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 15:30:53 :

I'm giving you examples of shared values.

If you want to go more complex take abortion.

Both sides agree killing babies is wrong. Or do you disagree with that statement?

What differs is two things: 

1. Does a womans right to choose override the rights of the baby. 

2. How a baby is defined. Most on one side argue it's not a baby but a fetus. The other side argue when does a fetus become a baby and why is there no consensus on that (different states have different cut off dates for abortions).

Both sides 80-90% agree that killing babies is wrong, and ideally we'd find other options. There's only 10-20% difference here.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 18:32:23 :

You are not.

A fetus is not a baby.

Absolutely yes. Just like you cannot be forced to sacrifice or donate any part of your body to anyone else. Especially not a fetus.

Right and the right wingers who think a fetus is a baby who deserves rights, don’t think that baby has any right to any kind of decent life once it’s born, proving they give not one single shit about life, they just want to punish people that upset their fucked values that are informed by mythology.

&gt;You are not.

I am, I gave you plenty of examples of shared values.

&gt;A fetus is not a baby.


Says you. Biologists and scientists are in agreement that life begins at conception. The entire abortion debate is because there's no consensus of when a fetus becomes a baby. This isn't rocket science.

I'm pro-choice but only because my ethics allow me to override my morals about killing babies.

&gt;Absolutely yes. Just like you cannot be forced to sacrifice or donate any part of your body to anyone else. Especially not a fetus.

So it sounds like at least your ethics on that matter are similar to mine but our morals differ.

&gt;Right and the right wingers who think a fetus is a baby who deserves rights, don’t think that baby has any right to any kind of decent life once it’s born

I don't know anyone who thinks the babies don't deserve _any right to any kind of decent life once it's born_ , I do know plenty who think it's not their responsibility to pay for someone else's children. Their belief is that if you can't afford to provide a decent life for your child them you shouldn't have children.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 19:02:20 :

I explained to you exactly how they are in fact unshared.

You need to stop being a manipulative communicator. Of course fetus are alive. Actually no the entire debate is that the right thinks a fetus is always a baby and that abortion is murder.

I’m pro choice because there is no ethical dilemma with terminating an unwanted fetus whatsoever, whereas there is an ethical dilemma to police a women’s body.

Cool. We are talking about right wingers, not you.

That’s literally the same thing. The people saying that shit are happy to give their tax dollars to kill foreigners and incarcerate people for victimless crimes. Your last sentence literally explains that their motivation is punishment.

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 19:42:12 :


&gt;I explained to you exactly how they are in fact unshared.

And I explained how many values you do share.

&gt;You need to stop being a manipulative communicator.

I'm not being manipulative, I'm communicating openly and clearly. You just aren't liking that I'm not allowing you to twist my words around.

&gt;Of course fetus are alive. Actually no the entire debate is that __the right thinks a fetus is always a baby__ and that abortion is murder.

Because they believe a fetus is a baby. Finally you're staring to see that. Put your own thoughts on the matter 100% aside for one moment. The fact that some right wing people fully believe a fetus is a baby explains why they are against abortion. (This is what I mean by listening with the intent to understand. It takes practice to listen while putting all your own personal beliefs aside).

&gt;I’m pro choice because there is no ethical dilemma with terminating an unwanted fetus whatsoever, whereas there is an ethical dilemma to police a women’s body.

Great we share those same ethics. I'm pretty sure we also share the same morals that killing babies is wrong. Since a lot of right wingers see no difference between a fetus and a baby they can't use ethics to bend or override their morals about killing babies.

&gt;That’s literally the same thing.

But it's not the same thing. If you can't provide for your baby you can give it up for adoption. (Babies get adopted very fast, it's children who don't.

&gt;Your last sentence literally explains that their motivation is punishment.

No their motivation is that they don't want to pay for the stupid choices of others. In my opinion it's parents having g children that they can't afford that is immoral.

I have two kids. I'd love to have had 3 or 4 as I grew up with 5 siblings. But after the second child was born I realised that there's no way I could afford to pay for all the extra curricular activities, health care and cover the full university tuition fees for more than two kids. It seems ridiculous to me that people who make much less than I do have more children and needing to beg someone else to pay for their offspring.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 19:58:22 :

No, you attempted to do so, and I explained how you are wrong. There’s a text record.

No you are. You tried to bring up biologists and the definition of life like that was a brilliant observation I was missing that added anything to the discussion whatsoever. I haven’t twisted a single thing you’ve said. Sorry.

OMG. Stop saying things you think are insightful! Of course they think it’s murder because they think it’s a baby! They are objectively wrong that it’s murder and objectively wrong that it’s a baby. Your distinction between the adoption speeds can babies and children literally has no bearing whatsoever on the ethics of this issue.

No, if that was there motivation they would support a women’s right to choose, because it costs society and taxpayers LESS to pay for the so called “mistake” of becoming pregnant, than it costs to bring an unwanted child into the world. Additionally if they actually cared about abortions they’d support a women’s right to choose and comprehensive sex Ed and free access to contraceptives, because all these measures REDUCE costs to society as well as REDUCE abortions, which is what they claim to care about.

Instead they oppose all these measures. It’s about punishment. 

The reason you can’t afford to take care of more children is because of the current economic conditions created by right wingers. Lmfao you honestly are completely over your head."	"[deleted] @ 2020-12-18 20:39:02 :

How is what I'm saying not valuable? I've been trying to explain to you that the Republicans aren't that different to you at all. They just have a different opinion on how things should be done.

I even explained why they have the views they do on abortion.

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 21:05:42 :

I do understand why people believe that men should be able to subjugate women. They are wrong. I do understand why people believe they shouldn’t pay taxes for others healthcare. It’s because they didn’t understand how private insurance works (because paying for other people is exactly how insurance works). There is not one right wing opinion I don’t understand. They just don’t have any value to anybody but the rich and powerful.

Why can’t you seem to understand that you are just continuously committing the golden mean fallacy?

--------------------------------

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 21:34:33 :

&gt;I do understand why people believe that men should be able to subjugate women.

But you don't. The point you are missing is that one it's not just men, many women are also pro-life. Also they don't believe they should be able to subjugate women, that doesn't even enter their arguement, they believe babies/fetuses shouldn't be killed. The subjugation is just an unfortunate result.

&gt; I do understand why people believe they shouldn’t pay taxes for others healthcare. It’s because they didn’t understand how private insurance works (because paying for other people is exactly how insurance works).

Once again you are dismissing their intelligence. I'm originally from Europe where there was universal healthcare and private insurance. The universal healthcare has  the issues people worry about with very long waiting unless it's an emergency. Their concerns aren't invalid. Healthcare in America is completely broken and the solutions aren't easy because they will involve making most hospitals public and massively dropping the level of care for many. It will also involve basically killing most of the health insurance industry. This will also result in tje loss of millions of jobs.

&gt;Why can’t you seem to understand that you are just continuously committing the golden mean fallacy?

Because I'm a left leaning centrist. I don't believe we'll ever get everyone to agree, but I do believe that with open, honest and __respectful__ discussion from both sides, we can reach a compromise. Neither side will be 100% happy bit we'll all get along.

--------------------------------

_Swamp_Ape_ @ 2020-12-18 21:56:13 :

No I do. I’m not missing that point. Right wing men subjugate women with more than just abortion, and also women can be and are also misogynists frequently. Especially right wing women. Again, you have absolutely no enlightening information to bring to this debate whatsoever.

Yes I am dismissing their intelligence because they aren’t smart. Wait times in Europe do not even compare to the amount of ailments that go completely untreated because they don’t have the time money or insurance. There should be wait times for emptying a that aren’t emergencies. Otherwise it’s pay to play. That’s what stupid poor people want, or what sociopathic rich people want. Care levels will not drop in the slightest in hospitals. You pulled that out of your asshole.

This doesn’t answer why you keep committing a logical fallacy, it just explains your ideology is a logical fallacy. The rights very ideology is abhorrent and disrespectful, they don’t deserve respect.

You realize that everything you are suggesting is exactly how the right managed to pull the Overton window so far right? No of course you don’t. You’ve repeatedly demonstrated you have no idea of the history of political movements

AslanLivesOn @ 2020-12-18 22:07:47 :

&gt; to bring to this debate whatsoever.

That explain some of our communication issues. I'm having a discussion while you're having a debate.

&gt;There should be wait times for emptying a that aren’t emergencies. Otherwise it’s pay to play.

In your opinion. 

I'm more in favour of both a private and public system. Those who want to pay to play should be allowed to pay for faster/better services if they wish to.

&gt; Care levels will not drop in the slightest in hospitals. You pulled that out of your asshole.

I've experienced the other system and everytime it wasn't an emergency I went private. Have you ever lived in a country with universal healthcare?

&gt;You realize that everything you are suggesting is exactly how the right managed to pull the Overton window so far right? No of course you don’t. You’ve repeatedly demonstrated you have no idea of the history of political movements

I'm suggesting nothing more than understanding and compromise, what you are describing is a dictatorship or communism.

I'm all for a more European style approach with a market economy with a good social safety net but I understand why many people don't want to pay for that.

&gt;Nope. Factually.

Just because __you__ state something as fact doesn't make it true or a fact.

&gt;Nope rich people shouldn’t be entitled to medical privileges denied others. Fucking sicko

Not just rich people anyone who wants to pay for it. I'm still paying off a loan 3 years later, that I took out to pay for surgery my wife needed that the insurance wouldn't cover. People should be allowed to make choices on how they spend their hard earned money.

&gt; Compromising between diametrically opposed positions is exactly how we ended up with the Overton window so far right.

The only conclusion to be drawn from that statement is that it was too far left to begin with, which isn't true in the USA.

&gt;70% of Americans want it. The ones that don’t do not have valid or good reasons

The ones that don't do have valid reasons, they are afraid of things costing more or losing coverage and options that they currently have. If you try to take privileges away from people they will get mad. Obamacare was a good step in the right direction but it still involved insurance companies and medical billings. It should simply have been expanding Medicare for all. And then figuring out a way to buy all the hospitals and make them public with some private wards. Additionally implement a system that if a doctor wants access to a public hospital then they must devote 70% of their practice to public patients.

I feel like the sheer amount of posts on this sub about this topic could be entered into evidence to demonstrate why the body positivity movement (and those like it) are needed. people are so upset and assume the absolute worst of fat people posting pictures of themselves in cute outfits or whatever. 

""health"" isn't always immediately perceptible just from looking at a person. of course it's undeniable that being very overweight can have a negative impact on someone's health. but let's say you're addicted to pills, and you go to rehab to get off of them. you do a ton of work to accomplish this really challenging thing that massively improves your health. but in the process, you gain weight. is that person less healthy than they were while they were addicted to drugs because they gained some weight during the recovery process? 

unless you're someone's doctor, you shouldn't make assumptions about someone's health. shaming them online isn't going to improve health outcomes for anyone. a culture of shame is what leads to fat people feeling too embarrassed to do stuff like go to the gym.

If a recovering addict posts a picture of themselves celebrating being sober then good for them. If they do it to celebrate their weight gain then they’re still promoting obesity, doesn’t matter what journey they’ve been on up to this point, and that’s wrong.

Yes, and I stand by that, because there’s nothing fatphobic about it. I’ve never said anything fatphobic in my life, you can see my other comment here and see for yourself:

If a recovering addict posts a picture of themselves celebrating being sober then good for them. If they do it to celebrate their weight gain then they’re still promoting obesity, doesn’t matter what journey they’ve been on up to this point, and that’s wrong.

I feel like the sheer amount of posts on this sub about this topic could be entered into evidence to demonstrate why the body positivity movement (and those like it) are needed. people are so upset and assume the absolute worst of fat people posting pictures of themselves in cute outfits or whatever. 

""health"" isn't always immediately perceptible just from looking at a person. of course it's undeniable that being very overweight can have a negative impact on someone's health. but let's say you're addicted to pills, and you go to rehab to get off of them. you do a ton of work to accomplish this really challenging thing that massively improves your health. but in the process, you gain weight. is that person less healthy than they were while they were addicted to drugs because they gained some weight during the recovery process? 

unless you're someone's doctor, you shouldn't make assumptions about someone's health. shaming them online isn't going to improve health outcomes for anyone. a culture of shame is what leads to fat people feeling too embarrassed to do stuff like go to the gym.

edit: I am blown away by the support for this comment &amp; for all the awards and people leaving insightful responses sharing their own thoughts and experiences. I'm now receiving replies speculating about my own weight and calling me ""fatty"" (even though I never mentioned my own weight in this comment). I think these responses demonstrate the need to regard the issue of weight with nuance and care. In that vein, I want to highlight this comment from u/DawnOfTomorrrow, which I think is a great reminder of how little you can actually know about someone by their appearance at one moment in time: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ljhxhi/cmv_the_body_positivity_movement_has_been_taken/gnfxjzp?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

Thank you!! These ""calories in vs calories out"" people are as mind-boggling frustrating as the ""stop smoking and you won't get cancer,"" ""don't have sex and you won't get pregnant,"" types who take complex human issues and reduce them to fit their moral agenda and I've just about had it.

Edit: also, if they're just worried about health, how about lobbying for free or low-cost gym memberships or meal plans, or universal health care. Moralizing people who struggle with weight instead of dealing with the causes of real health problems is not noble, it just shows an oversized ego, and I'd much rather spend my time with oversized people than oversized egos any day of the week.

It is not unlimited. If you want to spend money to help the upper and middle classes, you need to make an argument as to why we should spend our money doing that. 

I stick by my saying the point is that they find the money. And we don't have to make the argument in this case as it's already been made. The government needs to make student to forgiveness happen. It's just a matter of the approach.

&gt;I’m not saying taxes would necessarily increase

Good. That's a start. But I'm simply saying there are a myriad of ways the money can be raised or pulled. 

&gt;and since taxpayers fund 100% of the government budget, it comes from taxpayers. 

That's not true. There are other avenues money can be obtained. Deficit spending, relocating from other programs, creating new ones that raise money etc. 

And again this point is moot in regards to SDF. It doesn't cost money to do this. It costs money to fund other entirely separate programs. So focus on that as a separate yet also important issue.

&gt;This is completely outside the scope of if SLF is a good idea. 

My only concern is how we get it done. I don't see any possible argument against SLF and thus don't see it up for debate. 

&gt;Right. so why is it a good idea to put money into SLF

I can only repeat so many times. No money is being ""put into"" this at all. It's debt forgiveness. It doesn't cost money on its own. 

&gt;I don’t see why it’s good policy.

I don't see how it wouldn't be good. People are in debt that they shouldn't be and it's the government's responsibility to right the wrong they allowed in the first place. It's good because it frees up people to use their money for other bills or stimulate the economy in a time where that will be more important than ever.

&gt;&gt; This is a larger issue that I don't see contributing to this discussion.

&gt;Then why did you make the suggestion?

I didn't. It was an aside.

&gt;Why would I pay it off when ya’ll are advocating I should get free money? I’m against bad policies, but I’m not stupid. 

I mean this was only being proposed and talked about in the past few years on any significant level. Honestly, really only the past year if you want to be technical. I'm asking why you (in the general sense or the individual) wouldn't pay your loan debt off if you make 6 figures or more. 

&gt;I still don’t see any actual arguments from you as to why giving me taxpayer money is a good idea. 

I'm not proposing we give anyone money here. This isn't about the stimulus. It's about debt forgiveness. You aren't getting money. And again there is no reason to involve taxpayers in the discussion at all.

&gt;How does SLF help the poor?

People making less than $100,000 a year are possibly struggling to pay bills depending on where they live and a variety of other circumstances like business expenses or healthcare-related bills. 

I have 10s of thousands of dollars in debt and haven't had anything more than a min wage job to work towards paying it off. It's astonishing that people think forgiving these loans somehow doesn't help people who NEED the relief. 

&gt;My point is that it helps the middle class and rich at the expense of the poor

And that is false. The rich largely don't have loans in the first place let alone debt leftover. The poor have no choice but to take out loans and typically no means to pay them off. And the ""middle class"" are forced to take loans with only some of them being able to make payments on them. 

This also has NO adverse effects on ""the poor"". 

&gt;The poor pay taxes too and you are saying we should use their tax money to pay for the loans that the middle and upper class took out. 

I'm saying no such thing and you know that.

&gt;Again, I agree that it’s the governments responsibility.

Then stop arguing lol. The government can take responsibility by forgiving the debt. End of story. It doesn't have to involve taxpayers in the slightest."	0	0	stop arguing comment					"Hey peeps. I'm a progressive voter who supported Ilhan Omar and Elizabeth Warren (I'm in MN). I have a masters degree and about $20K in student loan debt. However I don't understand why canceling student loan debt is a progressive policy that is being championed by the likes of Warren, Bernie, AOC, and others. Change my view that this is a policy that won't address underlying issues with student debt but it will further divide class lines.

I understand that total student loan debt (&gt;$1.5 trillion) has now surpassed total credit card debt (&lt;$1trillion) to become the second largest form of debt in America (after mortgages). I acknowledge that's a concern. This has been driven by increases in the costs of higher education, increased/eliminated caps on borrowing for students and parents, the rise in for-profit colleges, the increasing number of people attaining college and especially graduate school, and more.

However, only about 1 in 8 Americans has student loan debt and the average amount is about $32K. While I understand that some people drop out of college and get the debt without the benefit, that is not emblematic of people who have student loan debt in general...an individuals who graduate college tend to make significantly more than those who don't (\~$75K/year vs $45K/year). Additionally there are income-based repayment plans for student loans that are an option which tie your repayment to your discretionary income and forgive anything you have left after a set number of years. Why should we cancel, on average, $30K in student loan debt for citizens who make, on average $30K more per year than non-college graduates?

So, again, why is canceling student loan debt seen as a progressive policy being championed by the likes of Warren and Bernie and AOC, etc?

Someone change my view that it would be more progressive and effective strategy to:

1. Address underlying issues causing the increase in student loan debt. Simply canceling student loan debt simply resets our debt back towards zero but then it will start accumulating all over again. Congress needs to address how we got in this situation.
2. Give every American a big ol' check. If someone wants to spend their big bailout on paying off a bunch of student loan debt, that's their prerogative. And if I want to spend it paying down credit card debt first, that's my choice based on my biggest need. And if a low income family wants to use it to buy a car to have reliable transportation to a better job, that's their opportunity to get ahead.

If we could lift every American out of poverty and provide universal healthcare and check a whole lot of other boxes then I'd be all for moving down the list to eventually forgiving student loans...but I don't understand or support why it's an issue that is getting so much attention now.

Forgiving student loans will disproportionately help middle and upper class Americans while providing no benefit to our most impoverished and marginalized citizens, and it will do nothing to address the systemic issues that created the debt in the first place. Change my view."	"Tibaltdidnothinwrong @ 2021-02-18 15:54:33 :

Part of the priority, is that it is actionable. The debt is owed to the federal government itself, and hence can easily be voided. Other than the process of debate itself, the act of doing this would only take a few minutes. 

This is in contrast to other problems, such as addressing underlying problems, solving poverty, solving homelessness, etc. These problems cannot simply be solved by a single act of congress, in a matter of minutes. 

Do the easy things first, get a few wins under your belt, and then move on to some harder things, Go for the low hanging fruit first. You get the idea.

But isn't the government counting on that $1.5 trillion dollars in student loan debt to be repaid in order to fund government initiatives such as housing and infrastructure (though, who are we kidding, mostly the military)? If the government says it's not going to collect that $1.5 trillion its owed, won't it be $1.5 trillion deeper in debt? Assuming that's the case, I'd rather see that same $1.5 trillion used to provide bailouts to every adult American instead of just forgiving loans for primarily middle and upper class Americans.

This just isn't true. If you really think the rich kids that went to Harvard are the ones with debt and not the poor kids that scraped together what they could to go to a small local public/private college then you are mistaken. 

This misconception seems likely to be what created the problem with your original position.

I guess I just think it’s silly to give money to someone who grew up with rich parents and chose to go to a school beyond their family’s means when we could instead do things to help actual poor people, especially those who _don’t_ have a college education.  We could put more of our taxpayer money into other programs that help the actual poor. Money doesn’t grow on trees and _someone_ is going to pay for these loans that these “rich kids” took out. I think it’s silly to hand them free taxpayer money (in the form of not paying back the money they borrowed from taxpayers). 

Will student loan forgiveness help _some_ poor people? Sure. But it will help mostly middle and upper class people. If we want to help poor people, there are far better ways to do it.

Personally I think we can do both. But I understand more help needs to go to the poor and so that's why I support plenty of other programs and proposals beyond just debt clearance. 

The point is that this is something that Biden admin can do instantly. So there's no reason to not just help people.

&gt; Money doesn’t grow on trees and someone is going to pay for these loans that these “rich kids” took out

The schools overcharging or the government letting the schools overcharge should hold that burden imo.

Letshavemorefun @ 2021-02-19 03:39:19 :

Oh I absolutely think the issue needs to be addressed at the root - the root being the insane cost of college. 

But we are where we are now. The money people borrowed from taxpayers (federal loans) or from companies (private loans) has already been spent and services have been rendered. We can’t take that back. So someone has to pay for it. 

That money has to come from somewhere. We don’t have an unlimited budget. I would rather put taxpayer money into programs that help the lower class instead of programs that help primarily the middle and upper class.

Edit: also you seem to misunderstand where the government gets its money from. The government doesn’t just have money. Their money comes from taxpayers.

My point was that people aren't taxed when students take out loans for school. 

This isn't the government spending money here. They can simply wipe the debt away. 

The alternative is spending money on direct stimulus in incredibly large amounts (which wouldn't pass through congress). 

It is the easier option and the more effective option to help millions of people. Again this doesn't mean it's ALL that can or should be done.

That is... not how money works. 

&gt; This isn't the government spending money here. They can simply wipe the debt away.

They can’t “simply” wipe debt away. For private loans it’s obvious why they can’t do that (though I can explain more if you don’t think it’s oblivious). For federal loans, “wiping” away debt isn’t how it works. The government gave someone an apple. They are expecting that Apple back in 5 years and they _need_ that Apple to feed other people who are hungry. If they don’t get that Apple back, they will still need an apple. They will have to get it from somewhere else. Guess where 100% of government apples come from? Taxpayers...

&gt; The alternative is spending money on direct stimulus in incredibly large amounts (which wouldn't pass through congress).

I would be more in favor of UBI then I would be student loan forgiveness. But those are not the only two options...

&gt; It is the easier option and the more effective option to help millions of people. Again this doesn't mean it's ALL that can or should be done.

That’s.. not a reason why we _should_ do it..

&gt; Weird how it feels that way when the government spends on all kinds of useless or less important things on the regular.

We... still don’t have an unlimited budget. I’m not against other reforms. I would absolutely be in favor of cutting our military budget by more then half. But this again is not an argument in support of why we should do SLF. 

&gt; I just don't see the issue here. Biden can wipe the debt and be done with it.

The issue is that it will help the upper and middle class at the expense of the lower class and call me crazy, but I don’t think that’s a good idea. I would prefer to put our _limited_ budget towards helping the lower class.

&gt;They can’t “simply” wipe debt away.

For federal loans they 100% can. 

&gt;The government gave someone an apple. They are expecting that Apple back in 5 years.

And the government can say they no longer expect it back...

&gt;If they don’t get that Apple back, they will still need an apple.

For what? Why would the government need this money? 

&gt;I would be more in favor of UBI then I would be student loan forgiveness. But those are not the only two options...

Let's do BOTH! 

&gt;&gt;It is the easier option and the more effective option to help millions of people.

&gt;That’s.. not a reason why we should do it..

Of course, it is. Beyond the basic fact that it's the government's fault for so many people being in this much debt in the first place. They need to take responsibility and acknowledge they allowed schools to charge students at predatory rates. I think there is room for schools to take some of this responsibility as well but the government allowed it to happen at the end of the day.

&gt;I would absolutely be in favor of cutting our military budget by more then half.

Then if they need the money that bad there's one option right? One option among many.

&gt;The issue is that it will help the upper and middle class at the expense of the lower class and call me crazy

No, it will not. It will help the poor and middle class and maybe even some people who have money at no expense regular people. 

Now is the time to deficit spend. Now is the time to stimulate the economy and provide as much possible relief to people as possible. This is literally one of the quickest and easiest ways to do that for millions of people. They should wipe the debt and then move on to more expansive options through congress.

Why would that make me gullible, of all things?

That’s not how borrowing money works. Someone still needs to pay the money. It’s either the person who took out the loan, or taxpayers. 

&gt; And the government can say they no longer expect it back...

Yes that’s _physically_ possible for them to do. But they will have to find the Apple from somewhere else if not from the person who borrowed it. 

&gt; For what? Why would the government need this money?

You really want me to list the things government uses money for? Let me just give you two examples - welfare and food stamps. Let’s say the money to pay for welfare was coming out of the money paid back by student loans. Well if the government is no longer getting any money paid back for student loans, it will have to get that money from somewhere else. So then the food stamp budget gets reduced. 

&gt; Let's do BOTH!

Again, not an argument for SLF. Also again, money doesn’t grow on trees. 

&gt; Beyond the basic fact that it's the government's fault for so many people being in this much debt in the first place. 

I actually agree with this. But taxpayers != government. SLF makes taxpayers pay for the loans, not some magic fairy government money that pops out of nowhere. 

&gt; I think there is room for schools to take some of this responsibility as well but the government allowed it to happen at the end of the day.

Fine. Make the schools pay back the loans. And in turn they will increase tuition and we’ll be in double the trouble in 20 years. 

&gt; Then if they need the money that bad there's one option right? One option among many.

Again, not an argument for why we should do SLF. 

&gt; No, it will not. It will help the poor and middle class and maybe even some people who have money at no expense regular people.

Well like I said, I grew up rich and I graduate with 50k in student loans. I now make six figures. Most of my peers were/are in the exact same situation. SLF helps us. We don’t need it. This is not what we should be using taxpayer money for. 

&gt; Now is the time to deficit spend. Now is the time to stimulate the economy and provide as much possible relief to people as possible. This is literally one of the quickest and easiest ways to do that for millions of people. They should wipe the debt and then move on to more expansive options through congress.

Also not an argument for SLF... yes, now is a good time to take some action. What you need is an argument as to why those actions should include SLF.

Electrivire @ 2021-02-19 05:05:34 :

&gt;Why would that make me gullible, of all things?

If you don't think congress finds the money to push whatever agenda they want then that's being gullible at best. I understand the money, in that case, comes from somewhere but the point is they find it. 

&gt;That’s not how borrowing money works. Someone still needs to pay the money. It’s either the person who took out the loan, or taxpayers. 

I see no reason this would affect taxpayers generally. There is a legal debate around the tax bill that could potentially come (on an individual level) for having your loans forgiven but there are also ways around that as well. 

There ARE legal arguments that would allow the secretary of education, the treasury department, and the IRS to make forgiveness tax-free. Forgiveness could get a “general welfare” exclusion, or qualify as disaster relief, or get a scholarship exclusion, among other options. It's possible and just needs to be seriously looked into and attempted for us to find the answer. 

&gt;Well if the government is no longer getting any money paid back for student loans, it will have to get that money from somewhere else. So then the food stamp budget gets reduced. 

I think you are just simplifying it too much. The fact is that isn't the case. I see what you are saying that the money has to come from somewhere to fund other unrelated programs and things but there are plenty of ways to RAISE that money. Plenty of other places we can pull those funds from. 

It's of course something that has to be thought about but it's inevitable the problem with be solved. The money will be found one way or another and there is no reason to think that would somehow be directly from taxpayers. 

&gt;Fine. Make the schools pay back the loans. And in turn they will increase tuition and we’ll be in double the trouble in 20 years.

This is a larger issue that I don't see contributing to this discussion. All I'll say is that the government needs to seriously crack down on schools going forward. 

&gt;Well like I said, I grew up rich and I graduate with 50k in student loans. I now make six figures. 

And you still have debt? Why not just pay it off?

&gt;SLF helps us

I'm ok with it honestly. Nobody should have to spend thousands of dollars to get an education so as much as I sympathize with helping the poor ""first"", I just don't see helping the rich as a byproduct of helping the poor being that big of an issue.

&gt;Also not an argument for SLF

You keep saying this. But nothing I've said was meant to be ""an argument for SLF"". The argument is people shouldn't have that debt in the first place and it's the government's responsibility to deal with it.

&gt; If you don't think congress finds the money to push whatever agenda they want then that's being gullible at best. I understand the money, in that case, comes from somewhere but the point is they find it.

No, the point is that _it comes from somewhere_. It is not unlimited. If you want to spend money to help the upper and middle classes, you need to make an argument as to why we should spend our money doing that. 

&gt; I see no reason this would affect taxpayers generally. There is a legal debate around the tax bill that could potentially come (on an individual level) for having your loans forgiven but there are also ways around that as well.

I’m not saying taxes would necessarily increase. I’m saying that money has to come from somewhere in the government budget, and since taxpayers fund 100% of the government budget, it comes from taxpayers. 

&gt; There ARE legal arguments that would allow the secretary of education, the treasury department, and the IRS to make forgiveness tax-free. Forgiveness could get a “general welfare” exclusion, or qualify as disaster relief, or get a scholarship exclusion, among other options. It's possible and just needs to be seriously looked into and attempted for us to find the answer.

This is completely outside the scope of if SLF is a good idea. 

&gt; I think you are just simplifying it too much. The fact is that isn't the case. I see what you are saying that the money has to come from somewhere to fund other unrelated programs and things but there are plenty of ways to RAISE that money. Plenty of other places we can pull those funds from.

Right. _so why is it a good idea to put money into SLF_. You still haven’t made that argument. You just keep repeating that it’s possible. I agree it’s possible. I don’t see why it’s good policy. 

&gt; It's of course something that has to be thought about but it's inevitable the problem with be solved. The money will be found one way or another and there is no reason to think that would somehow be directly from taxpayers.

Like I said, 100% of government money comes from taxpayers. 

&gt; This is a larger issue that I don't see contributing to this discussion. 

Then why did you make the suggestion?

&gt; All I'll say is that the government needs to seriously crack down on schools going forward.

I agree. And also on the amount of loans they give out. 

&gt; And you still have debt? Why not just pay it off?

Why would I pay it off when ya’ll are advocating I should get free money? I’m against bad policies, but I’m not stupid. 

&gt; I'm ok with it honestly. Nobody should have to spend thousands of dollars to get an education 

I think there are _far_ better ways to spend our money and I still don’t see any actual arguments from you as to why giving me taxpayer money is a good idea. 

&gt; so as much as I sympathize with helping the poor ""first"", I just don't see helping the rich as a byproduct of helping the poor being that big of an issue.

How does SLF help the poor? My point is that it helps the middle class and rich _at the expense of_ the poor. The poor pay taxes too and you are saying we should use their tax money to pay for the loans that the middle and upper class took out. 

&gt; You keep saying this. But nothing I've said was meant to be ""an argument for SLF"". 

Then what _are_ you trying to argue?

&gt; The argument is people shouldn't have that debt in the first place and it's the government's responsibility to deal with it.

Again, I agree that it’s the governments responsibility. I don’t agree that it’s the taxpayers responsibility, especially at the expense of the poor."	"Letshavemorefun @ 2021-02-19 18:40:31 :

&gt; I stick by my saying the point is that they find the money. 

They physically can get the money. The question is if they _should_. If we use the money for student loan forgiveness, then we have to take it out of something else. 

&gt; And we don't have to make the argument in this case as it's already been made. The government needs to make student to forgiveness happen. It's just a matter of the approach.

That’s not even an _attempt_ at an argument this time. You’re literally saying you don’t need an argument to get policy passed? Do we somehow live in Electrivire’s Dictatorship? Lol. In reality, this is a democractic republic and you need to convince lawmakers this is a good idea or convince other people it’s a good idea and they should vote for lawmakers who agree. 

&gt; Good. That's a start. 

No it’s not a start cause now I’m realizing you just don’t understand what I mean when I say taxpayers will pay for it. 

&gt; But I'm simply saying there are a myriad of ways the money can be raised or pulled.

Yes again. It’s _possible_ to find taxpayer money to pay for this. The question is if it’s a good idea. 

&gt; That's not true. There are other avenues money can be obtained. 

&gt; Deficit spending, 

Which taxpayer make up in the long run. 

&gt; relocating from other programs, 

Which are funded by taxpayers

&gt; creating new ones that raise money etc.

Such as? Also, why would the new money being raised go to SLF and not programs to help the lower class? Please, _make an argument_ to support your view. 

&gt; And again this point is moot in regards to SDF. It doesn't cost money to do this. 

Jesus Christ, yes it does. Money doesn’t grow on trees. I don’t understand how else to explain math to you. 

&gt; My only concern is how we get it done. I don't see any possible argument against SLF and thus don't see it up for debate.

I’ve given you several arguments in this thread. I think we should put our taxpayer money into helping the lower class, not the middle and upper classes to the detriment of the lower class. If you’re not even open to hearing arguments as to why SLF is bad then a) why are you even in this sub talking about it and b) you’re never going to get policy passed if you’re not even willing to argue as to why that policy is a good idea. 

&gt; I can only repeat so many times. No money is being ""put into"" this at all. It's debt forgiveness. It doesn't cost money on its own.

And I can only repeat so many times that that’s not how money works. If you are owed money and you don’t get that money back, you have less money then you should. If you need that money, you need to find it from somewhere else. You seem to understand that the money will need to come from somewhere else, but you keep repeating that SLF doesn’t cost anything. I’m starting to think this is an Amelia Bedelia situation and you’re just not understand the words I’m saying. Is English not your first language? That would explain a lot and I could try to explain the economics of this to you in some more basic language. 

&gt; I don't see how it wouldn't be good. 

Not an argument. 

&gt; People are in debt that they shouldn't be 

They _literally_ should be in debt. They took out loans. That’s how loans work. 

&gt; and it's the government's responsibility to right the wrong they allowed in the first place. 

Why is SLF a good way for the government to address the issue?

&gt; It's good because it frees up people to use their money for other bills or stimulate the economy in a time where that will be more important than ever.

But it does the opposite to taxpayer funds. Yes, middle and upper class individuals would have more money that they didn’t expect because now they wouldn’t have to payback loans they took out. But taxpayer funds would have _less_ money because we wouldn’t have money we _did_ expect to come in. So we would have to take that money out of other programs that could help the lower class instead of the middle and upper classes. 

&gt; I didn't. It was an aside.

Those are literally contradictory statements. Either you made the suggestion as an aside, or you didn’t make the suggestion lol. Either way, seems we are agreed now that it’s not a good idea to make universities pay these loans?

&gt; I mean this was only being proposed and talked about in the past few years on any significant level. Honestly, really only the past year if you want to be technical. I'm asking why you (in the general sense or the individual) wouldn't pay your loan debt off if you make 6 figures or more.

Well for me personally, I wasn’t making six figures until a few years ago. And having loans is good for my credit score. It would make no sense for me to put my money into paying off my loans all at once when I can instead invest it and make more, while boosting my credit by making regular payments. But once people starting talking about SLF - forget it. No way I’m paying it off all at once now lol. 

&gt; I'm not proposing we give anyone money here. This isn't about the stimulus. It's about debt forgiveness. You aren't getting money. And again there is no reason to involve taxpayers in the discussion at all.

Omg there you go again with the Amelia Bedelia literal interpretation of what I’m saying. I understand that no one is receiving a check. But if they owe money and you don’t make them pay it back, you are giving them that money that they owe. They have more money in their pocket then they would have if you hadn’t forgiven their loan. That’s giving them free money. 

&gt; People making less than $100,000 a year are possibly struggling to pay bills depending on where they live and a variety of other circumstances like business expenses or healthcare-related bills.

Yeah cause someone making 90k to pay off their college loans from a fancy private school are hurting so bad and we should give them free money. As opposed to people making 30k working minimum wage jobs and actually need that money. 

&gt; I have 10s of thousands of dollars in debt and haven't had anything more than a min wage job to work towards paying it off. 

Then we should design programs that help you since you’re lower class. That doesn’t have to be SLF since SLF also helps the 90k person who doesn’t need our help. It would be very easy to do a UBI for anyone making under 40k. No need to forgive loans for people making 90k. 

&gt; It's astonishing that people think forgiving these loans somehow doesn't help people who NEED the relief.

I never said it wouldn’t help _anyone_. I’m saying it’s not a good idea and there are better idea to help people that do need some relief. 

&gt; And that is false. The rich largely don't have loans in the first place let alone debt leftover. 

I’ve already addressed this. Yes we do. College is ridiculously expensive and even the rich need to take out loans to pay for it. The only people who don’t are the Uber Uber rich. But anyone in the top 80%-95% of wealth holders in our country would need to take out loans to pay for college. 

&gt; The poor have no choice but to take out loans and typically no means to pay them off. 

The lower class typical gets financial aid. My friend got a full ride to my private, expensive college (not scholarship - just pure financial aid) because his family was so poor they grew up on food stamps. It’s the middle and upper class who don’t get financial aid and need to take out loans to pay for college. 

&gt; And the ""middle class"" are forced to take loans with only some of them being able to make payments on them.

Yes I agree. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to use taxpayer money to give the middle class free money. We should be focusing on the lower class. 

&gt; This also has NO adverse effects on ""the poor"".

It does. Lower class people pay taxes (usually not income tax - but def other taxes like sales tax, etc). We are then using their money and giving it to the middle class. We would be redistributing wealth to the middle class. And the lower class people would get nothing. So now they are comparably even _more_ poorer then the middle class. When the middle class gets more money, that will make the cost of goods and services go up. Middle class will be about the same cause now they have free money to pay for this increase in costs. But lower class didn’t get any free money. So not only do they not get the benefit of SLF, they also now don’t have enough money to cover the goods and services they used to have enough money for but which have now increased in price.

&gt; I'm saying no such thing and you know that.

You’re just not understanding how an economy works. 

&gt; Then stop arguing lol. The government can take responsibility by forgiving the debt. 

And they can take responsibility without putting the burden to pay these loans on taxpayers. 

&gt; End of story. It doesn't have to involve taxpayers in the slightest.

You’re right. A solution to this problem doesn’t have to involve taxpayers. Why don’t you then make some suggestions that don’t involve using taxpayer money to make up for unpaid loans."

What you seem to be missing is that representation matters. It helps the general population see that people in marginalized groups are humans and are capable of acting, and it also shows kids (and adults as well) that they can grow up to become an actor, and that their stories can be told, and that they're valid, worthwhile human beings.

Sure, a good actor can act like a character that they're not. But ScarJo isn't trans, and having a trans actor playing a major role in a big-name movie would have brought a lot of attention to the social issues currently affecting trans people, and would have been a great avenue for trans representation in Hollywood. ScarJo wasn't cancelled for not being a good actor, she was cancelled for ignoring the issue of representation in Hollywood, when clearly it was a big enough deal that she got a lot of backlash for taking the role.

If I did something at work that was so socially bad that a bunch of customers were upset about it (even though it management was aware of my actions and didn't make any attempt to prevent my actions), I think that would be saying something about both me and the company, for being so unaware of the wants/needs of our customers (which in the ScarJo case, is the want/need for social justice via representation in media).

And on the 23 and me genetic tests, they put British and Irish together because they can't tell the difference. ""Southern Europe"" for instance is all lumped together. If there are specific genetic markers for countries, we haven't found most of them. But again, they would be regional, not bound by a country's borders. For instance Italy has a people named Catalonians. They have their own language, and would probably not be the same genetically as most people aren't about to learn a new language to live somewhere else.  For a modern day reference, the Kurds inhabit 5 different countries but would be genetically the same of course."

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-25 21:37:14 :

But my point is wider. How many different lifestyles should the government discriminate against? 

Should we allow people to do more or less whatever they want and basically pay the same into the tax pot and take what they need, or do we itemise it so different lifestyle choices come with an extra cost?

Personally I'm all for the government taxing cigarettes and alcohol and using the money to help pay for healthcare or rehab. I'd also tax fast food higher in the same way. But I think this tax should be transactional and be at the point of purchase. I don't think for example the health service should be able to discriminate between lifestyles, I think at that point it's unethical.

Galious @ 2021-02-25 22:29:40 :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventable_causes_of_death#/media/File:Preventable_causes_of_death.svg

It’s not like it’s a very complicated question: tobacco, obesity and alcohol are the top 3 preventable health problem in our societies by a large margin. The rest is statistically negligible or not personal responsibility.

Then it’s of course a question of how much people would have to pay more (or the discount for people not ticking any of these 3 categories)  if an obese person have to pay 3x more, I could agree it’s unethical, if if it’s 20% more, I don’t see a moral issue and of course that extra cost should be used  to help people to get healthy.

Now I’m not OP and I would agree that a part of the ‘unhealthy’ life style should be put as taxes.

In the end I live in a country (France) with universal free healthcare and while I’m very happy we have this, it’s still anger me everytime I hear smokers tell me that it’s their life and their choice and I should shut up because the reality is that I’m paying for them.

Final words: fuck tobacco! Worst shit ever! And fuck cancer!

--------------------------------

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-26 06:20:15 :

Preventable deaths and cost to the health service are not the same thing. You'll have to prove that deaths from tobacco or alcohol cost the healthcare service way more than the cost of a healthy person living to a ripe old age and dying of ""natural causes"". I don't think you've convinced me on that at all. 

Also why should smokers pay more at the doctor, when the majority of a pack of cigarettes is just tax specifically earmarked to go to the health service. Aren't you punishing them twice?

Finally a price hike at the doctor would just punish poor and vulnerable people more. Statistically poor people are more likely to smoke and more likely to be obese. This idea of making them pay more for healthcare just seems cruel to me. They need help not punishment!

--------------------------------

Galious @ 2021-02-26 09:09:23 :

You can't separate the cost of healthcare and loss of production from preventable death and sickness like they are two different things. If a smoker dies at the age of 55 after years of being sick 10 days/year more than a non-smoker (it's the average number of sick days a smoker had more in comparison of a non-smoker) he will have contributed to the system way less than someone dying at 90yo after a healthy life even if they end with comparable health bill for society.

If the pack of cigarette's price was to cover the real cost for society, it would need to cost 45$. My point is that we aren't punishing the smokers twice at all at the moment because they aren't actually paying the real cost for society of their addiction. It's not punishing someone to ask someone to pay the bill.

Then if we're talking universal healthcare system, it's not 'pay at the doctor' but simply your taxes (either on your salary or VAT) you may say what you want about how it would punish the most poor person but the truth is that making things more expensive is  one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking and other tobacco use.

So of course we should help people and not just punish them (I even wrote it literally in my last post) but just don't fool yourself into thinking that tax on tobacoo or alcohol or fast food cover the cost to society at the moment nor that hiking up the price wouldn't be effective: it would save lives!

--------------------------------

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-26 09:49:00 :

Do you have any references to back up your claims?

$45 for a pack of cigarettes?!? At that rate well over 95% of the cost would be tax for the healthcare service. So someone smoking a pack a day would be paying $16,000 into healthcare pot each year, or $160,000 in 10 years. 

Lung cancer treatment drugs cost from $1779 to $3565 depending on specifics. It seems that a lifetime smoker at your rates would be paying for several decades of treatment. 


What data are you using? The only relevant data I can find is from UK in 2015 published by NHS England. Then they collected £12 billion in taxes from cigarettes and tobacco. The estimated cost of treatment for smoking related illnesses was between £3 and 6 billion. This seems to show smokers more than pay their fair share of healthcare costs through taxes on purchasing tobacco products. 

Since this data from 2015, taxes on cigarettes have gone up and the cancer drugs have got cheaper. 

But I think you missed my point earlier. I'm not against a tax on sales of tobacco or alcohol. I'm in favour of that. I like that this money gets rerouted to the healthcare system. I'm only against charging addicts more for healthcare at the point of use.

Though with an estimated cost of more than 300 billions to society for US for 30 millions smokers: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/economics/econ_facts/index.htm#:~:text=Smoking%2Drelated%20illness%20in%20the,%24300%20billion%20each%20year%2C%20including%3A&amp;text=Nearly%20%24170%20billion%20for%20direct,due%20to%20secondhand%20smoke%20exposure

We can roughly say that a smoker cost $10000 on average each year to society with simple math so it may be less but still in the same park.

Then I'm not missing your point, I'm just telling that smoking, alcohol and obesity represent an enormous cost for society once you address every cost. A smoker isn't just lung cancer treatment: it's 10 days of sickness each year on average, it's 25% people dying before 65yo, it's second hand smoke casualities, it's family mourning the early loss of loved ones, it's quality of life loss, it's poor people wasting their money on something killing them.

My second point is that all studies show that when you rise cost and make people pay more, people are motivated to quit and it saves life. So of course you can talk about the moral or 'punishing' people but the truth is that you're not punishing people, you're just making them pay for what they cost and motivating them to quit on top of having more money to finance program to help people quit their bad habit.

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-26 11:36:55 :

I think you are missing my point!

I'm not against putting up the price of cigarettes or alcohol. 

I'm against charging those people extra at the point of visiting a health worker.

--------------------------------

Galious @ 2021-02-26 12:59:08 :

But who talks about charging people to visit a health worker? the topic is about having a bigger premium. As we've seen a smoker cost the society 10000$/year  because of his habit, so if he must pay 100$/month more through taxes (which don't even cover a third of the cost of his habit) then I don't really see what's morally wrong especially if the money is used for prevention and free recovery program on top of serving a purpose of deterring people to start and an incentive to stop.

--------------------------------

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-26 14:26:53 :

Is the tax system based on money paid in equals money you can take out?

That seems to undermine it as a mechanism for wealth distribution. It seems to imply rich people who pay tax at a higher rate are entitled to more public spending than poor people. 

Personally I'm all against wealth inequality and support systems that try to stem the growing wealth inequality in society. 

In terms of healthcare, this pandemic has shown me that a society is only as healthy as it's most vulnerable members. They have the capacity of literally taking up every hospital bed if they are not cared for and a crisis hits. Therefore anything that inhibits people's access to healthcare I'd oppose. 

In terms of the values you quote, aren't you just describing the situation as it is now? In UK you are paying £7 in tax on 20 cigarettes. So someone smoking a pack a day is paying £210 in taxes more than a non smoker would. This actually seems to show they are overpaying (as the data I showed from UK NHS 2015). So why pursecute them further? I'm all for disincentives to stop people smoking, or even better to stop people from starting to smoke. But for me this is accomplished with taxes on the products. Why do we have to go further?

--------------------------------

Galious @ 2021-02-26 16:19:28 :

As I've told you, your numbers don't take everything into account but only a part of it. If you take everything into account: https://imgur.com/JqXwz39

[source](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/tobacco/docs/tobacco_liability_final_en.pdf)

Then this same study shows  that smoking cost on average 3.4% of GDP for european countries. So for 1.65 billions of pack for year (stats shows around 2.5-3 billion pack smoked each month) you can calculate that 3.4% of GDP for UK is 69 billions and therefore the taxes of cigarettes should be 5.5x times more (so... roughly 38euros of taxes which are in line with my study in France and also in line with the number reported of 300 billions in US)

Now you can argue about the number of the report and also note that it's from 2000 and people smoked more twenty years ago and nowadays the % of GDP is probably lower but it would still be massivelsy more than your reported 12 billions so it's not persecution against smokers but only asking to participate in the major cost for society of their lifestyle.

Finally I repeat again that we're talking about universal healthcare, people cannot be kicked out but they would just have to pay more taxes if they are in position to do so and will be offered help to quit and as I mentioned, it's proven that making smoking more expensive, it makes people quit so it would save lives.

--------------------------------

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-26 22:58:46 :

I don't get how what you're agueing is any different from what we have now. Smokers do pay more in tax via their purchases. They are encouraged to quit by the state. The numbers of people smoking are reducing, especially in Europe and US. The problem is slowly going away because smoking is too expensive and dangerous and society doesn't tolerate it, does it need further intervention?

Currently it seems obesity costs the healthcare system more than smoking, but they both seem very high. I think targeting these people for higher taxes or more ridicule is difficult and counter productive. Both smoking and obesity have an element of choice and an element of genetic predisposition. Both occur much more prevalently in the poor. And in both the most suffers report a willingness to change, they are just struggling to fight the addiction. These people have just as much rights to healthcare as any other citizen. 

Whilst insurance prices go up for dangerous jobs such as polo player or russian journalist, no one expects you to pay more tax to cover your inevitable medical bills. Why should dangerous hobbies be any different? Should our government make such judgements on our private lifestyles? If I want to chop my fingers off in my shed with rusty gardening equipment, I'm not breaking any laws. It will cost a lot of money for the doctors to graft them back on, but they're doing their job. After one visit should my taxes go up to ensure I pay for my surgery before I die? 

Should we all be on specific complicated individual tax rates to reflect our likely cost to the healthcare system, chance to require state appointed legal aid, probability of having kids and their fair share of the wear and tear to the local swings... Or should we tell the state to butt out and give us the freedom to make bad decisions and enjoy life? I'm very happy to pay healthcare taxes that cover the needs of addicts and fat people as much as yoga instructors and nuns.

--------------------------------

Galious @ 2021-02-26 23:59:30 :

My point is that you told me that current taxes cover the cost of smoking and I want to punish smokers when I've given you the numbers proving **it's not the case at all**. It's a common misconception. Then yes I could have the same debate about obesity though it's a more complex topic because studies are even more complicated even if the cost is probably comparable.

And I'm repeating it again and again: all your hobby examples are almost anecdotal in comparison of the big trio of Smoke, Obesity and Alcohol. The cost to society of people running too much and crazy people cutting their fingers is negligible. So yes we could have panel of experts making calls for individual case if it's worth the cost because if doctors tell someone like your brother in law that he must get psychological aid or pay extra premium, I would be fine with it but again: it's anecdotal.
 
And I'm repeating again (and again and for the last time) we're not discussing here the question of kicking people out of healthcare and letting them die, we're talking about extra premium and extra taxes through VAT to motivate people to quit as it's proven that it works.

In other words: if a smoker cost the society 10000€/year because of his life style and we decide to make him pay 1000-2000€ and offer him free help to get healthier, it's not immoral at all. If polo players must pay an extra cost on their yearly Polo club subscription because it's statistically dangerous, I don't have any problem. We're still paying for them in the end and just ask for a participation.

Finally it's easy to say that you're fine with telling you're happy with paying people take bad decision and enjoy their life as you might persuade yourself you're really someone nice and cool but are you sure you're actually helping people by financing the thing that will statistically kill them? and do you think it's the best use for the money? because we're living in a world with limited spending and one person might get a negative answer for the ethical comity of the hopital for his 3 millions treatment because we're paying hundred of people 'enjoying their life"" smoking or the money you spend of the stupid person cutting his finger for fun could be used to finance a school in Namibia. I let you think about which is the best use...

--------------------------------

the_hucumber @ 2021-02-27 06:32:37 :

Why would money earmarked for healthcare go to building schools abroad? Surely that's the foreign aid budget. Are you suggesting taxes from cigarettes should fund foreign aid?

--------------------------------

Galious @ 2021-02-27 07:31:59 :

I’m just saying that we’re living in a society where money isn’t unlimited so when you say you’re happy to pay for smokers I’m saying: ok we’re not gonna let them die but when you think about it: imagine what you could do with all the money we spend to finance their life style.

In the end I think I’m just angry at you that we’re talking about things that kill 10-15 millions people world wide and eat up 6-8% of GDP and you use words like “people enjoying life” 

What fucking colossal tragedy it is and you, like many seems so used to it that you’re ok with it.

If we just let people like what they like, do what they want, and dress how they want, like we should, then there wouldn't be a reason for people to feel like they were born the wrong gender.

Let's stop arguing. It's pointless."	1	0	stop arguing comment					"The hadiths make it clear that he took his wife Aisha for marriage when she was 6. Many Muhammad apologists try to say she was actually much older and the Hadiths in question can't be trusted since they aren't ""the word of Allah"".. even though many are first hand accounts of the girl herself. By following the logic that the hadiths can't be trusted  then we would have little to no knowledge of Muhammad himself and also getting rid of the hadiths turns the Quran into mound of disconnected contextless writings. The Hadith's in question :

* Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13) Sahih Bukhari 8:73:151
* 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old. Sahih Muslim 8:3311
* A’ishah said : I used to play with dolls. Sometimes the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered upon me when the girls were with me. When he came in, they went out, and when he went out, they came in."" Sunan Abu Dawud 4913 (Ahmad Hasan Ref)
* It was narrated that 'Aishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."" (Sahih) Sunan an-Nasa'i 4:26:3380
* It was narrated that 'Aishah said: ""I used to play with dolls when I was with the Messenger of Allah, and he used to bring my friends to me to play with me."" (Sahih) Sunan Ibn Majah 3:9:198
* Aisha said she was nine years old when the act of consummation took place and she had her dolls with her. Mishkat al-Masabih, Vol. 2, p 77

Many defenders also like to point to the context at the time being normal for child brides to take place. Agreed! It was! However again he is a prophet and he is the most moral of all men, there is no way to in todays day and age give him a pass and say its ok to that he only be held to the standards of the society around him at the time, He was founding an entire religion, he was a ""holy man"" so he should be rightly held to a higher standard, to which he has failed.

I heard that non muslims could get their own areas to govern but I think that only applies to Christians and jews.


Intersex people choose male or female eventually so I think they can get married.

Besides money, what does a wealthy person have that a poor person doesn't? TIME. Time to research which foods are cheapest and most healthy. Time to shop for the best bargains. Time to prep and cook. Also time to exercise! It is a privilege to have time in your day to dedicate to living and eating healthier.

vettewiz @ 2021-04-28 18:05:33 :

But that’s not reality for the majority of people. Not even close. Wealthy people, on average, work far more hours weekly than poorer people.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2021-04-28 18:08:11 :

I mean, at the point where you’re wealthy enough to afford things like good child care, you can work more hours without the same impact on the rest of your life. It’s not really a good comparison to just add up the hours.

The main point wasn't that they work more; it was that they have less free time.

But they have MORE free time. Poorer people spend more time on leisure. 

They work less, and have substantially less to take care of.

speedyjohn @ 2021-04-28 20:39:45 :

Only one of those articles—the last one—deals with actual free time. All the other ones look at working hours, which, as mentioned, is not the same thing.

And that last article cite to one paper, which found that *less educated* people tend to have more leisure hours in their week. Not low earners.

--------------------------------

vettewiz @ 2021-04-28 22:26:55 :

All of those talk about low income people working less. Which naturally means they have more free time. 

Less educated is also strongly correlated with low income.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2021-04-28 22:32:06 :

As I mentioned above, working less doesn't naturally mean you have more free time. Low income people have things other than work—such as child care—to attend to. It's easier to work long hours when you're paying a nanny to be home with the kids.

And, as I pointed out in another comment, you can't say ""Leisure time and income are both correlated with education, therefore they're correlated with each other"" due to [Simpson's paradox.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)

--------------------------------

vettewiz @ 2021-04-28 22:36:16 :

Less than 4% of Americans have Nannies. That’s not really part of a reasonable conversation. Low income people have far less to worry about. 

They work less. They rent their homes so they don’t have to care for them. They don’t have to mow their lawns. They don’t have to take care of pools and gardens. The vast majority of people take care of kids after work - it just so happens that lower income people work less. 


Please stop arguing that lower income people have less free time. They factually have more leisure time than the higher income groups. I just do not see how you can argue otherwise against the data."	"vettewiz @ 2021-04-28 22:39:04 :

Attending college is completely voluntary. Attending school prior to college is mandatory, and thus available for free. Once you use something that you purchased you can no longer ask for a refund. Please stop arguing in bad faith or I will stop replying.	1	0	stop arguing comment					"So I'm currently attending university, I've managed to get half off tuition, and whatever I wasn't able to cover, I've taken out student loans calculating that they should be paid off within 3-4 years, 2 if I live frugally with my parents. Now I've seen this question answered many times and seen many of the common responses, but I haven't seen people or articles adequitely respond to these kinds of points, so I'd like to know why my way of thinking is wrong, flawed.

1. Student debt will help price control universities

a. Once we forgive student loans, and have the US government pay for it, colleges will now be incentivized to jack up their prices, hoping that the US government will bail out students again. The astronomical prices of universities are forced by supply and demand, and while the situation does suck, they are interested in maximizing profit. And if they get a free 50k per student, what's stopping them from boosting their prices to 100k per student, hoping that the government forgives it and pays it to the university? The current policy propsed under Biden does not try to address this issue, and I think it will be extremely difficult to enact bills on the federal level to try to fix this. 

 2. Student debt cancellation will boost the economy

a. Forgiving debt in general will boost the economy so that people will spend. If this is the case, why can't we forgive credit card debt? The average monthly mortgage payment is 1017$, why can't we forgive that? I'm simply stating that it's impractical to forgive those kinds of debts because they will have a negative impact of price gouging like point 1, plus people naturally agree that if you borrow 30,000$ to buy a car, you should pay it back. So why is student loan forgiveness the exception?

3. Everyone who doesn't agree is a selfish asshole

a. I really don't agree with this talking point. You can't simply name-call people who have genuine concerns over this. Some people who genuinely gave up possible career paths in college because it was too expensive, or sacrificed years of their early adulthood have vices with the policy, and it's not productive to simply hurl insults at them. I'm for other government incentives such as increased minimum wage, guaranteed community college, but this is a policy that I believe is a bit too radical for my tastes. My point in bringing this up is that if you can explain why people against student loan forgiveness is morally wrong, I will try to understand. 

4. Once this is an option, people will be more open to pursuing passions. 

a. If this were the case, why would anyone try to pursue degrees in engineering, computer science, Law, or medicine. I understand that some people genuinely enjoy these career paths, but I know an overwhelming majority of people who are pursuing these majors because of the income, and that they need to get their money's worth for hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Due to supply and demand, we'd have a lot more art or film students because those majors are enjoyable, but a lot fewer scientists and engineers despite a growing demand for them, and that would undoubtedly have a negative impact on US growth."

You can stop replying anytime you like, but I don't think you're addressing the underlying question of why people should or shouldn't have to pay for something. 

What makes students paying to attend university preferable to it being free for them?

--------------------------------

PassionVoid @ 2021-04-30 19:55:24 :

If you want to go down that road, why should people pay for anything? It's a disingenuous argument. There is nothing inherent about higher education that should make it free. It's a voluntary service that needs to be paid for, so why should the people using it not be the ones paying for it? 

Also, making college free and canceling student debt are two different things.

--------------------------------

Vesurel @ 2021-04-30 20:03:58 :

&gt;If you want to go down that road, why should people pay for anything? It's a disingenuous argument.

What's disingenuous about it, if you think something should be paid for I'd be curious why you think that's better than it being free?

&gt;It's a voluntary service that needs to be paid for, so why should the people using it not be the ones paying for it?

The people who get educated aren't the only people affected by how accesable education is, or who benifit from people being educated. If there's more capacity to pay for something on mass than at the individual level, and that's something that people on mass would benifit from then I can see an argument that it's preferable it be paid for collectivly.

PassionVoid @ 2021-04-30 20:13:24 :

&gt; What's disingenuous about it, if you think something should be paid for I'd be curious why you think that's better than it being free?

It's disingenuous because you've framed the argument as ""paid is preferable for the students"" when no one on Earth is arguing that. I've already explicitly stated like three times now why I believe it should be paid for. 

&gt;The people who get educated aren't the only people affected by how accesable education is, or who benifit from people being educated.

They benefit the most from it. There is an argument to be made that having a more educated society is better for the greater good, but even within that argument the educated reap more rewards from education than the uneducated. Why should they not then pay for that added benefits received by personally taking advantage of higher education?

When did I say for the students? I'm specifically trying to get at why you think the situation where people pay is preferable for you? How are you benifiting from people having to pay to be educated? What's your stake in this?

&gt;Why should they not then pay for that added benefits received by personally taking advantage of higher education?

Why put a barrier in front of people who want to do something that's benificial for socicity as a whole.

People who get lung cancer benifit the most for chemo, but that doesn't mean we don't also benifit from people who need chemo being able to have it without needing to risk going into debt.

There seems to be this idea that the person who should pay is the person who benifits the most, as opposed to the person most able to pay and I'm not sure why.

&gt;When did I say for the students? I'm specifically trying to get at why you think the situation where people pay is preferable for you? How are you benifiting from people having to pay to be educated? What's your stake in this?

It’s preferable to me because not only does it keep my tax burden lower, but it also preserves my scarcity, and thus earning potential, as a college educated individual. 

&gt;Why put a barrier in front of people who want to do something that's benificial for socicity as a whole.

Because somebody has to pay for it. Again, for the billionth time, it should be the people using it. 

&gt;People who get lung cancer benifit the most for chemo, but that doesn't mean we don't also benifit from people who need chemo being able to have it without needing to risk going into debt.

That’s why insurance covers chemo treatment, but doesn’t cover breast implants. The former is necessary, the latter is voluntary. 

&gt;There seems to be this idea that the person who should pay is the person who benifits the most, as opposed to the person most able to pay and I'm not sure why.

Yea that’s how buying things works. You really don’t understand this mindset? Pointless to discuss with you. Your counter arguments don’t address my stance at all, and you still haven’t addressed the fact that free college and student debt cancellation are not the same, so what’s the point?

Vesurel @ 2021-05-01 06:46:19 :

&gt;It’s preferable to me because not only does it keep my tax burden lower, but it also preserves my scarcity, and thus earning potential, as a college educated individual.

So you benifit from education being harder to get because it means you can earn more money as someone who could afford to be educated?

&gt;That’s why insurance covers chemo treatment, but doesn’t cover breast implants. The former is necessary, the latter is voluntary.

Why is that a meaningful distinction, and how are you deciding what you count as necessary. Because I'd say it's pretty necessary we have doctors, so I'm not sure why we'd want to limit potential doctors to people who can pay to be doctors themselves? 


&gt;Yea that’s how buying things works. You really don’t understand this mindset? 

I understand that's how you think, I just don't see why that's optimal.

&gt;Your counter arguments don’t address my stance at all,

That's because these aren't counter arguments, these are questions to establish why you believe what you do.

&gt;and you still haven’t addressed the fact that free college and student debt cancellation are not the same, so what’s the point?

Because I'm interested in the question of whether or nor people should pay for education. In the case where people shouldn't have to pay for education then they shouldn't have had to go into debt in the first place so they shouldn't have to pay back.

But again if you don't want to answer my questions you could stop anytime, it's not my job to tell you want the point is."

&gt;With that out of the way, I see a lot of dislike around the tactics used by the pro-life movement: 1. Standing outside Planned Parenthood clinics with signs and yelling how abortion is murder. 2. Distributing pamphlets and material in churches and other places heavily enforcing how abortion is one of the greatest sins ever. 3. Pushing to pass highly restrictive legislation that doesn’t exempt for any specific situations (like rape).

&gt;While I fundamentally disagree with the underlying beliefs of the Pro-Life movement, I can’t disagree with their tactics because they’re based on their belief that Abortion, as soon as conception has occurred, is murdering babies. Imagine if someone came up to you and said ‘X’ thing results in dead babies, you’d do everything in your power to stop ‘X’, no matter how inconvenient it might be for either yourself or what you’d be doing to others. Cause dead babies!

To go with an extreme example.

Many terrorists, murderers, nazis and neonazis, other groups that committed genocide, and so on , that genuinly believed in the ideologies that supported those actions.

But you don't have to ""hand it to them"".    
The genuine belief in an ideology that causes you to commit despicable actions is not an excuse that erases the harm those actions create.      

So sure.
They might believe that their actions are justified.
But that doesn't mean that everyone else must agree.

Everyone else is free to think that they're comitting harm to support bad ideas.

wadakow @ 2021-06-08 14:45:32 :

Using this same logic, you could also argue that supporters of abortion have effectively dehumanized the unborn babies, convincing themselves that they're nothing more than a tumor inside the pregnant mother, and with this collective belief, they then commit genocide on the unborn babies. It goes both ways, so I don't think this argument holds.

With abortion you end up having to weigh the value of the life of the mother and the fetus against each other. There’s no way around it. Those against abortion believe the fetus’s potential for life is more valuable than the autonomy of the pregnant person. That’s it.

--------------------------------

pleethe @ 2021-06-08 16:09:20 :

&gt;With abortion you end up having to weigh the value of the life of the mother and the fetus against each other. 

nope, pro-life is simple. it states that the best option is where no human life involved in the pregnancy is ended unnecessarily. 

abortion always kills the fetus. while, delivery rarely leads to the death of the mother. 

if delivery becomes a threat to the mother's life, that is when you weigh the value of the life of the mother and the fetus against each other (when an actual **dilemma** appears). in that case, the mother's life would be more valuable, as she has much more connections/abilities on the line, as opposed to the new human life.

if you disagree with the premise that a fetus is a human life, I would like to hear your arguments. Human life starts at conception, that is the most philosophically consistent line to draw, that most scientists would agree with.

--------------------------------

yukon_cornelius_75 @ 2021-06-08 16:15:22 :

The mother’s life isn’t the issue. It’s her bodily autonomy; her ability to decide what happens inside her own body. 

I believe that is more valuable than the life of a fetus that is under the age of viability. So I believe killing that fetus is the best choice if that is what the mother wants. Her choice is more valuable than that life.

It takes *two* people to have a child, yet you’re putting all responsibility on the mother. 

Citizens have the right of body autonomy, so that the government cannot *force* parents to undergo an organ transplant, skin graft, or blood transfusion, even if their child would die without it. For this same reason, the government cannot deprive a women of rights for 9 months, and force her to undergo an extremely invasive, painful, and often expensive medical procedure for the sole benefit of her child.

yes dude, when ur asleep, ur cerebral blood flow is decreased, brain waves are slower, and many parts of the brain are deactivated.

uglylizards @ 2021-06-08 20:43:51 :

You’re ignoring the fact that during sleep we cycle through difference wave patterns, including fast wave REM sleep. It can’t be said that there’s minimal brain activity during sleep as a whole. Also, EEG patterns resembling sleep patterns is a sign of a good prognosis (might wake up) for a minimally conscious patient, whereas the absence of these patterns is a sign of a bad prognosis. Although, the original premise was ignorant regardless. Take someone who has been anesthetized: obviously that is not the same as someone who is a persistent minimally conscious state in that it is transient- they would be conscious without the anesthesia and will be conscious once it’s gone. A fetus at a certain stage isn’t in a transient state- it hasn’t developed the ability to have this brain activity at all. Whether it will in the future or not is irrelevant to the fact that at that time, it is entirely incapable of the brain activity required for consciousness."

&gt; Do you know how many black people get into college JUST for being black?

Do you?

&gt; Do you know how many times I’ve seen people post on social media “black gay trans woman at risk of homelessness. Please help venmo in bio”

If someone has been stabbed and there are calls to help treat the wound on the street, do you say that person has privilege over someone else who has been stabbed and has already gone to the doctors?

&gt;“We need to hire more black employees” well great, but are they as qualified as the white person who just interviewed, if so, great, hire them! They deserve that. But if they’re not, then just hire them because they’re black who cares if they’re qualified or not.

Do you have any statistics that black people get hired more than white people when they both have the same qualifications (or lack of them)?  I know just offhand that there are studies that show that simply having a ""black"" name means someone gets far less call backs for interviews as an identical CV with a ""white"" name.

&gt;Notice how BLM is a movement against police brutality but more white people than black people get killed by the police?

There are more white people than black people.  We should expect roughly 5 white people to die for every black person (I believe it's roughly 50% white people, 14% black people, although the specific numbers aren't that important here) but we see closer to 2 to 1.  Black people are killed at higher *rates* than white people.

Your other claims are less easily quantified, so I'll leave those.

It seems to me that you make a lot of unverified claims here.  I know offhand that several are wrong, and you haven't provided any evidence for the others.

Personally I believe that a lot of cops are stupid, don't like black people and are more likely to shoot them.  But this stat doesn't take into account the rate at which the two races interact with police. Its higher among blacks.

Personage1 @ 2021-06-10 23:43:12 :

Police stop black drivers significantly more than white drivers when the sun is up and they are able to see that the driver is black, but not at night when they can't see the race of the driver. Meaning race is often the determining factor for why black drivers are pulled over. [[LINK]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0858-1)

Unarmed black people are 3.49 times as likely to be killed as unarmed white people and local crime rates have zero effect on this statistic. [[LINK]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854)

Police in oakland find contraband at the same rate regardless of the race of the person, but search black drivers 4x more often. [[LINK]](https://stanford.app.box.com/v/Data-for-Change)

When we look into it we find that the reason black people interact more with police is.....racism.

Stop arguing against the thread in your head and stick to what's posted"	41	0	stop arguing comment					"I was reading this article: https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/18/opinions/down-syndrome-cheerleading-photo-utah-perry/index.html. and all this person seems to care about is the special needs kid's experience. 

I want to start off by saying I do not think the girl with down syndrome should be excluded from the yearbook photo for her perspective squad. If she didn't make varsity and was on the backup squad then her photo should be on the squad that her skills allowed her to participate at. Which it seems is what happened from the article. But if she couldn't do the moves required to be varsity or on any squad then they gave her a nice photo to keep for memories and published the varsity only photo. 

But the author goes on to describe his special needs son and how he was ""discriminated"" against. Like being in choir but he likes to dance and move around while the choir that practiced hard to create a show for their families has the spotlight stolen by a distraction. He says they allowed him on stage for a couple of songs but then he was told to come off stage. Which seems completely reasonable. At some point the show should be about the kids that have practiced for months and not the disabled kid dancing with a choir in the background. When are the able bodied kid's parents allowed to snap their photos for their memories if your son is not participating in line with everyone else? He even goes on to say his son is a non speaking autistic boy so he literally could not participate correctly and they still included him in a program about singing. He also states his sons dancing is a delight to all the audience members and only the teacher saw a problem with it. What a big assumption. 

He also implies disabled children should be allowed to compete in competitive sports. So how does that go? Hey we are putting in our disabled kid as defensive line can you tell everyone not to try their best so we can give him some feel good memories? Hey we are putting our disabled kid in as pitcher because he really likes throwing the ball can you not smash a homer on him? At what point is hindering 60 other people's time so that your child can be in the spotlight enough?

My daughter currently has 3 disabled children in her 8th grade classes. She says you can tell right away because they have a helper with them at all times and her classes are being constantly disrupted by the special needs kid's. She has had her hair pulled by a disabled kid. Saw two disabled kids stabbing each other with pencils to the point a resource officer had to be stationed in her math class the remainder of the year. And even has one disabled kid who soils himself and doesn't shower in 3 of her classes which heavily disrupts her ability to learn. 


I believe inclusion ends where other kids progress and hard work is being undermined. The people with disabled children seem not to care about the disruptions as long as their child gets to pretend they are normal; while my daughter has to compete in the real world where her grades and extracurriculars matter for her future. Does hurting 26 other kids future outweigh helping one disabled kid do slightly better in class? I do not believe so. 

My mom, aunt and cousin have been teaching for 20 years or more each and all of them say that teaching with 29 kids and 1 or 2 disabled kids is damn near impossible. The normal class was already challenging. Now tell kids that they have one period  to take a test while one kid screams every couple of minutes and is actively fighting his para. Tell the kids they have to get over the unrelenting smell of teenage bo and poop in their pants and just focus on taking their itbs test.

Its not ableist to exclude disruptive kids from what an entire group is doing if they cannot participate properly. Its disableist to believe that your special needs child trumps everyone else's experiences and hardwork because you think they deserve it regardless of those other children and their parents feelings."

I've got a son with autism and I was fine with the first half of your statements but the second half is where I gotta step in and argue, rather forcefully because of what you're insinuating.

&gt;I believe inclusion ends where other kids progress and hard work is being undermined. The people with disabled children seem not to care about the disruptions as long as their child gets to pretend they are normal; while my daughter has to compete in the real world where her grades and extracurriculars matter for her future. Does hurting 26 other kids future outweigh helping one disabled kid do slightly better in class? I do not believe so. 

So what then? Do we go back to the 1980s where you just let children be excluded based upon arbitrary levels of skill? What happened back then was that regardless of your level of disability, if you were autistic, had Down syndrome, CP, MS, even dyslexia for some... you were put in the 'special needs' classroom. This is what you are arguing for? That the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?

It's very disappointing that you feel your daughter's value is over what my son's is. On a human scale that's rather disappointing. From a moral standpoint even more disappointing. Do you not think that my son's grades and his outlook on life is even more challenging and therefore might need MORE help not less? Your view that him being in the classroom somehow lowers her chance to succeed in life is flawed. Does she not have to deal with all kinds of people in life when she's in the real world? Or is she somehow going to be sheltered throughout her life so as not to have to deal with people who have less value in your mind.

&gt;My mom, aunt and cousin have been teaching for 20 years or more each and all of them say that teaching with 29 kids and 1 or 2 disabled kids is damn near impossible. The normal class was already challenging. Now tell kids that they have one period to take a test while one kid screams every couple of minutes and is actively fighting his para. Tell the kids they have to get over the unrelenting smell of teenage bo and poop in their pants and just focus on taking their itbs test.

That is a failure of the school system, not of the classroom. Each student has an IEP or a 504 plan. In it, it explains very clearly what can and can't be done to help a child out. If a child is disrupting the classroom in such a situation, there should be a process or an alternative written inside of it. If not, that's a failure of the school to provide assistance to the teacher, not a failure of the student to somehow adapt in a way that they have not yet achieved.

For example, my son can't write quickly. He's in 2nd grade now. He uses an aide to write out his words and is taken out of the classroom to help practice. Another child might need to be in a sensory room to take a test. Or they might assign that child to an aide to do a test in the hallway as my son has done before. If a child is suffering from BO/etc then that's something that is a MUST have in the IEP. As well, those are not something that just stays in the classroom, but usually those are handled by the nurse station, which again is a failure of the school to provide help for the teacher.

&gt;Its not ableist to exclude disruptive kids from what an entire group is doing if they cannot participate properly. Its disableist to believe that your special needs child trumps everyone else's experiences and hardwork because you think they deserve it regardless of those other children and their parents feelings.

Agreed. It's not ableist to make changes for those who cannot adjust to the needs of the classroom. It IS ableist to simply view those children as lost causes who are secondary to the needs of your child because of some view that your child will be successful and the other has very little chance of doing so.

No child left behind. That doesn't mean that you hold typically behaving children back. It means that you put into place assistance for those who cannot yet achieve the same education without help. You give water wings to those kids who can't swim in a pool yet. It's a rather concerning thought to just let those kids drown since they're never going to be Olympic swimmers. 

Because simply shoving those children into a classroom was how we treated them in the 70s/80s. And it didn't work then. 

I do wish you'd view those kids with a better light. Many children with special needs grow up and develop into well rounded individuals in society. The issue is what you view as success. Which really isn't the point of elementary/high school. That's literally the minimum amount of education the state has determined you need to function well in society.

OP is proposing a _class system_ that controls for the _things that contribute to performance_.  

If you take men who are shorter, slower and whatever other factors are used to determine the classes in hurdles and put them in with women who are the same height and speed and have the same leaping ability and so on  they will _perform the same_ because the class is determined by the factors that determine performance.

There is NO QUESTION that men will outperform women.  The topic is about finding the classes that make sense to determine what matters in sport performance.  If you get that right, then ""sex"" ceases to be the line, but you'll have pretty mediocre men in the same class as the top performing women. 

This is just like how boxing does it, but weight wouldn't do the trick because we know that there are factors in male physiology vs. female physiology that explain that ""weight"" doesn't tell the whole story.  A women of 110 pounds is significantly less powerful than a man of 110 - not even close.  So...the class would have to include power.

Even in the same weight class, there are physiologic differences between sexes. Males will still have benefit.

The main issue is that people see current divisions as gender divisions, but they are truly sex divisions. That's why adding transgender people to a different sex class does not work, because although they are a different gender, they cannot change their sex.

This is how this sub works. It's dialogue. 

When doing that, you will inevitably then completely exclude females from competing. Or you just superficially change the names.

If you keep saying that ""but"" then it sure seems like you're not understanding OP's position.  He is not unaware that men will in general do better at sports than men.

sapphireminds @ 2021-06-24 03:43:20 :

There is no such thing though. There will be more mediocre males who can qualify at the different levels, which means females are effectively eliminated. Objective criteria like weight or size will still not account for sexual differences. That's why it's not going to be possible

That said, I have a pretty privileged background and none of these issues have impacted my life directly, so I will definitely have pretty big gaps in my understanding. I have made what I think is an honest effort to understand both sides of this debate (which seems to have been set off by a couple recent reddit/twitter posts and the Oli London video), and I feel like I'm reaching a completely different conclusion to the people close to me (and online) that I tend to agree with, so I want to challenge my thinking.

In general I am 100% fine with people being cisgender, transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid, transsexual, or whatever else as long as they are doing it in good faith.\* Not everybody thinks this way, obviously, so we have this big cultural change underway as people come to grips with gender identity.  Big cultural shifts tend to create really challenging social/cultural knock-on effects. In my mind, this question about racial identity and being transracial is one of them. I don't think there are easy answers for a lot of these questions, but I think we owe it to eachother to listen, explore, communicate, and compromise. The conversations that I've seen so far on the topic of racial identity are far from honest, with arguments like: ""Gender dysphoria is a part of psychology \[and racial dysphoria isn't\]""[0](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3daui1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (Gender dysphoria wasn't either, 50 years ago); ""Culture and heritage however is lived through communities. It can be  appropriated and abused. A white British person claiming to be  trans-Korean diminishes the experiences and burdens of actual Korean people and communities.""[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3dc4wt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (Gender has a massive cultural component), ""Race and Ethnicity is Rooted in Ancestry… You Can’t Just Pick and Choose"" [2](https://medium.com/verve-up/transracial-is-not-the-new-transgender-why-race-and-gender-are-not-synonymous-b2c688ef0fae) (sounds a lot like the 'gender is rooted in biology' argument to me) and ""We also think that, as a result of this asymmetry, transgender identities deserve social uptake and so-called “transracial”  identifications as Black almost always do not. (We leave space for  unique circumstances in which someone who has deeply invested in a Black community and been forthcoming about their racial history is nevertheless accepted within that community as Black.)""[3](http://bostonreview.net/race-philosophy-religion-gender-sexuality/robin-dembroff-dee-payton-why-we-shouldnt-compare)[4](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp) (there's obviously massive differences, but this argument isn't fundamentally different to arguing that trans women aren't women because they haven't grown up having periods, experiencing sexism, etc).

Setting aside (for now) the existing use of 'transracial' used in the context of adopted children raised outside of their biological parents' ethnic/racial cultures, I think that being transracial is similar in a lot of ways to being transgender or transexual, and I don't see how that de-legitimizes either of those things. I think there's a lot of fear on the left that this comparison makes the transgender/transsexual struggle look somehow ridiculous or absurd by association [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called\_it/) and I guess I can see why people might think that, but it feels like either an unhelpful gut reaction, or (being a bit pessimistic) an overly political/strategic reaction which looks a lot like [throwing the ladder down](https://thomasnastcartoons.com/2015/01/06/throwing-down-the-ladder-by-which-they-rose-23-july-1870/). Every new cultural idea is uncomfortable at first, but we don't know if it has any merit if we don't explore it in good faith. I think it's also a missed opportunity to better understand trans/identity in general

As for the other (original) definition of transracial -- adopted children raised outside their biological parents' culture/race -- I think it's a really interesting bridge between transsexual identity politics and transracial (the other/new definition) identity politics, because there are hundreds of thousands of cases of transracial adoption, and I'm sure we could learn a lot about culture and identity if we asked them about it.  I expect some of these children experience very real, very complicated dysphoria \[citation needed, obviously\].

I don't know if the likes of Rachel Dolezal, Oli London, Ja Du, Ekundayo, etc are charlatans or people in genuine turmoil deserving of, if not our sympathy, at least our patience. What I do know is that this kind of tectonic cultural shift has happened enough times throughout history that I think I want to hedge my bets and at least be kind.

Edit: I'm adding this to clarify my title/view because I think there's some ambiguity and this more succinctly captures the view I want challenged (thanks /u/Rufus_Reddit)

&gt; It seems like what you're looking for is some kind of salient difference
that justifies having one attitude about trans-gender and another
attitude about trans-racial identity. In other words, you're looking
for something that somehow makes it ""right"" to push for transgender
rights and recognition, but that isn't readily paralleled when when we
look at trans-racial issues instead.

Edit 2: I've stopped being able to keep up with speed of the discussion, but I'm doing my best. I've saved threads that I want to respond to and will try to get to all of them eventually. Thanks everyone for investing so much time trying to help me learn.

Edit 3: I only mentioned specific transracial people because they've been driving the conversation by being very public. I have to assume that if there are transracial people out there (and I believe there are) they just want to lead happy (and most likely private) lives free from ridicule.


\*Quick aside:  I don't say ""as long as it isn't hurting anyone"" because I've observed that change hurts, and a lot of people are experiencing real pain caused by this big cultural shift in favor of trans rights and that's unavoidable. However, I think there will always be charlatans out there who take advantage of the opportunity that any big disruption creates, so that's why I say 'in good faith'. You can pick your example of this, from people 'playing the race card' to children setting their screen names to 'Connecting...' to get out of zoom/skype classes during a pandemic. Big changes create opportunities."	"fox-mcleod @ 2021-06-30 14:29:37 :

It’s pretty straightforward. There is good evidence to believe that gender dysphoria exists and more importantly that transitioning is the best medical response to it. 

There is no evidence to suggest that transitioning race is therapeutic. So why should society change to accommodate it?

Once a society decides to accommodate a more sophisticated conception of gender vs sex, there’s no reason to require people without dysphoria to conform to older conceptions — you certainly *could* do that for the sake of conformity, but now it’s a choice for the society to make. Nothing of the sort has happened with race — and in fact, we seem to have a less sophisticated understanding of race vs ethnicity vs population as time goes on (a lot of what you’re describing is actually ethnicity not race).

I'm saying there's no evidence that racial dysphoria is treated by racial transitioning because it's a new phenomenon *and the existence of things to study in the first place is only just now coming into being*.

Disingenuous misinterpretations aside of course.  I know you are fully aware one person isn't sufficient to conduct a study with society wide implications, so your disingenuous question about Dolezal doesn't even deserve a response, but I'm feeling generous.

Disingenuous intentional misinterpretations are infantile.  Please don't embarrass yourself like that, I get secondhand embarassment

But that’s *my* argument…

--------------------------------

DevilTuna @ 2021-07-01 14:30:53 :

Your argument was ""why should society change to accommodate it"" (given that there hasn't been a study.

My argument is that, since there CANT be a study until the thing manifests to a significant level in the first place, maybe ""we shouldn't accommodate its manifested in levels sufficient to have a study"" isn't the way to go.  Because historically, a couple decades later, we all end up looking like intolerant assholes.

I don't think studies are the be all end all of what society should accept *ethically*, because studies are conducted by *individuals who have their own ethical motivations in the first place*.  I'm never going to let a social ""scientist"" tell me what's write and wrong in the end anyway.  That's not something the scientific process can determine.

Not to mention, accommodation just means tolerance.  Doesn't mean acceptance and support.  And one could realistically assume that if some sort of identity dysphoria could be treated by merely changing physical appearances, then it would hold true across the board.  Why wouldn't it

I’m having trouble getting through that sentence.

That’s survivorship bias. The way to know the future is the do the research.

I'm never going to let a social ""scientist"" tell me what's write and wrong in the end anyway.  That's not something the scientific process can determine.

Listen, at bottom, either your ethics are based on fact finding or they’re just a power struggle. Does what makes something true depend on what the world is actually like or not? If it’s not, I have no way of convincing others to change their behavior other than by coercive force. And I’m just not into that.

--------------------------------

DevilTuna @ 2021-07-01 15:22:05 :

That was a whole lot of arguments rooted in nebulous evocative terms and subjective labels.

Ethics aren't rooted in fact finding, because nothing is factually good or evil.  Those are subjective human constructs...largely dictated by the society we grew up in.

That would be the reason the Sambia thought it was perfectly legit to whip young boys and compel them to suck off their elders to obtain manhood, and why you think it's fucked up.  Nothing to do with fact, everything to do with the cultures you were raised in.  You weren't (and still aren't, frankly) reading scientific dissertations as a child in order to determine punching someone in the face was ""wrong"""

I see that justification a bit. The issue with that is that 8/10 times, social norms will dictate that the man is the one asking the woman so the man will be the one paying. 1/10 of the time the woman may initiate the date but it will be on a way that the man still asks (Do you want to take me out) so he’ll still end up paying. Then the last 1/10 of the time the woman may ask the man out but chances are he’ll still end up paying. Even if she does pay that extremely rare

--------------------------------

soulangelic @ 2021-10-03 06:17:58 :

Where are you getting these statistics?

--------------------------------

Team-First @ 2021-10-03 06:21:27 :

A bit generalized but here: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-how-and-why-sex-differences/201104/why-dont-women-ask-men-out-first-dates


“As noted in the histogram, a great majority of the women, 93 percent, preferred to be asked out — only 6 percent preferred to do the asking. The majority of men preferred to do the asking, 83 percent, while 16 percent preferred to be asked out on a date.”

“As can be seen in the histogram, males reported significantly more instances of asking someone out in the past year. On average, males asked four women out on a first date in the past year. In contrast, most females did not ask anyone out on a first date in the past year.”

--------------------------------

soulangelic @ 2021-10-03 06:27:43 :

Okay. Now two more questions.

The first: how old are you?

The second: The source you provided says that 83% of men PREFER to do the asking. If it’s their preference, then it would seem that they don’t see asking a woman out as a burden. There shouldn’t be any issues if most men are fine with being the ones that extend the invitation.

And, the source you provided also says nothing about paying—just about who asks who out. That takes care of your first “8/10” men, but it does nothing to address that:

 “1/10 of the time the woman may initiate the date but it will be in a  way that the man still asks so he’ll still end up paying” 

or 

“1/10 of the time the woman may ask the man out but chances are he’ll still end up paying”.

In fact, with your math, that makes 100% of the time that a woman either won’t pay or won’t offer to split the check — which is just blatantly untrue.

--------------------------------

Team-First @ 2021-10-03 06:36:59 :

Why does my age matter? 

Yes most men prefer to ask women out (probably because they know women won’t). And yeah I’m responding to your comment that said the asker should be the one paying and I’m pointing out that men are the ones who ask the vast vast majority of the time. 

I also said “chances are the man will end up paying” meaning it may not be 100% of the time but it’s most of the time

--------------------------------

soulangelic @ 2021-10-03 06:40:28 :

Your age matters because people make more money (money to spend on dates) as they get older. That, and the younger you are, the less experience with dating you have. 

You can’t assume that most men prefer to ask women out “probably because they know women won’t”. You do not know that. You are assuming based on your own pre-set biases.

I’ll repeat my question: if 83% of men prefer to extend the invitation, and etiquette suggest that the inviter be the one that pays, why is it a problem that men typically pay if they’re the ones that prefer to ask in the first place?

--------------------------------

Team-First @ 2021-10-03 06:57:21 :

Neither of this things have to do with why men should pay. Because the fact is regardless of a mans age or income he will always be expected to pay so I’m not sure the relevance.

As a guy who talks to other guys I think it’s safe to say that I can make an educated guess.

And your question is coming from the place that men are expected to pay based on an outdated social construct. Men can prefer to ask women on dates and at the same time not want to pay for everything.

Whoever does the inviting should offer to pay, because that's polite. However, at least in my experience in the UK, most people counter offer to go Dutch, also to be polite. Then it's up to individuals on how to sort it all out. 

A common first date is dinner and a movie. I've been on a few where I paid for the cinema tickets and my date paid for dinner (I'm female btw). And usually, I have to argue my way into paying anything at all - I don't like the man paying for everything after a nasty incident where someone turned around and declared I owed him sex because he paid, despite the fact I offered to go Dutch. 

If you don't want to pay the full price on the first date, I think there's nothing wrong with that. You just need to communicate with your date beforehand. I get the impression in America it's not the norm, so you'd need to set expectations. I'm sure there are plenty women who agree with you, and you likely aren't compatible with those that want everything paid for.

Out of interest, how would you feel if someone offered to get the next one, instead of going Dutch?

Women say this like women do the approaching when comes to dating

Padfootfan123 @ 2021-10-03 17:48:10 :

If you don't want to do the approaching then don't. No one's forcing you. I can tell you when I've been asked out I'm also interested, just slower to work up the courage but I would get there if I wasn't beaten to it. In general terms, I think most women need to be more certain to take the step than most men, though of course there are many exceptions.

That's your experience and opinion. I have different experiences.
Point stands...don't blame women for your decisions. If you don't want to ask, then don't. If she's also interested, she will ask you, just takes longer and you may need to hint so she's more confident of a yes.

I have made the first move two times, one rejection one yes. So...not sure why you're accusing me of gaslighting without waiting for more information first. That's a little rude. My experience is not wrong, just different than yours.   
Majority of times the man has done the asking, but that's not to say I haven't and wouldn't. I agree that in most instances men do the asking, but in my personal experience women do ask, we're just more picky and take longer to work up the courage. So, if you don't want to ask, don't. If you don't want to do the inviting and have the subsequent social expectation of paying, don't do the inviting. 

 I will say, online dating is probably different. I personally don't go in for that, I prefer to be friends first and a lot of people I spend time with are the same. It is likely very different if meeting people specifically to date.

--------------------------------

Padfootfan123 @ 2021-10-03 19:56:38 :

If you're talking about the study below, you do realise they only interviewed 1000 women? That's a tiny sample size, not even the number in a small village, and doesn't go into who does the actual asking, just preference.  
[https://www.mantelligence.com/dating-statistics/](https://www.mantelligence.com/dating-statistics/) This was the only study I could find, if you have another I'd be interested to see. I'm willing to change my view if a good study shows that I'm in the minority in my country (UK by the way.) If America is different, that's fine (assuming that's where you're from), but it wouldn't change my opinion on what it's like here.

In my experience, probably 80:20 men to women...not really a vast majority but it isn't equal. I think there are reasons for that that go beyond social pressure and link back to heterosexual reproduction, so if more men gave signs and were patient, I think women would do the asking out more.

--------------------------------

gammaJinx @ 2021-10-03 19:58:20 :

So you agree in 8 out of 10 situations men will make the first move?

I'm done, by the way. This is getting frustrating and I just feel picked on. Hope you have a nice life and good luck in the dating game :)

--------------------------------

gammaJinx @ 2021-10-03 20:03:40 :

Sorry that somehow asking a question made you frustrated but ok I’ll get to the point and finish this 8 out of 10 is the vast majority. So by your own logic 8 out of 10 men will have to pay for the date. Acting like saying that whoever asks pays is fair is objectively false. The reality is that women don’t like to initiate and don’t like to pay for dates. Which is not a bad thing it’s just the way it is. 
Have a good day😄

Padfootfan123 @ 2021-10-03 20:05:21 :

gammaJinx @ 2021-10-03 20:11:00 :

Ok fine since you want to be picky remove the vast majority part and My point still stands. Acting like saying whoever initiates should pay is fair is false when it’s clear that one sex has an advantage. That’s like me saying that whoever is the strongest should get paid the most at work. That’s not really fair to women now is it? You just can’t admit that what you said is not fair to men.

I am also not arguing that capitalism is the best /worst economic system out there. 

What I am arguing is that a core aspect of capitalism makes it less effective at producing quality goods and services than an economic system without this aspect.

The reason why I believe this is due to a quirk in human nature. Humans have both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. It has also been shown that when someone is intrinsically motivated to accomplish something giving them extrinsic motivation can have negative impacts on their performance ([Source 1](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/teachereducationx92x1/chapter/incentive-theory-of-motivation-and-intrinsic-vs-extrinsic-motivation/), [Source 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect)). This is not always the case though because extrinsic motivation can make people accomplish repetitive and non-creative tasks faster ([Source 3](https://fs.blog/2016/08/daniel-pink-two-types-of-motivation/)). 

Since a core aspect of capitalism is that we give someone a stand-in for the value ( money ) they contributed to society (some would argue that we give even less) that then causes that person to become more functionally fixed and less creative which, I am willing to argue, reduces the quality of the goods and services that we create. This is ok for some jobs but I am also willing to argue that a majority of the jobs that go into developing new goods and services should require creativity and adaptability.

I may not be able to respond right away since I am going to class soon but please tell me your thoughts."	"DestrutionW @ 2021-10-04 17:15:37 :

Your intent does not matter, you're not allowed to create a hostile work environment for your coworker no matter how much you disagree with their worldview. Consistently misgendering someone when you have been asked to stop is harassment, plain and simple.

You don't get to just say, ""well actually I subscribe to a worldview where my harassment is accurate"" as a way to get out of it. Doesn't work that way.

People don't have absolute freedom of speech at work, you can be fired for saying all sorts of things. And at some point it is a violation of someone's rights to make it so they are unable to work. Harassment is a part of that.

A racist, for example, will want to call his black coworkers the n-word. To this racist, calling black people the n-word is normal, traditional, and expected. They've grown up saying it and when they say it they do not intend to cause offense...it is simply how they see the world.

Problem is none of that matters. Being overtly racist creates a hostile work environment for your coworkers. Your rights end where other's begin.

--------------------------------

Xxy is not non binary. Not even close. Most people with xxy are so gender conforming biologically that they aren’t even aware they are xxy unless they had a medical exam in life that determines they are. You have probably met an xxy person and didn’t even know it. So you have in fact already relied on someone to present their gender to you and you have accepted it without a biological exam.

But the outcome is the same.

The fetus dies because the mother wants to deny it access to her blood/body.

The fetus/baby finds itself in a situation where it needs something from the mother's body to survive.

The mother says no.

The fetus/baby dies.

If the outcomes are roughly same then the analogy holds.

That's the basis of Consequentialism...

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/)

&gt;This historically important and still popular theory embodies the basic intuition that what is best or right is whatever makes the world best in the future, because we cannot change the past, so worrying about the past is no more useful than crying over spilled milk.  


You're trying to figure out how /why they got in this situation, and that's ""crying over spilled milk.""

  
Now you can say that you're not a consequentialist on this issue, but if our moral frameworks are too divergent I won't be able to change your view and so I'll just stop arguing."	2	0	stop arguing comment					"
EDIT: 
Change my mind partially, Abortion in the first trimester is properly fine if necessary considering the fetus doesn’t feel pain and is mostly not human. Obviously I still recommend not getting abortion and explore other options but it’s just my advise and up to the person and I obviously want to reduce the numbers like anyone else. I’m going to reduce my reply’s and start focusing on other stuff.

The post:

Let’s start from where I am coming from. I grew up religious but don’t believe it anymore. I disagree with conditioning a person from a young age to believe a certain way as well as the homophobia. I don’t believe in overall wrong/right but reasoning with society to a overall good. 

I still find abortion to be a wrong as I would find murder to be wrong. 

I care more about the abortion issue then the euthanasia issue because it isn’t old people possibly wanting to be killed/suicide but innocent people.

In my country of New Zealand ~20% of baby are aborted. 

I think the Hyde law is a reasonable law. I think abortion should be allow in cases of rape/incest or cause the woman complications.

A lot of abortions are related to the baby possibly having mental issues or the parents not being able to look after the child.

To shows the problems of abortion, you could just look at when it goes wrong. Serial killer Dr Gosnell who crimes are so horrible, I wouldn’t even look up unless you really want to know. Is just the tip of the iceberg for allowing abortion in a society. Do we really want to have a society where this is promoted.

I do believe people should be allow to do what they want, the problem here is that it’s another person inside of them and they are effecting there rights to life.

If I wanted to murder someone, society would say do what you want but don’t effect anyone else. So I wouldn’t be allowed, it’s the same for abortion.

I’ll try my best to change my mind, my opinion on this is pretty set in stone but it would be interesting to here other peoples opinion on it."	"[deleted] @ 2021-10-11 04:08:17 :

Counter point, consider this...

A mother gives birth.

The child is born, but the doctor accidentally cuts the baby.

The baby bleeds.

By the time the baby is done bleeding, it has lost so much blood it will die without a blood transfusion.

The mother is the ONLY matching source of blood possible.

**Would you arrest the mother for murder if she refused to give blood to her baby?**

See I don't care about reducing pain, or at least, not as much as I care about not setting a precedent that someone else's life is more important than my organs.

Huh starting to sound like a pro lifer with your very specific situation. No I would’nt arrest the mother because it was’nt her fault. Duh what was the logic there, I don’t get the point there. precedent over pain. Hmm that doesn’t sound like a good idea.

iwfan53 @ 2021-10-11 05:35:49 :

&gt;Duh what was the logic there, I don’t get the point there.

The point is that this establishes... we don't allow the baby to make use of the mother's body without her consent.

You agree that it shouldn't be a crime to let the mother deny the baby access to something as simple as a blood transfusion, and believe me a blood transfusion puts much less stress on someone's body than a pregnancy does.  


So... why are you okay with the mother denying the baby access to her blood even if the baby dies as a result... but not the mother deny the fetus access to her organs?

**Why do you support the mother's bodily autonomy over the baby's right to life, but feel differently when it is still a fetus?**

I generally disagree with premise three. What I said is that men and women who get parts amputated are still men and women. This doesn't mean that I except your premise that there are no physical or biological or objectively measurable traits that define man or woman.

I mean, I'm going to oversimplify, if you don't mind, because I don't want to write pages.

But, in all human societies, the population is generally heterosexual, and 'men' and 'women' fuck, and have children, that's how the species continues. In all societies, there are also homosexuals who are attracted to the same sex. And there are also sexual deviants, or outliers. I don't mean this in a disrespectful way, I mean that in addition to hetero and homosexuals, we always find some number of rarities  as concerns who they sleep with and how they express their sex. I'm trying hard not to use the word gender here, because I don't know what it encompasses, because I don't know how much of being a man or a woman is socially constructed.  To broaden that, I don't know how much of being human is socially constructed.

Now, what it seems to me you're doing is that you've decided on some new definitions of men and women to spare the feelings of the rarities. Sure, you're just like us, join the club, hop on board. You're absolutely a man, live your truth, yada, yada, yada.


You seem to think I'm uncomfortable with Transgender people as people. I'm not. If you think you're the sex you aren't, and you go through a full transition, sex organs replaced with an approximation of the other ones, hormone replacement, and all the other things, I mean, what do I care. Clearly you felt pretty bad in the body you had, to go through all that trouble. Hope you feel much better post transition, and if anyone bullies you in the street for being different, that person is a jerk. 

But this just doesn't have anything to do with the definitions of things I feel to be objective. And I think man and woman are *probably objective terms, that refer to men and women as people with my commonly held view understood those terms 15 years ago.

Like, give me two new words to describe Transmen and Transwomen, and I'd be done with those conversation.  I'd use the words, and live in a four-gendered world.

But you can't do that, because there's some ideology behind your argument. You'e sort of trying to pretend like the terms men and women are throw-away, inconsequencial ones. But obviously they aren't. If I tell some trans woman, ""you aren't a woman, you're something else,"" she may be pissed.

Yet, at the same time, I've seen ""hey, you look like a trans woman,"" used as an insult towards actual women, and those women were very, very angry, because I think they thought they were being called manly looking, or mannish.

Like, if you think this is a settled issue, you can stop arguing with me. I'll die on the wrong side of history, shame for me, and that'll be that.

Look how weird this argument is. I'm not calling trans people subhuman, I'm not saying they aren't worthy of respect and dignity, in the United States they deserve equal protection under the law. People shouldn't be mean to them. I'll even use the form of adress they would prefer, hell, if I do it for priests, who I don't believe either, I can do it for Trans people.

But you'll argue and argue with me, because you want me to believe trans men are men and trans women are women because you've just decided there's no objective way of telling the two sexes apart . 

And then you'll say, not the two sexes, but the two genders.

And then I'll say, you're using the word gender like a rhetorical black box."	1	0	stop arguing comment					[removed]	"joopface @ 2021-10-13 19:14:01 :

&gt;	There's a big difference between ""we should act as if X is true, because that makes people happier"" and ""X is true, and coincidentally acting as if that is the case makes people happier.""

Is there really? 

The concepts of “Japanese” “parent” and “reliable” are all things we as humans and human societies have created. We decided what they are, we defined them and we continue to decide what they mean at any given time. 

From a gender perspective, given as you say there’s no brain scan or blood test or whatever that can determine ‘male’ or ‘female’ and given that these gender identities are similarly things we have created as societies, how is it possible for people to be mistaken in their self identity at any given time? 

As long as they sincerely identify that way and society accepts that identification how could it possibly be wrong? To what truth are you appealing to suggest it could be mistaken?

&gt;	Sure, but some societies and cultures might not recognize these concepts, or mean the same thing by them.
&gt;In Islamic law adoptive parents don't exist. Instead the concept is called ""sponsorship."" A person in this context could criticize the Anglo-American concept of adoption as ""not real"" or ""against God's law"" or something.

Ok, but so what? Does Islamic law not recognising adoptive parentage render adoptive parentage “untrue” in places where it is recognised?

&gt;	Word definitions can't be ""wrong"" - so a person could use any terminological set and still talk about the same underlying realities.
&gt;Everyone is agreed that, given current technology, trans women fail the following membership tests:
 • Able to get pregnant
 • Able to produce ovum
 • Able to menstruate
 • Has XX chromosomes
 • Naturally has a typical female reproductive system
&gt;Now, we might say that plenty of people who are uncontroversially counted among women might fail many of those membership tests as well, and that is true. But the decision of what membership tests to tie to a word is arbitrary - if I say that a new word ""blah"" means ""passes all of the above membership tests"", then we could say ""transwomen are not women, and some cis women are not women.""

This basically agrees with what I said. Society decides what these words mean. If someone identifies as X and society agrees, then by what measure could that identification be ‘wrong’?

Your original post posited some potential objective truth as opposed to society acting in a certain way as though something were true. But we seem now to agree that for a concept like this one society acting as though a thing is true is basically what we mean by ‘true.’ Right?

I agree that water can mean different things, and the chemist would modify their description according to the context. Sometimes the chemist may be dealing with everyday impure water, sometimes with the pure stuff. And naming and documentation would appropriately record this. 

But I don’t see the leap you’re making. Are you suggesting that society should use the goal state of ‘can have children’ as the definition of ‘woman’? As you pointed out, this would exclude a very large proportion of cis women. 

The reality is that the definition of ‘woman’ is a societally defined one based on a relatively fluid set of criteria that are kind of crowdsourced live on an ongoing basis. And not through some rational documented aggregation of goal states. And because of this, if someone says “I’m a woman” and society says “we agree” then there is no other truth that supersedes this.

&gt;	Obviously, the particular words we decide to use are arbitrary. A ""dog"" could have been called a ""panther"" and the world would not be different. However, ""dog"" is a bit of a natural category - it seems to cut reality at the joints.

It’s perfectly possible to conceive of equally rational categories either that are less specific - including more mammals say - or more specific than the category ‘dog.’ I just don’t agree with this statement at all; it suggests that the categories we have are someone preordained and objective. And they are not. 

But regardless, the category we’re actually talking about definitively does not ‘cut reality at the joints.’ Gender is not the same as ‘dog.’ 

Where you’re struggling is that you want to define ‘woman’ in some biological sense but the concept is a societal one. You want to say ‘woman’ is someone who produces eggs (but many cis women do not) or can have children (similar) or whatever. But these fail because this isn’t how we - society - defines women.

&gt;	Okay, here's a weaker version of my claim.

I understand the claim, I just think it’s something you believe rather than something you have any evidence for. I also think the category ‘dog’ only bears superficial relationship to the category ‘woman’ as we use it. 


&gt;	I'm not so sure I agree that society defines woman in a trans-inclusive way either. If you asked a random sampling of English speakers to try to list the necessary and sufficient traits of a ""woman"" - I think the definitions they'd come up with would not necessarily be ones that would include trans women off the bat.

I didn’t say society did, currently. I agree this isn’t comprehensively the case at the moment. It’s moving that way. But our definition of ‘woman’ is still fungible in the way I outlined and doesn’t rest on the simple biological traits you mentioned.

But my contention is that were society to do so, there is no other ‘truth’ beyond that acceptance with which to contradict it. Which is a simple point that - forgive me for being direct - you seem intent on not addressing. :-)

I'm not op. But it seems like you are assuming that the most pro trans definition wasn't just yanked out of thin air, when, to me, it looks like it was.

Yes, yes, I get it. Trans people, gender disphorea, transition best treatment for sadness and lowering risk of suicide, I'm all in favor, transition away. 

But. I'm not convinced that the definitions of man and woman are as stretchy as you say they are. 

I feel like if I had a machine that would let me hop through time and space, and speak any language, and if I used that machine to hop all around the world, and throughout history, and I kept showing up and demanding, ""show me ten women,"" what I'd be shown, over and over again, would be biological females.

Even if you take the most 'pro trans' definition of the word ""woman"" almost all of the people who fall into that categorisation as cis women. There are many, many more of them than there are trans women. 

But this really isn't the point I'm making. What I'm saying is a quite limited, specific thing, and it is this.

What society says ""woman"" means is what ""woman"" means. There is no other source of truth to which we can refer to disprove this societal definition. Any given biological trait (the OP mentioned ovulation, giving birth others include chromosomal traits, the absence of gonads etc.) [excludes people that society generally agrees are women](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32764-3/fulltext), and where such a conflict exists society's definition wins out. 

Of course it's possible for the societal definition to be linked solely to a biological trait. But that doesn't disprove the point.

Look, to me, it seems like what you're doing is, so that there's a logical justification for the nature of Trans people and the gender claims they make, you're. . . There's a latin term I can't remember which describes what your doing. It's like reasoning after the fact or something. You're creating a justification to back up a worldview. As opposed to letting objective truth inform your worldview.

It's true, as op says, that right now, there's no way to test for ""man"" or ""woman"" Op summarizes this point well. But that doesn't mean this will remain true, a hundred years ago, there probably wasn't a pregnancy test, now there is, because we're always learning more and more about the world. 

And, you argue like a Christian. Whenever we get down to the heart of the matter, you say nothing can be proven because every concept we have are castles in the sky.

Like, it seems that you are thinking about language as though it has zero connection whatsoever to objective reality. Yes, yes, we could call spoons forks, but unless we also change the definition of the verb stab, you won't be able to stab someone with a spoon. This, to me, is the game you're playing. It's like, if you owed me five dollars, I'd ask you for the mmoney and you'd hand me a book of matches and you'd say ""well, society can decide what all these things mean, and I've decided money is matches, so here you are, we're even.""

It's quite the remarkable contortion to then call \*my\* view one lacking evidence. 

The OP's point rests on the idea that there are things that are social constructs and things that are objective facts and that the concept of 'woman' is contained in the latter category. 

It is not, according to all currently available information. 

This is what I am saying. Tell me specifically what you disagree with and why.

""The OP's point rests on the idea that there are things that are social constructs and things that are objective facts and that the concept of 'woman' is contained in the latter category.""

My point is that I believe you've decided this statement is untrue, because if the statement was true, you'd have a much harder time explaining what Transgendered people are, and so it has to be untrue.

I think it's clear that some aspects of gender. And now I'm at a point where I want to exclusively use the word sex so there's no confusion. . . But it's clear that some aspects of gender are socially constructed. But, in order for me to buy the argument you're making you'd have to show me that being a biological male or female has zero influence on the development of a human being's personality or character. You'd have to show me that gender is entirely a social construct, as far from related to biology as anything we do is, like Christianity or communism. 

You seem to say that people identify with a physical state? Like, good for them, identifying with a thing doesn't make you that thing. 

I mean. Let's say we have a gay man. A biological man. And then, we have a trans man, in a female body. And those two begin a relationship. If you want  to tell me that's two men in a relationship, like, go ahead, I can't stop you from thinking about it like that, but as far as I'm concerned doing so is a descent into utter insensibility.

If you'd like to keep arguing this back and fourthh, we can, but I don't want to waste your time.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2021-10-14 12:29:37 :

Your comment doesn't say what you disagree with, just that you disagree. 

Here is what I'm saying in standard form:

1. Many categories into which we allocate things are defined as such by societal convention
2. These categories of things are those for which no objectively measurable and consistent set of traits exist to define the members of the category
3. There is no distinct set of physical, biological or other objectively measurably traits that reliable designates what a ""man"" or a ""woman"" is
4. However, societies do define people as ""men"" or ""women"" despite this
5. Therefore, who we consider to be ""men"" and ""women"" is a categorisation that is made by societal convention

There are four premises here. So far I think you've agreed directly or indirectly with all four. Could you point out where specifically you disagree with me?

I understand that you are not comfortable with the definition of ""women"" to include trans women, but this isn't actually the discussion we're having here.

--------------------------------

laconicflow @ 2021-10-14 12:41:54 :

Where I disagree is number three. And also, I find it important to note that there is an idea directly opposing number II, which is that there are also facts, and objective truth, and society uses this to group things, too.

And. I know that the definition of man and woman is wider than private parts, because you can castrate a man, and I suppose he's still a man. 

But this elasticity must end, or you're talking about absolutely nothing at all, you'd eventually widen it to include all of humanity.

And I think you're being tricky. Like, there's been a male female  divide in literally every society I've ever studied. Which leads me to believe it's a useful concept, and far less socially constructed than you believe.

I mean. You know anything about Sparta? There was this relationship that older Spartan's had with teenaged boys. There was some word in greek to describe this relationship. The older guy would buy the boy gifts, and there was some kind of richualized seduction involved. Now, that's a social construct, existing around some biological facts. . . And it doesn't bother me because I can describe it as a man fucking a teenaged boy. Which I find morally gross, but at least linguistically and philisophically sensible.

--------------------------------

Alright, now we're getting more specific. Let's focus on premise 3. 

&gt;There is no distinct set of physical, biological or other objectively measurably traits that reliabl\[y\] designates what a ""man"" or a ""woman"" is

And let's then also look at your own perspective which is...

&gt;And. I know that the definition of man and woman is wider than private parts, because you can castrate a man, and I suppose he's still a man.

Hm. So it seems like.... you do agree with premise 3? Your view is a little unclear here so could you please explain what **distinct set of physical, biological or other objectively measurable traits designate what a man or woman is**? I pointed you in the direction of [this article earlier](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32764-3/fulltext) which may be helpful in identifying some. 

What is happening here is that you're arguing from incredulity. You personally find trans people hard to accommodate into your view of men and women. That's absolutely fine, so far as it goes. 

But you're taking your own discomfort and extrapolating from that some things you consider to be facts about the world. This doesn't hold water. Just because you really, really, feel like something is the case doesn't make it true. And just because you find it hard to accept that the categories we define as men and women are groupings we have defined as societies doesn't make that any less the case. 

Your view is a common one, and perfectly understandable. What is a little irksome is you repeatedly suggesting that I'm the one not rooting my perspective in a logical framework when you're basically doing the equivalent of just putting your fingers in your ears and jumping up and down. 

You have literally just said you disagree with premise 3, and then one line later explained why you disagree with yourself."	"joopface @ 2021-10-14 14:13:09 :

I believe I have made no claim about trans women or trans men whatsoever. And you keep telling me I have, that I have some ideology that 'makes me want to believe' something. 

I have explicitly said more than once I think that this discussion isn't about whether trans women \*should\* fall into the category of 'women' as society defines it. 

Take this part of your comment:

&gt;Now, what it seems to me you're doing is that you've decided on some new definitions of men and women to spare the feelings of the rarities. Sure, you're just like us, join the club, hop on board. You're absolutely a man, live your truth, yada, yada, yada

I haven't actually suggested any specific definition of 'man' or 'woman'. You're assuming that I hold a certain view on trans women being included within the definition of 'woman' and you're pushing back against this solely because of your personal discomfort with that. 

I don't think you're uncomfortable with trans people as people. I didn't say that you were. I think you're uncomfortable with the idea of trans women being called women and trans men being called men.  

So let's try to avoid the topic of trans women and trans men and how they're categorised entirely, at least for the moment. And let's go back to deal with premise 3. Premise 3, to remind ourselves, was:

&gt;There is no distinct set of physical, biological or other objectively measurably traits that reliabl\[y\] designates what a ""man"" or a ""woman"" is

In your comment you say this:

&gt;this just doesn't have anything to do with the definitions of things I feel to be objective. And I think man and woman are \*probably objective terms, that refer to men and women as people with my commonly held view understood those terms 15 years ago

And so, here I am asking again. Please explain what distinct and consistent set of physical, biological or other objectively measurable traits designate what a man or woman is?

laconicflow @ 2021-10-14 14:25:30 :

I hate to use newspeak, but doesn't CIS man and CIS woman paint the general picture?

I can't figure out how you've arrived at your premise three, because it seems to indicate that man and woman are based strictly in subjectivity, and that, I  believe, is wrong. It's where everybody runs when they don't want to have a fact based argument. 

I mean, don't you believe the universe is at least softly deterministic? 

I think I'm comfortable with a definition of man and woman that orbits biological sex. You can mutalate a body, but the brain in that body still lived a certain biology for a long time. And it seems to me the human experience is rooted in biology. 

I mean that who you are is rooted in biology. If we could rewind time a thousand times, and put little baby  you through a thousand lives, you'd most likely be a thousand different people, but you'd never escape your own biology, you'd be stuck with it, and it would influence each of those thousand lives, it would influence you objectively.

And. When we talk about gender identity, I feel like I'm just arguing with people playing little word games and deploying silly rhetorical tricks. 

Like, we don't know fully the impact sex has on a given human. I mean that we don't know every single difference between biological men and women, we've done thousands of studies, but it isn't like the work is done, we have an imperfect understanding.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2021-10-14 14:37:03 :

&gt;It's where everybody runs when they don't want to have a fact based argument.

I have asked you directly several times for the objective factual basis by which you designate that people fall into the categories 'man' and 'woman.' You haven't answered this question. What 'facts' are you talking about? Your opinion and discomfort are not facts. 

&amp;#x200B;

You've said this:

&gt;orbits biological sex.

What does this even mean? What part of biology are you talking about? What combination of factors is distinct, consistent and objective?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I can't figure out how you've arrived at your premise three

You can definitively disprove premise 3 by simply providing the set of distinct, consistent and objective factors that reliably allow us to categorise people into the 'men' and 'women' buckets.

--------------------------------

laconicflow @ 2021-10-14 14:49:30 :

What's wrong with man meaning biological male and woman meaning biological female? That's objective. You ca can chop the breasts off a 'woman' and she'll still be a biological female. 

There are objective ways to measure biological sex. So, what's wrong with this definition? All biological male's are men, all biological females are women. It's objectively measurable, we do it with dogs and cats and horses.

We just invent a few words for the outliers to the general pattern, and we're good.

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2021-10-14 14:58:22 :

&gt;There are objective ways to measure biological sex

OK, let's take a look at this. Which ones would you use?

As far as I'm aware, there aren't any biological criteria that are consistent and objective. Even biological definitions of sex have cultural overlays and interpretations associated with them. For example, this is a quote from the Lancet Perspectives article I linked to earlier:

&gt;Policy makers who formulate sex categorisations and definitions overwhelmingly rely on biological features to ground membership. Biological factors hold appeal and power since reference to “biology” and “science” lends any suggested trait or combination of traits the appearance of neutrality and thus objectivity. But biological definitions of sex are at odds with the understanding that sex involves multiple biological and social factors. They are also at odds with social scientific work that complicates the idea that sex is biological whereas gender is cultural; sex, as much as gender, is culturally contingent and produced. As J R Latham notes, “sex” is not a static, discrete, or even strictly biological characteristic that exists prior to the relations and practices that produce it. Historian of science Sarah Richardson, for example, has shown how scientists “sexed” the X and Y chromosomes by glossing over inconsistencies and ambiguities between the two in their research to elevate findings that align with gendered ideas about biological sex differences.  
&gt;  
&gt;Decisions about which traits or sets of traits are used, in what combination, and for what purpose are inextricably tied to why sex categorisation exists and whom or what it serves. Far from neutral or objective, sex classification and definition rely on cultural norms about the “appropriate” relationships between sex, gender, and sexuality, and work in tandem with power to support social norms and goals as well as sociopolitical hierarchies that determine opportunities, rights, and privileges.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not surprisingly, there is a long history of using—and misusing—discrete biological criteria to determine sex and thereby include or exclude certain people from categories.

OldButterscotch3 @ 2021-10-14 20:24:42 :

What if I just say man = people who are x y or are born with a penis. And similarly for woman. And then there’s intersex for people not caught by either net.

joopface @ 2021-10-14 21:06:03 :

Oh, sorry. I misread this comment; you’re suggesting these traits as the objective definitions of man/woman?

The issue is that regardless of the trait you choose there will be outliers who society classifies as a man or a women but who fall outside the biological definition. And in that situation the societal definition is the one that holds sway. 

For example 1 in every 80k people has this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis

This is a disorder where someone is born with female external genitalia as well as gonads and is XY chromosomally. They present externally as female.

Or as another example men can be born wjth no penis: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_agenesis_and_testicular_agenesis

Now the point isn’t that it is not technically possible to exclude these people from a narrow male/female sex division based on biology and create a third “other” category for everyone else. Of course this is one of the many categorisations possible. 

The point is that this is not how we actually do things. Rather, society has definitions for man and woman into which these people also fall. And even if there were a single biological definition, the societal conception is what would hold sway regardless. 

A human with female genitalia, calling herself a women, wearing women’s clothing etc. but who happens to also have XY chromosomes is still a woman according to society.

--------------------------------

OldButterscotch3 @ 2021-10-14 23:36:19 :

I’m not the person you were arguing with earlier. 

Regarding your examples, both of them would fit the societal gender by my definition. They either match chromosomes or genetalia with the societal gender. Are there others I’m not aware of (that aren’t merely hundreds of people) ?

--------------------------------

joopface @ 2021-10-15 05:47:03 :

I don’t really want to get into the specifics of *your particular* definition because that’s not the point I was making. But, to be clear, people with Swyer syndrome would be male by your definition (XY or have a penis) but they generally present and are treated as women

But as I said in my last comment my point isn’t that it’s impossible to categorise humans into male and female categories. Of course you could do that, so long as you’re willing to have the biological definition follow defined criteria and to have an ‘other’ bucket. 

My point was that this isn’t how we actually do this in reality. Any categorisation we make is made with social and cultural overlays. Society treats - for example - people with Swyer syndrome as women. They look like women, have female external genitals etc. And that societal definition is what actually matters, it’s what is most real for us and for the Individual. 

That was my original point to the OP. Their contention was that what we consider people to be was distinct and lesser than some objective truth of what they ‘really’ are - in terms of make/female and other things. My point is that the objective ‘truth’ to which the OP seeks to refer doesn’t exist. At best it’s an arbitrary choice like the one you made, and such choices while they can be made are no more ‘true’ than the choice we make as a society."

Vaccines work, they really do. The more people we get vaccinated the better it is for everybody.

This shit you hear on Joe Rogan and Tucker and these other conservative media people, it's 5% fact and 95% fiction.

We've been using vaccines for hundreds of years.

Yes the coronavirus is a new disease and we are still learning new things about it daily.

But getting everybody or as many people vaccinated is the goal.

Look I am all for critically evaluating experts, but you are barking up the wrong tree.

You aren't going to come up with a better solution to a rapidly evolving outbreak that's better than all our top disease control experts.

You ever lived in the third world? Public health is less controlled, and diseases run rampant. Don't eat the food sold by street vendors - it tastes great but has nasty bugs that will make you sicker then you've ever been in your life.

America is fortunate that they have no experienced true plagues in a long time.

But now one is here.

I'm not trying to fear monger, but objectively the coronavirus is objectively a big deal.

Right now, our best bet is getting as many people as possible vaccinated. That's what our top experts say, and based on the math and physics and epidemiology I've studied, it makes a lot of sense.

You aren't going to learn more from listening to a few podcasts than people with decades of experience.

People pretending they can come up with their own alternative solutions to a disease outbreak are deluding themselves.

We have a vaccine right now and all our best experts say all signs point to it being the best thing to deal with the outbreak.

The people fighting are just a waste of everyone's time and all total self-deluded failures.

We need as many as possible vaccinated. Too many are holding back. They got to get vaccinated now please for all of us."	2	0	stop arguing comment					"The entire identity of antivaxxers is this: ""I don't trust Big Pharma, I don't trust the government. They want to infringe on my freedoms, and I am the Hero who will stand up for what's right."" That ""standing by the river of truth and saying 'no, you move'"" thing is a massive part of conservative identity. This narrative of tyrants and heroic rebels is at their heart.

The vaccine mandate played right into that narrative: that fit perfectly with their story of tyrants and rebels. People who do take the vaccine do it reluctantly, feeling forced and threatened with losing their jobs, while those few still refusing are held up as heroes. 

And it didn't even work, at least so far - the US is behind Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and many more. As it turns out, feeding right into people's narratives of victimhood is...not a great plan.

""But we need to get people vaccinated! How else will you do it except forcing them!""

Well the French have a solution: defuse the narrative.

See, the French also have a MASSIVE antivaxx movement. Distrust of governments and Big Pharma is rampant with giant chunks of the population believing in homeopathy and distrusting vaccines, both on the right and the left. A vaccine mandate would have led to country-wide demonstrations. 

Instead, the government said ""you don't HAVE to get a vaccine. But if you want to travel, go to cinemas, restaurants, etc, you need either a negative test, or a vaccine"".

Why was that brilliant? Because it defused the narrative. A relative of mine is an massive conspiracy theorist - antivaxx, climate skeptic, the works. But they wanted to go to concerts, and couldn't be bothered to do the tests every time, so...they got jabbed. 

See how that defuses their whole thing? No one forced them, they just had to admit that they liked their comfort and convenience more than their professed principles. And now France, the home of antivaxx nutjobs, has a higher vaccination rate than even the UK and Germany!

That's how you get antivaxxers to drop their pretenses, you don't play into their story, you sidestep it. And it demonstrably works. Yes, I know the majority of people approve of the mandate, but that's very much not the point - you can keep all those people on board and get more people vaccinated without giving your opponents ammunition, with cleverer more subtle governance tools. Instead of going with the clever subtle solution they went in with the hammer, and the blowback is going to hurt."	"Kman17 @ 2021-11-07 21:37:12 :

The “vaccine mandate” isn’t a mandate to get vaccinated - it’s a mandate to large employers to adopt the policy of requiring vaccination *or* weekly testing.  

Concerts and events are the same thing: they require proof of testing within 72 hours.

Functionally it’s the exact same policy as France. The government isn’t going door to door sticking needles in arms, it’s just making life annoying enough to test the conviction of anti-vaxxers by frequent testing or declining events.

The fact that it’s called a mandate is that both sides want to characterize it that way.

--------------------------------

Rwandrall @ 2021-11-07 21:45:50 :

The big difference is that losing access to your concerts isnt tyranny - they're just entertainment. Losing your job is a massive deal.

Is the weekly testing free?

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2021-11-07 22:06:51 :

The mandate doesn’t involve your job. It’s a regulation of your employer if it exceeds requirements like number of employees. If you don’t want to get a shot, and you don’t want to get tested, talk to your employer to come to an arrangement like home work. Or go find an employer, like a small employer, not subject to the regulation. Employment has always been at-will, subject to certain rules. If you don’t want to test weekly at JP Morgan, go find a smaller investment fund.

I'm fully vax. I'm agree with getting vaccinated. 


But also, if you're mandating and forcing people to get vaccinated (or lose your job, which the government won't give you unemployment from those rules, from what I understand), what happens if you're one of the few who does get sick from the vaccine? Does the government take responsibility for your healthcare? 

What if you're one of the ultra rare cases where you die from covid due to allergies, or some freak accident? The government mandated you take it or lose your job, so you took it and died. Does that company take blame? Government? Both? 

Accountability for it should lay somewhere, but it seems they're cool with mandating a vaccine without accountability for the negative effects, which is why I'm guessing there are a few who are not ok with this

And what about all the mass death and mayhem these unvaccinated are causing all of us?

Refusing to get vaccinated during an outbreak? Are these people going to pay us for the mass murder-suicides they cause, the hospitals they overburden, the beds they occupy from infinitely more deserving patients, the kids who lose their school years to more lockdowns?

There are massive risks to having tens of millions of these people all refusing to get vaccinated.

What are the risks to all of us allowing this virus to keep spreading and mutating in our communities?

Are these people accountable for the harm they are causing all of us?

No? Then play outside. This is not tyranny. None of these people feeding on conservative media gutter trash understand tyranny.

America is one of the lowest vaccinated advanced countries on earth despite producing its own vaccine. This is disgraceful.

These people have the FREEDOM not to get vaccinated, and we have the FREEDOM not to let them into our schools, our businesses and places of work.

If these people decided *washing yourself* was a government conspiracy and they came to work reeking of shit and crawling with lice and bacteria, we would have the RIGHT to throw these people out of the building.

The anti-vaxers are the tyrants. They are the ones holding us all hostage to their mad sick games.

Nobody has a right to a job. Don't want to get vaccinated, don't want to clean yourself, don't want to get the lice out of your hair? PLAY OUTSIDE.

--------------------------------

throwitallaway1121 @ 2021-11-08 01:28:45 :

&gt;And what about all the mass death and mayhem these unvaccinated are causing all of us?

Mass death and mayhem is quite a bit of an exaggeration. And I don't think you can attribute all of it to unvaccinated people. The disease is here to stay. Mitigation is the name of the game, sure. But with respect to living a fulfilling life. A balance which many won't agree on, but it's balancing death with productive society. 

How many people die from cars? Do we ban cars? No. We let it happen for productivity, but we enforce laws with seatbelts. Are there people who die with seatbelts? Yes. And those without also die. Texting and driving is illegal, but do we introduce technology which prevents you from using your phone entirely in your car? No. 

&gt;Are these people going to pay us for the mass murder-suicides they cause,

I don't know what this means 

&gt;the hospitals they overburden, the beds they occupy from infinitely more deserving patients

They pay hospital bills. It's not free to go to the hospital 

&gt;the kids who lose their school years to more lockdowns

So don't lock down schools. This is what many have been saying for 2 years. But many people consider unrealistic standards before unlocking down schools. When, less than 600 kids total (most of which happened when no adult was vaccinated) have died from covid. School lockdowns is bad policy - can be entirely independent from a vaccine mandate. 

&gt;There are massive risks to having tens of millions of these people all refusing to get vaccinated.

Massive risks? It's a 99.7% survival rate for most of those who are unvaccinated. 

&gt;What are the risks to all of us allowing this virus to keep spreading and mutating in our communities?

It will do that regardless. Look at third world countries where we are obsessed with third booster shots vs. giving other countries our vaccine supply when they don't have any shots. 

&gt;Are these people accountable for the harm they are causing all of us?

What harm are they causing you? Can you directly attribute an unvaccinated person to harming you personally? What if the unvaccinated person isn't testing positive, and is just a farmer in a field and interacts with no one? Or wears a KN95 every time he's out? 

What about the vaccinated people who are still capable of spreading the disease? Why can't I hold that person accountable? An unvaccinated person with antibodies vs. a vaccinated person with the same level of antibodies is somehow different in your eyes? 

&gt;None of these people feeding on conservative media gutter trash understand tyranny.

Ah. You do realize like, on a ethnicity basis, the highest percentage of unvaccinated people are black households, right? I didn't realize conservative media catered to black people but I guess that's where we're at now. 

&gt;These people have the FREEDOM not to get vaccinated, and we have the FREEDOM not to let them into our schools, our businesses and places of work.

Damn. So you do realize this affects a lot of black people too, right? This policy you're thinking of will affect people of color and minorities disproportionately. So.... 

&gt;Nobody has a right to a job.

So you're cool with abolishing unemployment then? Lol. I mean, nobody has a right to a job, they should also not have a right to free things from a government 

One of the biggest disconnects I think you're missing is unvaccinated does not equal non-protected, and vaccinated does not equal protected (from getting the disease). Asymptomatic spread just isn't a thing, statistically speaking. But even those who do get it, are not dying en masse. Again - 99.7% survival rate. But what if I told you a person who was unvaccinated but recently had covid is far more likely to have higher antibody count, and protection, from covid than a person who got the first dose of the vaccine as soon as it came out? 

You still think the unvaccinated person is an asshole and the vaccinated person is just fine?

800,000 people are dead and hundreds of thousands more will follow unless we get everybody or as many as possible vaccinated.

Joe Rogan and these other lunatics find 5% fact and 95% fiction to peddle their bullshit.

But the game is exactly like their global warming denial. The same tactics, the same outcome.

How many decades have we wasted begging and pleading these people to help us stop global warming before it's too late? You can feel it getting hotter now.

This is simply a game of math. It is IMPOSSIBLE to stop this virus without a lot more people vaccinated.

The randomness of the mutations adds another unpredictability level. This could get a lot worse.

We needed 95% vaccinated to eliminate polio. That's 19 out of 20.

We could never accomplish that now. We would be living with polio outbreaks today if these people were alive then. Outbreaks of mass child paralysis and death.

There is no alternative version of reality where having this many millions all refusing to get vaccinated is a good thing.

As I said, these people have the freedom not to get vaccinated the same way they can refuse to wash themselves after using the toilet. But we have our rights too, and we are defending our communities and looking out for our own.

This conspiracy culture of denial and blaming everyone else for your failures isn't going to work. Not anymore.

These conservative media cultists are spreading lies and insanity and causing mass death.

Hundreds of thousands more people are going to die, millions will get injured, more lockdowns will come, unless these people take the risk and get vaccinated.

Where is our compensation for the damage these people are doing?

They want the freedom not to get vaccinated during a global outbreak? Then accept the blame. Accept they are causing death and suicides on a massive scale.

That is the price of freedom: consequences.

We are not going to forget the people who fucked this up for all of us.

Blacks ain't the problem. This is the Republican Party and Fox News disinformation machine.

The same people who groomed millions to believe climate change is fake, the election was fake, the Jan. 6 terror attack was fake - now have something to say about vaccines???

We can argue policy but not reality. Hundreds of thousands more are going to die and millions more will get injured unless lots more Americans take the risk and do their minimum patriotic duty for their country.

The vaccine is a risk but so is letting these outbreaks run rampant in our communities.

This Republican culture of causing us all disasters and pain and blaming blacks and the media and the government and antifah must stop.

We see everything they are doing to us. Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, these Republican QAnon politicians.

They are grooming their followers to kill themselves and die in massive numbers.

I have never seen such gross sadomasochism in my life.

Appalling, shocking, horrifying. A lot more people need to get vaccinated or a lot more people will die needlessly.

These people want the freedom not to get vaccinated, but none of the blame for their failure?

It's impossible to stop the virus. Period. Read experts. Herd immunity is not a thing with covid. It will become like the flu.

&gt;Hundreds of thousands more people are going to die, millions will get injured, more lockdowns will come, unless these people take the risk and get vaccinated.

Do you know that hundreds of thousands of people just.... Die? No one will lock down. Because this virus ran it's course. What you're saying is more lockdowns will come. And I don't disagree. But it's because fear mongers like you want to see 0 covid deaths, which is statistically impossible. 

&gt;Where is our compensation for the damage these people are doing?

What damage? 

&gt;We are not going to forget the people who fucked this up for all of us.

You're getting voted out of office for fucking it up. Republicans are seeing sweeping victories because Democrats can't stop locking shit down and taking power and creating fascist states. 

I'm sorry, I'm done responding to your CNN nonsense. You're spewing absurdly informed opinions. A rational take was 'hey, if people get hurt from a vaccine, who's to blame? Someone should be if you're forcing people to take it'. It spiraled into a blue-anon anti-science rhetoric to spread fear.

People with comorbidities are dying in massive numbers. And elderly people. I'd urge you to look at that science. Those are the only ones dying at massive rates. But also it's because when you're unhealthy, your body can't naturally fight viruses as well. 

&gt;There is no resistance here.

You, like the other poster, refuse to answer my simple question before going into blue-anon bullshit. If the government forced you to take a vaccine and you died from the vaccine, who will compensate the victim? 

&gt;Which of our established medical authorities are saying tens of millions should all refuse to get vaccinated and this is somehow a good thing?

Reading isn't a strong suit of yours. I never said people should refuse to get vaccinated. I said vaccine mandates are quite unethical because accountability for vaccine deaths/harm, albeit those numbers will be small, isn't established.

Do you believe my friends business, which was forcibly shut down by the government after he sunk his life savings into it, and got no compensation by the government, is ok behavior?"	"throwitallaway1121 @ 2021-11-08 12:27:53 :

&gt;Dude, please can we stop arguing endlessly. Vaccines work, they really do. The more people we get vaccinated the better it is for everybody.

Please show me a quote where I said the opposite of this. I never once said this. 

&gt;Public health is less controlled, and diseases run rampant

So why are we obsessed with boosters in the us and not sending all of our vaccines to third world countries who none of them have gotten any kind of vaccine? You know, the unvaccinated? 

&gt;I'm not trying to fear monger, but objectively the coronavirus is objectively a big deal.

It WAS a big deal. Now it isn't. It's not nothing, but it's not a 'big' deal. 


&gt;Right now, our best bet is getting as many people as possible vaccinated. That's what our top experts say, and based on the math and physics and epidemiology I've studied, it makes a lot of sense.

Ok. Again, I never indicated that wasn't a problem. But you still refuse to answer my question I posed 5 comments ago. You run away with some bullshit every post like someone who hasn't taken their ADHD medication. It's a very simple question - if you force people to take a vaccine, and statistically speaking the risk of vaccine harming you is incredibly low, it's not 0. So what happened when the government forces you to take a vaccine and you get seriously ill. Are you, the individual who didn't want the vaccine but forced to take it, and are now hospitalized due to an allergic reaction, responsible for your own medical bill? 

Simple question. Very simple question to ask which you refuse to answer.  

&gt;You aren't going to learn more from listening to a few podcasts than people with decades of experience.

Funny how you assume I only listen to Rogan. Also hilarious how the people Rogan has on his podcast are far more qualified to talk about pandemic, epidemiology, and public policy than you. They're actual experts.  

&gt;They got to get vaccinated now please for all of us.

You, as a vaccinated individual, legitimately do not need to waste any time or breath on thinking about covid, statistically speaking.

FaisalAli_91 @ 2021-11-08 12:36:50 :

Excuse what the hell? You are throwing these disgusting insults at me and demanding answers?

Unreal, your behavior is garbage.

I'm not assuming anything. I'm saying we need a lot more vaccinated or a lot more people are going to die and all of us are going to pay the price.

Will the unvaccinated compensate us if the outbreak continues and gets worse? No? Then how dare these people demand compensation.

Not complicated. If these people all refused to get vaccinated during a polio outbreak and were murdering children, we'd be having the exact same argument.

Rogan's podcast is just grooming gullible people to refuse to get vaccinated.

The unvaccinated are harming all of us now, prolonging the outbreak and getting more people killed.

That's not a debate, it's basic reality. Whether these people give a damn about any other human life is the question.

There is no alternative reality where having these millions all refusing to get vaccinated is a good thing.

They want the freedom not to get vaccinated during an outbreak? They get all the blame for all the mass death and destruction they cause. There is nothing they can say that will change that.

When their country and their communities needed them to step up during an emergency, these people all refused and failed.

Children are doing more to help than these people. Children are showing greater intelligence and leadership than these conspiracy toddlers, it is sick. These people are throwing the world's biggest tantrum and dragging us all to QAnon hell with them.

Even children understand getting vaccinated helps them and those around them.

Children have a greater understanding of reality and community than these overgrown conspiracy addicted toddlers. Disgraceful beyond belief.

&gt;Will the unvaccinated compensate us if the outbreak continues and gets worse? No? Then how dare these people demand compensation.

Because this isn't a pandemic of only the unvaccinated. Vaccinated people are still getting it and are getting hospitalized. At much lower rates, but it happens. Look at Israel. 

&gt;I'm saying we need a lot more vaccinated or a lot more people are going to die and all of us are going to pay the price.

Look at death rates now and realize that isn't true. The most important thing you can do for your body longer term isn't a vaccine. It's become healthy. Lose weight and excercise, and eat better. But no one wants to talk about that. A vaccine helps you now, but just like the flu, covid is here to stay. 

&gt;ogan's podcast is just grooming gullible people to refuse to get vaccinated

I can say with utmost confidence you haven't listened to a single full episode if you truly believe this. CNN soundbytes is not representative, not enough context, to make an understanding. It's like all the trans people upset with Chappelle who didn't listen to 5 seconds of his special. 

&gt;The unvaccinated are harming all of us now, prolonging the outbreak and getting more people killed.

Nah. The 'outbreak' really isn't a thing anymore. People are dying, but you do realize that on any given day, people die anyway, right? 

You should also look at the statistics - obesity and smoking are killing more people from covid complications than not. Do you have the same passion for obese people or smokers as you do for anti-vaxxers, who are not dying at those levels? 

&gt;Whether these people give a damn about any other human life is the question.


They probably do. They just stopped giving a shit when people like you kept screaming at them day after day when they were still wearing masks and distancing after having antibodies. You catch more bees with honey than screaming at them. I've convinced one of my friends to get vaccinated not by yelling at him, but working with him to understand his hesitation and quelling any fears. But people like you push more people away from vaccination status because you have a 'holier than thou' attitude and act like billions of people are dying every day due to covid, which isn't true at all. 

&gt;They want the freedom not to get vaccinated during an outbreak? They get all the blame for all the mass death and destruction they cause. There is nothing they can say that will change that.

Ah ok. You should look at Israel. Lol. Where people are still dying despite the highest vaccination rate in the world. Your goal of 0 deaths is not realistic, and you are looking for a scapegoat so you blame everyone else. 

Rather than look at the obese people who do nothing for their health, you'd rather scream at the healthy guy who has antibodies and poses no threat to spreading the virus. That's a pretty anti-scientific stance to take. 

&gt;Children are doing more to help than these people

I agree. You know why? Because unvaccinated children don't spread the disease. Because most unvaccinated children have healthy bodies and healthy immune systems. Lol. Not because of the other bullshit you said 

&gt;Even children understand getting vaccinated helps them and those around them.

There are few medical reasons to vaccinate children when their death rates are less than 500 for the past 2 years. Pfizer would love to vaccinate your children for more profit, but simply said - kids don't spread the disease nor die from it, statistically speaking. Teachers union propaganda really got to you. 

&gt;Children have a greater understanding of reality and community than these overgrown conspiracy addicted toddlers. Disgraceful beyond belief.

Iroonic. Plugging your ears to facts and reality and crying 'but people are dying' is childish behavior, when reality doesn't reflect your made up death fantasy land"

This kind of difference can only be created through statutory law. Because police shootings are under the exact same self defense statues as anyone else

If there is no statutory law, your statement is false and grabbing at a civilian’s gun is the same as grabbing at a police officer’s gun.


&gt; Um, you said yourself that he kept going?

The water cannot keep going out of your faucet when the tap is closed. It will keep going when you turn the faucet on. The faucet was closed. Do you understand that the water isnt faulty because it isnt going out of the tap when the tap is closed?

 just because someone ran at at a time before an incident and a time after an incident, it does not mean they could run during the incident


&gt; And no. I’m not going to film myself. Lol.

Why not? Blur your face if you want, I want you to prove this is humanly possible

&gt; That seems like a relevant fact when you’re arguing that he couldn’t run…

He couldnt run in that very second due to being cornered. Not that his legs were crippled. What part of this is so hard for you to understand?

&gt; 
I never said he was doing that. The drone video shows him aiming the gun before backing up, at several points while backing up, and shortly before firing.

""And yelling “friendly” is kinda meaningless when, again, you’re aiming your rifle at someone.""

You explicitly said he was aiming his rifle at Rosenbaum while retreating, not after being cornered between the 3 cars. The entire reason we went down this line of questioning is because you are claiming that he pointed his gun at Rosenbaum first and then Rosenbaum chased him, not the other way around. 

You just proved my point that ""He retreated as far as he could while yelling friendly."" and that you are having to say something that is objectively wrong and is contradictory to your previous claims in order to act otherwise

&gt; 
Okay, so more mouthing off. Got it. That has nothing to do with Rittenhouse’s self-defense claim.

According to you, it definitevely proves self defense

""What facts besides Rittenhouse being 6 feet under would prove that to you?""


""I mean, anything showing he reasonably feared for his life? If Rosenbaum had been armed. **If Rosenbaum hadn’t very clearly been trying to avoid being shot.** If Rosenbaum had actually been physically aggressive towards Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him. Things like that.""

And yes, if a serial child molester that just got out of a mental hospital is screaming ""shoot me"", you should presume he is suicidal.

&gt; That’s not an attack.


The start of your last comment was literally affirming that ""Indeed"" it is an attack

If Rittenhouse hadn't been able to get a gun he would most likely be dead. The reason he was there in Kenosha was to try to defend businesses from rioters. You can argue that he and others shouldn't have had to be there defending those places because the police should have arrested or otherwise stopped them, but Rittenhouse realized the law wasn't going to protect them and did a heroic thing to try and defend his community. Which is a tremendously courageous act, and he should be treated like a hero instead of a criminal.

&gt;	The other person could literally put his hand inside his pocket and claim he's holding a gun he's gonna kill you with and that would give you legal right to shoot him on the spot in self defense.

Did Rosenbaum do that?

&gt;	an unarmed person can still kill you if you don't do anything to defend yourself.

Did Rosenbaum give Rittenhouse any reason to think he *would*? 

&gt;	Kyle had no way to know what Rosenbaum was or wasn't armed with.

Rittenhouse testified under oath that he knew Rosenbaum was unarmed. 

&gt;	Rosenbaum repeteadly tried to take Kyle's gun away, after ambushing him and telling him he'd kill him.

When someone’s pointing a gun at you, the natural response is to push the barrel away. That’s not reason for Rittenhouse to fear for his life. 

And Rittenhouse did not testify that he was ambushed. 

&gt;	So your whole bullshit about ""bUT rOsemBaum waSNT ArmeD!!!!"" Doesn't hold any fucking weight. 

Not on its own, but absolutely in context.

--------------------------------

jumas_turbo @ 2021-11-11 20:44:57 :

&gt;Did Rosenbaum do that

YES, he EXPLICITLY said he would kill Kyle.

&gt;Did Rosenbaum did anything to make thing Kyle he would.

1: see my reply above.
2: Rosenbaum chased Kyle after having issued a death threat, despite Kyle trying to run away and even shouting ""friendly, friendly!""

So yes, he did 

&gt;Kyle said he knew Rosenbaum was unarmed.

Kyle could have thought that and he wouldn't have had a way to actually know for sure, not to mention it's irrelevant since Rosenbaum had already shown deadly intent. It is very reasonable to assume that Rosenbaum wanted to take the gun away to shoot Kyle with it.

&gt;Rosenbaum was ok to try to wrestle Kyle's gun away because he was pointing it at Rosenbaum

He was pointing it at Rosenbaum because Rosenbaum was fucking chasing him after saying he'd kill Kyle 😂 

&gt;And Rittenhouse did not testify he was ambushed.

Did you watch the drone videos? Rosenbaum snuck up behind a car and chased Kyle through the parking lot. Zimminski shot at Kyle's direction while Kyle was  being charged by Rosenbaum, leading Kyle to shoot Rosenbaum.

&gt;Not on its own but it does in context!

No it fucking doesn't. Go watch the drone videos, they show Rosenbaum chasing after Kyle unprovoked.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2021-11-11 20:52:08 :

&gt;	YES, he EXPLICITLY said he would kill Kyle.

I asked if he pretended he was armed, not if he mouthed off a few hours before. 

&gt;	Rosenbaum chased Kyle after having issued a death threat, despite Kyle trying to run away and even shouting ""friendly, friendly!""

Shouting “friendly, friendly” *while aiming his AR-15 at Rosenbaum*. Real convincing…

&gt;	Kyle could have thought that and he wouldn't have had a way to actually know for sure, not to mention it's irrelevant since Rosenbaum had already shown deadly intent

It absolutely matters. Rittenhouse needs to show he reasonably feared for his life. Knowing whether Rosenbaum is armed is absolutely relevant to that. 

Why was Rittenhouse, armed with a rifle, reasonably afraid that an unarmed man was about to kill him?

&gt;	He was pointing it at Rosenbaum because Rosenbaum was fucking chasing him after saying he'd kill Kyle 😂

He was pointing it at Rosenbaum before being chased

&gt;	Did you watch the drone videos? Rosenbaum snuck up behind a car and chased Kyle through the parking lot. Zimminski shot at Kyle's direction while Kyle was being charged by Rosenbaum, leading Kyle to shoot Rosenbaum.

That is not at all clear from the drone video. And Rittenhouse testified that he did not know at the time he was being shot at. 

Besides, Ziminski firing his gun does not give Rittenhouse the right to shoot *Rosenbaum*. That’s not how self-defend works.

--------------------------------

jumas_turbo @ 2021-11-11 21:01:52 :

You absolutely do not know how self defense works and you also don't even know the facts of the case. I refuse to reply further until you actually educate yourself on what happened so you stop spewing bullshit.

But I'll just say this: it is IRRELEVANT if Rosenbaum was unarmed and Kyle wasn't. Self defense requires you to fear for your life. You're idiotically suggesting that Kyle wasn't in danger because he was armed, meaning that Kyle being armed rendered him immune against Rosenbaum's attacked. So what if Kyle didn't actually do anything and just let Rosenbaum attack him? Then Rosenbaum knocks him out with a single punch (perfectly possible) then proceeds to bash his head in while unconscious OR takes his gun and shoots him with it.

&gt;Zimminski shooting doesn't mean Kyle could shoot!

Except it absolutely does and you just keep proving you have no understanding of how self defense is determined in the legal system. The beauty of self defense is that the law KNOWS that the person isn't a psychic so he's actually not supposed to know ALL of the events around him. If there is a group chasing you and you hear gunshots while someone is charging at you (and said someone already expressed desire to kill you) you're absolutely entitled to shoot at the closest threat to preserve your life.

You have no idea how self defense works. Educate yourself on the subject before answering further. Also Kyle didn't aim at Rosenbaum unprovoked, your whole argument rests on the premise that Rosenbaum didn't pose a threat to Kyle because he was unarmed and Kyle wasn't, which is stupid as hell since that's not how self defense works.

--------------------------------

speedyjohn @ 2021-11-11 21:13:47 :

&gt;	You absolutely do not know how self defense works and you also don't even know the facts of the case. I refuse to reply further until you actually educate yourself on what happened so you stop spewing bullshit.

I am a law student and have been “educating myself” for two years. 

How have you “educated yourself”?

&gt;	But I'll just say this: it is IRRELEVANT if Rosenbaum was unarmed and Kyle wasn't. Self defense requires you to fear for your life

Again, that is incorrect. It requires that you *reasonably* fear for your life. Whether or not you or the person you’re “afraid” of is armed is *absolutely* a relevant factor. Not the only factor, but absolutely relevant. 

&gt;	You're idiotically suggesting that Kyle wasn't in danger because he was armed, meaning that Kyle being armed rendered him immune against Rosenbaum's attacked. 

No, I’m saying that *part* of why Rittenhouse didn’t reasonably fear for his life is because he was armed and Rosenbaum wasn’t. 

&gt;	So what if Kyle didn't actually do anything and just let Rosenbaum attack him? Then Rosenbaum knocks him out with a single punch (perfectly possible) then proceeds to bash his head in while unconscious OR takes his gun and shoots him with it.

1) Rittenhouse had options other than doing nothing and shooting Rosenbaum four times. 

2) You *still* haven’t established that it was reasonable to think that Rosenbaum was going to knock Rittenhouse out or steal his gun and shoot him. 

&gt;&gt; Zimminski shooting doesn't mean Kyle could shoot!

&gt;	Except it absolutely does and you just keep proving you have no understanding of how self defense is determined in the legal system

Okay, do you have a case or statute for the proposition that a third party firing a gun (which, remember, Rittenhouse didn’t think was fired at him) justifies shooting *someone else* in “self-defense”?

Rittenhouse had to reasonably fear that *Rosenbaum* was a threat to his life. The gunshot, which he *knew* didn’t come from Rosenbaum, is irrelevant. 

&gt;	The beauty of self defense is that the law KNOWS that the person isn't a psychic so he's actually not supposed to know ALL of the events around him. If there is a group chasing you and you hear gunshots while someone is charging at you (and said someone already expressed desire to kill you) you're absolutely entitled to shoot at the closest threat to preserve your life.

Sure, if you thought the guy chasing you was shooting at you. Rittenhouse testified that he *knew* he wasn’t.

&gt;	You have no idea how self defense works. Educate yourself on the subject before answering further. 

What makes you the expert, again?

&gt;	Kyle didn't aim at Rosenbaum unprovoked, your whole argument rests on the premise that Rosenbaum didn't pose a threat to Kyle because he was unarmed and Kyle wasn't, which is stupid as hell since that's not how self defense works.

Provocation is not relevant (and also it’s not at all clear that Rittenhouse was provoked). And “posing a threat” isn’t the standard for self-defense. Which you should know, since apparently you’re an expert.

--------------------------------

Intrepid-Client9449 @ 2021-11-11 21:29:47 :

He grabbed Rittenhouses gun. That shows intent to use the weapon on rittenhouse

He retreated as far as he could while yelling friendly. 

&gt; 2) You still haven’t established that it was reasonable to think that Rosenbaum was going to knock Rittenhouse out or steal his gun and shoot him.

speedyjohn @ 2021-11-11 21:36:32 :

No, it doesn’t. It shows intent to *disarm* Rittenhouse, which is not intent to kill. 

And, honestly, it doesn’t even show that. Rosenbaum could just as well have been pushing the barrel away from *his chest where Rittenhouse had been aiming.*

&gt;	He retreated as far as he could while yelling friendly.

Really? As far as he could? Because he kept running after he shot Rosenbaum. 

And yelling “friendly” is kinda meaningless when, again, you’re *aiming your rifle at someone.*

&gt;	What facts besides Rittenhouse being 6 feet under would prove that to you?

I mean, anything showing he reasonably feared for his life? If Rosenbaum had been armed. If Rosenbaum hadn’t *very clearly* been trying to avoid being shot. If Rosenbaum had actually been physically aggressive towards Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him. Things like that.

--------------------------------

Intrepid-Client9449 @ 2021-11-11 21:49:34 :

&gt; No, it doesn’t. It shows intent to disarm Rittenhouse, which is not intent to kill.

There are thousands of cases of case law showing that is intent to kill, because there are hundreds of police shootings *per year* that rely on this

You would know that if you were a law student

&gt; And, honestly, it doesn’t even show that. Rosenbaum could just as well have been pushing the barrel away from his chest where Rittenhouse had been aiming.

He chased Rittenhouse for a hundred yards, that is an utterly absurd statement

&gt; Really? As far as he could? Because he kept running after he shot Rosenbaum.

Either

1) Film yourself running into the side of a Chevrolet Suburban at full speed and running through the car. How the steel and glass will just vanish if you try running through it. 

2) Film yourself running into a wall at full speed then running at a 90 degree angle to said wall. Because he would have had to made a 90 degree turn and ran between a 2 foot gap between the suburban and the sedan to run in a different direction

Because that is what he needed to do to continue running

He walked out of the way of the cars before running again. Not through the cars. 

&gt; And yelling “friendly” is kinda meaningless when, again, you’re aiming your rifle at someone.

...you are claiming he was running backwards at full speed? with his gun shouldered? That isnt even physically possible for any human to do. And we have video showing that he was facing the other direction while running. Because people run forwards. Not backwards. 

He did not turn around and aim at rittenhouse until he could not run any more, because that would require teleporting through a Chevy Suburbab

&gt; If Rosenbaum hadn’t very clearly been trying to avoid being shot.

#He  was asking people to shoot him that night. Repeatedly.

Then fucking attacked someone. Dont attack people if you dont want to get shot. Especially people that are clearly armed. 


&gt; If Rosenbaum had actually been physically aggressive towards Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him.

There is nothing more physically aggressive than that. Gouging out someones eyeball with your thumb and eating it is less aggressive than trying to disarm somoene.

Prove that.

Because literally all that is proven here is that he could run. Do you understand that just because someone ran at at a time before an incident and a time after an incident, it does not mean they could run during the incident? Think of a valve in the kitchen sink. The water can run out of it before you turn it off. It can run after you turn it off. but it cannot run while the ball valve is switched off. The ball valve was switched off because Rittenhouse was blocked from running by 3 cars. When he walked away from the cars he could run again. 

&gt; We do have video. And it shows him aiming his gun at Rosenbaum as he moves away (as well as before).

Provide the video that proves he was running backwards with the gun shouldered and aimed at Rosenbaum while running full speed 



&gt; When did he ask to be shot? 

Jason Lackowski testified as such, as well as the whole video:

[Shoot me nigger. Shoot me nigger. Bust on me. For real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N70fok1R2Kg)

&gt;  And is asking to be shot an acceptable reason for shooting him?

According to you, yes:

""I mean, anything showing he reasonably feared for his life? If Rosenbaum had been armed. **If Rosenbaum hadn’t very clearly been trying to avoid being shot.** If Rosenbaum had actually been physically aggressive towards Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him. Things like that.""

We have proven that he tried getting shot. Dont change the goalpost

&gt; Who did he attack? And when?

He grabbed his gun

&gt; Also, I’m glad that you now admit that it matters that Rittenhouse was armed and Rosenbaum wasn’t.

I have kept that position the entire time - the fact that Rosenbaum grabbed Rittenhouses gun makes it inarguably self defense

&gt; What is wrong with you?

Stop arguing in bad faith."	6	0	stop arguing comment					"The theory that I have is that most major socialist movements in history (as well as many contemporary movements) are primarily driven by a loathing for the rich.

While many people call the USSR/China to be ""not socialism"", IMO the founding principles and ideas that drove the Russian Revolution and the Cultural Revolution are generally socialist, and a large swath of people generally believed and popularly supported in the ideals -- at least initially.

My argument is that ""hatred of the rich"" is a unifying element of nearly all socialist movements, and many socialist movements accrue critical mass most easily by fanning the population's hatred of the rich. Even though not everyone in a socialist movement may agree on exactly on how to implement a socialist state after the revolution, everyone agrees that the downfall of the rich must happen *now*.

And that's precisely what happened in the communist revolutions.

The rich were evicted from power / persecuted / jailed, but the movements largely fall apart due to a lack of universal consensus on how to implement a socialist state. Initial popular support crumbles after the 'enemies' are removed, and resentment rises against the controlling group because most people don't get exactly the kind of socialism that they wanted. The revolution deviates from the original vision due to practical reasons and it becomes a perversion of what most people would consider ""socialism"" in its purist form.

I genuinely think this is probably what would happen to most major socialists movements, particularly those that are driven by hatred of the rich. Even if a movement claims that it does not hate the rich, this notion sort of occurs incidentally by the nature of socialism itself (whether by the rhetoric used or other features of campaigning for socialism), and it's the most salient and popular feature of the ideology.

I think if socialism remotely has a chance to work, I think it should be primarily motivated by a communal desire and widespread cultural values to help the poor. Rather than investing energy into 1% protests (which IMO is strictly all about hating the rich; everyone including people at the 51% percentile should be actively helping the poor), we should proactively be pooling resources into community chests and and community organizations to help the least fortunate members of their own communities. We should be encouraging people regardless of their level of income (whether you are at the 30th percentile or the 75th percentile) to volunteer and contribute to helping the lowest percentile."

Milwaukee was run by Socialist mayors for 40 years (1920-1960). During that time, they installed water and sewer systems, established a parks system that is STILL winning national awards, had one of the best school systems in the country, and was home to major manufacturing plants employing skilled workers. It was called the Workshop to the World. 

They were known for ruthlessly rooting out corruption, and they always had balanced budgets. Even during the Great Depression.

&gt; which instituted racist policies across the country, including redlining.

Southern democrats didnt institute redlining, jews in NYC did. The South East US was never the core of the US financial system and redlining is a banking practice. 

Because redlining was not based on race, it was based on foreclosure rates. If you forclose the bank loses money so they want to either charge an increased rate or refuse to lend at all, based on the neighborhood involved. Hence why the term red line - you do not lend to the area within a red line. 

Though realistically that did not matter much at all because in the 50s houses were just cheap and past then, mortgage interest rates were so absurd that you could buy a house cash easily. Because house prices are a derivitive of interest rates not the other way around, the payment for a  30 year mortgage has always hovered between 900 and 1200 on average

Rents in redlined areas were 50-100% higher than outside, meaning people could not save money.

Black people are disproportionately imprisoned for murder today - at 6 times the rates for whites. 

The only way for that to be the case is some combination of the following:

1) Blacks are more likely to commit murder

2) White people are going into our inner cities and being the ones who actually kill gang members

3) Police are ignoring 80+% of white people that are getting murdered

Which one of those 3 options shows anti-black racism? because we are talking about an outcome where blacks are disproportionately going to prison.

He also played an increasingly major role in shaping foreign policy, especially with respect to Lend-Lease, support for China, helping Jewish refugees, and proposing (in the ""Morgenthau Plan"") to prevent Germany from again being a military threat.

Your 3 options are essentially shit you came up with in 2 minutes of thinking about how you could best create a straw-man out of the situation.

None of the above 3 are even close to reasonable attempts at explaining the crime rates.

I would start with the fact that if we go back to redlining, the knock-on effect on black communities has been to foster an environment where poverty is far more prevalent than it is elsewhere and this desperation leads to an increase in crime rates.

Another factor would be how marijuana, heroin and crack cocaine were deliberately introduced to black neighbourhoods, and then heavily criminalised once they took hold.

Number 6 is not a gross ethical because that A. Not what he did, B. What he did do was given permission by the judge. He requested to, with permission to illustrate the position of the three people who attacked him, per the claims he pointed his gun at them. Again with judges permission, he was given the gun (made safe as can be, yeah people will say no gun is safe, which is a good motto but let's go through the process of this weapon took so I can just say safe. A seized weapon in lock up is separated from magazine and cleared of the chamber before being stored Bolt open, typically with a bolt lock to signify there is no chance of fire. (If you see talk of a bolt flag, it's the same thing just less permanent, commonly used in cleaning a gun). This weapon was then, taken out of storage, handed to a fire arms bailiff, who, before entering the courtroom double checked the weapon, with two signatures proving it was double checked. Upon entering the court the weapon was handed to another bailiff who then proceeded to do the exact same thing in front of the court. Only then was the weapon surrendered to the lawyer. So uhhhh it's a safe weapon for the layman. Gun aficionados are correct, every gun in your hand is loaded, but we gotta accept this one wasn't cuz frankly everyone there knew it). Once given this gun he was instructed to point at a vacated section of Wall, near but not actually at the jury. So strike 2 is also out, cuz well he didn't actually point at them. He did break the 3 rule of gun safety though. It's a big one on the in, but it's one a lot of novices break. FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER, IF YOURE NOT FIRING IT RIGHT NOW! Finger on the trigger means a sneeze, a bump or an earthquake might start you firing. So anyway the judge said sure, the weapon was safe (bite me) and he didn't point at them.

Because the quality of children's medical care should not be tied to the question, ""Are St.Judes spokeschildren as cute as the dogs in ASPCA commercials?"" People often choose to give to less valuable causes for poor reasons.

Furthermore, giant charities are evidence of a dysfunctional system of government.

If our society recognizes that a problem is so grave that people willingly give billions to it, our government should seek to mitigate that problem.

&gt; However, Peterson goes further, into its most paranoid territory. His bete noire is what he calls “postmodern neo-Marxism” or “cultural Marxism”. In a nutshell: having failed to win the economic argument, Marxists decided to infiltrate the education system and undermine western values with “vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas”, such as identity politics, that will pave the road to totalitarianism.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cultural Marxism...**  


Where have I heard that term before...  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural\_Marxism\_conspiracy\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory)  


&gt;Cultural Marxism is a far-right antisemitic conspiracy theory which claims Western Marxism as the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert Western culture.

how is jordan peterson a anti-semite? and he's assigning his own definition to ""cultural marxism"" not the literal definition

Also so long as he's using a different definition you'd figure he'd be able to come up with a different name for this completely different phenomenon that doesn't harken back to far right conspiracy theories then....

It's like... if you name your kid ""Adolf Hitler"" that doesn't 100% make you a Nazi... but why did he feel the need to call it Cultural Marxism/why didn't he change its title once he discovered the name was already taken by a far right conspiracy theory?

The fact that he still calls his theory Cultural Marxism.

&gt;The theory claims that an elite of Marxist theorists and Frankfurt School intellectuals are **subverting Western society**

Decoupling the religious aspect from it doesn't really matter, it just means you've chosen a secular version for a more secular age of the same old fascist theory.  Except that even though Jordon likes to play fast and loose with his religious beliefs, he still decries lack of objective morality as a bad thing....

IE he still believes the two core tenants of...

&gt;the Judeo-Christian ethic is what underpins the value systems of Western civilization; and, atheists and “anti-religious thinkers” are abandoning this tradition to our collective peril

So it's really hard for me to believe that he doesn't care about Christian Values being undermined when you know... he hates on Atheists the exact same way and for more or less the exact same reasons that Christians do positing that Atheists are a danger to society because they don't have an objective moral system....

&gt;They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the West with their resentment-ridden ideology. They have made it their life's mission to undermine Western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive and “patriarchal.”

Then

&gt;You're supporting ideologues who claim that all truth is subjective; that all sex differences are socially constructed; and that Western imperialism is the sole source of all Third World problems. They are the post-modernists, pushing “progressive” activism at a college near you.

And

&gt;Their thinking took hold in Western universities in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when the true believers of the radical left became the professors of today. And now we rack up education-related debt—not so that our children learn to think critically, write clearly, or speak properly, but so they can model their mentors' destructive agenda.

And

&gt;First is their new unholy trinity of diversity, equity and inclusion. Diversity is defined not by opinion, but by **race, ethnicity or sexual identity**; equity is no longer the laudable goal of equality of opportunity, but the insistence on equality of outcome; and inclusion is the use of identity-based quotas to attain this misconceived state of equity.

And

&gt;All the classic rights of the West are to be considered secondary to these new values. Take, for example, freedom of speech—the very pillar of democracy. The post-modernists refuse to believe that people of good will can exchange ideas and reach consensus.

And

&gt;Third, and finally, are the politics of identity. Post-modernists don't believe in individuals. You're an exemplar of your race, sex, or sexual preference. You're also either a victim or an oppressor. No wrong can be done by anyone in the former group, and no good by the latter. Such ideas of victimization do nothing but justify the use of power and engender intergroup conflict.

Then of course the big jackpot...

&gt;**All these concepts originated with Karl Marx,** the 19th-century German philosopher. Marx viewed the world as a gigantic class struggle—the bourgeoisie against the proletariat; the grasping rich against the desperate poor. But wherever his ideas were put into practice—in the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, to name just a few—whole economies failed, and tens of millions were killed. We fought a decades-long cold war to stop the spread of those murderous notions. **But they're back, in the new guise of identity politics.**

Jordon Peterson clearly believes that Cultural Marxism is destroying Western Society.

&gt;Hierarchies are everywhere. It is often argued that they are a social construct, invented to allow certain people (such as white men) to have power over others. But not everyone agrees. While promoting his new book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, psychology professor Jordan Peterson, of the University of Toronto, has sparked debate by arguing that hierarchies are in fact natural to some extent.

The belief that hierarchies are good/natural is textbook right wing.

If you think hierarchies are good /natural you're right wing if you think they're bad then you're left wing, that's the best way to define the two political groups...

The standard ""size of government"" divide for example sorts ""Anarchists"" and ""AnCaps"" into both being right wing, which makes it obviously factually wrong.

Peterson believes that hierarchies are inescapable, and so he is right wing.

iwfan53 @ 2021-11-29 07:15:00 :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;he's far-right and fascist is a stretch

I'll say it again, **I don't believe he's a fascist.**

I just believe he regurgitates fascist talking points without realizing it.  


&gt;why/how would you use hierarchies to tell between left-wing and right-wing, there is no hierarchy that shows if you are right or left in America;

You have COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY misunderstood how the hierarchies thing works.

I'll give a college try to explain it to you, but if this fails then then someone smarter than me would have to do the job....

So, lets take a look at one particular question...

""Should a person's access to cheap health insurance be dependent upon their employer?""

The right wing pro-hierarchy view is ""Yes"" because the hierarchy of being a member of a company will supply this necessary service to those who prove worthy of it by being good employees.

The left wing anti-hierarchy view is ""No"" because people should have access to health insurance regardless of if they hold a position in a business hierarchy or not.

**The left wing wants to decrease the amount of power that the business hierarchy has over people's lives.**

&gt;it's based on your ideology and sometimes the party you align with but you can still hold beliefs from any party/ideology

It's not a hierarchies that people are sorted into.... **it is the ideology that people hold on the concept of hierarchies that divides left from right.**

A really helpful example of this is Anarchists and AnCaps (Anarcho-capitalism).

Both of these groups want to get rid of the modern day state as we know it... and yet it would be extremely misleading to believe that both of these groups belong to the same ""political wing"".

This is why ""size of government"" is not a useful measuring stick, because both Anarchists and AnCaps want a smaller (non-existent) government.

The difference is that Anarchists think that by doing away with the Government, they can do away with the concept hierarchies completely.  AnCaps on the other hand think that by doing away with Government then they will be free to assert ""just"" and ""warranted"" meritocratic hierarchies of the free market.

You've so completely misunderstood what I said that if this doesn't clear things up I'm not sure how else I can help you...."

I can't seem to understand why people feel the need to be called they/them for instance. Or identifying yourself as ""another gender"" than male or female.

I fully understand and respect if someone wants to change their gender from the one they're born as. So I can understand why a man would want to be referred to as a woman or vice-versa. In that case there's a mismatch between your ""brain's sex"" and your genitalia (from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong). So for instance your brain is biologically female, but you have a penis. As such it makes sense to me why someone would want to be recognized by the ""sex of their brain"" rather than the genitalia they have.

But if someone doesn't know whether or not they identify as male or female, or feel like they're a little bit of both, why not just refer to yourself as whichever sex you have?

I understand that there's an idea of what a man/woman should be in society and you might not want to categorize into one of those. But I (and it seems like most people today) think you shouldn't have to fit into those norms to be considered a man or a woman, your biological sex or sexual identity is what matters.

I mean, wanting to wear a skirt as a man doesn't mean you can't call yourself male. Likewise, being a tomboyish woman doesn't mean you can't call yourself female.

Lets say if you get enough of chemical A you have a brain chemistry that is female, and if you get enough of chemical B you have a brain chemistry that is male.

**Is there any possibility that a person's brain chemistry might be different in such a way that they lack enough of both chemicals to have a clearly defined ""brain sex""?**

&gt;But if someone doesn't know whether or not they identify as male or female, or feel like they're a little bit of both, why not just refer to yourself as whichever sex you have?

Because they don't feel like that sex.  They don't have the brain chemistry of someone who feels like that sex.  **Why should they be forced to identify as something their brain chemistry is different from in this one particular case?**

[https://neurosciencenews.com/machine-learning-gender-15717/](https://neurosciencenews.com/machine-learning-gender-15717/)

&gt;The researchers used machine learning algorithms that could provide evidence that sex/gender may not be a dichotomic entity in the human brain. In an unbiased pattern-learning approach they could show that **at least nine dimensions of brain-gender variation can be robustly identified.** That is, the particular individuals can be assigned to nine “expressions” or coordinate system axes of how much they fall along a particular distribution of brain-gender variation.

I get what you are saying, but wouldn't that imply that you would be neutral towards your sex. Hence it would be logical to refer to yourself as the sex which your genitalia matches, it is after all just a biological trait. If you feel neutral towards your sexual identity, that doesn't mean you don't have a penis/vagina that do determine your sex. 

I'd say it would be the same as calling a blonde person blonde. It's a trait which you don't necessarily identify with, that doesn't mean it's not an identifying feature you have. I think the same would apply to sex in that situation

--------------------------------

iwfan53 @ 2021-12-06 00:37:14 :

&gt;Hence it would be logical to refer to yourself as the sex which your genitalia matches,

Referring to yourself as the sex which your genitalia matches when you have a different brain chemistry than cis people who have matching genitalia denies such a person the ability to fully express themselves.

**That's why they don't want do it.**

&gt;I'd say it would be the same as calling a blonde person blonde. It's a trait which you don't necessarily identify with, that doesn't mean it's not an identifying feature you have.

Think about it this way...

Person 1: Hey Person 2, you're blonde.

(how person 2 looks)

**Is it correct to call a strawberry blonde person blonde, or should you use the most accurate terminology possible?**

--------------------------------

Killerzqp @ 2021-12-06 00:58:53 :

Well I guess that's a fair point, but I also don't think it's practical to be so specific. If you go down that rabbit hole you'd have to use hex codes or something to refer to someone's hair color.

--------------------------------

iwfan53 @ 2021-12-06 01:03:30 :

&gt;Well I guess that's a fair point, but I also don't think it's practical to be so specific.

Please remember the Golden Rule.

""Do unto others are you would have them do unto you.""

I want people to refer to me by the correct gender/correct set of gender pronouns, so I do the same for other people.  **That is why I find it practical to refer to people by whatever gender/set of pronouns they desire, because I'm expecting them to do the same for me.**

--------------------------------

Killerzqp @ 2021-12-06 01:38:30 :

No I agree, if someone wants me to use a certain pronoun to refer to them I will out of respect (for the vast majority of cases at least), but I still don't understand why they feel that need and that's what I'm trying to understand here

Well then we go back to my earlier comments...

&gt;Referring to yourself as the sex which your genitalia matches when you have a different brain chemistry than cis people who have matching genitalia denies such a person the ability to fully express themselves.

**This non-binary person with a penis does not have male brain chemistry, so they do not wished to be referred to as male.**

--------------------------------

Killerzqp @ 2021-12-06 02:33:46 :

But if they don't then identify as female either, the deciding factor (in my opinion) should then be the biological sex you have.  And I don't think that strips away your ability to express yourself at all. You are still you whether or not someone refers to you as male or female.

I can't really imagine what it would look like to have a brain chemistry that doesn't fit into either male or female. And that's giving me a hard time believing that the brain would find itself between those two states, but I'll have to do some research because that is based on nothing but assumptions. So I'll admit that I lack some knowledge to fully support my view on the topic.

(I feel like I sound pretty incoherent, so I apologize if that's the case. It's past 3AM right now so I'm a bit sleep deprived)

--------------------------------

iwfan53 @ 2021-12-06 02:36:09 :

&gt;But if they don't then identify as female either, the deciding factor (in my opinion) should then be the biological sex you have. 

They disagree.  


They do not feel comfortable identifying as male for any reason.  


**Would you be willing to take the word of a non-binary person directly telling you this?**

Wooba12 @ 2021-12-06 04:59:59 :

I don't think it's as if the OP doesn't believe non-binary people. He's certainly willing to accommodate their needs and desires to the best of his ability. But he's looking to understand, rather than to prove it one way or another."	"HollerinScholar @ 2021-12-06 13:14:07 :

Nonbinary person here, I think your questions and assertions have been pretty much spot on, I look forward to OP's response. 

It's about agency. It's also about reasonable accommodation. So far in this thread, OP loses me when they make the determination that despite how ""little of a desire"" (on the most optimistic end of the spectrum, usually more like ""how shittily it makes them feel"") they have to be referred to as such, that the biological genitalia you're born with should be the overriding shortcut to pronouns (which would still leaves the jury out on Intersex folks, of course).

The thing is, we've been doing that for millenia at this point, and it's only until recently that society has found a way to broach this  (on a global scale, people outside of the gender binary have existed throughout history). And why not? To OP: **the point is that it helps a lot of people feel a lot less shitty to the point that it makes a measurable difference in the quality of life for a non-insignificant number of people, so if we can do that, we should.**

I've been called all sorts of names, and not just gender based ones. And I don't tend to give a fuck. Call me what the fuck you like. I know what I am, who I am, and I'm happy with that.

You asked my personal take on my own personal circumstances, that's all this is. There is no reflection on you and how you feel in the same situations.

Your answer is right for you, but I just don't think it would ever apply to me. And I'd very much not feel shitty for it, as it's them that's wrong. Shit happens.

&gt;and the generation following the civil war was not any more liberal

I would have to be a sociology professor to prove you wrong at this point so I'm going to just stop arguing because I don't have the right facts I need on hand."	2	0	stop arguing comment					"I want to preface by saying I do believe the civil war was about slavery and that it was the wrong decision. However when it comes to monuments and symbolism I believe they should be preserved 

First off many people claim these statues were built to intimidate black people with the fact that most statues were not built until the 1900s. However I believe this is nonsense when you think of it logically. First off traditionally there were very few monuments built immediately after a person’s death. The Washington monument started construction 50 years after his death, the Jefferson monument 100 years after, even the Lincoln memorial was not built until 1914 50 years after his death, and around the time when most confederate statues went up. Makes you wonder why there are not charts showing union monuments going up

So the fact it took 50 years for statues for confederates to come up is nothing unusual. It also makes sense economically as it took 30 years for the south to recover after the war, and even the rest of the country

On top of that if the south wanted to intimidate black people why not build statues of the KKK and slaves being whipped? Black schools were horribly underfunded so how would most african americans know about generals and politicians like Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis? This also contradicts the lost cause narrative that southern states rewrote history books to whitewash the confederacy meaning these symbols are meant to intimidate black people while denying slavery or claiming slavery was not that bad? Was the south a blatantly racist society promoting white supremacy or a society denying its racism?

As for the flag itself first off the rectangular “confederate” flag was used in the civil war despite what many people say. It was originally designed by William P. Miles though it had just 7 stars instead of 13 and it was rectangular but rejected from being the national flag however it would be used by several battalions and a square version most famously used by Robert Lee. And as for its use by the KKK it wasn’t until after WWII when they appropriated it due to the association of the STATES RIGHTS PARTY or the Dixiecrats. However i don’t think that makes it a hate symbol nor does it mean anyone who uses it is a racist 

The fact is this. The statues were built to commemorate the civil war and recognize those who died during the war. There simply is no good reason to remove these statues or symbols. If someone personally thinks it’s hateful then that’s their problem. And if we are getting rid of every flag associated with the confederacy [then france better change their flag soon](https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/bonham/bonham--flags_of_louisiana_files/800px-Flag_of_Louisiana_(January_1861).svg.png)"	"iwfan53 @ 2021-12-12 20:32:55 :

&gt;On top of that if the south wanted to intimidate black people why not build statues of the KKK and slaves being whipped?

Because they didn't wanted plausible deniability so that people like you would make the arguments your making about how these statues weren't racist.

Are you familiar with the concept of Doublethink?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink)

&gt;Doublethink is a process of indoctrination whereby the subject is expected to simultaneously accept two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in contravention to one's own memories or sense of reality  


  
Or as it was described in the 1984..  


&gt;To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word—doublethink—involved the use of doublethink

So blatantly racist things like Jim Crow laws got passed, but then got repealed within a few decades.

But quasi-blatantly racist statues... didn't get torn down at the same time as Jim Crow got repealed.

The entire point of the Lost Cause Mythology is to play the long game and slowly bring the nation around to seeing the CSA as not such bad people.

I don't have to perfectly predict what 100 years in the future will look like to make long reaching plan.

""People in the future will be more socially liberal than the current generation so we had best plan for that possibility"" is an analysis you could make in roughly any point in America post the Civil War just by looking at the current generation's children and extrapolating.

It's the social equivalent of betting on the stock market being will be higher ten from years now than it is at the moment...

Even if it's less than 1% dead, that's still a ton of people. Plus even if you live, you can have serious long-term complications; end up with huge medical bills; overwhelm the hospital system; spread it to the immunocompromised; etc. If you don't want the vaccine, you do you, but it's still a major public health issue, even with a less than 1% fatality rate.

LordJesterTheFree @ 2021-12-22 03:55:51 :

It has everything to do with people who refuse to get vaccinated not for their own sake but for other peoples sake because the reality is it is objectively negligence that is leading to wrongful death. now proving it in a court of law is another matter which is why it's logistically impossible to enforce in such a way. so the solution is prevent people from wrongfully killing other people.

--------------------------------

Basicallysteve @ 2021-12-22 04:03:41 :

Even if everyone was vaccinated they’d still be at risk. They’d be at risk of other diseases AND covid (seeing as these vaccines don’t prevent the spread).

--------------------------------

LordJesterTheFree @ 2021-12-22 04:08:45 :

No vaccine prevents the spread of anything 100% but the vaccine does make the spread much less likely to a point that it is a case of negligent wrongful death to not get it if you happen to spread it to someone else who dies of it

It's like a safety railing on a construction site sure it won't make the likelihood that a worker will fall off 0% and maybe some people are smart enough to not fall off even without a railing but if you don't put a railing up the people who do fall are still your responsibility because you didn't take an extremely basic precaution to ensure their safety contrary to the recommendations of public officials on the matter

The cheap construction guy could get lucky and 0 people could fall off or he could not and then be liable for a wrongful death lawsuit it's basically the same situation except with disease it's logistically impossible to prove wrongful death in a sense that you spread the disease in the same sense as an employer employed someone

LordJesterTheFree @ 2021-12-22 06:36:39 :

But the point of the post is that it's not a vaccine mandate it's a testing mandate with an exemption for people who are vaccinated

I'm opposed to a vaccine mandate as well because it does violate bodily autonomy however with that said so long as your body isn't safe it needs to be tested and that's what the Mandate is about because at the point where you start affecting other people that it becomes a problem

It's kind of like how you have a right to throw punches aimed at the empty space in front of you all you want however that right ends the second someone else's face begins in the same since you have a right to do whatever you want with your own body it's your body your choice however that right ends whenever you start interacting with other people and their immune systems begin

The vast majority of people barring a few really weird people who I've never encountered but might exist somewhere, don't believe anyone is changing biological sex via the technology we have today.

You may be unintentionally strawmaning the people you disagree with from what I can tell...

Transmen are not biological men, transwomen are not biological women, I'd agree with that....

But because ""biological"" is an adjective, it modifies the word men/women, in particular it denotes a subset of the total set.

So a transman is not a ""biological man"" but they still falls into the greater category of ""all possible men"" because some people are ""elective men  (for lack of a better term that I'm pretty sure exists but this is just me pulling words out of my rear)"".

If you're going to argue that this shouldn't be the case and ""biological men"" and ""men"" should be forced to be perfect synonyms I'm going to stop arguing because that's a much more complicated topic that I don't think I'll be able to change your view on.

Okay so here's a million adults with vaginas they've had since birth. Biological sex would catagorise them as all the same. And what's more they're all experiencing depression and we'd like to treat it. 

Someone suggests double mastectomies as a treatment, so we give everyone with a vagina who is depressed a double mastectomy. But it turns out that for the vast majority of people we're giving double mastectomies to this doesn't make them feel better and often makes them much feel worse.

Conclusion, people with vaginas like having breasts ~99% of the time.

But here's the thing, for some of these people a double mastectomy actually did improve their mood.

Now here's another million depressed adults wtih vaginas, if we just know they have vaginas we can conclude there's a low chance any of them would be helped by double mastectomy and so we shouldn't give anyone top surgery.

But then someone suggests what if we ask these people whether or not they identify as men or women.  Now we can repeat our top surgery experiment on those two groups, and it turns out you don't get the same 99% across groups. Implying that there's some difference between people with vaginas who identify as women and people with vaginas who identify as men, that's more predictive of whether or not they'd benifit from mastectomy than just whether or not they have vaginas.

So we have an anatomy question, and an identity question that predict the result of a test to different extents, implying they can't be equivilent.

&gt;Transitioning improves trans people’s mental health. New research I’ve carried out found that a positive attitude toward life, the ability to cope with stress and optimism about the future are all boosted by transitioning. These factors all shape one’s mental health status.

ZorgZeFrenchGuy @ 2021-12-23 05:42:42 :

That seems like a fair argument.  

While it does seem like a decent way to treat trans people, would that not still be a mental disorder?

iwfan53 @ 2021-12-23 05:45:18 :

Gender dysphoria is the mental disorder, transitioning is the treatment, because once the body is altered to agree with the brain, the gender dysphoria starts to decrease noticeable.

I totally get venting about a date gone wrong, or posting about not meeting someone who fits their standards, but how are people expecting to find a relationship with such a consistent negative mindset? 

Like many who post there, I also personally aim for having a partner that is socioeconomically equal to or higher than me, I work hard, have a good education, and can hold my own, I need a partner who can do the same for themselves. Doesn’t matter if they work construction or if they’re a professional streamer or what have you, I just aim for people who are doing /something/. The ridiculous standards on FDS are a little wack. Being told I /deserve/ someone with 6 figures when I myself only land in the 40k range is a bit of a reach. All in all, if the person I’m talking to doesn’t have ambitions or a sort of life plan, I kindly move on and have even remained good friends with a couple of guys I once casually dated.

The downfall of the sub is they’re consistently crapping on dudes who they deem ‘below them’ for myriad reasons that don’t make much sense.

VikingFjorden @ 2021-12-16 15:32:39 :

You'll see quickly that there's an inherent belief that ""high value men"" make up a disappearingly small portion of the male population, and everyone else is basically dogshit. It's a veiled way of saying that men, as a rule, are pieces of shit, and they are on a journey to find the needle in the haystack - the exception to the rule.

They say that a woman should never date someone who isn't on equal or better financial footing than herself, which in itself is reasonable. 

But then they turn around to say that if you're a man who wants to go dutch on a date, you're low value. As a man, you can't ever expect that your female partner contributes to your dates - her mere presence should be ""reward"" enough. So much for equality, and so much for being on the same financial footing.

They say relationships should be about respect and love, and give you this laundry list of things to ""look out for"" to find men who are trying to be with you for the wrong reasons. 

But then they turn around and say ""it's not a problem if you're a gold digger, men basically deserve to be emotionally manipulated and exploited for financial gain simply because they are men"".

As you read FDS, you'll see this type of trend more and more. There's the ""well this doesn't sound unreasonable at all"", and then 5 minutes later you go ""ah, I see now that I spoke entirely too soon""

They foster this illusion that women are inherently princesses to be revered and worshipped (silently, non-sexually and preferably with gifts or financial incentives), whose right it is to make a shopping list's worth of arbitrary demands from their potential male partner - but stunningly, they also reserve the right to not have any demands whatsoever placed on themselves by said potential partner. In FDS, a woman has every right to expect the man to be better off than her, pay for her, facilitate her personal growth and aspirations, just all in all make more effort than her in literally every aspect of life, and the man should not do anything else other than worship the ground she walks on - otherwise he's low value scum.

&gt;They say that a woman should never date someone who isn't on equal or better financial footing than herself, which in itself is reasonable.

How is that reasonable? If all women do that, they're going to run out of men who are as rich as or richer than them.

--------------------------------

VikingFjorden @ 2021-12-27 13:52:12 :

I don't think that will be the case. Statistically, men outrank women in wealth by a pretty large margin. We can speculate that the size of this gap is in some degree due to a small portion of ultra-wealthy men, but even discounting those I still think men are on average as wealthy (or more wealthy) as women.

Regardless of the statistics, it's not unreasonable to look for a partner who is roughly equal to you in terms of finances. Granted, it's not a criteria that will necessarily work for absolutely everyone. But that doesn't mean this single criteria is bad, it will just as easily be attributable to something else in that person's life.

--------------------------------

7elevenses @ 2021-12-27 13:58:12 :

If the man are on average as wealthy, then women looking only for richer men will certainly leave a lot of women without a partner. And if men are making substantially more money than women, that's a separate problem.

But in general, I think that this is a stupidly shallow way of deciding who you want to spend your life with. If you are making enough money for a stable life, why do you care about how much the other person makes? And if you aren't, why are you explicitly looking for somebody to support your financial needs?

--------------------------------

VikingFjorden @ 2021-12-27 14:10:41 :

&gt;then women looking only for richer men

Stop strawmanning. I'm not saying ""only richer"", I'm saying ""equal or better"".

&gt; If you are making enough money for a stable life, why do you care about how much the other person makes? And if you aren't, why are you explicitly looking for somebody to support your financial needs?

If you make roundaboutly enough to make ends meet, you can't afford to pick a partner you have to ""take care of"", meaning you have to find a partner who is on equal financial footing - or better.

--------------------------------

7elevenses @ 2021-12-27 14:12:43 :

Should men also look only for ""equal or better"", or should they demean themselves and settle for ""worse""?

This feels more like investment advice than relationship advice.

--------------------------------

VikingFjorden @ 2021-12-27 14:19:30 :

If a man cannot afford to take care of somebody else, the man should obviously look for equal or better - because otherwise, what is going to be the result? 

If you can afford to do whatever you please because you have more money than you know what to do with, obviously the financial situation of your partner doesn't matter on a literal level so do whatever you damn well please.

If you think two generalized sentences on reddit constitutes relationship advice for literally 100% every person on the planet, I don't know what to tell you. Either you are being deliberately obtuse or you are just ignorant to the realities of life for the vast majority of people. The ""love is all that matters"" idea is a romantic utopia, and for people in the middle class and downwards, finances is one of the most significant factors of life and cohabitation.

--------------------------------

7elevenses @ 2021-12-27 14:24:32 :

But if men should look for ""equal and better"" and women should look for ""equal and better"", then the only matching combination is ""both equal"", and everybody who can't find somebody equal tha tthey fancy will be left alone.

Look, I get it that people need to plan their lives, including financial security. I get it that financial security can be a good indicator of other positive characteristics, though it's far from perfect.

But ""look only for people who have no less money than you"" is not sound relationship advice for anybody.

--------------------------------

VikingFjorden @ 2021-12-27 14:43:46 :

This is what I mean by being obtuse. 

If you make 50k and you meet somebody who makes 49k, that's obviously not a situation where you go ""sorry, your financial situation is not equal to mine, bye"".

I'm also obviously not saying to pick a partner solely based on finances, nor that good finances guarantees that somebody is a good person or a good fit for you.

7elevenses @ 2021-12-27 14:52:01 :

&gt;There's no situation where you go ""sorry, your financial situation is not equal to mine, bye"" is the point.

If you live in a reasonable area and you still make only enough money to make rent every month, how is finances not going to matter? If your potential partner has no money, what reasonable way are you going to make the cohabitation work? 

Saying ""money doesn't matter"" is a luxury, which is what I meant when I said earlier that ""love is all that matters"" is a romantic utopia for most people.

&gt;But all of that is moot, anyway: It is not the transmission of the virus we care about, it is the consequences of the infection caused. No one (well maybe some scientists) would care about a virus that infected every human on the planet but wouldn't do any damage. Transmissions are merely a proxy for the thing we actually want to reduce, and a big such thing is deaths.

I agree. The death stats that are relevant to future policy are those of people who survived covid and those who were vaccinated. Because together those groups make up the vast majority. And the collective immunity of those two groups is roughly equal (when factors like age are controlled for)

That's why I linked the study showing that the rates were very similar, and also very low for both groups .

Here's [another example of such a study](https://ncrc.jhsph.edu/research/comparing-sars-cov-2-natural-immunity-to-vaccine-induced-immunity-reinfections-versus-breakthrough-infections/)

&gt;Overall, infections were very rare in all of the groups studied, and only 1.5% or less of study participants were infected in any of the analysis groups, regardless of how immunity was derived; there were no deaths in any group.

.

&gt;[Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination) (great site, would recommend for data exploration!) has a nice page showing graphs of death rates among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and what do we find? The thing pretty much everyone expects: Vaccinated people have a much lower risk of dying from covid. 

If you followed the link to the actual interactive data, you would see that the numbers of deaths per 100,000 people is tiny. If you exclude the 80+ age range it's less than 20 deaths per 100k. Not exactly the end of the world.

&gt;So, after all of this, what is the gist? You hold the view that NPIs don't work, I think they do. You hold the view that vaccines don't work, I think they do. 

Once again,  I never said that vaccines don't work. I’ve never said anything about NPIs at all. Stop arguing with yourself and actually read what I have said. I'll summarize it again if you want. You could just scrub through my comment history, there is plenty more there.

&gt;Extraordinary claims such as ""a reduction of social contacts does not inhibit spread of a highly contagious virus which is airborne"" require extraordinary evidence, 

Good thing I didn't make that claim. How about you just address the things I actually said, and not what you imagined I said.

&gt;and so far the evidence you showed me is, let me say it once more, hot garbage. 

In what way? If it's garbage, falsify it... What details are false? 

&gt;And I'll go a step further: I think you're also not genuinely interested in actually finding the right answers here. You're already set on those, so you go ahead and just link every shoddy study you can find that gives you a piece to quote in your posts, and I reckon that you don't even try to evaluate their quality. 

This is a personal attack, and an unfounded accusation of bad-faith. Which goes against the rules of this sub. I could be petty like you were, and report your comment to to the mods to silence you, but censorship doesn't change your view. Shall this become the battle of tattle-tales or would you like to actually support your argument? 

&gt;My evidence for this is two-fold: (a) you never speak about study quality at all, (b) every study you linked so far has been, at best, severely limited by its methodology.

Another group, nearly twice as many died from cancer than from Covid.

Yet another group, stroke and diabetes combined accounted for deaths equal to roughly 75% the count of Covid deaths.

**At this point in time, if the vast majority of Covid deaths are unvaccinated people, then let it be the choice of the individual.** If your choice is to vaccinate, and you are protected then let the unvaccinated carry the burden of their choice.

If your primary or fallback defense is that we need to protect the community and not just the self, or that unvaccinated people are being ""selfish"" by tying up medical resources, then please re-read the above statistics and answer these questions...

\-Where is the illegalization of artificial food products that have been banned in other developed countries?  
\-Where is the subsidization of healthy foods?  
\-Where is the social stigma around junk foods?  
\-Where is the mandate that any company with over 100 employees require their overweight employees to exercise (excluding those who have weight gain for medical reasons)

If you are for shaming unvaccinated individuals, while 4.5 times as many people die annually, year after year, from reducible causes that go unaddressed, then I ask you to turn to your loved ones who suffer from heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and any other ailment correlated to high sugar diets, artificial / processed food products, and unhealthy lifestyles. I ask you to consider shaming them for not living healthier lives and passing on better habits to the next generation (affecting others besides themselves). I ask you to consider shaming them for tying up our medical resources - especially during this pandemic when we could have used more beds for Covid patients.

I, for one, do not support shaming anyone for their decisions. I don't support forcing them to do what they don't want in order to ""unburden resources"". And let the above facts demonstrate that we never once care to ""protect the community"" until politicians with an agenda socially engineer us to do otherwise. There is an opportunity to save far more people each year than just those affected by Covid, all by utilizing healthier and and more ethical approaches. But we won't ...

The missing detail is that it's not about long-term use of medical resources and the associated expense/lost productivity/whatever.  That's not the point here.

It's about huge surges that completely fill up hospital capacity, which results in other people dying because there are no ICU beds available.

The other examples you list don't have surges.  You're never going to find yourself unable to get treated for a bad car accident because the whole hospital is full of cancer patients.  That is a thing that happens with COVID patients and it causes other people to die of completely unrelated, totally treatable things.

[This man](https://www.digitaljournal.com/life/man-turned-away-from-43-hospitals-dies-because-no-icu-beds-were-available-due-to-covid-surge/article) died of a heart attack because 43 hospitals had no ICU beds.  He died because unvaccinated people (being much more likely to be hospitalized) filled up every bed.  (Or, at least, he *might* have survived had that not been the case.)

[This veteran](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-covid-veteran-dies-gallstone-covid-crowding-houston-texas-20210827-g4nl2q6ihbgdhkf3cu2yj3x2ly-story.html) died of *gallstones*--gallstones!--because there were no ICU beds available.

It's not about the use of medical resources, per se.  It's that these people, who choose to gamble with their own lives, are also gambling with the lives of the car accident victims, the stroke patients, the Purple Heart-recipient veterans with gallstones.  Because when they start dropping like flies of their own free will in a big surge, we treat them anyway, even though they voluntarily took that risk, and then we don't have the capacity to treat anyone else.

Because this is more about compliance than COVID.

Any sources on this? As per [this](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/), the 10 states with the highest rates of covid deaths are, in order (as of Dec 16):

* Mississippi (348/100k)

* Alabama (333/100k)

* New Jersey (322/100k)

* Louisiana (321/100k)

* Arizona (320/100k)

* Oklahoma (307/100k)

* New York (300/100k)

* Arkansas (295/100k)

* Georgia (295/100k)

* Florida (289/100k)

California in particular sits much lower at 191/100k. 

Of course, there are a lot of differences between states -- like average age -- that will distort the picture. However, another thing not shown in this is the temporal component: Many of the deaths in NY occured in the first wave when covid was still pretty unknown (see the case fatality rate) while deaths in e.g. Louisiana are spread much more evenly across multiple waves in the last 2 years. 

Please take your propaganda somewhere else.

eggo @ 2021-12-28 15:02:41 :

So wouldn't we expect that list to be correlated pretty closely with [the rate of vaccination in each states](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker)?

But in fact, a [direct comparison study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/) of these data points has said.

&gt;For instance, the narrative related to the ongoing surge of new cases in the United States (US) is argued to be driven by areas with low vaccination rates [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/#CR1)]. A similar narrative also has been observed in countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/#CR2)]. At the same time, Israel that was hailed for its swift and high rates of vaccination has also seen a substantial resurgence in COVID-19 cases

.

&gt;At the country-level, **there appears to be no discernable relationship** between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases  

Or maybe it would be correlated with how locked down the states were... but that doesn't seem to be true either.

I haven't found a similar one for the states,  but a study of the effectiveness of lockdowns in Europe: 

[The data doesn't seem to indicate that lockdowns had much effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879021/)

&gt;[Fig. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879021/figure/f0005/?report=objectonly) and [Table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879021/table/t0005/?report=objectonly) reveal that **countries with a shorter duration of lockdown have a lower average value of confirmed cases**/population (%) but a higher average variation of confirmed cases/population (%) than countries with a longer period of lockdown form April to August 2020 (period indicating the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic).

Who's spreading propaganda,  now?

--------------------------------

Watercrystal @ 2021-12-29 02:26:37 :

Still you, sorry to report. 

The lockdown study is hot garbage, and if you want to argue against lockdowns (whatever that even means, just one of the problems of that study) this is not the way to do so. Have you read their methodology? The compiled a bunch of statistics from 2 groups of countries they think are similar (another problem) and then tried to read into that. I'll focus on the covid case numbers because that is what you highlighted and seem to care about here. Do you think that lockdowns, or better put, NPIs had no effect? This study doesn't say this, like at all. The findings of it are perfectly consistent with the model of ""countries had a lot of cases, then enacted NPIs that worked to stop the spread and kept them around for as long as needed"", which is also pretty logical. Occam's razor and such. If you want a pretty good read on it all, I recommend this [ACX post](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/lockdown-effectiveness-much-more) which goes into way more depth than any reddit comment I could ever leave you with. As for reducing the spread of covid, the conclusion is

&gt; Various policies lumped together as “lockdowns” probably significantly decreased R. Full-blown stay-at home orders were less important than targeted policies like school closures and banning large gatherings.

You bringing up vaccines in a discussion about policy is pretty interesting, and might I add, pretty revealing. Anyway, let's look at that article!

*First red flag: There are many, many factors other than vaccines explaining covid case numbers, and they account for none of them, apparently. No consideration for NPIs, no consideration for differences in data quality, no consideration for immunity acquired by infection, no nothing. None of these caveats are even mentioned or discussed _at all_.

*Second red flag: There seems to be erroneous data in there. They say that the top 5 US counties had vaccination rates between 99.9% and 84.3% by Sep 3rd 2021. At this point, no vaccine was FDA approved for children aged &lt;12 (the first one was Biontech/Pfizer on Oct 29). According to the latest US census data available, about 12% of people in the US were aged &lt;10. So a county that was 99.9% fully vaccinated at the time of the study basically had to have no children at all! That seems very suspicious to me, and authors should have _definitely_ seen that something is going wrong rather than specifically pointing to it as a case in point.

*Third red flag: The authors fail to give crucial context. One example:

&gt; Even though vaccinations offers protection to individuals against severe hospitalization and death, the CDC reported an increase from 0.01 to 9% and 0 to 15.1% (between January to May 2021) in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths, respectively, amongst the fully vaccinated

Guess what also increase in that time, from basically zero in January to ~33% (completed by May 1) by May? Vaccinations. So this observation is completely to be expected, they frame it as some kind of vaccine failure which it is not. 

What do you think about the credibility of this article? I'd say: hot garbage. 

I again want to offer you a better alternative. Someone did a similar direct comparison for German states about a month ago, and this has several advantages despite some of the earlier mentioned problems still present: NPIs are much more comparable (and in particular, the usage of NPIs generally scaled to the number of cases), data quality is pretty close too. Aggregation to state levels smooth out very local effects and small problems with the data. The result is [this](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/26164.jpeg), taken from [this article](https://de.statista.com/infografik/26164/quote-der-vollstaendig-geimpften-und-7-tage-inzidenz-nach-bundeslaendern/) (unfortunately only available in German). On the y-axis you have no of confirmed cases per 100k in the last 7 days, on the x-axis you have rate of vaccination in %. That is a very strong negative correlation if I do say so myself.

But all of that is moot, anyway: It is not the transmission of the virus we care about, it is the consequences of the infection caused. No one (well maybe some scientists) would care about a virus that infected every human on the planet but wouldn't do any damage. Transmissions are merely a proxy for the thing we actually want to reduce, and a big such thing is deaths. [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination) (great site, would recommend for data exploration!) has a nice page showing graphs of death rates among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and what do we find? The thing pretty much everyone expects: Vaccinated people have a much lower risk of dying from covid. 

----

So, after all of this, what is the gist? You hold the view that NPIs don't work, I think they do. You hold the view that vaccines don't work, I think they do. And not only me, but basically all medical professionals and epidemiologists. Extraordinary claims such as ""a reduction of social contacts does not inhibit spread of a highly contagious virus which is airborne"" require extraordinary evidence, and so far the evidence you showed me is, let me say it once more, hot garbage. 

And I'll go a step further: I think you're also not genuinely interested in actually finding the right answers here. You're already set on those, so you go ahead and just link every shoddy study you can find that gives you a piece to quote in your posts, and I reckon that you don't even try to evaluate their quality. My evidence for this is two-fold: (a) you never speak about study quality at all, (b) every study you linked so far has been, at best, severely limited by its methodology."	"Watercrystal @ 2021-12-29 04:53:05 :

&gt; If you followed the link to the actual interactive data, you would see that the numbers of deaths per 100,000 people is tiny.

Depends on your worldview I guess.

As for your claims of strawmanning: Surely I have assumed some of your positions, but not out of thin air. I have read a few posts of yours in this thread, and found that they mostly consist of quoting a bunch of studies with highlights without you actually stating an opinion directly. This leaves me to infer: What do you want to tell people by quoting these studies, and not other ones? Why no contrasting? I think it is fair to assume that someone saying

&gt; Compare the covid policies and associated mortality rates of those states if you want your mind blown. I suspect that you will ignore this information though. 

implies that they think there is some seemingly strange thing going on with policies (i.e. NPIs) and mortality rates. Then you highlight another study that is supposed to show that lockdowns didn't work. Surely I must be missing a big thing here if you didn't say anything about NPIs at all. As for the vaccine thing: We discussed covid mortality vs. policies, and then _you_ say

&gt; So wouldn't we expect that list to be correlated pretty closely with the rate of vaccination in each states?

I'm not sure why you would bring up that study in this context, and again you didn't explain (or at least I didn't understand?). I assume that people bring up things if they want to make a point, and the sentence you're highlighting is that ""there appears to be no discernable relationship [between vaccination rate and no of new covid cases]"". I think it's fair to assume in this case. But if you want to change course and actually explain what you meant to say, go ahead. Anything that makes discussion more productive I'm for.

Next up:
&gt; In what way? If it's garbage, falsify it... What details are false? 

I don't understand. I wrote a pretty in-depth rebuttal of the vaccine study and explained why the lockdown study is really bad, and not good evidence for anything, really. You ignore that and ask me to do it again? Unfortunately, that has been a trend with you: I spend a good amount of effort taking apart the studies you quote and the claims you make, and you fail to acknowledge that. This alone, to me, justifies an accusation of bad faith, and I see no reason to continue investing this effort when you don't reciprocate. I have also clearly explained why I think you're arguing in bad faith. If the mods see that as hostility, they're free to remove my posts or take any action they find appropriate. 

I reported one of your comments for misinformation, because that it what it was. You made a claim that was just plain wrong, and while this can happen to the best, this was pretty egregious as proof of the contrary was obtainable with an absolute minimum amount of research.

Sorry, that's not what I meant. I'll concede that lockdown study I linked is not very robust scientifically. I'm  not basing my view on it,, but rather using it to illustrate my thinking.. If you have another better constructed one that's better, I'll read it. 

I do think it provides a counterpoint to the idea that we can legislate our way our of this. I personally think the effectiveness (or lack thereof) is secondary to the ethical unsupportability. I wasn't speaking of NPIs in general, just government imposed lockdowns. Obviously separation from other people slows the spread of a virus. That's not the only important thing to measure, however. Full body condoms and motorcycle helmets prevent all viral and bacterial infections, and reduce the chance of concussions. I could give you statistics about the dangers of head injury and ebola all day long but (I hope) you wouldn't seek to mandate that every person wear a full body condom with helmet to go outside their house.

And for some reason the same groups that are pro-lockdowns and vaccine passports are often, for some reason, against border restrictions and fine with illegal immigration. 

[Nature: Ranking the effectiveness of worldwide COVID-19 government interventions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0)

&gt;Taken together, the social distancing and movement-restriction measures discussed above can therefore be seen as the ‘nuclear option’ of NPIs: **highly effective but causing substantial collateral damages to society, the economy, trade and human rights[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR4),[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR39).**

&gt;We find strong support for the effectiveness of border restrictions. The role of travelling in the global spread of respiratory diseases proved central during the first SARS epidemic (2002–2003)[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR42), but travelling restrictions show a large impact on trade, economy and the humanitarian response system globally[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR41),[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR43). The effectiveness of social distancing and travel restrictions is also in line with results from other studies that used different statistical approaches, epidemiological metrics, geographic coverage and NPI classification[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR2),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR8),[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR10),[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR11),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR13),[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR19),[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0#ref-CR20).

&gt;We also find a number of highly effective NPIs that can be considered less costly. For instance, we find that risk-communication strategies feature prominently amongst consensus NPIs. This includes government actions intended to educate and actively communicate with the public. The effective messages include encouraging people to stay at home, promoting social distancing and workplace safety measures, encouraging the self-initiated isolation of people with symptoms, travel warnings and information campaigns (mostly via social media). **All these measures are non-binding government advice, contrasting with the mandatory border restriction and social distancing measures that are often enforced by police or army interventions and sanctions.**

So, I think it's clear according to this; Texas has the right approach, while California is hurting itself more than helping with its authoritarian practices, fines and open borders.

--------------------------------

Watercrystal @ 2021-12-29 15:45:23 :

To illustrate your thinking? Why would you cite a study (I don't even want to call it a study) for that rather than just explain it? I have provided you with information on NPI effectiveness already, and the point of contention was whether they work in the context of inhibiting the spread of the coronavirus, and they do. Of course they do come at a price, and whether that price is one worth paying is another question entirely. So far, your entire line of reasoning had been based on alluding that they don't work, which is why I told you that ""if you want to argue against lockdowns [...] this is not the way to do so"". If you think that 

&gt;  I personally think the effectiveness (or lack thereof) is secondary to the ethical unsupportability.

then say that outright. That is a perfectly reasonable position to hold, and by trying to insinuate that they don't work (still doing in your post here!) you only significantly weaken your position to a point where you have to argue using super bad studies. Motte and bailey.

Anyway, all NPIs (and this includes lockdowns) are trade-offs between public health (in the form of covid cases/deaths/whatever) and other fundamental goods of our societies. One can analyze these trade-offs and doing so mostly yields that it's _really complicated_ (see the ACX post I mentioned earlier) and leads to many hard moralistic questions. Everyone answered them differently in some way, and that's the way things like this always work. 

Just to be clear though: The statement

&gt; Texas has the right approach, while California is hurting itself more than helping with its authoritarian practices, fines and open borders.

is definitely not supported by the study you quote. It doesn't conclude that ""non-binding advice"" is better than legal restrictions, it says that there are some effective NPIs based on ""non-binding advice"". In fact, the entire point of the study is to assess the effectiveness of various NPIs for inhibiting the spread of covid and _nothing else_. The trade-offs mentioned earlier are not assessed, it is merely mentioned that they exist.

No, you are strawmanning again. I didn't say lockdowns didn't work;  I compared them to full-body condoms. That is nearly 100% effective, you wear one if you want, but I'll just take my chances. I think it's silly to turn society upside down over a flu-like lillness that most people beat in a couple days. I feel like all this covid paranoia is creating a  generation of germaphobes. Well guess what? Not all of us are scared anymore.

No it's supported by Texas having fewer deaths per capita and a booming economy, while California is at an all time economic low. There are other factors associated there of course, but their covid responses are pretty closely related to their other economically disastrous policies. 

&gt;It doesn't conclude that ""non-binding advice"" is better than legal restrictions, 

It does though:

&gt;**Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less disruptive and costly NPIs can be as effective as more intrusive, drastic, ones (for example, a national lockdown).** Using country-specific ‘what-if’ scenarios, we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of their adoption, **opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions.**

&gt; Because unpopular opinions get reported by authoritarians as ""misinformation"" around here if they aren't backed up with evidence. Mostly by people who don't understand science. 

I reported one of your posts which said that there was no scientific evidence for booster shots, and you even admitted you were wrong on it. There was easily obtainable evidence for safety and efficacy. Saying there is no scientific evidence was just plain wrong, so your statement was, in fact, misinformation.

&gt; That's what I did.

After I asked you to do so, yes. Before that you did not clearly state what you actually believe in a clear way in any of the posts I replied to.

&gt; No, you are strawmanning again. I didn't say lockdowns didn't work; I compared them to full-body condoms. That is nearly 100% effective, you wear one if you want, but I'll just take my chances. 

The post which started this all said ""Compare the covid policies and associated mortality rates of those states if you want your mind blown"", and that is what I was referring to. When I asked you to expand on this, you did not say ""lockdowns work but I have other concerns with them"" but linked a study apparently concluding they didn't work as it concluded that countries with shorter lockdowns had fewer cases. You also said 

&gt; Or maybe it would be correlated with how locked down the states were... but that doesn't seem to be true either. I haven't found a similar one for the states, but a study of the effectiveness of lockdowns in Europe: The data doesn't seem to indicate that lockdowns had much effect

So, to summarize, you said that the comparison between covid policies and mortality rate is mind-blowing (i.e. differing from the expected outcome that stronger measures are associated with fewer covid deaths), then posted a study and said the above. I conclude that it's was at this point very reasonable for me to assume that you were arguing that lockdowns don't work. Later you came out and said that you think lockdowns work but that you don't like them for other reasons, which, as I have said, is a perfectly okay position to have. But your initial posts are what they are.

&gt; No it's supported by Texas having fewer deaths per capita and a booming economy, while California is at an all time economic low. There are other factors associated there of course, but their covid responses are pretty closely related to their other economically disastrous policies. 

This is false: Texas has significantly more covid deaths per capita than California. Google's data says that both of them have about 76k deaths (CA a little more, TX a little less), but CA has ~10 million more inhabitants (CA 39.2 million, TX 29.5 million as per the census estimate). This is consistent with the stats on the page in my initial post which showed a death rate of 191/100k for CA and 258/100k for TX. 

As for their economies: What does ""Texas having [...] a booming economy, while California is at an all time economic low"" mean? Are we looking at the state of the economy overall (CA has significantly higher GDP per capita than TX)? Are we looking at economic growth and if so, in what time frame? I don't really want to have this discussion as I'm not very familiar with economics, but on first investigation your claim seems not at all obvious to me.

&gt; It does though:

Still says that there are different effective NPIs and that we need a suitable combination. It does not say ""do X, not Y"" because it isn't that simple."

One of the issues with these ""rape prevention"" strategies isn't really the assignation of blame, but their lack of utility in prevention of rape.

The majority of rape is not stranger rape-- it isn't being grabbed in the street by a faceless creep. It's by someone you know. Walking in a group is a good strategy for not getting mugged, it's not a good strategy for preventing someone who knows you from assaulting you (it doesn't keep an acquaintance who knows your address away, it doesn't keep your parents away, it doesn't keep teachers or employers away, it doesn't keep the friend of a friend who's got a weird thing for you from cornering you at a party).

People can buy all the alarms and apps they want, at most it might make online dating and hookup apps a  tiny bit safer.

Also, a note: men can be raped, women can be rapists.

RoundSchedule3665 @ 2022-01-12 11:22:43 :

I completely agree with you. I know the vast majority of cases don't come like this however, is specifically regarding those cases. As women still feel very unsafe walking at night it is sort of regarding those cases. Also i understand men can be raped too but when it comes to these violent cases the quantity is so negligible that i just didn't mention it.

LucidMetal @ 2022-01-12 11:54:01 :

If you have a crime that you know happens a certain way 90% of the time and a different way 10% of the time, why are you focusing on ways to reduce the 10% when any reduction would be negligible?

--------------------------------

Morasain @ 2022-01-12 12:22:36 :

You are arguing a different thing.

The things that OP mentioned - rape alarms, walking together alone at night - are specifically to help against violent rape by a stranger. An assumed friend forcing himself on a woman is also rape, but the measures that op mentioned aren't designed against that anyway.

--------------------------------

LucidMetal @ 2022-01-12 12:44:03 :

I'm saying that since that type of rape is rare these measures limit women's autonomy more than prevent rape. The reduction would be negligible.

These measures aren't law. Women are free to not do these things, at a higher risk of violent rape. Even if that type of rape is rare.

But just because my autonomy is restricted because I limit myself to not walk through my neighborhood at night doesn't mean that this is a bad thing. It's a good thing. I'm instead using my autonomy so that I don't get robbed or murdered.

Okay, this will be my last response.

Just because a low number of the overall cases belongs to this group doesn't mean preventing it isn't a good idea. Terrorism accounts for the tiniest fraction of deaths, regardless of where you live - but every country still has some form of counter terrorism in place.

Drunk driving might only be a fraction of the causes for accidents, but we still have serious penalties on it - and no, this is just an example, not a reason for you to say ""but that's a law and you were not talking about laws"", or whatever."

Most cities in the world vote heavily liberal (I don’t know exactly why, maybe that’s a minor hole in my argument) but again, don’t see why this would turn around and if those are the areas with population growth, then you can see how the balance of power between cities and rural areas will increasingly favor Democrats in other states like Texas going forward. 

The second trend is demographic diversification. The largest voting block for republicans (older whites) is dying out, their descendants skew liberal, and even if they weren’t, their share of the US electorate is shrinking as the minority population rises (particularly Hispanics). This trend is further enforced by low fertility rates within the US, while immigration (of which the majority is non-white) is increasingly relied upon for continued population growth. Minority voting blocks have voted pretty consistently liberal in US elections, most notably in California, where the rising Hispanic population turned it from a tilt-red state to a solidly blue one. Demographic shifts have likewise turned other former swing states blue, such as Colorado and Virginia. I am aware that there are some exceptions to this (notably Florida’a Cuban population voting conservative) but I’d counter that even within that edge case the younger Cubans appear to be more liberal as well. Virtually every single minority group votes liberal outside of the aforementioned edge case voted liberal. 

I see no reason why these trends will not continue, and so long as they do, it seems like the republicans are destined to eventually lose Texas as they did California, at which point they will become unviable to win presidencies. Democrats can use this political leverage to increase voting rights and immigration, further increasing their likelihood to win future elections. They will simply cease to have political relevance unless they make major policy changes and basically undergo a realignment."	"DankLeader @ 2022-01-11 20:39:10 :

Conservatism is just about maintaining whatever the previous status quo was, and there will always be a previous status quo to try and maintain, and people who benefitted from that status quo and who will argue their interests must be protected over those of the general population. 

Conservatism is always wrong in the long run of history, wrong about fighting in favor of slavery, wrong for fighting against women's right to vote, wrong for fighting against gay people, and their current tantrum about trans folks will also age poorly, this is the nature of all conservative movements.

As the Republican Party is likely to continue to be the nexus of the conservative political movement they will continue to exist as long as human beings continue to be selfishly self-interested in the beliefs they hold, which doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. A great example that others have provided are the Hispanic populations, more and more they vote conservative, why?

Well, more and more they have been integrated and benefit from the status quo, many of them starting to be considered ""white"" just as other immigrant population that were not considered white and whose presence in the country was opposed by conservative movements in the past such as Italians and the Irish. So we can see that even the bigoted and racist elements of the conservative movement adapt to the new status quo once they become irreversible and then begins to protect that status quo. It might seem odd that immigrants would so quickly turn towards anti-immigration policies for example, but historically that's exactly what every immigrant group in the US has done.

BANGAR4NG @ 2022-01-12 20:31:11 :

I’m sorry but by your elementary definition then progressives must have been the cause of slavery as there was a period of time that didn’t have it.

Conservatives are not against social change. That doesn’t make any sense.

--------------------------------

DankLeader @ 2022-01-12 20:53:34 :

There was a period in world history where slavery was eradicated and then brought back? I'm unfamiliar with this being the case, feel free to show me otherwise. I wouldn't say progressives specifically because that's a different can of worms, but yeah if the status quo was anti-slavery and there was a movement to enslave the people in power conservatism would then have taken the anti-slavery position, this is consistent with what I outlined above.

Edit: In general feel free to provide a definition of conservatism that is applicable to all conservative movements around the world and doesn't match my definition as well, since you clearly don't like mine. I'm always happy to learn about different points of views.

You have to because you already said ""Conservatism is just about maintaining whatever the previous status quo"" and the only paradigm where this exists is where progressivism is contrasting conservatism - which isnt correct.

&gt;Conservatism is always wrong in the long run of history 

You want me to name all of the times conservative policy was correct and liberating? You want me to name all of the times democrats messed up? This is ridiculous."	"BANGAR4NG @ 2022-01-13 21:48:32 :

Then when did you say “conservative=bad”

Conservative, in the US party sense has nothing to do with conserving the status quo. 

How can you look at the current presidency and say that the right has always been on the wrong side of history. You’re understanding of all of these terms is so convoluted and pseudo intelligent.

--------------------------------

DankLeader @ 2022-01-13 22:28:30 :

Conservatism is not a party, the Republican party houses most conservatives but there are conservative Democrats as well. I think in theory conservatism should serve a necessary role in politics by preventing unnecessary and harmful change, however from my perspective we are so behind on what we need to being as a society that yes I believe conservatism in the current context of the world to be harmful.

It is possible in theory to imagine a world in which this is not the case, and where conservatism is necessary. However while I acknowledge that theoretical possibility I believe history shows that in practice human nature does not allow for the idealized version of conservatism to take place, instead what we get are reactionaries. Furthermore, I'd still expect liberals to be more successful at fighting against change in a more responsible manner than conservatives given the history of conservative movements. Are you going to try to argue confederates are actually secret leftists? Come on, stop thinking of political beliefs as teams in your favorite sport.

Yes politics are complicated, but your unwillingness to engage with the historic and present reality of how politics plays out and how complex peoples beliefs are is the issue, just because the world is more complicated than your bubble doesn't make everything ""pseudo intelligent."" You can call names all you want, but you're the one who looks silly by trying to argue that I as an anarchist who isn't even from your country need to defend US progressives from the democratic party as if the end all be all of politics and the world begins and ends at your borders.

The difference here is I have no issues acknowledging the flaws of all these ideologies and perspectives including my own, progressivism in a vacuum is difficult to talk about because it is simply far less coherent because it could be anything, conservatism at least needs to be grounded in existing cultures and history. But even then I have no issues acknowledging progressive stances can and have been harmful in various instances, in fact I've said it comes with the territory. Likewise I can point to how the utopian views of anarchists are a massive hindrance to achieve the goals espoused by its ideals, this is where you and I are different. I've studied these ideologies and I understand and accept their flaws, none of them are perfect. The reason you are upset is because for your worldview to be cohesive you must be able to reduce the world into simple binaries where you are good and I am bad. I reject that, and if you actually bother to look at how people actually engage with their belief systems, including your own you will be forced to admit they are a lot more complicated than that.

Yes I think conservatism is bad, because I think history has been kind of a shitshow, and the world is still kind of a shitshow, so to want to preserve that shitshow is bad. I hope I turn out to be wrong and in a near future we reach such a pinnacle of civilization that conservatives can be its stalwart protectors, but I don't believe there is some perfect society endgame, the world is always changing and so adapting to those changes will always be necessary. If we accept there will always be change and we will always have to adapt to it then conservatism as an ideology will always drag us down as it will stall our ability to adapt. Liberals seem to provide sufficient resistance to change from a center-right perspective to an extent that to me makes conservatism an obsolete political ideology. Again, perhaps I am wrong, I hope I am because I don't think conservatism will ever go away, but just because I think something is bad or unnecessary overall doesn't mean I cannot acknowledge the noble aspirations that lie within in. If we lived in a perfect anarchist society for example, my stances would be conservative within that context, I just don't believe such utopias are possible. I believe the purpose of ideology is to always force us to recognize where as a society we could be doing better, to push ourselves and our species to be the best we can be. I don't believe in some perfect end-goal, but I also don't believe in sticking to the devil we know which is the position conservatism takes.

That doesn't mean I think conservatives are evil people, but yeah I think they've attached their identity to what is historically a political bad take, and I think this tends to happen because it is easier to reaffirm that what you are doing is right instead of acknowledging that the world is infinitely more complicated than we can perceive, and we must always be reflecting and adapting, that something you thought was good behavior yesterday might turn out to be ignorant asshole behavior. I don't mind that, I think recognizing our faults is a necessary part of growth, and this will always put me at odds with conservatism. Sure sometimes we take one step forward and to steps back, but I rather we keep walking than stand still, and this is why me and conservatives will likely never see eye to eye.

You probably won't read all of this but if you do I highly recommend you try stepping outside of the bubble of your nation and of the media spheres you tend to inhabit, I promise you that even if it only reaffirms your beliefs your understanding of them will be greatly enriched by the experience.

Prove that True Gonadal Intersex human beings do not exist."	2	0	stop arguing comment					"As humans we want to find some sort of community that we feel connected too. In the modern world, there is lack of connections and community we fit in as we strive for unity yet we are so divided by our strong sense of want to be individuals.There is a hatred created amongst those who don’t respect follow the same ideals as you. Such as expecting others to call you by your non-binary pronoun. I honestly think this will make you lose your identity even more. Gender is not fluid in my opinion, I do support the transgender community and LGBTQ as a whole (I am bi) but I don’t know why one needs to be called they/them and gets triggered when someone makes a mistake. If you do identify as non-binary, why do you feel the need to be called they/them? genuinely curious. Don’t you get frustrated when someone makes a mistake? Where are some people so forceful? Those with a strong “stance” are not trying to understand other’s thoughts and perspective because our own selfishness as humans want to be a “strong individual” and this makes us only limited to what we want see/hear. We are restricting ourselves to open about whatever topics so we lose the numbers of “communities” we can be in. It’s almost like we have selective mutism, only hearing,seeing what we want to. 

I guess we are divided as a nation to extreme political ideals, or philosophy. 

Which results to in this “modern psychology” the diagnosis that helps then find a community, no matter what gender, political ideals. They want labels because they want to feel connected and these labels will help them feel more untied. We want to feel empathy for them and also except them to for us which further leads to a “connection” created. Don’t people always tell you in this psychiatry “you are not alone”? Yet they expect us to be individuals. I think this makes us so subjective that we can’t see the objective view and understand other perspectives. After all, what humans want is connections, empathy and love in my opinion. Mental health diagnosis can help one heal to understand themselves better through symptoms but I don’t think medication helps and therapy only helps which a suited therapist (which is very hard to find)

EDIT
extra thoughts from my dear childhood friend 

“What you’ve said is spot on, the lack of genuine connections is the most pressing social issue that our generation faces. Access to the internet and social media allows a paradox to form where we are seemingly the most connected generation yet the most lonely generation. 

Identity politics is a plague imo, because people will flock to find as many identities and hide behind them (intersectionality). People will showcase their external identity rather than showcasing their character. “

EDIT
point of this post 
My point is not to minimize people’s need to get diagnosis but rather why some people would want to seek a community through diagnosis

EDIT 
Regarding the non-binary issue, my stance is non-binary rights are not trans rights. If you want to CMV, please use logic rather than emotion.

EDIT
I am going to bed, also please stop making assumption and CMV on what I actually said. Stop assuming I “implied” something what is is not something I said. It is a form of gaslighting. Also, comparing gender and sexuality is not the same. Medication can work for some, but rather finding the therapist for you should be promoted. Focus on the root for the problem and trauma is my opinion.

EDIT 
I am beginning to understand the perspectives of non-binary people more in a spiritual view. After all, spirituality can not really be explained with logics. If you know something is out there? You know. However, not many can grasp the concept of spiritual awakening and I am still not in favor of the pronouns they/them which comes from my own bias of limited experience with non-binary people but I am beginning to accept their community more. Maybe in the future I will be open for they/them pronouns but honestly the comments really forced me to believe more strongly on why I am against in. However, I think moving to a more progressive place like California which  I plan to do to continue my studies will change my perspective rather than staying in a conservative country as Korea. To non-binary people, I apologize for my lack of understanding towards you guys but I am learning and even though my stance won’t change this quickly, I will learn and I hope I can hopefully learn to respect your pronouns. I am only human after all, I am not perfect and can not please everyone. Oh my god I want to sleep 3:22AM rn. Thank you for this opportunity. I plan on taking gender studies class to understand you guys more. I would like to stop the non-binary discussions and move on to how I think diagnosis can build a sense of acceptance and community. Even if you try to CMV on this, I don’t think it can be achieve right now with my limited experiences with actual non-binary people. I will not be replying to non-binary comments anymore.

Further EDIT:
 I was tired, I tried to fight people with logic rather than emotions to check my own bias but I think those who identify as non-binary felt triggered. My whole goal is to help people reach their spiritual awakening but also this is hasty cuz spirituality is hard to understand with logical reasoning. Actually it’s mostly all fallacies but it makes sense to such a “logical”person like myself. On the other hand I am extremely a hypersensitivity person so interesting…"	"iwfan53 @ 2022-01-29 03:44:08 :

Bimodal means that there are two positions that are opposite each other but also many possibilities falling between the two.

So imagine this is bimodal.

Sex is bimodal.

Gender is bimodal.

People who do not fall on either end of the gender spectrum want to be referred to by the correct pronouns, just like most men want to be called ""he"" and most women want to be called ""she"".  That is why some people want to be called ""they"" or some ""neo pronoun"" because they're asking to be shown the same respect we already show all the people who fall on the two ends of the gender bimodal.

Major_Lennox @ 2022-01-29 04:19:53 :

&gt; sex is bimodal

You can't just state that like it's an accepted fact. [Here's an example](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dangerous-denial-of-sex-11581638089) of two biologists disagreeing with it.

Intersex people are roughly as common as redheads.

[https://cadehildreth.com/gender-spectrum/](https://cadehildreth.com/gender-spectrum/)

&gt;Current research estimates that intersex people compose 1.7% of the population, which makes being intersex about as common as having red hair.  


  
So unless you can convince me that roughly one out of every 50 people on Earth doesn't exist... sex isn't binary.

Major_Lennox @ 2022-01-29 04:22:53 :

Yeah they talk about this kind of logic:

&gt; There is a difference, however, between the statements that there are only two sexes (true) and that everyone can be neatly categorized as either male or female (false). The existence of only two sexes does not mean sex is never ambiguous. But intersex individuals are extremely rare, and they are neither a third sex nor proof that sex is a “spectrum” or a “social construct.” Not everyone needs to be discretely assignable to one or the other sex in order for biological sex to be functionally binary. To assume otherwise—to confuse secondary sexual traits with biological sex itself—is a category error.

&gt;TRUE GONADAL INTERSEX

&gt;The person must have both ovarian and testicular tissue. This may be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have 1 ovary and 1 testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. This condition used to be called true hermaphroditism. In most people with true gonadal intersex, the underlying cause is unknown, although in some animal studies it has been linked to exposure to common agricultural pesticides.

Explain how True Gonadal Intersex people can have their sex determined as male or female at birth.

Ok - you deleted your other comment, but I'll answer it anyway.

&gt; What would it take to change your view that sex is binary?

A redefinition of some very fundamental terms that *isn't* driven by political or cultural mores. For example - [Gonochorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonochorism):

&gt; In biology, gonochorism is a sexual system where there are only two sexes and each individual organism is either male or female. The term gonochorism is usually applied in animal species, the vast majority of which are gonochoric.

You would have to convince me that the existence of intersex people is indicative of a third sex.

This is the problem with your argument - when you talk about *gender* being a spectrum, that's ok. It's a cultural thing (albeit stemming from biology, but that's a digression). When you talk about *biological sex* being a spectrum, that's where people will draw a very firm line, because the arguments that work for gender *don't work* with this. The authors of that article talk about a category error, and I think they're *right*. 

What would it take for *you* to change your view on this?"	"Major_Lennox @ 2022-01-29 04:57:45 :

[try this](https://www.nas.org/academic-questions/33/2/in-humans-sex-is-binary-and-immutable):

&gt; All “intersex” conditions, when examined, clearly arise from single-gene mutations or chromosomal aberrations on a genetic background that would have indisputably been producing male or female gametes had these mutations not occurred, and, rarely, due to chimerism (i.e. individuals made up of both male and female cells). True hermaphrodites possessing both sets of functional gonads and genitalia have never been observed in Homo sapiens.

&gt; Therefore the “intersex” argument against the sex binary is simply not valid. Intersex individuals exist only because of continuous de novo reintroduction of the relevant mutations in the population, recessive genes becoming unmasked, or disruptions of normal embryonic development."

I feel like the terms have come to represent such a broad range of things that they have become effectively meaningless in open discussions (in other words, they have specific meaning to specific groups at best - Trotskists have a definition, marxists have a definition, liberal economists have a definition, and so on). 

That being the case,  a lot of saliva and time and effort are spent on trying to define what they ACTUALLY mean, but that discussion seems to be not of a philosophical/inquisitive nature, but more often than not, serve a function to define who's the ingroup and who's the out group. 

Those kinds of very common discussions seem to both polarize debate (edited out ""discussion"" just to not repeat myself) and be a fruit of polarization, and a polarization that doesn't lead to actual societal or political change. 

We're not discussing solutions when we're discussing who are the actual bona fide leftists. While we do that, the world burns. 

I don't think I have a solution to this, but it seems to me like it's time to move on to other terminologies/dynamics.

Maybe you find it simple, but throw that out there and see how much agreeance to terms you'll find. 

My instinctive use of those words doesn't agree with yours by a lot (though they are not completely different). 

Stalinism tends to have high regard for hyerarchy, and is considered by most to be on the left spectrum. Milton Friedman, a self appointed economic liberal, did not think inequality was good in on itself (correct me if I'm wrong, please), but is considered by many to be on the right side of the spectrum.

&gt;Stalinism tends to have high regard to hyerarchy, and is considered by most to be on the left spectrum.

But Stalinism's end goal is a system without hierarchy.  It just requires the hierarchy in order to achieve the transition to proper communism without backsliding into capitalism.

That's not how it ever works out in reality of course, but it doesn't change the fact that in theory it is an approach to government that sees hierarchy as a necessary evil as opposed to Fascism where hierarchy is viewed as a good in and of itself as the people will always need a leader to speak with their collective voice.

&gt;Milton Friedman, a self appointed economic liberal, did not think inequality was good in on itself (correct me if I'm wrong, please), but is considered by many to be on the right side of the spectrum.

Counterpoint

[http://www.mit.edu/\~jrising/webres/justice2.1.pdf](http://www.mit.edu/~jrising/webres/justice2.1.pdf)

&gt;In Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman argues that the distribution of wealth caused by market forces and capitalistic exchanges is **both just and desirable.**

Capitalism distributes wealth in in an non-equal way.  This is Milton Friedman saying that the inequality in the distribution of wealth is just and desirable.

So it seems like you are indeed wrong on Mr. Friedman.

No.  I don't deny that it is possible to have a left wing authoritarian system of government.

&gt;**THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren't only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else.** All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.

There can exist leftwing dictatorships.  Authoritarianism is a viewpoint that you can find both people on the left and people on the right advocating for.

Natural-Arugula @ 2022-01-29 01:08:40 :

Stalin was a dictator that demanded complete subservience to his will, including spying on the population and subjecting dissidents to imprisonment and execution. He was even notoriously anti-Semitic.

There is no difference between him and Franco and Mussolini. Nationalism is Fascism. German Fascism just happened to place greater importance on ethno-nationalism.

What part of that shows equality and rejection of hierarchy?

Harrison Bergeron is a work of fiction that if anything is opposing equality by showing how it is bad. Do you think 1984 is meant to be an endorsement of totalitarianism? It's pretty weird to call that an example of being left wing...

But that does demonstrate the point. In Fascism everyone is ""equal"" in that they are all subordinate to the state- embodied in the will of it's supreme commander.

If you have so called equality but you have an hierarchy than you don't really have equality.

Again, Orwell: ""All pigs are equal, but some pigs are more equal than others.""

Put another way, Left-wing runs from Social Democracy to Libertarian, Right-wing runs from Liberalism to Fascist- including every state which has called itself ""Communist"".

People clearly don't understand this concept if they think North Korea is Leftist.

That's not what makes a person a fascist though.

One of the key aspects of Fascism is saying that the modern day is debased /decadent and that things were better in the past and the leader will bring the people back to what made the past good.

Hitler wanted to restore Germany to its ancient ""Aryan"" past even if that past never existed.

Mussolini called back to the grandeur of the Roman Empire... but Stalin was about moving Russia forward into something new and breaking ties with the past.

When I said ""good"" I meant it in the sense of ""accurate"" not ""something to be aspired to"".

Yes that is what Left Wing authoritarianism under communism looks like.

Right wing fascism makes no attempt to say everyone is equal, blond haired blue eyed Reinhard Heydrich types are better than those who don’t have the ideal Aryan looks…

You say all are equal under fascism…. but how do you explain Jews having fewer right than non-Jews as codified by law?

Clearly some Germans had more rights than others under Fascism.

I guess if you want to define Fascist according to it's aesthetics. I don't really care about the fine distinction between what two genocidal dictators claim thier motivations are. The way thier political system actually operates is what matters to me.

Leftism wants to disseminate power, while right wants to concentrate it. That is the meaningful distinction.

You don't have to call Stalin a Fascist but I think it's futile saying that Leftism is wanting equality and getting rid of hierarchy, and that Stalin was therefore a Leftist because he said that he wanted that while doing the exact opposite.

Here's a super long post someone else did that says it better than I could...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/nqvjy9/cmv\_there\_isnt\_arent\_consistent\_values\_between/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/nqvjy9/cmv_there_isnt_arent_consistent_values_between/)

&gt;Nazism is considered a far-right ideology because the sole division of left and right is not academically considered to be matters of things such as ""big government vs. small government"", ""privatization in the economy vs. nationalization in the economy"", and ""change vs. conservation"" contrary to popular belief. These are all considered some popular perceptions of what divides the left and right on the political spectrum, but this isn't what is genuinely accepted as the primary difference between left-wing politics and right-wing politics. Before I get into what is generally considered the main division between left and right in politics, I'd like to get into why the interpretations of what the political spectrum measures are flawed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Size of Government (Big Government Left vs. Small Government Right)**  
&gt;  
&gt;This is flawed because right-wing does not inherently mean favoring small government, and left-wing does not inherently mean favoring big government. Not even close. The truth is, if this were true, Republicans and Augusto Pinochet would be considered leftists, but no reasonable person would assume that. Republicans like to claim they support ""small government"" because they like low taxes and gun rights, but here are a few things to acknowledge. There are cases where republicans are for bigger government and the left is against these ""bigger government"" solutions such as military spending, regulating abortion rights, and all the rest. Second of all, if you're judging this from an economic angle, meaning that ""Low taxes and laissez-faire capitalism makes one supportive of 'small government'."", then you must either agree that Pinochet, the totalitarian dictator who would kill his opposition simply due to disagreement, is a leftist of some sort (false) or the idea that supporting laissez-faire economics does not inherently make you pro-""small government"" (true). Anarchism, a far-left ideology, favors no state. Fascism, a far-right ideology, favors a very robust state.  
&gt;  
&gt;**State Intervention In The Economy (Left Favoring State Intervention vs. Right Being Against State Intervention)**  
&gt;  
&gt;This is flawed because a right-winger can actually prefer a regulative, state-controlled economy if pursuing right-wing interests. If a right-wing government (like Adolf Hitler's Nazi party) were to support excessive nationalization for solely right-wing purposes, like gathering more authority to put the power into a specific group of people rather than nationalizing to combat wealth inequality, then they are supporting what is generally seen as a left-wing practice, but not for leftist purposes. This also has no clue where to put anarchism on the political spectrum. Anarchism favors no state intervention in the economy because it doesn't have one! Yet, it is widely regarded as a far-left ideology because of its direct anti-hierarchical and egalitarian nature. The political compass test uses this definition to divide left-wing and right-wing, but they essentially just ripped this idea off of the Nolan Chart. It is considered highly unacademic to believe that left-wing means you like a planned economy and right-wing means you favor a free-market economy. This definition leads to confusion because a principled market SOCIALIST could get a ""centrist"" result on the political compass test because it has trouble conceptualizing support for markets yet disagreement with capitalism. A laissez-faire free market capitalist economy is just one way that the right could maintain and promote hierarchies, but it's not the only way.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Change vs. Conversation (Left For Change vs. Right For Conservation)**  
&gt;  
&gt;This one will be a quicky. This is not a true dichotomy for left vs. right because it is entirely possible for the left to be for conservation and the right to be for change. An example of this is if the left wants to conserve workers rights, the environment, or protection against discrimination for certain oppressed groups, and the right could want to change the way those aspects of society function. Easy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So what actually is, academically speaking, regarded as the most genuine divide of a left-wing ideology and a right-wing ideology?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I already hinted at it in the section, ""State Intervention In The Economy (Left Favoring State Intervention vs. Right Being Against State Intervention)"". That would be attitude on equality. It is generally regarded that if you have a mindset that equality is favorable and should be worked towards, you are left-wing. If you believe that inequality, hierarchy, and social orders are natural, normal, inevitable, or even desirable, then you are right-wing. This is primarily defining factor that separates right from left in politics. Nazis were no fans of equality, not even Strasserists. All the variations of right-wing ideology out there believe in upholding some form of inequality or hierarchy in some sort, and this is what Nazism has in common with them. Policy doesn't necessarily define whether something is left-wing or right-wing. The reason why the far-right could favor what is generally regarded as a left-wing policy like nationalization of business is that they could favor these for reasons linked to wanting to reinforce inequality. THIS is why Nazis are considered far-right, despite being different than a lot of mainstream rightist ideologies. It may be third-positionist and sometimes not entirely traditional or in favor of conservation, but what it has in common with every other right-wing position under the sun is that it believes inequality/hierarchy/social order is natural, normal, inevitable, or even desirable, which in this case, seeing it as a desirable trait is very applicable for Nazism.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Closing Words:**  
&gt;  
&gt;A lot of right-wingers dislike this kind of dichotomy, but it is not a Marxist plot to make the right look ""evil"". It is merely the take that's given that could actually hold any strong basis for separating left from right. If you define it by the other ways mentioned, there are numerous flaws. For example, the ""big government vs. small government"" definition would place both Stalin and Pinochet on the far-left. The ""favoring state intervention in the economy vs. being against state intervention in the economy"" definition would place both market socialists and third-positionist fascists in the center. The ""change vs. conservation"" definition could mean communists could be right-wing in a world where communism is the status quo. The bottom line is, despite any disagreements that a Nazi would have with your mainstream U.S. Republican or libertarian, they would agree that inequality, in some way, is better for society than equality, whether they realize it or not.

I think your system fails to separate the Anarchists from the AnCaps, and my system about hierarchy does not.

TLDR: What people are doing does not matter as much as why they are doing it.

--------------------------------

Natural-Arugula @ 2022-01-30 00:02:37 :

Was that quote supposed to be disagreeing with me or do you disagree with that? That is pretty much exactly what I think. 

Here's a few choice quotes:

""Pinochet, the totalitarian dictator who would kill his opposition simply due to disagreement, is a leftist of some sort (false)""

That's exactly what I said about Stalin.

""For example, the ""big government vs. small government"" definition would place both Stalin and Pinochet on the far-left.""

The ""example"" is the one they are explicitly rejecting, thus by their reasoning and mine, Stalin is not in the far left, he is on the right.

""Anarchism, a far-left ideology, favors no state. Fascism, a far-right ideology, favors a very robust state.""

Again, exactly what I said.

""Anarcho Capitalists"" are not Anarchists because they believe in hierarchy and inequality. Thier actual system is pretty much just Feudalism, placing them closer to the far right.

That's the perfect example of it mattering what they do and not why they are doing it.

&gt;  
&gt;The ""example"" is the one they are explicitly rejecting, thus by their reasoning and mine, Stalin is not in the far left, he is on the right.

They are rejecting the idea that both are on the same side, instead they are arguing that one is one the left and one is on the right.

You are completely failing to understand what they're arguing.

Stalin is on the left because his philosophy does not argue that hierarchy  is a good unto itself as opposed to Hitler/Pinochet.

&gt;""Anarcho Capitalists"" are not Anarchists **because they believe in hierarchy and inequality.** Thier actual system is pretty much just Feudalism, placing them closer to the far right.

What happened to concentrate and disseminate power?

All of a sudden you're talking about hierarchy and inequality just like I do!

Also I think you're using ""concentrate and disseminate power"" in such loosey goosey terms as to be meaningless.

**Was the Confederacy Left Wing because it wanted to disseminate power away from the federal government, or Right Wing because it wanted to concentrate power in the hands of the slave holders?**

  
Power is a zero sum game to some degree, and thus any system that isn't giving all power to one single source (complete and total authoritarianism) can be argued to be concentrating or disseminating it.

**Under your system The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a Right Wing action because it concentrated power in the Federal Government to prohibit and punish certain racist actions.**

Natural-Arugula @ 2022-01-30 00:15:56 :

""Was it a rightwing action when the United States created the EPA thus concentrating power in the government to set standards for pollution?""

I'm not sure what you are asking me here.

I don't think that putting in place environmental protections is on its own right-wing or left-wing.

If it was decided democratically it would be left wing, if it was decided by Hitler it would be right wing.

The EPA was established by the president as an executive action, that would make it rightwing, but only because executive action is right wing, not because environmental protection is.

As for Market Socialism, I don't really know to place it because I don't understand what it is.

I will answer your questions, but can you tell me how you can say that left-wing is anti hierarchical and at the same time say that having a dictatorship can be left-wing?

Those are contradictions. 

Ok, so the CSA did not want to disseminate federal power. The ability to decide on slavery was not a power of the federal government until after the Civil War. Prior to the war the federal government explicitly upheld the states right to choose slavery, and the South just didn't like it that states which chose not to have it outnumbered them.

Either way, the ability of states to make decisions is less concentrated power than the ability to own human beings as property. Other than maybe genocide, slavery is the most right-wing thing that there is.

Now I know you're trying to get me to draw a dichotomy here. You're going to ask, so does that make Czar Alexander II freeing the serfs Left-wing?

I guess technically that one action is, but it's kind of pointless. That didn't make the Russian Empire Not Right-wing. It's like ""equality"" under Fascism- you could say that it's just a generalized slavery for everyone instead of a specific one. The people are slaves to the emperor who still has absolute power over them.

Ok, so the Civil rights act. That's a toss up. You could say that it was Rightwing because it was a Liberal policy- it enshrined equality as a power of the government and not as individual autonomy. But it's like the least possible Rightwing thing.

You could argue that it was Social Democratic and therefore just barely nudges over into being Left-wing. On that moderate line it's blurry and individual policy holds more sway than at the boundaries.

&gt;I will answer your questions, but can you tell me how you can say that left-wing is anti hierarchical and at the same time say that having a dictatorship can be left-wing?

Because the people believe that the dictatorship is necessary in the short term to establish a non-hierarchy system in the long term.

Look at the famous history of Cincinnatus

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius\_Quinctius\_Cincinnatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus)

&amp;#x200B;

He was a guy who stepped in was a Dictator to deal with a problem that could not be solved by the system as it currently stood... then once the problem was solved stepped down and relinquished power (indeed he was dictator of Rome for **15 days**).

People like Cincinnatus are super, duper, f\*\*king rare, and it is foolish to believe that you'll be lucky enough to find one, but that's the idea in theory.  We have a dictator for now so that we can establish a system without needing dictators, because if we didn't have one we'd backslide.

That's the ethos behind Stalinism as I understand, that people can't successfully shift out of Capitalism without needing a strong hand on the reins overseeing the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ok, so the Civil rights act. That's a toss up. You could say that it was Rightwing because it was a Liberal policy-

You could say it was rightwing because it was liberal?

Now I'm gonna need you to define what ""Liberal"" means to you.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Other than maybe genocide, slavery is the most right-wing thing that there is.  
  


I also challenge this.  


If a group of slaves belonging to race X rise up an murder all the slave owners who belong to race Y who are oppressing them, is this not a left wing genocide?

--------------------------------

Natural-Arugula @ 2022-01-30 01:48:19 :

Ok. I see what you mean. That makes sense.

I said that Liberalism is on the Right. Liberalism believes that authority is vested in legitimate institutions and not outside of it. That it is the power of the state to ensure equality and liberty, generally under the principle that the economy should operate under the free market.

As a system that doesn't empower the autonomous individual as well as supporting capitalism which is dictatorial and unequal, it is right wing.

As I said, I somewhat arbitrarily split the difference between the two and call social democracy Left. It's basically liberalism with less capitalism.

If you wanted to be more restrictive I think it would be fine to call democratic socialism the minimum for Leftism.

I don't think that a slave revolt is genocide unless you mean like killing every single slave owner?

Anyway, it's more about a general government tendency. I don't know why you keep reducing it to individual actions. I don't think it is very useful to look at that way."	"Natural-Arugula @ 2022-01-30 02:46:10 :

You could point out that under my system effectively all political parties would be right wing, but of course I wouldn't have a problem with that.

But it does pose a problem for say a democratic socialist to support a view that more or less concedes the impossibility of their system working.

As for the right wing, I do tend to believe that it is immoral, but I haven't made a moral argument and you could make one for the Right.

If you had the Platonic view of the ""Philosopher King"", or as you said Cincinnatus. The benevolent dictator. You could argue that giving the rulership to one person is a burden that gives freedom to everyone else.

I still consider that Rightwing, but I did concede it could be Left, so I'll give you a !delta for that.

Or if you are religious and want a theocracy. Depending on your moral system you can easily say an hierarchy is the most moral thing.

**The cornerstone of conflict (primarily in the scope of things we would debate with ""words rather than swords, but might prevent a lot of sword fighting anyways"") in our society is that we lack the ability to communicate effectively (quick, all encompassing, and devoid of differing interpretations) since we are all silos of cognition and experience, even when members of groups.** A parable that strongly reflects my view would be the Blind Men and the Elephant. Without the ability to communicate more effectively, we have to resort to swords more than words to arrive at conflict resolution.

Why I want my view changed: I want a better world. I see many debates over ""controversies"" as unproductive and psychologically harmful to multiple sides of the debate. If we have the ability to create problems, I would like to think we could solve them too. Part of this is that people modify the definitions of words to suit their purpose (this is a universal thing, not a one side of the debate or the other thing). Another part of this is the inability to conceptualize an experience they are lacking. Enough of the right kind of communication should be able to provide the necessary conceptualization and integrated experience for the receiver. I would like to say that I readily conceptualize the multiple angles to most debates and appreciate the experience and see roads forward and that I also have experiences that can be difficult to communicate to others and get them to appreciate in the way that I do.

3. We in general have an ability to simulate portions of reality in our minds (a quick and dirty one would be the fact that we dream) and how that might relate back to our own experience. For example, I hurt myself and grimaced my face in pain. I saw someone grimace their face, so they must be in pain. This is a form of non-verbal communication that we would refer to as empathy.
4. Other important facets of communication may include, but is not limited to, intangible concepts like respect, trust, attention, creativity, sense of humor, etc.
5. Communication means the sending and receiving of a signal. If the signal is not received, communication did not occur.
6. Lines of communication can be damaged or absent and are demonstrative of failure to communicate abstract concepts when seemingly simple concepts may be difficult with a specific avenue (a difficult but seemingly simple concept to explain would be color, especially to someone who has never seen it, or to attempt to explain and evoke in the mind a color that does not ""exist to us"")
7. Established vocabulary does not immediately queue up the same image for every individual even within the same language or cultural group. For example, in the United States, if say ""Think about (A)pple,"" how many iterations of, extrapolations from, and in what order would you visualize different ""definitions"" of (A)pple? Examples might include: Red Delicious Apple, A Golden Delicious Apple, a large technology corporation, a fruit from a religious story about a woman in a garden, ""A is for Apple,"" ""Apples to Apples,"" that would be a good Wordle Word, etc. so on and so forth. This may be an avenue to attempt a ""test.""
8. The described ""Apple"" phenomenon happens to a variable extent with all words.
9. We are constantly bombarded with communicative signals that may provoke different neurological response, such as ""freezing"" a certain ""range of definitions"" for a given word.
10. Communicating using a ""different meaning"" than held in the state from #9 may be considered a form of neurological assault
11. New definitions of words are best acquired through experience and/or satisfaction of mental  evidence requirements
12. Definition may be interpreted as the belief in what something is
13. Humans are limited in their ability to disseminate information from their minds (as a metaphor, the hands and mouth are a funnel against the very large tank of the mind and information is the water attempting to flow through the funnel).
14. Technology to date does not allow for the 100% conversion of ""thought"" to a digestible format
15. This notion extends to artistic execution and consumption of art (Two people may take away a different message from the same piece of art, even if they are genetic twins raised in the same household)
16. If we could ""relay"" our full mindset (intent, emotions, feelings, sensations, mental imagery, evocations (how I'm expressing how one's mind reacts upon hearing a word or description), and corporealizations (how I'm expressing how mentally held concepts are communicated) to another it would be far easier for them to ""co-adopt our viewpoint"" and integrate it into their mindset and beliefs to remove barriers of communication and reach nuanced conclusions
17. Most spontaneous ""abstract in concept"" communication occurs ""on the fly"" in words.
18. I consider conflict and competition to be separate if not parallel components of the human condition

Original Post:

As someone who enjoys debate or challenging my beliefs and worldviews, I feel I see a universal source of conflict is semantics (word choice, ""commonly accepted"" descriptive short cuts, too little detail, too much detail, chosen definitions, agenda based definitions, self-manifested definitions, etc.) and that we are fundamentally ill suited to productively resolve conflict due to our inability to communicate effectively and/or sadly even agree what a word means. Basically the parable of the ""Blind Men and the Elephant"" applies to quite literally everything we as ""conscious people"" experience. As a disclaimer: my entire objective is to dissect focuses and definitions, and if something is construed as offensive or taking a side on a controversial issue is not the intent or purpose of this view.

A simple example that I'll end up convoluting excessively: ""A glass filled halfway with water."" It's easy to visualize on your kitchen counter or desk (there may even be one there).

Now describe it to someone else: Is the glass half full or half empty? Is it half full of air or is it half empty of water? Is the glass full of air and water? Is the glass empty of oil? Is the glass filled to it's halfway point in terms of volume or in terms of distance from its base or its top? What if the water in the glass is it actually 99.9% H2O, .01% Sodium, Chloride, Fluoride and Calcium Ions, .09% Bacteria and the air is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% Carbon Dioxide, etc. and is that by molecules or volumetric occupation? Is the glass clear or opaque? Is it colorful? Does it have a handle? Is it short and stout or tall and thin? Is it a functional cylinder or a tornado glass? How about a full bait and switch since this has all been relayed through text: What if the ""glass filled halfway with water"" is actually a fishbowl with a little goldfish swimming about over his little blue rocks and plastic treasure chest?

Now which description of ""A glass filled halfway with water"" is the truth and which statement is a lie and where is the cutoff or accommodation for intent and/or background? Everything said is at very least ""mostly"" true, but it may not be all encompassing, or it might not focus on what was important or the more favored description, or it might depend on the person describing it. Certainly a glassblower and a marine biologist might begin at different points in their emphasis. The chemist might begin elsewhere. Or they might start at the same point because of their culture, but what if they are part of different cultures/upbringings/politics? A child might emphasize how empty the ""glass bowl"" is of other fish for their goldfish to be friends with and the parent might admonish the child for keeping the water level too low for the goldfish to thrive. To what end is it reasonable to agree or disagree on each observers' unique experience?

Even a picture or video could invite endless criticism and misinterpretation: What kind of liquid is it? Is it CGI? Is it an artistic but physical recreation (robot fish and refraction of a second solid within the glass to give the impression of liquid).

Take transgenderism (this is not an agenda post on this issue itself, just a focus on linguistic choices and limitations and conveyance of viewpoints):

We as a society literally argue about what linguistic shortcut we use to refer to someone in the third person. Obviously everyone in the debate, for or against, a member of the community or not, is a member of the human condition. Each debate seemingly boils down to: what is gender? Is it ""biological sex?"" Is it a reference to a cultural presentation of Femininity vs. Masculinity? Is it our inherent level of empathy? Hair length? Use of makeup? Hormone levels? Physical vs. social aggressiveness? Is it whether our torso is more ""Hourglass"" or ""Dorito?""  Is it based on the cut and/or color of clothes we wear? Is it based on what we like to do, feel the need to do, or others expect us to do? Does it have anything to do with the general appearance of breasts under clothing or a bulge in the crotch region of pants. Does it relate to who we would be attracted to or who we would desire to be attracted to us? Where does each participant in the disagreement's definition begin and end?

Surely if the emotions, feelings, sensations, mental imagery, evocations (how I'm expressing how one's mind reacts upon hearing a word or description), and corporealizations (how I'm expressing how mentally held concepts are communicated) related to the debate could be relayed between the conflicting parties, understanding, respect, and trust could and would be readily reached.  Outside of this described ""telepathic empathy,"" how do we effectively convey meaning as words, art, policy, and violence seemingly have not ""settled the matter"" for everyone on hotly debated topics.

I realize a simple explanation could be the willful manipulation by invested entities to alter word definitions to their purpose, but I feel that may be an exacerbation of the issue (since it is an easily attackable vulnerability of human to human communication), rather than its origin.

A burdensome counter (takes time and resources and may no longer be referable to as ""communication"") to ineffective communication would be a combination of the scientific method (constantly testing assumptions) and replication of experiences (so that a belief may become tangibly recreated in a different mind, which may be an innate trait of highly empathetic individuals, which most people are not, and may lead to the wrong conclusions and expanding the divide).

As a curiosity as to how other species are able to communicate, things like ""sonar imaging"" [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3346588/What-dolphins-REALLY-Stunning-image-shows-diver-eyes-mammal-reveals-animals-send-images-water-other.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3346588/What-dolphins-REALLY-Stunning-image-shows-diver-eyes-mammal-reveals-animals-send-images-water-other.html) and something as mundane as pheromones (which I realize people have, it's just not something that seems very powerful for us) seem more effective then words if short of ""telepathic empathy.""

Edit 1: My apologies, but I think I needed to establish more context, as the ""conflict"" I'm primarily referring to is the kind of conflict you would read on this very /subreddit as an example or people would organize politically around.

I wholesale agree that resources are foundational source of conflict, but would propose that much of conflict today around resources are about managing and distributing currently abundant resources along lines that could be ""softened, changed, or erased"" if we could ""beam the contents of our mind"" into another's ""mind.""

Edit 2:

Really should of said ""A Major Cornerstone..."" to save me a lot of headache, lol xP

Though mentioned, I wish to emphasize: certain aspects of the human condition I would consider a fundamental part of how we communicate. A major aspect would be ""Empathy."" Empathy serves as a vehicle for us to interpret communicative signals from others that allow us to make assumptions based on our experiences about those signals and perhaps attempt to act on them in a ""positive manner."" Lack of empathy is a communications failure on this avenue (defining lack of empathy as inability to recognize signals or if recognized, don't respond to them appropriately).

Avenues of communication that fail quickly could be explaining empathetic recognition to those on the autistic spectrum or explaining appropriate empathetic responses to a sociopath.

Another difficult line of expression would be explaining color to a blind person or imaging a color that does not exist.

This would be emblematic of difficulty discussing experienced concepts from person to person."	"iwfan53 @ 2022-02-09 21:34:45 :

For a counter point I would like to present you with the abortion debate.

The Violinist Argument takes all need for definitional debate of is the fetus a person/does life begin at conception off the table, because it grants the fetus all the rights of a fully living breathing human being... and says society is okay with me letting this person die... so why not let a fetus die in the same situation?

The cornerstone of that conflict is not inability to communicate but people having different values and different value systems (pro-life is typically deontological while pro-choice is typically consequentialist).

--------------------------------

TheUncannyFoxhound @ 2022-02-09 22:10:13 :

Had to look up the Violinist Argument, so thank you for that. I also am intrigued to take on the challenge of tackling this debate from a communicative standpoint. Please note, I'm not trying to make my view established, but how communication falls apart. 

Though you propose the removal of the life/not life via the Violinist argument, it is still an recurring angle of communication (so the Violinist Argument failed to settle the matter for everyone as a means of a communicated idea). 

Then we have the issue of defining bodily autonomy. If you hooked yourself up to the Violinist of your own accord with only a snowball's chance your being attached to him would prolong his life and it turns out it would, how would your bodily autonomy play out? You made the decision to attempt to save the violinist's life, even if it would most likely soon fail. Are you to live with your decision? If not, are you murdering the violinist? If this isn't clear, this is an allegory for consensual sex and getting pregnant. 

In an ideal scenario of ""perfect, telepathic empathy"" communication, let's say we have a pregnant teenager who really wants and feels she needs an abortion in order to live life and her religious zealot of a mother who wants to be a grandmother. If they were able to truly evoke their feelings and sense of experience into each other, you could and would likely have two people who are conflicted about their viewpoint: they both want the teenage girl to be happy and live their life and both want to experience the joy of bringing a new and miraculous life into the world because they literally felt each others full experience. They could then have a discussion rather than an argument. In the realm of words, how would you evoke that change in the other? You couldn't scientifically test if ""abortion is a mortal sin"" and to setup the mother than be on the verge of a lifechanging experience and then impregnate her might be considered unethical to replicate the experience while at the same time sending the girl to ""church camp"" and have the baby simply by the passage of time.

Consent to sex is not consent to getting pregnant.  So your allegory is pointless.

I know some people believe it is, but I do not.

This would be one of those difference in values things I talked about.

I think you've had another failure to communicate as I have no idea what the point of this argument is.

--------------------------------

TheUncannyFoxhound @ 2022-02-09 23:06:33 :

That is like saying ""Consent to gamble is not consent to lose."" The allegory (both the original and mine) and the foundation of the ""abortion"" debate would revolve around as a natural consequence to unprotected sex. Protected sex leading to pregnancy would qualify as ""consent not given to become pregnant:""

So let's attempt to define ""sex:"" 

1. The act of attempting to get pregnant? (Basic biological point of having sex organs)
2. A fun activity where we touch body parts with other body parts? (Inclusive of masturbation and any sexuality engaging in sexual acts)?
3. An act of dominance by men forced upon women? (Feminism)
4. An act of seduction by women to obtain resource providing men? (Pro-male dominance? I don't know, not super well versed in some of these arguments)
5. All the above
6. None of the above
7. Something else?

And if you didn't receive the message I was trying to send with that example, then yes, I failed to communicate to you effectively or you failed to receive my message effectively (Option A, B, Both, or Neither). That natural disposition of our failure to accurately relay ideas to each other would induce conflict and for each other to reach conclusions about mental faculties either accurate or inaccurate. Hence my entire original point.

--------------------------------

iwfan53 @ 2022-02-09 23:16:48 :

&gt;That is like saying ""Consent to gamble is not consent to lose.""

No is isn't.  It's like saying ""Consenting to leave your house door open at night, is not consent to be robbed.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard this argument before never found it convincing, because I have different beliefs than you do.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem isn't communication, the problem is that we fundamentally believe different things.

You're attempting to make this complicated than it really is.

**Why can't you believe that I understand but just don't agree with your argument?**

annoyedateverybody @ 2022-02-10 00:04:15 :

This is super interesting.

I don't have much to add but is OP trying to establish that ALL conflict is rooted in erroneous communication? While you provide a great example here, does it invalidate what OP is claiming?

There's functionally no way to compare which of these scenarios is more likely to occur (but if you use this subreddit as an example, there's way more failures of communication than straight amicable disagreements with people understanding each other (obviously anecdotal)

Anyways, carry on folks!"	"annoyedateverybody @ 2022-02-10 00:14:43 :

Yeah I literally thought the same thing to your last point haha. Is OP playing 4d chess?

--------------------------------

TheUncannyFoxhound @ 2022-02-10 01:35:07 :

Lol, that question is highly indicative of the discussion I'm trying to have. To reuse a a word in context that I used in my stated views, I feel as though I have trouble ""corporealizing"" my mind or converting what I consider a highly ""fractalized,"" conflicting, and multidimensional thoughts into a ""single string medium"" like talking or writing. 

I try to ""assess and integrate information as appropriate"" into my worldview, and sometimes that leads to believing both opposing viewpoints and the process of reconciliation or integration involves questioning definitions of those viewpoints. 

To chaotically express some things I would try to reconcile would be 1+1=2, which is easily accepted as true for most people. How about 1 apple + 1 apple = 2 apples, seems safe enough, but assume the apples are different weights. So 100 gram apple plus 80 gram apple = 2 apples weighing a total 180 grams? Or 180 grams of apple? Is an apple on average 90 grams? What if a 90 gram apple doesn't actually exist and only comes in 80 and 100 gram varieties? Returning to math, there are fundamentally infinite things that equal 2, such as 4-2=2, or 2 billion divided by 1 billion. So if we decide to have a conversation about the number 2, which version of 2 or 2 equivalent are we talking about? Or what if we're talking about permutations of ""2"" and don't realize we are both just taking about ""2.""

So if I were to take the word ""sex,"" and have a conversation about it, it would be important to know what we're talking about (are we talking about ""organ possession"" or ""chromosal pairings"" or we talking about sending ""naughty"" messages and images over texts, or are we talking about the act of reproducing/mating, or we talking about the fun activity you performed with some random person the other night naked, or the German version of the number ""6""). You could simply say ""context matters,"" but context might not be sufficient or phrasing could have been different or understanding is just absent, but the communication continues due to no need for understanding to proceed.

Another extrapolation of this thought process is answering the question: ""Where do you live?"" Valid responses include: wherever I happen to be is where I'm currently living at; mostly in my head; at my house; in my city; in my country; on Earth, in the Milky Way, this reality, etc. Ad infinitum. Is there answer reliant upon social decorum or an accepted definition of the question? 

And this is an issue even with all communicative faculties are present. It's easy to see communication failing in their absence like if someone is deaf, you lose sound as an avenue of communication. If you lose sight, you lose body language/facial expressions/gestures. But what about more subtle things like sense of humor, empathy, attention, trust, etc.? 

As an aside, I need to delve in to Absolute vs. General argumentative positions to better articulate my intent and what avenues would contribute to my understanding and changing view (I think I need to go through and add so contextual view changes, but give me some time to review what and when something changed or evolved in my view).

DavidJayy @ 2022-02-24 02:55:47 :

Your perspective seems exceedingly biased and extreme. 

This was a influx of multiple factors. Past vaccine mandates were also met with controversy but the covid vaccine mandate is a situation with many layers to break down. As foolish as it sounds, anti-vaxx has been a thing for a while now. But that’s a completely different point. The process and creation of these mRNA vaccines are entirely contemporary. We still do not know the long term effects of them because this method has never been deployed on such a scale. It was also the addition of many other mandates where social restrictions were put into place with the addition of the economy being put into a hiatus. When was the last time anyone had to quarantine for months? in their lives? When was the last time you were required to wear a cloth over your face? When was the last time you could get fined for being outside after a certain time? Many of these individuals believe they’re being restricted of freedom and for anyone with a position that does not condone exuberant federal power, this whole situation feels violating. 

There’s probably many more factors that I’m personally not aware of but these seem to be the points they tend to argue. I’m all about trying to keep an open mind. Yes, Fox News can feel like propaganda. Yes, one could argue that it is very close to brainwashing. But it is very much the same for other left leaning news sources. They ultimately strive and profit from polarization. You are very much a cog enabling their propositions as well. Hopefully you’re aware of that.

capitalism: [system characterized by private ... ownership](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism)

Fascism is on a spectrum. Direct democracy based on libertarian values is the least fascist because it  exalts nothing over the individual. You can't have representative democracy without some fascism. And if you go full-blown ethnostate \[right wing\] or ecostate \[left wing\] you are at the same place on the fascism scale. Complete subjugation of the individual to group values.

It is interesting to contrast the Websters definition with the wikipedia definition of fascism. Webster's viewpoint is over centuries and is more objective, while wikipedia's is over a MUCH shorter period and shows just the prevailing zeitgeist understanding.

The left no longer think they are on the fascist spectrum because they have turned the word into a pejorative.

Edit: Better definition of fascism by Griffith. Thanks iwfan53. ""\[F\]ascism is best defined as a  revolutionary form of nationalism, one that sets out to be a political,  social and ethical revolution, welding the ‘people’ into a dynamic  national community under new elites infused with heroic values. The core  myth that inspires this project is that only a populist, trans-class  movement of purifying, cathartic national rebirth (palingenesis) can  stem the tide of decadence"" This definition emphasizes the WELDING/CONCENTRATING-OF-POWER of people together, without right or left interpretation, except the traditionalist aspect which is not necessary in my interpretation.

edit: My evolving current working definition is ""fascism is the quasi-religious concentration of power by adherents in one leader, which may have traditionalist foundations and may have authoritarian outcomes."" The defining aspect is the leadership not the leaders marketing. **The reason phds have such a hard time defining it, is because the political power is so concentrated the leaders whims become war banners, and fleeting thoughts become construction projects. They expect consistency where there is none.** Authoritarian leadership is on a sliding scale depending on the zeal of the followers with fascism being the maximal case. The zeal acts as a power and stability multiplier.

I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT FASCISM BEING LEFT AND RIGHT EQUALLY:

Thanks St33lbutcher. ""The Capitalist class will always align themselves with the fascists because they can keep their property if the fascists take power, but they can't if the socialists do."" I would add, they MIGHT keep their property with a fascist leader.

Thanks iwfan53 for helping me realize that the left ideal is leaderless, so not compatible with fascism. However the implementation of the left still could be fascist if there is leader worship and the leader doesn't step down. Also thanks for helping me refine my working definition of fascism distinguishing it from just authoritarianism.

I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT FASCISM BEING INCORRECTLY USED (sort of):

Thanks CrimsonHartless for giving examples of other leader worship, and context of false labeling eg Tankies (just because someone says they are a thing doesn't make it so). I see better why fascism is currently being used with a heavy emphasis on historical context.

Thanks I\_am\_the\_night you helped me see that the current definitions are still helpful (but overemphasized) beyond the first part of the definition I posted.

DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND ON:

The left and the right are vulnerable to cults of leadership, violation of human dignity and autonomy and need to take steps to reduce hyperbole in regards to name calling. The new civil war doesn't need to happen. Even the worst person in the world deserves respect if they don't violate human dignity or autonomy.

WHAT I LEARNED:

Fascism and how it has been implemented are two different things, and fascism is unique in the level of willing concentration of power in a single individual which borders on the religious and **can be thought of as voluntary monarchy for the ingroup**. Thanks to CutieHeartgoddess for helping me appreciate the importance of balancing a definition from both critics and supporters. The supporters may be wrong but critics may be more objective.

Thanks to [ImaginaryInsect1275](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t2ru6g/cmv_definition_of_fascism_is_being_used/hyoq433/) for showing the **utter mess defining fascism is**, and helping me realize that **fascism is not a new thing it is a very old thing** with updated reasons to join the ingroup. Also thanks to memelord2022 for showing the fickle nature of fascist propaganda/marketing. Also thanks to iwfan53 for helping me see the important of the current syncretic view of fascism which helps outline the existence of idiosyncratic philosophies, which are not remarkable in and of themselves. 

In regards to the left / right spectrum, the [Nolan Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart) is quite helpful. But according to my view, **fascism could be anywhere on the chart because once you choose your fascist leader, he takes you  where he wants to go, not where he told you he would go. This explains why fascism is so idiosyncratic and hard to define.**

Thanks to LucidMetal for suggesting to read Umberto Eco's essay on fascism, and emphasizing its importance. Unfortunately it was problematic. 8/14 of his points can be summarized as [""people need stories/lies,  people need to be kept under control, and you always need an enemy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t2ru6g/comment/hyxbxo9/) which is not insightful/unique and only reinforced my view that the leader worship aspect (6/14) is way more important to understanding fascism than any of the other ideas surrounding it.

**The fascist leads the out-group by fear, and the in-group by love.** The transition between out-group to in-group would necessarily involve humiliation and subjugation. With late night speeches, Stockholm syndrome, mass entrainment, and public acts of submission as tools to inspire trust from leader to in-group and love from in-group to leader.

\--- This whole post aside, I don't think anything keeps the left from having hierarchies and out-groups. They have disgust reflex that can be manipulated.

You changed the definition of fascism from Merriam Webster as you linked to it! The definition links fascism to a race or in-group (most memorably, Aryans), not just to the concept of a group like you did.

Authoritarianism is not the same as fascism. Collectivism is not the same as fascism. Fascism is the glorification of a specific in-group, usually nationalistic or ethnic, and the treatment of outsiders as impure and subhuman.

Tried to clarify it to emphasize the group values regardless of nation or race or hobbies.

Fascism is the glorification of a specific in-group - Agree But I would phrase it as the ultimate concentration of political power, possibly with shitting on others.

Usually nationalistic or ethnic - Agree

\[USUALLY\] treatment of outsiders as subhuman - Agree

--------------------------------

jonawesome @ 2022-02-27 18:57:25 :

&gt;Tried to clarify it to emphasize the group values regardless of nation or race or hobbies.

Would scholars of fascism agree with that emphasis? You are changing the definition of fascism to argue your point, rather than following from what the definition says to make that analysis. The focus on the in-group/out-group dichotomy is much more intrinsic to fascism than collectivist economic or government policies.

--------------------------------

youbetterkeepwalking @ 2022-02-27 19:06:14 :

No, scholars would necessarily object to my simple mind and definitions.

MY working definition of fascism is ""a maximum of willing concentration of power by adherents in one leader, which may have traditionalist foundations and may have authoritarian outcomes.""

So you're using your own definition that doesn't align with any widely agreed-upon definition?  


That's not how it works. You can't change the definiton of a word to what you think it should be, then argue the word is used incorrectly. That's circular logic.

When debating with someone, you are trying to convince them that your point of view is correct. This requires a lot of understanding on both sides. When I see people screaming ""my body, my choice"" I despair at the self-rightousness and lack of empathy for the other side. That's not to say that this doesn't happen in both directions.

For most people using this argument, they do not see the fetus as a baby and therefore attribute no human rights to it. But the people that they're arguing against DO see the fetus as a human. My sister is religious, she sees every human life as a gift from God in his own image. Try to imagine how precious a thing that is to someone who genuinely believes it. It seems so strange to me to be yelling at someone that it's your body, so it's fine to kill a baby. I know that isn't how you or I see it, but that's what it looks like from a pro-life perspective. It's the kind of argument that brutal slave owners would use to justify beating their slaves given that they own them. So this argument is not going to convince anyone for your case, when what you really disagree on is the moral value of the fetus.

Can a conjoined twin kill its twin with the defence ""it's my body, my choice""? Of course not, because the human right to ""do what you want with your property"" is superseded by the human right to live.

I don't actually think that there's much chance of convincing someone of the opposite opinion to yours with regards to abortion. I'm just a bit sick of the villification that I see all over reddit of people with opposing views without any attempt to see the problem from their angle.

No one is debating that bodily autonomy is important. The debate is whether or not that autonomy is more important than the already-existing life of the child. I’m also pro-choice but don’t find “my body my choice” all that compelling, because to those that are concerned for the child’s life (because they see the two as equally worthy of continued life), it’s a matter of one person’s convenience vs another person’s life.

I think the best arguments I’ve seen here have been ones relating to the idea that bodily autonomy *does* take precedence over life, but those only stand due to precedent, such as that you are not required to sacrifice your own well being to save someone’s life. With that said, if you put someone in a situation where someone was dependent on your body for their survival and then let them be killed, you would absolutely be liable for either manslaughter or criminal negligence…

I just don’t see how you can justify abortion without devaluing the fetus’ life, which is the argument I *do* find compelling. I don’t consider the situation described above equivalent because I don’t see a pre-sentient being as being of equal human value to an actual sentient, sapient being. But most people who say “my body my choice” consider that point to be irrelevant, and the justifications for that just don’t add up for me.

You know how you end that arguement almost altogether?? Mandate vasectomies for men at 16. Then there will be no accidental pregnancy from dudes being unable to control their bodily fluids. Then after you mandate that also mandate child support from day of conception. See? Your body my choice.  As for your arguement about said fetus; that fetus isnt a viable baby until it gets pushed from its mothers body and takes its first breaths alone, thats just facts, many many things can go wrong. Until then its literally a succubus and should not take position over the woman who created the baby. Until it leaves the womans body it does not function on its own. No one is getting late term abortions without really really great reason so that arguement is moot as well. If youre a man you need to get over this notion you should have any sort of say over a woman and her body, even if you are the cause of that child being created.

I believe he meant it not as a counterpoint but as a clarification. Time itself and time's passage isn't a social construct, but our calendar is. This gets into interesting territory as much of how we construct time is based on physical, observable cycles. A ""year"" is a social construct, but the amount of time it takes for an orbit around the sun is not. The lunar cycle is physical but ""months"" are not.   


I actually think this distinction is important to OP's original argument. Much of what people call ""social constructs"" are deeply rooted in physical, observable phenomena. Phenotypical expressions are socially crafted in ""races"", genders and sexuality pigeonholed into a couple acceptable options, etc.  


OP might be getting at the idea that race (an easy example) isn't made up and using ""race is a social construct"" to avoid or dismiss critical examinations of race relations is dumb and missing the point. I would agree. Race being a social construct doesn't stop humans from being physically and culturally different from one another and the idea of social constructs can be used to turn a blind eye to certain realities.

This “spirituality-meets-science” is NOT scientific.

Just to tag on additional thoughts to race (not saying that you disagree with this!), I think people say ""race is a social construct"" to push against the idea that you can define races completely based on biology. I've never really heard people use it to dismiss addressing racism or racial relations.

Yes, there are people who literally have more and less melatonin, but it's not like there's a clear line between skin color and race. You can definitely have a White person who's darker than a Black person. Nationality is already a social construction, but race is kind of ambiguous there too. The U.S. government most of the time considers a North African person and a Mexican to be White, which feels arbitrary. Definitions of who is what race have changed throughout time - for egregious examples, South Africa at some point considered certain groups of East Asian people to be White. In the U.S., you probably wouldn't consider yourself to be racially Aryan, but the Nazis certainly had different ideas of what races were.

I think you're taking this 'time is a social construct' too literal, I don't think it means to refer to actual time, I think it's aimed more at timing and punctuality. I think it means to say that things like 'being late' or 'being early' are social constructs; time is an impartial and uncaring force, all meaning we attach to that are subjectively attached by people (= social construct), time doesn't have any inherent meaning.

I would say 'our obsession with time is a social construct'

You misunderstood if you think that physicists would say time is a \*social construct\*.

--------------------------------

RoyalSloth @ 2022-03-27 21:57:43 :

The way I understand it, time itself is a social construct, although what we derive the concept of time from exists objectively (or at least, as objectively as anything can be said to exist). For example, the International System of Units states that “the second is equal to the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the hyperfine levels of the unperturbed ground state of the 133Cs atom.” If we consider all other units of time as multiples or fractions of the second, then all units and measurements of time are social constructs, i.e. they’re the way they are because we say so, not because of any objective reality. Now, those cesium atoms really exist, and what those cesium atoms do that gives way to a definition of the second really exists as well. But the second itself does not, that’s just us looking at some funky thing cesium atoms do and collectively agreeing “yup, that’s what a second is.” 

Time, at the end of the day, is just a way for us to compare differences in motion/displacement. That’s why every time you see some character in a TV show “stop time,” everything appears to stop moving. If everything has the exact same displacement, you have no observable phenomena from which to construct the idea of time. To think of this another way: it may be objective fact that the entirety of the universe and everything in it is moving at near-infinite velocity, but because everything is doing this in unison, this motion is completely imperceptible to us, since there’s nothing we can see that *isn’t* moving at near-infinite velocity. Our construction of time is therefore left completely unaffected by this sort of motion, because we construct time from our perception of and as a way to compare different things concurrently displacing themselves relative to us in different degrees and directions, and if there’s no difference in the degree or direction of displacement (ie everything stays in the same location relative to each other) we simply can’t create a concept of time from it.

It’s in these ways that time is a social construct. You have to distinguish between time in itself and the objects of which time is used to describe: the former is our invention, and the latter truly exist (as far as anything can be said to truly exist).

--------------------------------

SpeakerOfMyMind @ 2022-03-27 22:07:43 :

The leading theory and most widely accepted position is that time is real. There are a lot that disagree, but even more agree or at least lean that way. Which doesn’t mean it’s right, but there is a lot of math behind it, way more than to those who oppose it.

They’re just arguing a different point than what I’m saying. 

Could one culture not have a word for “knife”, but rather call it simply “small swords”? Sure. That’s similar to how cultures have different words for base colors, and if you grow up in a culture that doesn’t distinguish (for example) green and blue, that you’ll have a harder time differentiating those colors than someone who did. 

But that’s perception. That’s not what I’m talking about. Green light and blue light **still physically exist**. They **are** different, fundamentally, and they exist, and you can describe their differences objectively without any reliance whatsoever on cultural associations or even language. 

Color perception exists in your brain. Colors are a human construct. But visible light? That’s a physical construct. It’s real. 

Similarly, if someone makes an object that you or I would call a “knife”, it still exists. Even if every person who would ever call it a “knife” were to perish, it would still exist. The word “knife” is just a word, and like all parts of language it too is just a social construct. **Y’all are getting way too caught up on the words.** I don’t have any other way to describe this stuff to you without breaking out the full philosophical prose and referencing platonic ideals and shit, and it would be a whole lot easier if you would please stop arguing semantics when I am repeating over and over that this argument is not about semantics.

A knife is not a social construct. It is a physical thing that exists. If all humans poofed out of existence, the knife would still be there. It is a physical construct, not a social one. 

The concepts of ""breadwinner"" and ""homemaker"" are social constructs. They do not exist physically. They only have meaning in the context of human society. If all humans magically poofed out of existence, these concepts would cease to exist. 

That is the difference.

epelle9 @ 2022-03-27 13:37:26 :

It could be argued that a knife is a social construct though.

If I grab a sharp rock and cut things with it, is it a knife? Is it a rock? What defines a knife?

Is a knife really a knife? Or is it just metal, and we as humans use the socially constructed word knife to describe a combination of matter?

Because if humans ceased to exist, the knife object will still be there, but it will no longer be a knife, and there will be no-one to call it that.

--------------------------------

Skyy-High @ 2022-03-27 16:28:43 :

That’s tautological. The word “knife” encompasses those purposes, because humans came up with that word to describe the object and what it does. If all humans disappeared and some ooze alien without limbs came by in centuries and found a knife, would they call it a knife? Would they know it was used for cutting? No. But it would still exist. It’s a physical object. It has certain unarguable properties (it’s a solid, at least part of it is likely made of metal, the blade is fashioned into some sort of thin wedge, etc). 

How about this for a comparison: “person who gives birth to a live human baby” vs “mother”. The former exists independent of any human culture or context; if you can understand those words (or translate them so they can be understood) then any person knows what you mean and can answer yes/no questions about whether any other person falls into that category. 

The latter, however, is a social construct. Different people will have different ideas about what exactly “mother” means. Those ideas will often, but not always, overlap with the same persons identified by the former phrase. See also: “he may have been your father, but he ain’t your daddy.”

AlexandreZani @ 2022-03-27 16:47:11 :

&gt;  If all humans disappeared and some ooze alien without limbs came by in centuries and found a knife

They would not. They would find a sharp pointy thing. I don't mean that they would use different words. I mean it literally would not be a knife to them. That's part of what it means for knives to be socially constructed.

&gt; How about this for a comparison: “person who gives birth to a live human baby” vs “mother”. The former exists independent of any human culture or context;

No. If you have no culture or context it's just a bunch of atoms bouncing around.

&gt; if you can understand those words (or translate them so they can be understood)

I have done a little translation professionally and part of the job is communicating the cultural context. You're describing a process by which people are transmitting cultural constructs. A culture could in theory not have a distinct concept of ""person who gives birth to a live human baby"" and if you are trying to translate, you would have to build that construct in their culture by explaining that say, the child outside the womb vs the child in the womb are distinct states as opposed to just the child being somewhere. (or whatever it is their culture has.)

We’re using written language here mate. “Knife” here is just a less wordy substitute for what you wrote that we both understand so I can get to the point faster. There was no reason to write this except to pretend to get a “gotcha”; literally the next words I wrote were “would they call it a knife?”

&gt;	No. If you have no culture or context it’s just a bunch of atoms bouncing around.

Unless you’re going to tell me that some form of intelligent life could exist that would not recognize our species as **at bare minimum** a thing that creates near-copies of itself and those copies come out from some of them and grow in size over time, then you don’t even need a human context to understand the former idea. 

You’d need the ability to observe the universe with a level of detail necessary to resolve and distinguish human-sized objects, and basic pattern recognition (which I think would be necessary for anything we would define as “intelligence”). That’s it. The rest is observation. 

If you posit that physics is the same everywhere in the universe, there’s no inherent reason why these things wouldn’t be, well, universal. 

&gt;	A culture could in theory not have a distinct concept of “person who gives birth to a live human baby”

That’s like saying a culture could not have a distinct concept of “person who drinks water.” Even positing the notion that the grouping isn’t important enough for a human culture to be familiar with (ridiculous; show me that culture), it’s still a universal physical process and act that you can describe to any human with simple terms like “out of” and “smaller”. Those are comparative relationships. You could describe what I said in terms of math, topologically. It absolutely does not need cultural context if all you are talking about is the physical act, devoid of emotions / expectations / sense information.

&gt; We’re using written language here mate. “Knife” here is just a less wordy substitute for what you wrote that we both understand so I can get to the point faster.

But my point is exactly that a sharp pointy object is not a knife unless it has a certain purpose. So if you mean they find a sharp pointy object, sure. If you mean they find something you and I think is a knife, sure. If you mean ""they find a knife"", then no. They find a sharp pointy object.

&gt; literally the next words I wrote were “would they call it a knife?”

Right, but my point is that's not about the word they use. It's about the concept of knife not being attached to the object alone. There is no such thing as a knife absent a purpose of cutting things. Not ""there would not be a word for it"". I mean literally it's not part of their ontology.

You can try to write down a definition of ""knife"" that is independent of cultural context, but that's a different thing from what we mean by ""knife"". Yes, there are certain arrangements of atoms that we agree are a knife, but that's not what it means to be a knife.

&gt; That’s like saying a culture could not have a distinct concept of “person who drinks water.”

In practice, all human cultures do as far as I'm aware. But that doesn't mean it's not socially constructed. Some social constructs are very useful and get constructed by pretty much all cultures.

&gt; Even positing the notion that the grouping isn’t important enough for a human culture to be familiar with (ridiculous; show me that culture), it’s still a universal physical process and act that you can describe to any human with simple terms like “out of” and “smaller”. Those are comparative relationships. You could describe what I said in terms of math, topologically. It absolutely does not need cultural context if all you are talking about is the physical act, devoid of emotions / expectations / sense information.

Yes, you could describe what you said in topological terms. If all you mean is that there is some sort of physical processes that could theoretically be listed that correspond to birth, then sure.

But that's not what ""birth"" or ""person"" or ""live"" or ""human"" or ""baby"" mean. They're not just physical processes. What I'm saying is that when you use the words, you are importing cultural context and you can't avoid doing that. The fact that certain things are distinct and others are grouped together by our culture is a fundamental part of something being a baby and unless you're redefining the word ""baby"", you can't avoid it being part of what you said.

You’re trying to do the “how many molecules can you take away from a chair before it’s not a chair” thing, and that’s entirely besides my point. I’m not trying to define the boundaries on what a knife is. I’m literally saying that a knife **is**. It is a physical object. It’s not a social construct because if all humans died, a knife would continue to exist. 

Would it have all of the same societal cues and uses? No, of course not. Has the Acropolis ever stopped existing in the last 4000 years? No. Does anyone alive today look at it and see it in the same cultural context as it was seen when it was built? No. The thing still exists. Humans attach significance to things, including names like “knife”, and people with more time than me can quibble about the philosophical limitations of those labels. 

But, in order to participate in this discussion, *you already bought into the idea that you could define a thing called a “knife”*. We’ve already agreed that the term is useful to describe a physical object, and I have no interest in debating the limitations of that description. I’m just using it to make a point that you are refusing to engage with.

At no point did I say that objects could not be imbued with more meaning than a simple physical description would entail. But…that’s not the object. That’s the social connotations that have been associated with the object.

No. But you're trying to say the object can be stripped of that social meaning and remain the same thing. I'm disagreeing with you. A knife is a thing in a social context. There is no ""knife"" without the purpose of cutting. Sure, there is a physical thingie, but it's not a knife.

--------------------------------

Skyy-High @ 2022-03-27 19:55:09 :

You’re asserting that definition, that a “knife” encompasses the social meaning of the object. 

I disagree. And I think anyone reading this discussion would agree, just by answering this question: in all the instances where you read the word “knife” in this discussion, what came to mind? Was it some nebulous knife-shaped object (for me it kinda morphs between various video-game inspired military knives)? Did it include any emotions at all? Anything that couldn’t be described by geometry and physics? 

Because mine sure didn’t. That’s why I say you can attach emotional/cultural connotations to a knife (a curved blade might be described as “wicked” for various cultural reasons) but a “knife” itself is merely physical. 

You just breezed past the part of my post regarding the Acropolis for another example of an object that has cultural connotations, changing ones at that, but the object itself is static and described by the same word regardless of connotations and perspective.

--------------------------------

tomatoswoop @ 2022-03-28 00:34:26 :

You're not understanding the point they're making. It's not about the word used, ""knife"" is not an inherent thing, it is human created category, ""knife"" is a description of a categorisation scheme that humans have for objects. That is what it means for an object to be a ""knife"", that a human culture/society has come up with a categorisation for objects that includes that object in a certain category (here called ""knife"", but it could be called ""hakcloff"" or ""pinsha"" or ""dubrith"" if you like, it's not the specific word we're talking about, but the idea that there is a such thing as a ""dubrith""/""knife"", and that this object fits the bill.)

Let's say another human culture has a similar word to ""knife"", one that also includes swords, scissors, and shears. They don't have a word that includes a ""knife"" but excludes ""shears"". Do they also have a ""knife""? If so, they also have a ""knife"" when they have scissors no? Or do they have a ""bildran"", and we just don't know that both knives and scissors are _bildrani_?

Or lets say another culture separates out 1- edged cutters used as tools (e.g. knives), 2 edged cutters (shears, scissors), and other words for knife-like weapons (daggers, swords). Okay, not that dissimilar to our schema, and in fact, you could translate the first word as ""knife"" right? Well, except it would also include a sickle, used in the fields. Is a sickle a knife? It's a cutting blade with a handle...

The point is that it's not just the word, the concept of a ""knife"" includes ideas about how different objects in the world are grouped, how they are made, what their form is, what their purpose is. To say that someone found a ""knife"" _means_ that they have an shared understanding of what some something is: what it's used for, how it's used, its form, providence etc. informs how they should categorise it.


And so if an alien, who has never heard of a ""knife"" (maybe this alien is from an entirely gaseous planet with no need to cut things) finds a sharp piece of metal on earth, maybe it just finds a ""stick"". Or a ""shiny"", which includes coins too. Or a ""small heavy"". Maybe our ""roughly hand-sized long thin metal cutting implement"" is just not a category that makes sense to this being, not having hands, or a need to cut anything. In that sense he hasn't got a ""knife"" any more than the person that made it had a ""dogroth"" (a word for a metallic object containing carbon perhaps, or for a stone, maybe a knife and a stone seem like pretty much the same thing to this alien)."	"tomatoswoop @ 2022-03-28 01:31:01 :

Literally not talking about the word, but the concept, as both I and the other person made clear.

Yes, the physical collection of atoms would exist. But it wouldn't be ""a knife"", and that's not a point about the _word_ knife, but the _concept_ of a knife.

An object would exist, no one disputes that. But that object wouldn't be a knife (conceptually, not just in English) without a culture to categorise it as one.

The original point was this:

&gt;A knife is not a social construct. It is a physical thing that exists.

The point is that a knife literally is a social construct

Skyy-High @ 2022-03-28 01:44:06 :

Cool cool, so how exactly am I supposed to describe objects that exist independently of humanity’s interference or observation? 

Is Venus a social construct because different societies throughout history have thought about planets in different ways, or is it just a planet, and your point amounts to “language is a social construct”?

Because if it’s the former, then I have two questions: first, what *isn’t* a social construct? And second, what is the purpose of a term if it encompasses essentially everything? A dialectical should be the bare minimum requirement for any grouping term to be useful. Otherwise just roll the term into the umbrella of properties under “everything” and be done with it."

Once again, I did not say that. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop arguing against things I haven't said. If someone else said that then cool, take it up with them.

I simply said that men, on average, make better soldiers than women. Not that women are incapable of being a soldier.

If you want an analogy to *really* make it clear, it's like me saying that a sofa makes for a better seat than a rock, and you keep telling me that it's possible to sit on a rock.

Cool dude, you're not disagreeing with me.

&gt; If you respond to that, on a thread about whether women should or shouldn't be conscripted, and argue that women are substantially inferior to men, then I'm not sure why it wouldn't make sense to think you're arguing in favor of excluding women from conscription.

Because ""women shouldn't be forced to fight in a war"" is a completely different stance to ""women aren't capable of fighting in a war"". That seems pretty obvious to me.

Moreover, it makes far more sense to actually engage with what someone is saying to you. Not just ignore it and assume they really mean something else.

&gt; Literally speaking, carrying your weight, in this instance 100+ lb, is surely enough to carry tens of pounds of weight distributed around your body.

Wait, so you mean literally carrying objects that total the same weight as your body? If so, that's an *insanely* high bar that the majority of women cannot meet. Hell, it's a high bar that a lot of men can't even reach.

This leads me to think you have literally never done anything resembling physical exercise in all honesty.

&gt; I'm sure boot camp addresses whether or not an individual is strong enough to carry their equipment, and since women are joining the US Army for example in increasing numbers, I'm not sure why I would believe women can't carry their weight, figuratively this time.

First, there is no boot camp or training period in conscription. You are literally being taken as you are.

Second, great that you mentioned boot camp as an example of how the average woman can keep up with the average man.

Did you know that they actually reduced the entry requirements in order to admit more women on several occasions? And they *still* see more men than women despite lowering standards multiple times over the years.

&gt; Not only did I not suggest they have similar levels of endurance on average, in fact I suggested it was lower on average

You said they were ""slightly lower"" which was grossly underselling it, and even that was only after I called you out on saying they were ""on par"" which means equal to, or at the same level. 

&gt; Specifically, in this instance, I do not see why women would be unable to keep up with men in meeting the physical demands of war time.

Because most women can't keep up with men in the physical demands of a workout for Christ's sake.

You seem to grossly underestimate both the physical demands of modern warfare, and the physical capabilities of your average woman."	3	0	stop arguing comment					"It’s really been bothering me that this rule exists and is separating families. I feel like I’m missing something since everyone else seems so okay and normal about it. It’s heartbreaking.

Ok if it's truely coming from a non political position let us be frank

Life is not fair.
Men are biologically stronger than women.
Women and children are far more likely to be targeted with rape war crime.
Someone has to look after kids, women do that more than men generally.
Biologically speaking, to ensure your groups and cultures survival you need more women than men left at the end of war.
The only reason we can speak of equality is because our ancestors did all the hard work for us.
In a world of war or before societal development and human rights, equality does not exist. When society is attacked, things fall into a more natural state of chaos and instinct.

This is one of the only scenarios forced conscription could be tolerated politically and morally in this dat and age. Ukraine would be loosing if their men were not willing to step up to defend their homeland..and their women to feed them and care for their injuries or children in safety etc. Natural order of things and everyone plays a role..

--------------------------------

Roalae_Ilsp @ 2022-03-31 07:37:13 :

&gt;Men are biologically stronger than women.

Men can build muscle much more easily and have more muscle on average, yes. So what? Are you really insinuating that a 25 year old woman is physically less capable than a 50 year old man? That's complete nonsense.

Also, we're not Neanderthals. Our effectiveness in combat is not ""who can swing the club hardest?"" anymore. Strength does not play a role in modern warfare like mental acuity or endurance do, both of which women are on par for. 

&gt;Women and children are far more likely to be targeted with rape war crime.

Women are going to be disproportionately targeted for sexual desires by an army of men. And what is the relevance? The odds of a civilian being raped does not affect their effectiveness in combat.

Slothjitzu @ 2022-03-31 08:44:08 :

&gt; Are you really insinuating that a 25 year old woman is physically less capable than a 50 year old man? That's complete nonsense.

This isn't going to hold true in every single case of course, but generally yes, a 25 year old woman probably is less capable than a 50 year old man.

Obviously showing you data is difficult, but hopefully this helps illustrate the point:

https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/former-tour-pro-sets-masters-hour-record/

A 54 year old former athlete set the masters hour record at 49.392km

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_track_cycling

The woman's hour world record is 48.405km.

Obviously these are examples of elite athletes in both demographics and I realise it's more anecdotal, but if a 50 year old male athlete can comfortably beat the best female athlete of all time, there's no reason to suggest that the average population for both groups would be any different.

&gt; Also, we're not Neanderthals. Our effectiveness in combat is not ""who can swing the club hardest?"" anymore. Strength does not play a role in modern warfare like mental acuity or endurance do, both of which women are on par for.

Strength, speed, and endurance all play a gigantic role. Obviously significantly less than they did a thousand years ago, but they are still major factors.

And no, women are not ""on par"" for endurance. Men generally exceed women in all three of the aforementioned categories. Again, generally speaking, obviously some women are stronger, faster, or have better endurance than some men. 

&gt; Women are going to be disproportionately targeted for sexual desires by an army of men. And what is the relevance? The odds of a civilian being raped does not affect their effectiveness in combat.

I think they were going for a ""harm reduction"" kind of angle here. Essentially that there are more feasible ways for women to undergo harm than men, during wartime.

I don't really agree with it being relevant myself, just trying to shed some light on why I think they mentioned it.

There is no field in science where a common trend, let alone a single example, is taken and extrapolated to the average.

Sports have many more makes participating which means higher chances at that sex performing better; the culture encouraging men to join sports is consistently more cutthroat with higher stakes (eg men going for sports scholarships); our current culture discourages women from pursuing non-aesthetic physical training; better coaching and infrastructure is generally provided in men's leagues; and so forth.

There are an absurd amount of potential factors going into males dominating sports that are not accounted for in arguments such as the one put forth.

I do not deny that women are disadvantaged at carrying or developing muscle, but there is nothing that suggests women are incapable of being qualified soldiers in modern warfare. 

&gt;Strength, speed, and endurance all play a gigantic role. Obviously significantly less than they did a thousand years ago, but they are still major factors.

Speed and endurance, yes, but the importance of strength has clearly been greatly diminished. Being able to carry your weight, literally, is enough for modern warfare. 

&gt;And no, women are not ""on par"" for endurance.

Yes, they are. VO2max is the common metric thrown around on this subject, and while women do have slightly lower VO2max on average, there is nothing which suggests women's endurance cannot keep up with men in an environment with strenuous activity.

--------------------------------

Slothjitzu @ 2022-03-31 09:26:34 :

&gt; There is no field in science where a common trend, let alone a single example, is taken and extrapolated to the average.

Sure, I even said as much myself. I'm not claiming that the examples given are representative of the average. I'm saying ""here is some admittedly imperfect evidence that would lend support to this claim"". 

You can say ""that's imperfect evidence!"" and I'd agree with you. But if you aren't going to provide *anything* to demonstrate the opposite, most people would side with imperfect evidence over no evidence at all. 

&gt; I do not deny that women are disadvantaged at carrying or developing muscle, but there is nothing that suggests women are incapable of being qualified soldiers in modern warfare.

I'm not saying that women are incapable of being qualified soldiers in modern warfare. I don't think anyone did tbh.

I'm saying that they will not be *as* capable as their male counterparts, generally speaking. Again, there will be exceptions but the average man will make a better soldier than the average woman.

&gt; Speed and endurance, yes, but the importance of strength has clearly been greatly diminished. Being able to carry your weight, literally, is enough for modern warfare.

That's not true at all. Have you ever served in the armed forces? It's not just ""being able to carry your weight"" at all. Do you think soldiers don't have any equipment, or any need to transport or move any equipment at any time?

Now again, I agree that the need for strength has been diminished, I said so myself. But my point was that it is not absent, and as a result that is a factor that make men better soldiers (along with speed and endurance).

&gt; Yes, they are. VO2max is the common metric thrown around on this subject, and while women do have slightly lower VO2max on average, there is nothing which suggests women's endurance cannot keep up with men in an environment with strenuous activity.

I'm not even sure how you're getting here. You point out a common metric of endurance, admit that women generally are not as high in that metric, but then claim it doesn't actually matter?

So firstly let's just look at V02 max. To say women are ""slightly lower"" is a gross underestimation, the average woman has around 70-75% of the V02 max of the average man after puberty:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198313/#:~:text=The%20average%20gender%20difference%20in,male%20after%20puberty%20%5B4%5D.

Now let's look at how much it does actually matter. No person can operate at above 100% of their V02 max for any sustained period of time. The higher the figure, the higher level of intensity the body is capable of operating under for long periods of time.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10647532/

To pull a hypothetical out of my ass, if the average man can carry 100lbs for a distance of 1 mile, the average woman can only carry 70-75lbs for the same distance. If she attempts to carry the same weight over the same distance, she will either need to stop and rest several times, or will simply fail. 

The reason that V02 max is the common metric is because its the single biggest indicator of endurance. But what about other measures, like muscular endurance?

Well it turns out that boys and girls experience linear growth in muscular endurance up until 13, at which point boys generally enjoy a gigantic growth rate and girls do not.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endurance

By the time they reach 18 (the age were discussing here) the average difference in muscular endurance between men and women is massive.

To suggest that men and women have similar levels of endurance on average is to deny basic human biology. If you want to critique the individual sources be my guest, they're all found via 2-3 second Google searches because there's an *abundance* of literature on the subject and it's not really something that reasonable people even debate.

--------------------------------

Roalae_Ilsp @ 2022-03-31 18:47:43 :

&gt;But if you aren't going to provide anything to demonstrate the opposite, most people would side with imperfect evidence over no evidence at all. 

Women compete in sports at high levels, you already pointed out that women can be stronger than me, it's becoming increasingly popular (though still a huge minority) for women to workout for the sake getting stronger, women are already enlisted in the army and pass boot camp, and so forth. Even in your track cycling example, the women's records were still respectable times.

Your imperfect evidence demonstrates there is a difference between high level men's sports and high level female's sports. It does not demonstrate that men are so physically superior to men that women would be incapable of effectively serving in the military.

And while I appreciate you pointed it out as flawed, I'm not going to roll with it or be convinced by it just because you acknowledged that. 

&gt;I'm not saying that women are incapable of being qualified soldiers in modern warfare. I don't think anyone did tbh.

The thread is literally about women shouldn't be excluded from conscription. Many comments are saying women are unfit for war. I have responded to many of them. My comment you originally responded to was literally in response to someone arguing why women aren't conscripted.

If you respond to that, on a thread about whether women should or shouldn't be conscripted, and argue that women are substantially inferior to men, then I'm not sure why it wouldn't make sense to think you're arguing in favor of excluding women from conscription. 

&gt;It's not just ""being able to carry your weight"" at all. Do you think soldiers don't have any equipment, or any need to transport or move any equipment at any time?

&gt;To suggest that men and women have similar levels of endurance on average is to deny basic human biology.

I appreciate your sourcing, though I cannot check them right now. Even I could, I don't see a need to. Allow me to remind you of the text you quoted:

&gt;there is nothing which suggests women's endurance cannot keep up with men in an environment with strenuous activity.

Not only did I not suggest they have similar levels of endurance on average, in fact I suggested it was lower on average, but I also specified an environment with strenuous activity.

Meaning, in an environment where there is a minimum for what you need to be able to do, there is nothing to suggest women wouldn't be able to keep up with men. Specifically, in this instance, I do not see why women would be unable to keep up with men in meeting the physical demands of war time."	"Roalae_Ilsp @ 2022-03-31 21:49:30 :

The responses on here, yours included, are beginning to be very irritating so I'm unlikely to continue to respond.

My original comment was in response to someone arguing why women shouldn't be conscripted. You stepped in and began defending their points, specifically countering mine to them without declaring why. I don't mind if you see some interesting talking points and want to hash them out, but it shouldn't be very difficult to understand that I thought you were defending someone's points because you agree with them.

If you did make it clear beyond the last two comments, I apologize and I missed it. Having said that, once again, it shouldn't be hard to see why. 

&gt;Wait, so you mean literally carrying objects that total the same weight as your body? If so, that's an insanely high bar that the majority of women cannot meet. Hell, it's a high bar that a lot of men can't even reach.

&gt;This leads me to think you have literally never done anything resembling physical exercise in all honesty.


Yes, that was a poorly thought out statement. No, I have not literally ""never done anything resembling physical exercise"". 

&gt;First, there is no boot camp or training period in conscription. You are literally being taken as you are.


[Literally the first result for ""do drafted soldiers get training"". ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story%3Fid%3D875907&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOmP_Bo_H2AhUoHTQIHaSCD64QFXoECAEQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ETctTf0XZSwFAzBWNxdg3)

I'm not suggesting they get comprehensive training. I'm suggesting that if the training put forth is what the military deems to be the bare minimum for combat readiness, and if women can pass it, there's no reason to exclude them. 

&gt;Second, great that you mentioned boot camp as an example of how the average woman can keep up with the average man.

I did not intend to say women are keeping up with men in boot camp. If I said women are currently competing and showing compeltely even results, I was obviously grossly incorrect. What I intended was that clearly women can pass boot camp, so the potential for them to be physically capable is there. 

To me, I don't see any reason to believe women couldn't consistently pass boot camp with adequate training, especially as we better understand how our biological differences affect them through practice and how we can compensate for those differences by sex specific training.

Edit: to be clear, I am not insinuating you are making the statement women are incapable of passing boot camp. I understand you acknowledge women can pass boot camp and there are strong women out there. I am suggesting that current inequalities are likely inflated by many factors which are not controlled for, such as cultural ones, and that I do not believe women should e excluded from the draft or shouldn't join the military based on erratic results surrounding current bars of entry. 

&gt;Did you know that they actually reduced the entry requirements in order to admit more women on several occasions?

Did you know that they already changed entry requirements and physical standards based on age? The PFTs are not the sole determiner if you're a capable soldier or not. They're a great benchmark for what you're capable of and good goals for maintaining a minimum level of fitness, but we already delegate roles based on individual capabilities.

Even if women were, say, 70% as capable as men across the board even with adequate training, that doesn't make them liabilities or mean they wouldn't be useful in combat. 

Disclaimer: I understand that you're not arguing women are incapable of participating in te military and are instead arguing they shouldn't. To be clear, I am saying I don't think the difference means they shouldn't be in the military or should be excluded from the draft. 

&gt;You said they were ""slightly lower"" which was grossly underselling it, and even that was only after I called you out on saying they were ""on par"" which means equal to, or at the same level.

Yes, because I remember reading studies regarding athletes VO2max being only a 5-10% difference and I didn't see why that alone was such a significant difference that women *shouldn't*, not are incapable of, be conscripted. Your study suggested a different number, and I have not gotten around to reading it yet.

~~Once again, I believe I specified on par with men in a strenuous environment, not random people plucked off the street or peak athletes, and I believe I have made it explicitly clear multiple times that's with the requsite of adequate training.~~

Edit: I was confusing the comment you're referring to with another one I made. Yes, in my original comment I made the sweeping generalization that men and women are equal in endurance and mental acuity without specifying anything beyond that.

I've made it explicitly clear I'm referring to capability of being equal in an intensive environment with adequate training in many different comments. I apologize for my misleading wording and incorrect sweeping generalization in the original.

Slothjitzu @ 2022-04-01 07:29:15 :

&gt; My original comment was in response to someone arguing why women shouldn't be conscripted.

Yes, and as I already explained this is different to ""women should not or can not serve in the military"".

I'm not, and nobody I can find, is saying that women should not be allowed to serve in the military or are unable to do so. A lot of people *are* saying that women shouldn't be conscripted. 

Surely you can understand the difference right?

&gt; Yes, that was a poorly thought out statement. No, I have not literally ""never done anything resembling physical exercise"".

Cool, glad we agree. So in that case, what is your anecdotal experience of men and women in whatever exercise you have done? Do women tend to outcompete, or even keep up, with men?

Or, like every other physical activity in existence, do men generally tend to have greater success?

&gt; Literally the first result for ""do drafted soldiers get training"".

You understand that being conscripted during war-time is different to the draft in peace-time right? The OP is about conscription during war-time, not the draft in times of peace.

The training given in those two situations is *massively* different.

&gt; What I intended was that clearly women can pass boot camp, so the potential for them to be physically capable is there.

Sure, and we have had to lower the standards that we accept in order to make that possible, so this seems like a strange point to make.

You're making my point, that we have to try to make things easier in order for more women to participate. And *still* the average woman is unable to meet those requirements.

&gt; I do not believe women should e excluded from the draft or shouldn't join the military based on erratic results surrounding current bars of entry.

Again, two different things. I don't beleive women shouldnt join the military either. I do beleive that it doesnt make sense to include them in conscription during war-time. It just doesn't make sense.

Drafting men and not women and putting an age requirement (18-60) is the single quickest way of ensuring you get the highest quality recruits.

I could draft women, but then I lower the average talent pool. I could draft 14 year old and 70 year old guys too, but then that also lowers the average talent pool (obviously significantly more than women would of course). 

&gt; Did you know that they already changed entry requirements and physical standards based on age? 

Yes, and that was also a bad idea. I don't think ""old men are not as physically capable as young men in general, and younger candidates make better soldiers in general"" is a particularly controversial opinion. 

&gt; Even if women were, say, 70% as capable as men across the board even with adequate training, that doesn't make them liabilities or mean they wouldn't be useful in combat.

I wouldn't describe them as a liability, that's a bit far. I wouldn't describe them as useless either. Again, argue against what I'm saying, not whatever else you'd prefer to argue against.

What I would say, is that if women are 70% as capable as men across the board, they are literally not *as* useful as men and are *more* likely to become a liability.

This isn't a binary discussion of ""men good, women bad"" or ""men can be soldiers, women can't"" and you really not to stop addressing it this way.

Instead, address this:

Men make better soldiers in general, thanks almost entirely the clear physical advantages that come with being male. If any country needs an immediate influx of conscripted soldiers due to war, it makes more sense for all of those soldiers to be male.

If you disagree with that then cool, explain why. Stop saying ""but women can be soldiers too!"" when I am not saying that they can't.

&gt; Yes, because I remember reading studies regarding athletes VO2max being only a 5-10% difference and I didn't see why that alone was such a significant difference

""I remember seeing a study"" isn't sourcing something. Interesting you mention athletes though, considering that you earlier pointed out that athletes are irrelevant, because we're talking about the average person. 

Regardless, even if I just play along then you're still wrong. You don't think 5-10% is significant? That's *a lot*.

A 10% increase in someone's V02 max is absolutely significant, and the higher your V02 max is, the bigger the 10% figure is of course, but the harder it is to improve the number as well.

V02 max growth isn't linear. In order to train my V02 max I need to work at my max-rate on a regular basis for weeks on end. The higher it is, the slower that growth will be.

A 5-10% difference in elite athletes is the equivalent of *years* of dedicated training."

MY NEW VIEW: I now believe that there truly are people who exist outside the binary system. Perhaps a coincidence, they all identified as agender, which they calmly and eloquently explained as having no connection towards masculinity nor femininity. Unfortunately, of the 675+ comments this post received, the reasonable people made about 5 of them. The majority of people who I interacted with all mentioned that they had low self esteem, low confidence, and faced bullying in there lives. They appear to be using the NB identity to hide from their insecurities and blame them on society. They were unable to define their identity and frequently contradicted themselves and each other. Their arguments were disjointed, and generally focused on twisting the words from my arguments while avoiding the actual questions. How can you expect people to believe and to conform to your identity when it immediately crumbles under any criticism or skepticism? Your identity is not immediately valid because you claim it to be, and you are an asshole if you expect people, especially strangers to just trust you without explanation. Im sorry to the agender people and emo kids out there, you’re much more valid than most of the people who tried to argue with me today.

This schizo rant that started this nightmare:
————————————————————————————
So non-binary people claim that they are neither man nor woman, but something in between. “Gender expression” is very important to them. But what is gender expression? As far as I can tell, it’s just the clothes that they wear, their haircut, and some other accessories. These are all very superficial things. 

However, these fashion choices all point towards the same look. You know the type, neon hair, baggy clothes, usually a decent amount of piercings. It’s a specific enough style that you can pinpoint a non-binary person when you see one. You can also tell whether they’re a man or a woman. 

I can’t help but draw parallels to the scene kid phase of the 2000’s. A specific style that is a similar style regardless of gender. The swooping hair, black clothes, studded leather accessories. Once again, these are all very superficial, yet it was crucial to their identity at the time. 

They felt like outcasts and they formed an identity around their peers who also felt like outcasts. Remember that common phrase used to mock scene kids? “It’s not a phase mom!!!”. Seems like that phrase very much applies to the talking points non-binary people take now. 

The most grounded explanation for the validity of being non-binary is that we’ve found evidence of seemingly non-binary or trans people in ancient civilization. Most prominently, the “Two-spirited” identity found in Native Americans. 

But just because there’s remnants of it in older civilizations does not make it valid. Mayans cut people’s hearts out to appease the sun gods; native north/South Americans don’t exactly have a history of being pure and humanitarian, nor an advanced understatement of science.

There’s more I could say, but I’ll wrap it up here. I do not hate non-binary people, I just don’t believe they have some kind of magical exemption from the human binary. I think they are attracted to the fashion of it. As far as I can tell, non-binary is the modern day emo. If you want to be referred to as “they” that’s fine and I will do that for you. But pronouns are not an accessory that you can change when you feel like it. You can’t create your own, and you can’t expect people to abandon a lifetime use of a minor, unconscious part of the English language.

I’m pretty set in this belief, but I am genuinely curious if anybody has evidence to the contrary. If this truly runs deeper than fashion, and isn’t “just a phase”, I’d truly love to see it. But as it stands, I believe it’s a fashion trend that trailed behind the transgender movement to avoid criticism."	"AlwaysTheNoob @ 2022-04-09 22:10:21 :

Gender expression goes beyond clothes.  Women are expected to come across as passive, caring, nuturing, etc.  Men are expected to come across as strong, assertive, a bit surly, etc.

Gender expression isn't just about what you wear.  It's about how society expects you to behave.  People who identify as non-binary simply don't want to be labeled in one of those ways that traps them into certain behaviors.

--------------------------------

FreezingM00N @ 2022-04-09 22:27:18 :

I’ve met women who are strong and assertive and I’ve met men who are passive and nurturing. I fucking love snuggling with my cat. I have piercings. I like to drink rosé and fruity cocktails. They’re are feminine things that I enjoy. Society doesn’t disregard me as being “not a man” because of that.

Edit: btw beer is not a manly drink. It literally gives you tits. The notion that beer is a drink for manly men is a psyop to sell more of that pisswater

--------------------------------

AlwaysTheNoob @ 2022-04-09 22:49:08 :

Well then consider yourself lucky.  I've been on the end of decades of bullying for not being ""manly"" enough.  And I'm far from alone in that experience.

--------------------------------

Bas14ST @ 2022-04-10 08:49:19 :

No, but that's beside the point. Gender [identity] is not the same as gender expression, you can have any gender expression as any gender, but terms like ""man"" and ""woman"" have certain expectations and for some people these expectations are so crippling and connected with their gender that they reject the gender as a whole. This is completely valid but not the only reason why people are non-binary.

--------------------------------

dingdongdickaroo @ 2022-04-10 12:01:04 :

I think a lot of this shit is way over complicating the issue. I think a trans woman in saudia Arabia would still be trans, but I dont think nonbinary people would be nonbinary in saudia Arabia or anywhere else where it didnt come with social benefits

--------------------------------

njexocet @ 2022-04-10 16:39:47 :

well why else would you do it?  


She could of swam against the men in a womens uniform and still competed?  


I don't get it, nobody is saying trans people shouldn't get to compete, I just dont understand how an athlete or competitor can just decide they want to transition to compete against the other biological sex.   


This is the next step on the slippery slope

--------------------------------

Bas14ST @ 2022-04-10 16:45:53 :

She's not transitioning to compete against women, she's transitioning because she's trans. If she'd compete against men it'd be unfair to her. She's got less testosterone and she's competing against people of another gender. She's a woman so she should compete against women.

People transition because their trans and transitioning is the only way to treat gender dysphoria. It's absurd to think people transition to have better chances at winning in a sports.

--------------------------------

njexocet @ 2022-04-10 16:50:08 :

UNFAIR TO HER?  


She chose to transition, that was a choice, that she ELECETED to go through.   


Lia may feel, think, or believe she is a woman but she is not, she is a BIOLOGICAL man, who is transitioning.  


She has an unfair advantage against every other female she is competing against, although she is on HRT her testosterone levels are 5-20x of a normal female, that is not fair. Not only that but being born a man she grew, and developed, and went through puberty as a man, so even if her testosterone was regulated down to or below womens T levels, she would still have an unfair advantage.   


People used to seek therapy when they suffered from gender dysphoria but now it is celebrated. A similar thing has happened over last 10-20 years with obese and severely overweight people, it used to be ok to tell overweight people they were unhealthy, now it cannot be done.

--------------------------------

Bas14ST @ 2022-04-10 16:58:57 :

She's not a biological man. Her HRT biologically affects her body and anatomy. In sports, it's not ""normal females"" competing, but the cis women who already have an above average testosterone level and more muscular anatomy. Puberty does indeed complicate transitioning, but it's not irreversible. Why do people have this image of biology as a fixed, unchangeable thing¿ It's biology, not God."

First they complain about their gender ideologies saying they don’t get enough respect. But still you can sue, you can do something about it. Here justice system doesn’t even work so can’t sue and specially not for something like that. Gay people get zero respect and they can be discriminated against. Trans people are almost non existent. The LGBT community is seen as a joke.



They complain about the government and they may be corrupt, but not like ours. The government officials have illegal parties with narcos (recorded) and they protect the biggest cocaine labs in the Chapare. If you dare try say something you risk getting thrown in jail, killed or drown with internal taxes that come out of nowhere. Where in the US have you seen politicians partying with narcos? They can do whatever they want and no one can say other wise. 



Poverty is another one. A poor person from here is not the same as a poor person from the US. The minimal salary here is 2000bs which is less than 300$. You don’t see ‘poor’ people with Iphones and cars. They have to ration everything if they want to eat along with paying everything else.


Here education (unless you were in a private school) is terrible and they fill you with political lies. The books are about our ex-president and they have festivities only for the current political party. Since kids they brainwash them. Would you say it is possible to do the same in the US? I don’t think so. People would complain and riot. The media would talk about it. Again you can do something about it. 



The justice system is non existent. The winner is the one who has more money. All the judges are bought and if you try to do it the right way, you lose the trial. 


Basically all public services have to be bought if you want them to work. Police, health care and schools. I’m having a hard time seeing how the US could be comparable to my country in any aspect."	"coberh @ 2022-07-09 16:04:00 :

This isnt just one internet post I see it everywhere it's the reason behind the groomer nonsense and the don't say gay bill, the idea that speaking about these things is inherently sexual. 

The biggest issue I find is that largely this logic is withheld from heterosexual things libs of tik tok will upload a video of a teacher saying they're gay to their students is horrific but they'd never upload a video of a teacher saying they were getting married to their students, or a video of a clearly pregnant teacher even though those things both imply sex just as much as a gay teacher would.

The ratio of available media that includes romance overwhelmingly and disproportionately displays heterosexual romance, and it isn't even close.

Once again obviously there gonna show heterosexual romance more often then not considering it is standard practice for a man and woman to be together.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-08 05:09:16 :

&gt;it is standard practice for a man and woman to be together.

Why is this standard? 

&gt;Not saying being gay is a bad thing but it’s not necessarily conventional.

What makes something ""conventional?""

&gt;I never said anything offended

That is certainly the tone of your comment ""being forced"" in everything when you concede it actually is relatively rare. Which is it?

Is it also unconventional or non-standard to be black or Jewish?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-08 05:22:33 :

Why is it standard practice? Well let’s see since the beginning of time men and woman have been in relationships together to have children and so on. Something conventional is something that is a standard practice. I wouldn’t say that being gay is really a standard practice worldwide. And the last thing you said is just fucking stupid. Who said anything about black or Jewish people? What does that have to do with this?

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-08 13:01:59 :

&gt;Well let’s see since the beginning of time men and woman have been in relationships together to have children and so on.

Since the beginning of time, humans have had same sex relationships for love and companionship and so on.

&gt;Something conventional is something that is a standard practice.

So why is heterosexuality standard practice?

&gt;I wouldn’t say that being gay is really a standard practice worldwide.

Why not?

&gt;Who said anything about black or Jewish people? What does that have to do with this?

You're implying that something not being a majority characteristic means it isn't standard. If being gay isn't standard, does that mean being black isn't either?

Do you really believe homosexuality didn't exist until the 50s or whatever?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-08 17:36:22 :

Since the beginning of time people probably were in same sex relationships but the majority was definitely straight relationships considering we got to where we are at today. That doesn’t just happen without reproducing. 

Why is heterosexual standard practice? Do I even actually have to explain this? Other then the fact that the majority of people world wide are straight. I wouldn’t consider being gay a standard practice because it isn’t the common norm. It’s the common norm for a man and woman to be together.

Once again your last statement really just doesn’t make sense. Obviously being black isn’t not standard. It’s not fucking 1880. And no obviously there have been gay people since before the 50s lmao. I like how you try to had race in there though to stir things up. Another thing a lot of people do these days because I guess they feel like they have to. Pretty much the same as the kiss in this movie

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 12:12:04 :

So again.

You say standard or normal is majority behavior.

You say race, despite being non-majority, is normal or standard.

You keep saying I'm not making sense, but your entire position is internally contradictory.

Which is it? If being gay isn't normal because it isn't majority then how can being black be normal despite not being majority? You obviously aren't sharp enough to understand the prejudice you apply toward sexual orientation is identical to racial prejudice. That's why you can't explain why majority is both normal and non normal. If a gay kiss is not normal then your logic requires interracial kisses to be not normal as well and you should have the same attitude toward race as you do sexual orientation. Either you can't admit your position is flawed or you simply refuse to actually explain your issue with these groups. 

I think you're embarrassed that you walked into a position where you have to justify racism to justify homophobia but you don't want to admit that so you says it doesn't make sense

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 17:56:00 :

Dude your actually fucking stupid if your gonna compare this to being black. That actually makes no viable sense at all. And yes standard or normal is majority behavior. Is that not just common sense? And my views towards racial prejudice is the same as sexual orientation? You don’t even fucking know me don’t put words into my mouth. What are you even talking about saying I have problems with interracial kisses too? Who the hell ever said that? No one did until you had to bring up race for pretty much no reason other then to try and “expose” me or something I guess. I don’t even know where you came up with that or why but your seriously lacking in some mental capacity. I’m not embarrassed about shit you just can’t back anything up your saying you clown and now accusing me of being racist.  Just laughable at this point. Lol and go figure you mainly just post about politics. I guess I answered my own question on why you had to randomly bring up race

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 18:54:26 :

&gt;Dude your actually fucking stupid if your gonna compare this to being black.

If it is so stupid, why can't you explain why your position isn't internally contradictory?

&gt;That actually makes no viable sense at all.

It makes no sense because you've established a contradictory worldview where ""things majority of people are"" = normal=standard. So when I point out that a majority of people are not black and would not be considered ""normal"" in your view, you get confused because you can't fathom how your understanding of normality is flawed enough to engender racism. This is called cognitive dissonance. It happens to everyone. 

&gt;And yes standard or normal is majority behavior.

So you consider immutable characteristics to be forms of behavior?

&gt;Is that not just common sense?

Common sense is an excuse people use when they have no reasoning to offer. It is a rhetorical strategy to avoid critical thinking.

Are you wrong because of common sense? No. You're wrong because you consider sexual orientation to be a behavior and you're wrong because you fail to explan why certain people should be excluded from representation because there are more people with other characteristics, even though they are overrepresented.

&gt;You don’t even fucking know me don’t put words into my mouth.

I know what you've said which is majority = normal. That means you cannot believe both that and thar being black is normal. Either majority =/= normal and your argument is bad or it does and your argument engenders racism. Which is it?

&gt;What are you even talking about saying I have problems with interracial kisses too?

You have an issue with people who are not in the majority (normal) kissing on screen. Black people are not in the majority, therfore you have an issue with them kissing on screen.

Can you explain why one non-majority group kissing on screen is acceptable while another isn't?

&gt;Who the hell ever said that?

You said being out of the majority is not normal or standard and that is why a group shouldn't be represented on screen. It seems like you didn't entirely think about your reasoning before taking that position so now you're upset that you took a position about how non-majority people shouldn't be represented.

&gt;No one did until you had to bring up race for pretty much no reason other then to try and “expose” me or something I guess. 

I've clearly explained the relationship between race and sexual orientation. You argue non-normal people shouldn't be represented on screen because they are not normal. You argue normality is ""majority characteristics."" Race is subject to the same divisional scheme. If you subscribe to your own argument, you cannot consider black people to be normal.

Since you don't repudiate your position on normality even when confronted with criticism, I assume you maintain it for all characteristics, not just sexual orientation. Feel free to clarify.

&gt;I don’t even know where you came up with that

Well that's because you didn't read my comments which clearly explain this.

&gt;but your seriously lacking in some mental capacity.

A. It's ""you're.""

B. I'm not the one who can't read and apply. Seriously, I am just repeating myself. You should be embarrassed that you can't figure this out when I lay it out for you.

&gt;’m not embarrassed about shit 

If you weren't embarrassed, you wouldn't be so combative and unresponsive. It's simple enough to say ""yeah that is a bad way to understand normality or how we should treat people."" But instead you cry about how you don't understand while looking at an explanation. Do I need to drop my writing down a few levels for you or something?

&gt;you just can’t back anything up your saying you clown and now accusing me of being racist.

If you want, I can give you line by line quotes of my comments that provide all the supporting evidence and reasoning for my argument. I'm game. This would be so much easier of you just defended your position instead of complaining about how the position you took engenders racism. I get it, you don't like the possibility that you might have said something racist. You know what the dumbest thing to do in that situation is? Cry about it instead of explaining your reasoning.

Just explain why majority is normal and how you can take that position without calling racial minorities not normal. How hard is that?

It's actually pretty hard because that is a terrible position to take. I'd just abandon it if I were you.

&gt;I guess I answered my own question on why you had to randomly bring up race

How hilarious is it that you can't even give yourself accurate answers?

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 18:59:46 :

I’m not wasting my time reading this whole thing. The kiss in this movie was pretty unnecessary and many people agree with that. Idk why you keep trying to put race into it. No one on here has said shit about that until you. You should be embarrassed for putting so much effort into this for pretty much no reason. Your a god damn moron. Keep bringing up race to every conversation when you got nothing else to say.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 19:39:26 :

&gt;I’m not wasting my time reading this whole thing.

That's exactly why you can't figure this out. The answers are right in your face, you simply refuse to look at them because being wrong makes you uncomfortable. If you didn't know you were wrong, you have a response other than throwing a tantrum. People who know they are right can defend their argument. You only bear characteristics of someone who knows they made a mistake - name-calling, feigning ignorance, refusing to examine the argument. 

&gt;The kiss in this show was pretty unnecessary and many people agree with that.

There is a difference between kissing being unnecessary and gay couples kissing being unnecessary. This is the latter. No one would have batted an eye at a straight couple, which is indicative of prejudice. The failure of any of these people to fault heterosexual interactions in animated films is also indicative of prejudice.

In essence these people feel it was unnecessary because they don't like gay people, not because they don't like kissing. 

&gt;Idk why you keep trying to put race into it.

Why do you keep saying you don't know? The information is right here, you just refuse to read it. It's not that the information isn't avaliable, you just prefer not to have it.

&gt;No one on here has said shit about that until you

If you exercised just one of your brain cells and read my comments, the relationship would be clear.

You sure complain a lot about not understanding something that has a explanation in print in your hands that you admittedly refuse to read.

New rule: don't say you don't understand when you refuse to read the explanation.

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:10:45 :

A gay kiss shouldn’t be in a kids movie. Not much more reasoning behind it. It’s a bit weird and forced very obviously

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:14:33 :

There is no reasoning here, just a claim.

Weird and forced are opinions. We can't establish either are true.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:15:45 :

Then maybe find another subreddit if you don’t wanna hear peoples “opinions”

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:24:04 :

No thanks. Literally the first rule of this sub is that you have to *explain your reasoning.* Opinions must have a basis in reason. ""I just think it's weird"" isn't a reason.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:24:48 :

Your accusations aren’t a reason either

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:25:33 :

I've provided reasoning for my argument. You are welcome to address those reasons at any time.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:25:55 :

Accusations aren’t an argument

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:30:08 :

An argument is a claim and a warrant. If an accusation (claim) is warranted with reasoning, it is, by definition, an argument. 

For example, if you said I live in my parents' basement. That isn't an argument. If you said, you live in your parents' basement because you visited me there this morning, that would be an argument. 

Conversely, if I said that someone who thinks its weird for two parents of the same sex to kiss in a kids movie, but not if they are a different sex; that would be evidence of homophobia: that would be an argument even if it was an accusation.

But  not that smart, so what do I know?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:31:58 :

Yeah your not smart. That doesn’t back up anything besides an opinion

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:33:33 :

Exactly. The evidence doesn't do anything besides back up my claim, as is its function. I think you accidentally figured out what an argument is. I follow the evidence, not feelings of weirdness.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:34:59 :

Claim? What even is your claim besides bitching about what I say

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:37:29 :

You might figure that out if you go read all the comments you refused to read.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:39:26 :

I did read most of it unfortunately. Still doesn’t seem like much a claim to me

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:43:15 :

How so? Is it not a complete sentence? What elements are missing for it to be a claim?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:45:57 :

Your all over the fucking place with what your saying. Stick to a claim and go from there maybe

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 21:51:26 :

Asking a clarifying question means I'm all over the place?

How am I not sticking to my argument by asking why you don't think the claim contained with in ""isn't much of one,"" whatever that means?

Your comment doesn't even say anything that has meaning to anyone besides you. How could anyone not be all over the place when dealing with such vacuous comments?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 21:54:02 :

Because dude I’m done explaining shit to you. If you want an explanation go into your PMs where I destroyed you for 40 minutes. Your bringing so much shit up that doesn’t even pertain to this post. Just accept that your view isn’t the same as a lot of people

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 22:06:42 :

The problem is that you aren't explaining things, as I've repeatedly said.

I fully agree my view is different. There are many different views about how non-majority people should be treated in inferior ways to majority people throughout the history of this country. The major difference is that my view comes from the perspective that people being different or ""weird"" doesn't mean they are bad or wrong or should be prohibited from the view of children or anyone. I challenge contrary views to provide reasoning why they feel people different from them should be treated differently. You have failed to meet that challenge and have only the proposition that gay kissing is weird to justify your view. When pressed on why you feel it is weird, you refuse to explain and lash out with insults. Accordingly, I would assume people who think gay kissing should be kept from screens due to weirdness feel ot is weird because they are irrationally hostile toward homosexuality.  This isn't an unreasonable conclusion. 

If I said it was weird to have two interracial parents to give a brief peck in a kids movie to show they are a loving couple, but not weird to have the same with white parents; it would be reasonable to conclude that feeling of weirdness is the result of bigotry, conscious or not.

&gt;where I destroyed you for 40 minutes.

You must have some self esteem issues if you need to depict your lobbing insults and profanities for 40 minutes instead of offering a warranted argument to be the destruction of anything but your credibility and ethos.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 22:21:40 :

Never called anyone weird. I literally just said that it’s weird to have a gay kiss in a kids movie which many people agree with. If that’s homophobic in your eyes then you need some counseling or something. And once again your bringing race in for no apparent reason other then the fact that it links people being different in your eyes. And I did destroy you for 40 minutes. You didn’t say shit to defend what I said to you or really answered anything I said to you for that matter and just kept repeating what you’ve already said on here 5 times

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 23:03:19 :

&gt;I literally just said that it’s weird to have a gay kiss in a kids movie which many people agree with.

Is it weird because ot hasn't been done before and is novel or because your opinion of homosexuality is negative and weird is the only way to describe that that doesn't reveal bigotry?

&gt;If that’s homophobic in your eyes 

It's homophobia by definition. Having an irrational negative feeling about something is 100% phobic. This isn't a question of opinion. Either the negative feeling is rational or not. If rational, it requires an explanation that also isn't based in a negative opinion on homosexuality. 

&gt;And once again your bringing race in for no apparent reason other then the fact that it links people being different in your eyes

So the exact reason I brought it up? There is no difference between this and having a problem with an interracial kiss. Both are based in bigotry, which is my point.

If I said interracial kisses are weird and should be kep from children, that would be the same bigotry.

&gt;You didn’t say shit to defend what I said to you

I certainly did, you admittedly refused to read it and never responded to it.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 23:08:48 :

It’s homophobic by definition? Give me a definition then. I never said anything about gay kisses or characters in other movies just this one which is once again a children’s movie which makes it so weird. So stop making yourself feel so good. I never said a thing negative about homosexuality 

The interracial kiss has nothing to do with this. I’m sure there’s plenty of people who would’ve rather seen two black people kiss in this movie then two gay people. 

And no you didn’t literally look back to your PM’s. You barely responded to anything I said at all. And not too sure what I didn’t respond to? Pretty much fucking everything.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 23:32:27 :

An irrational aversion to something is a phobia.

&gt;I never said a thing negative about homosexuality 

You said it was weird to have a gay kiss in this movie, but didn't explain why. Never in the history of the world has anyone complained about two straight parents kissing in a movie to establish the nature of their relationship. Your post history is silent of such complaints despite numerous animated and live action features including benign kisses by two parents. It's only weird because it's not straight which is a negative position on homosexuality. 

&gt;I’m sure there’s plenty of people who would’ve rather seen two black people kiss in this movie then two gay people. 

A. Two black people kissing isn't interracial really.

B. That is still homophobic because it suggests homosexuality is less or not appropriate than other immutable characteristics. 

&gt;You barely responded to anything I said at all.

Well yeah, most of it was insults directed at me which warrant no response. If you think there was something worthwhile in there that you want a response to, please ask or present the argument again.

&gt;And not too sure what I didn’t respond to?

You haven't provided reasoning for your position. You have said it is ""weird"" therefore it shouldn't be in the movie. You don't explain why it is weird other than you and others personally find it to be, which isn't rational therefore it is phobic.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-11 23:40:29 :

For the 100th time I explained that the kiss was weird because it’s in a CHILDRENS movie. Do I need to spell it out anymore? There’s no negative components of homosexuality just me expressing why I think it’s unnecessary. 

Most of what I said to you was insults? Do you expect to come at me with accusations putting words in my mouth and have me not react? I’m not here to be your fucking friend. I’m telling you what my view is.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-11 23:54:26 :

&gt;For the 100th time I explained that the kiss was weird because it’s in a CHILDRENS movie.

Also for the 100th time.

That isn't an explanation. You have still not explained WHY this is ""weird.""

And it's totally not weird. Kids sometimes have parents, sometimes gay parents, who kiss in front of them. This is virtually universal among children with parents. Kissing is also, virtually universally, an act of affection. A brief peck between parents IN A KID'S MOVIE to illustrate the nature of their relationship is not only not weird, it is super common in kid's movies. So not only does your position not contain any supporting reasoning, it doesn't even make sense as a position. In what world is ""parents modestly kissing"" not present in virtually every kid's movie with a family dynamic or backstory to give you a clue to that kid's upbringing or the relationship of their parents? You've had literally days to think about the reasoning behind that view and the best you can offer is ""kid's don't need to see parents showing affection in movies because it is inexplicably weird?""

Hopefully, you can see why that position is not remotely believable or even coherent and why affectionate parents in kid's movies is becoming an issue *now* at the exact moment when the affectionate parents happened to be queer is far too much of a coincidence to be acceptable without a detailed set of reasons beyond ""this is weird in this space because I say so?""

So let's hear it. Why is it too weird for parents to show affection by modestly kissing to be presented to children, who are already regularly exposed to that kind of behavior and wouldn't exist without it?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 02:33:09 :

Yes it is a reason. You just refuse it to be a reason. Its not weird for parents to kiss or show affection in front of children but in this instance it was. You can think whatever you want at this point it’s clear this conversation is going nowhere.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 12:14:50 :

Even if you think it is a reason, which it is not because it is not a rationale, the lack of a rationale means it is not rationale. That your reason is not rational definitively confirms this view is homophobic as a phobia is an *irrational* aversion.

&gt;Its not weird for parents to kiss or show affection in front of children but in this instance it was.

And why is that? You're so close. Why do you refuse to answer this question? It's obvious you think it is weird because it is homosexual, not because it is parental affection. Why are you so afraid of admitting that?

&gt;You can think whatever you want at this point it’s clear this conversation is going nowhere.

And again, it's going nowhere because you refuse to defend your view with any reasoning.

Fuck sake, I give you a host of actual reasons why this is not only not weird, it is super common. You even agree it is common, except in this instance, but you can't explain why this is any different.

This is why your view isn't remotely believable. It constitutes an inept excuse to cover homophobia. If your view wasn't based on an irrational aversion to homosexuality, you would be able to provide a reason that was rational.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 16:19:05 :

My reasons aren’t rationale but yours are because you think your right. You’ve failed to say anything rationale yourself that convinces me your right. Read through half this post and see what more people have to say on there view and who’s it matches closer too. You even said yourself that gay stuff was often sprinkled in media just because but you didn’t have a problem with it. If you agree with that but can’t even think a second to somewhat understand my view and just jump to homophobia there isn’t much to say besides your either the most close minded person their is or just a straight up hypocrite who thinks their always right.

Yes it’s weird because it’s a homosexual kiss in a kids movie. I’ve already repeated that time and time again so don’t sit there thinking you discovered that. But yeah I know it’s super homophobic that me along with millions of others didn’t wanna see that while taking our kids. You give me a host of bullshit reasons that you keep repeating and serve no relevance. It’s funny you say my view isn’t believable when you’ve actually fucking repeated yourself constantly with opinions and act like there rationale facts. On top of going off topic on this non stop. Bringing up interracial kisses is defiantly rationale to bring up while talking about a gay kiss right? Even when the two have nothing to do with each other or in this instance at least.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 16:46:35 :

&gt;You’ve failed to say anything rationale yourself that convinces me your right. 

You've already agreed that parents kissing in front of children is extremely common, which means it isn't weird. You agree that I am right that parents kissing modestly in kid's movies isn't weird. That discussion is over. Your reasoning is gone. You say this particular instance is an exception for zero reasons. The only possible discernable reason is because it involves a couple. If so, that is homophobic. End of story.

You provide no alternative other than that you are homophobic. 

&gt;Read through half this post and see what more people have to say on there view and who’s it matches closer too. 

I see a lot of people without any reasoning for their view, just like you. 

&gt;Yes it’s weird because it’s a homosexual kiss in a kids movie.

Game. Set. Match. Homophobic. Indisputable. 

&gt;I know it’s super homophobic that me along with millions of others didn’t wanna see that while taking our kids.

You could have just acknowledged you are a homophobe from the beginning and this would have been much easier. My accusation was true all along.

&gt;You give me a host of bullshit reasons

Parents are affectionate in front of kids is bullshit. TIL. You don't even give a reason for you view and have finally conceded I'm right that your reason is irrational aversion to gay people. 

&gt;act like there rationale facts.

Parents show affection in front of kids, even gay parents. That is a fact. It is indisputable. You are simply wrong to suggest that is uncommon or strange to show to kids. You don't dispute this.

&gt;On top of going off topic on this non stop

You've proven my reasoning was 100% pertinent by conceding homophobia. You rely on the same irrational aversion that is racism. Your bigotry is indistinguishable from the illogic of racism. If anyone said it was weird to show black people in kid's movies was weird because they are black, we would rightly call them racist bigots. Replace black with gay = homophobia. Bigotry.

&gt;Bringing up interracial kisses is defiantly rationale to bring up while talking about a gay kiss right?

People who don't like black people based on irrational aversion = racists. People who don't like gay people based on irrational aversion = homophobes. How pathetic is it that an alleged black man doesn't understand bigotry?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 16:47:55 :

Lmao fuck this dude your not even answering half my questions. And once again I’m being a smart ass when saying I’m homophobic. Poor social cues I see? I already explained everything you’ve said and you didn’t say shit about being the hypocrite you are. Feel defeated much? You only respond to what you feel like or what you have a response for. Your fucking speechless for half of what I say

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 16:52:05 :

You admitted you are a homophobe. That is all I needed. I was right that you are a bigot all along and your tantrums from being accused of homophobia were unjustified.

The only thing you've explained is that you think we should treat people differently based on their sexual orientation. This is the same logic that justifies racism, which was my point about racis.racism. You've proven every aspect of my arguments true.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 16:54:02 :

I didn’t admit to shit you just see it as that because you lack necessary brain cells. You still haven’t said anything about you admitting that some gay stuff is sprinkled into movies just because but you have no problem with it. So you can justify that but not see how some people would find that uncomfortable? But if they do that means their automatically homophobic. Your points make no sense. You are closed minded that’s the conclusion I came to. And a hypocrite

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 16:58:42 :

&gt;I didn’t admit to shit

You absolutely admitted this is weird because it is a gay couple. That means you lied about it being about a kiss. It was because it is a gay kiss. You have a double standard. Straight kisses are acceptable, gay kisses are not. A double standard, which you present as your position, is bigotry. You are a homophobe by your own admission. You provide no reasons why treating hsy people different isn't homophobic.

&gt;You still haven’t said anything about you admitting that some gay stuff is sprinkled into movies just because but you have no problem with it.

Why would I care about gay people in movies any more than black people? Who is harmed by having to see that different people exist? I'm not a homophobe,  so why would I care?

&gt;So you can justify that but not see how some people would find that uncomfortable?

You find it uncomfortable *because* you are homophobic. You have an irrational aversion to gay people. If I said I was uncomfortable with black people in a movie, that would be racist!

&gt;But if they do that means their automatically homophobic.

Literally what homophobia is! Irrational aversion. If you have no rationale why you don't like the existence of gay people in society or media, you're a homophobe!

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 17:00:35 :

Keep avoiding the question. Your a closed minded hypocrite. At least I explain what you throw at me but you can’t. That’s a fact

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 17:02:48 :

What is your question? I answered every question you asked.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 17:03:55 :

You admitted that gay stuff is sprinkled in media and are okay with it. But you can’t see how some people might be fed up or not like it in a kids movie? Your a hypocrite

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 17:12:06 :

Yes, gay people are in the media. It doesn't bother me because I don't have an aversion to people who have different immutable characteristics.

Similarly, black people are in the media. It doesn't bother me because I don't have an aversion to people who have different immutable characteristics.

There is no difference in logic between racism and homophobia. Being upset because other people have different immutable characteristics is bigotry.

&gt;But you can’t see how some people might be fed up or not like it in a kids movie?

Yes, they don't like it because they are bigots. I can see that some people are hateful and/or irrational. No one made them see the movie or show it to their kids. No one is harmed by gay or black people appearing in movies. Their aversion is irrational, therefore is bigotry. If they weren't bigots, they wouldn't be so upset.

&gt;Your a hypocrite

How so?

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 17:14:16 :

Dude stop bringing black people into this. You racist too? And once again I’m not even upset I was just stating my view because that’s what this subreddit is. Your a hypocrite because you admitted that gay stuff is added in media just because and you can’t even fathom your mind to see the other view that people didn’t wanna see that in a cartoon.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 17:29:57 :

&gt;Dude stop bringing black people into this.

I will stop when you acknowledge that if you change ""gay"" to ""black"" your view would be racist.

Right now. If someone believes black people should not be kissing on screen because they are black, they are racist. Yes or no?

&gt;I was just stating my view because that’s what this subreddit is.

This subreddit is not ""stare your view"" but ""change my view."" Rule A is to provide reasoning behind your view, I've consistently presses you to do that but the best you can do is ""this is weird."" You concede kissing isn't weird, just that gay people are. Using the racism parallel should get you to rethink your logic, but instead of addressing the logic of your bigotry, you simply complain that your homophobia is being compared to racism accurately. Somehow you lack the sympathy to understand the struggle of minorities that aren't yours.

&gt;you can’t even fathom your mind to see the other view that people didn’t wanna see that in a cartoon.

I sure can. I can fathom that someone who hates black people wouldn't want to see them on TV represented positively. That doesn't mean that is justifiable bigotry.

You are welcome to offer a reason why someone who doesn't think [minority] should be kissing on screen, but [non-minority] should be isn't a bigot.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 17:36:47 :

Yes but we’re no talking about black people in this movie. And why blacks? Why not Jews or Mexican or Asians? Why you gotta keep saying blacks? Your me calling me homophobic with no evidence besides me not liking the kiss but you keep calling out black people and it’s okay? That’s definitely not racism at all. What do you not understand. You’ve provided no reasoning besides shitty opinions you keep bringing up. At least I say what’s true and you just don’t wanna accept that fact. Your racist and a hypocrite

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 17:48:40 :

&gt;Yes but we’re no talking about black people in this movie. 

It's no different than if we were. Bigotry is bigotry. Double standards are double standards. Homophobia and racism have the same logic - you don't like someone because of who they are and think they should be treated differently. In this case that gay parents shouldn't be in kid's movies. Why not limit ethnic minorities from kid's movies too since racists think that's weird? As long as someone thinks an immutable characteristic is weird, we don't put that kind of person in movies!

&gt;And why blacks? Why not Jews or Mexican or Asians?

Take your pick. Doesn't matter to my argument. The logic for any of this bigotry is identical to the logic of your bigotry toward gay people.

If you had the same view about gay people of any ethnic group, you'd be a racist. 

&gt;You’ve provided no reasoning

Please explain how my analysis of the parallels of kinds of bigotry isn't reasoning.

Why is someone a racist for holding an identical view as yours about an ethnic group, but not a homophobe for holding that view about a gay person?

&gt; At least I say what’s true and you just don’t wanna accept that fact.

What have you said that is true? You lied about parents kissing being weird to later admit it was only because they were gay.

If opposing black folks is movies is racist then opposing gay people in movies is homophobic.

&gt;Your racist and a hypocrite

I'm literally the only one in this conversation who doesn't subscribe to a form of bigotry. You are a homophobe, by your own admission. I'm the one disputing the racist logic underlying your bigotry.

--------------------------------

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 17:53:08 :

You very evidently keep calling out black people. You haven’t mentioned anything other then them which draws me to a conclusion that you are a racist. 

I didn’t lie about shit. I don’t think it’s weird for parents to kiss or gay parents but in a kids movie it is. I already fucking “admitted” that like a day ago. Once again don’t make yourself feel so good.

I’m a homophobe by my own admission lol? How is that? When I’ve been stating that I’ve been saying it how you have to mock you and to be a smartass. Your social cues are fucking horrible. No wonder you’ve been arguing with me on here for a full day. Definitely should look for a girlfriend or someone that is attracted to racist hypocrites

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 18:06:14 :

&gt;You very evidently keep calling out black people.

How so, what have I called out about black people other than noting that racism against them follows the same logic as homophobia?

&gt;You haven’t mentioned anything other then them which draws me to a conclusion that you are a racist. 

So your argument is that mentioning the existence of a prominent minority is bigotry against that minority group? 

So if you say ""gay kiss"" or ""Asians"" in one of your comments, that means you are both a racist an a homophobe?

&gt;I don’t think it’s weird for parents to kiss or gay parents but in a kids movie it is.

Hold up. Are you saying it is weird for *any parents* to kiss in kids movies or just gay parents? If just gay parents, how is that not a double standard? Why should we treat two groups differently? Are we justified in allowing only white parents to kiss in films because racists would otherwise find it weird?

If any parents kissing, why is the outrage only happening now?

&gt;How is that?

You think we should treat gay people differently than straight people. The former should not be allowed in these movies on the basis that you have an irrational aversion to them.

&gt;Definitely should look for a girlfriend or someone that is attracted to racist hypocrites

I assume this is projection as your own ridiculous definition of racism makes you a racist.

You said that like the 5th time you've said you're done. Another lie.

It's no wonder you can't figure out something as simple as bigotry when you think the mere mention that black people exist is racism. Now, in order not to be racist, we have to pretend a group doesn't exist? You'd have to be brain dead to arrive at such a conclusion.

After all of this, it really was simply that you don't like gay people and think they shouldn't be represented equally. Next time just say you are a bigot and save us both the trouble of wrapping what that is around your head."	"Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 18:54:07 :

&gt;Oh you mean like how you’ve repeated yourself 5 times?

Like I said. This was also a lie.

I'll repeat myself until you sufficiently reconcile the disparities in your reasoning or concede that your reasoning is rooted in bigotry.

&gt;Why do you keep talking.

Because that is what this sub is about. Challenging views. Why are you talking after lying about being done talking? Do you not value honesty? If you don't want to talk, then don't. I'm not making you. You staked your view and now you refuse to resolve the rationale behind it because that requires either changing your view or admitting bigotry. Both are uncomfortable and I understand that feeling. Refusing to do either, though, causes the most cognitive dissonance because you are holding contradictory ideas.

&gt;Grow the fuck up and stop arguing with people online when your a narrow minded prick who’s obviously not gonna change their mind.

I told you what would change my mind. You not only failed to provide reasoning for your view that isn't rooted in bigotry, you confirmed my view that yours is rooted in bigotry by demonstrating you prefer to treat gay and straight representation with different standards. It's no different than racial segregation. One set of rules for straight, an inferior set for LGBT. Straight parents get to kiss in kid's media, LGBT parents don't. No different than banning black parents from kissing in kid's media but not white. We don't ban black folks from TV because it makes racists feel weird, do we? Why would you do it to gay parents for the same reason in you weren't a bigot?

I'm willing to change my mind if you can demonstrate that double standard has a rational basis that isn't discriminatory.

You on the other hand, are so closed minded that you won't even acknowledge the parallels to racism, despite acknowledging that the same situation would be racist if we were talking about any ethnic minorities. All you can do is demand I stop making this parallel, but you can't explain why it isn't a parallel. You say it isn't without explanation. 

&gt;Just fuck off already so we can both go about our days

You have two options. Either engage my debate or stop lying about being done.

You could end this very easily by saying ""yes, I acknowledge that my view is homophobic because it constitutes treating people in inferior ways based on their homosexuality. And yes, I acknowledge that this would be racist if I held a similar view of an ethnic minority.""

We both know you could say that 100% truthfully.

dj_haze23 @ 2022-07-12 19:10:02 :

I wanna end this but it almost seems like I can’t because you continuously put words into my mouth. You must really worship yourself and what you say. I’m not acknowledging anything because there’s nothing to acknowledge besides in your own pea brain. Your racist and hypocritical geezer. That just kinda sums it up. I’d recommend professional help or maybe medication. A girl wouldn’t be bad either. Take care

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-07-12 19:20:00 :

I'll take that as a concession. You refuse to provide rationale for your view. You refuse to reconcile the problems with the irrational reasons you provide. You refuse to engage the discussion without hurling insults. Most of all, you offer nothing to satisfy the open questions here that would change my view. That tells me the answers would definitively support my view. That you will scurry away instead of addressing the glaring holes in your reasoning is sufficient to determine the answer is bigotry, which was my view.

The unfortunate problem for you is that your attitude justifies racism. If someone said or did something racist to you, how would you have room to complain when you subscribe to bigotry also? Who is going to care that bigotry was inflicted upon you when you would inflict it upon others for the exact same irrational reasons? No one. That means every time the word racism comes out of your mouth, you are a hypocrite."

I think that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is being empowered by the shitty state of human mind in the 21st century, especially the late 2010s and the 2020s decade.

And it's getting worse over time with crap like TikTok and corporate greed of increasingly tighter community guidelines of every website. You know who else is such an idol? Putin. No wonder people idolize crappy politicians if their own media surrounding promotes making an idol for oneself (not being xtian here, just making a statement). 

I think that this is the ""frog boiling"" paradigm. There are plenty of microscopic events which while inconsequential, eventually accumulate to make humans gradually dumber and more degraded.

""Russia has had a history of ""strong"" and dogmatic leaders,""

To me that's ironically the reversal because world has been progressing towards peace and that's exactly why it doesn't convince me that Russia had a ""history of leaders"".

Plenty of countries have ideas about taking land from a neighbouring country because of some historical reason but they don't act on them, because peace, trade, life, and sustenance are a lot more important and are actually needed for human development. Russia decided to think it is the exception. So in my head, some other external process opened a can of worms that was normally sealed.

And ""degradation is a Nazi talking point"" is a ""Hitler breathed oxygen"" argument because it doesn't explain inherently why using degradation as argument is bad, just that ""Nazis used it to gain power"" and nothing else. Ironically I think one of items of modern degradation is ""everyone I don't like is Hitler/Stalin/etc."" - it is a cheap throw that really doesn't mean anything when you examine it.

you didnt understand my nazi point, the ""western culture is going too far"" is a talking point of oligarchy so that people let go of their rights in favour of a fake sense of order and safety. 

It was first used by the nazis but its a tool used by power all over the world no matter their ideology. 

Your ideas in this CMV are very intresting because you have used a propaganda tool to get to a good conclusion. Sounds like your heart is in a good place but your ideas are tainted by russian propaganda. Again nothing wrong, mine are tainted by other types of propaganda. 

If you want a fancy quote I can give you one, its from a harvard historian (because I am not spitting nonsense here, I have used anti propaganda retoric in my studies to prove stuff...doesnt matter lmao).

modernism can be defined as a broad cultural, social, or political initiative, sustained by the ethos of ""the temporality of the new"". Modernism sought to restore, Griffin writes, a ""sense of sublime order and purpose to the contemporary world, thereby counteracting the (perceived) erosion of an overarching ‘nomos’, or ‘sacred canopy’, under the fragmenting and secularizing impact of modernity."" Therefore, phenomena apparently unrelated to each other such as ""Expressionism, Futurism, vitalism, Theosophy, psychoanalysis, nudism, eugenics, utopian town planning and architecture, modern dance, Bolshevism, organic nationalism – and even the cult of self-sacrifice that sustained the hecatomb of the First World War – disclose a common cause and psychological matrix in the fight against (perceived) decadence."" All of them embody bids to access a ""supra-personal experience of reality"", in which individuals believed they could transcend their own mortality, and eventually that they had ceased to be victims of history to become instead its creators.

So yeah, I am not saying Russia is doing good, I am just saying that the why is just a way to blame the west. I would say the west can be blamed of many things that made the war, many many many things, but culture isnt it. The culture is numbing the citizens for sure and its problematic in many senses, but the train of thought your view holds is as a direct line, while I am saying that its more of a spider web of many things. With aesthetic politics vs materialistic politics, the materialistic politics are always stronger. I feel you are using aesthetic politics as a reason of material politics.

This is what I mean with ""you've been propagandized"", its a very common tactic to uses aesthetics to ignore materiality and that happens all over the globe, its just that yours just has its russian flavour hahaha. No worries, again, its difficult to see through this stuff, I am myself fooled too."	"Whateveridontkare @ 2022-07-19 00:50:57 :

its not a crazy conspiracy theory its that many people have superficial and propagandized views. Years ago saying smoking gave cancer was a conspiracy for example.

Having a better understanding of different topics such a political propaganda, geopolitics, some class conciousness and critical thinking can help.

We need to stop the “tough on crime” mantra in the US. 

It is far too common on Reddit to see people cheering on vigilante justice of accused criminals being beaten, murdered, raped in prison, you name it. 

It would seem people are forgetting why “innocent until proven guilty” and “when you have served your time, your punishment has been exacted” are principles we have built our society on to begin with.

**Society is more dangerous for everyone when we lose our humanity.** Violent criminals will never peacefully surrender, if they know society will spare them absolutely no second thought as they wither away or get murdered in prison. 

What keeps so many criminals surrendering peacefully is the social contract: You surrender and turn yourself in, and we will punish you in appropriate - but not excessive - measure, and your life will be better than one on the run.

**If we break that contract or fail to uphold our end**, less criminals will ultimately surrender, and those who are on the run will have nothing to lose and be much, much more dangerous.

I despise child molesters as much as the next guy, **but please stop advocating for their rape and lifelong abuse**, which only pushes potential child molesters towards not coming forwards, hiding even better, never seeking treatment for their sick thoughts, etc. 

I despise murderers too, but I’m not willing to put society at risk to make an example of them.

And **all of this** is without even mentioning another massive problem: The absolutely ridiculous amount of innocent people in prison due to plea deals and bad prosecutors, **whom you are inadvertently advocating for the assault, abuse, and death of as well.**

The most common counter-argument I hear is “this is ignoring the plight and needs of the victims.” 

I fundamentally don’t believe this. I don’t believe all victims are unequivocally out for revenge and lose all reflection and nuance when victims of a crime. I’ve been a victim of a crime a couple of times now - I still keep my rational brain around. 

Victims should have an interest in **as few people being victims of the same crime in the future as possible**. This is accomplished by combatting rising crime rates and recidivism.

Guess what has imperially proven itself the best way to do that? 

Through prison systems that focus on rehabilitation and well prepared re-entry into society, not draconian punitive laws and beating up the sex offender in your neighborhood with bats after he came back from his 25 year prison sentence.

I understand the drive to exact justice on some of the people we hear about every day **but the urge and advocating for vigilante violence has to end.**

You’re making society more dangerous under the guise of being “tough on crime” and it’s such an own goal.

We need to be better.

EDIT:

Just to define what I mean by “tough on crime,” I will paste a previous comment here for context:

When I talk about being tough on crime, I’m talking about the specific policies which, in political science, have come to be associated with the term:

•	⁠Mandatory minimums, relatively lax approaches to crimes committed in gen.pop. in prisons.

•	⁠Capital punishment.

•	⁠The notion that getting beaten or raped in prison is part of your punishment and just in some abstract sense, sometimes even funny (“that rapist better not drop the soap in the showers, I doubt anybody is gonna come to his rescue” as if rape is somehow funny now because the shoe is on the other foot)

•	⁠A lifelong sex offender registry which notifies your neighbors and - not that I think any part of the sex offender registry should exist outside of police databases, but to make matters worse - won’t even tell them if you’re on it for urinating in public or for violating a child, because apparently that’s a violation of your privacy, but somehow notifying your neighbors in the first place is not? What!?

•	⁠Broken windows policing, stop and frisk, red-lining, the 1994 crime bill, the cash for kids shit, etcetera, etcetera,  which disproportionally criminalizes marginalized people for minor non-violent crimes and drags them into the cycle of recidivism somehow being okay.

•	⁠The idea that prison cells should be cold and horrible places rather than examples of the life inmates could have if they would break the cycle.

•	⁠The idea that education, job training, and access to news and media is somehow a waste or a privilege to inmates rather than a natural part of rehabilitating someone and pushing them towards a legal, fulfilling life rather than back into the cycle.

•	⁠and on and on and on.

I don’t mean we should pursue or investigate crime less, or certain crimes less, or ignore white collar crime (which you’re right, we absolutely should massively increase enforcement on), but that we should get rid of policies which criminalize people, trap them in cycles of recidivism, and foster apathy through subhuman living conditions which the system then justifies to them, causing inmates and ex-cons to further alienate themselves from society.

I only feel the need to comment on the sex offender, rapist talk --- everything else I can more or less agree with you ;

&amp;#x200B;

you can go online and do a search for sex offenders and click on what specific act they did. it wont lay out a whole case for you but for example ;

I heard that someone I worked with was a sex offender and I went the registry, typed in his name and last name, clicked on it and it showed ""lewd acts with a minor ""with the year of the crime  and some pictures from the past years that show what he looked like 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't see where exactly was that claim.
With which part you disagree precisely? You seem to argue sex offender registry a lot. And that's the point i'm interested in honestly. You think somehow this is too harsh of a punishment.
But there's the person telling you that *you can in fact figure out what kind of offense was committed*. And you somehow disagree with the measure still? How come?

--------------------------------

SaltRevolutionary917 @ 2022-08-22 09:34:02 :

“*… And I disagree with your stance on that being public info. **And also for rapists to get any humane treatment***.”

That’s where I got the notion that sex offenders are somehow worse than murderers, because murderers aren’t singled out as undeserving of humane treatment. 

As for the registry, I believe it is fundamentally unjust whether the details of the charge are public or not (though it’s preferable that they are if the registry must exist). 

It fundamentally breaks the social contract of “when you serve your time your punishment ends.” The sex offender registry follows you for life, and even if your crime is written there, it’s written in vague terms like “public indecency” when you peed in a park, but the charge sounds like you trench coat flashed a park jogger.

Your sentence ends when you leave prison, it’s fundamentally unfair for it to be permanent and irrevocable, **especially since murder to me seems more extreme than flashing in a trench coat** but only one of the two will follow you for life. Why the hell is that? 

Add to that how often the sex offender registry leads to extrajudicial violence, **and** that many other countries have NO sex offender registry and also have no higher proportion of sex crimes than the US, so the registry doesn’t even prevent the crime it supposedly exists to prevent.

People get beaten and lose job prospects for a system which keeps nobody safe and has absolutely zero track record with benefiting society compared to countries without it.

I’m fully in favor of such a registry **existing**, but it shouldn’t be public. Only police should ever be able to access it, and they should be able to access it for the same reason they can access arrest records - to aid in investigations and solving crime.

The public shouldn’t be made party to that. The public cannot be trusted to handle such information in a civilized manner.

--------------------------------

BloodyPaintress @ 2022-08-22 10:02:21 :

Well I'm not gonna argue on other person's behalf. But I'd interpret it as *rapists shouldn't get humain treatment*, not *everybody should get humain treatment but rapists*.
Murder will most definitely follow you for life, I'm not even sure what you are talking about in that instance. First of all, you will get harsher punishment. And after that record does exist, also accesible by many people, who are not limited to government service. Any sentence will follow you for life, even DYI...
You are clearly painting a picture of vigilante barbarians who will ruin the life of poor park peeing dood. They can't be trusted to be civilized as you said. Well i suggest that these people are civilized enough to not become sexual offenders themselves, for starters. And then, after figuring out it was public indecency, they just forget about pop-up or try to figure out from the person, what's up. Instead of your expected outcome of chasing poor thing with torches. I'd like to see statistics on extrajudicial violence against park peeers or even trench flashers.
Sentenced criminals broke some social contracts themselves, didn't they? How exactly do you guys rehabilitate sex offenders? I'm not american, just before you started with us against you thing. And did i get right that your idea is to reject punitive system in favor of rehabilitative one? So no punishment, just rehabilitation? Aren't those just semantics, considering you still put people in jail, however comfortable?

--------------------------------

SaltRevolutionary917 @ 2022-08-22 10:20:47 :

Well I can only respond to what the person says, I can’t start interpreting their statements freely, then I’ll simply be told I’m putting words in their mouths instead.

And then, no, murder doesn’t **follow you for life at a government level**. There’s a very big difference between “it shows up on your criminal background check” and “your neighbors straight up get push notifications about your past”. That **does not** happen in any other kind of crime than those of sexual nature. 

And then your whole dehumanizing “they’re savages” shtick is so wrong and so insensitive it’s damn near angering me. **You can become a sex offender by pissing in a fucking forest**, okay? If we want to have these debates we need to stop defaulting our arguments to applying only to the worst offenders.

If you favor the current sex offender registry, you can’t “only favor it for violent sex crimes” because that’s not what the current registry is. The current registry will **absolutely write you up for life** for being nude on a nude beach if it’s missing some bullshit federal classification as “clothing optional.” 

Stop nullifying any sort of narrative that runs counter to your “but violent criminals deserve it!” when it impacts so much more than violent criminals. 

People shouldn’t have to defend peeing in a park 20 years ago to **anyone**, because nobody should get a fucking PUSH NOTIFICATION that you were punished for something 20 years ago to begin with, holy fuck don’t you understand how draconian that is?

And again, prove to me that the sex registry makes **any difference** to sex crimes, because the statistics sure don’t support it - at which point you’re punishing all the non violent public urinators in the name of the greater good, **and then that greater good doesn’t fucking work**. So what are they unjustly paying the price for if it doesn’t even safeguard society then?

Do you seriously not see a problem with you peeing in a forest at age 18, moving to a new house at **fucking 50** and the entire 300 people in your neighborhood get a message that “a sex offender just moved into your neighborhood!”?

insensitive is defending rapists as if they are still due their human rights. 

Stop talking about the pissers and the trenchies... we are talking about the violent sex offenders.. 

**Your main statement was to say that since you could not at all look up to see what specific sex crime they made that they were all unjustly put in to the same category and that that was unfair.** 

I already explained that you indeed can see what specific sex crime they did.  so if you can, try to separate it. 

if someone gets a push notification that there is a sex offender in the area most likely they are going to try to find out what happened. and if they do not... then their lack of a research is a different conversation.

them peeing publicly when they knew they could get on the sex offender list for something so stupid and getting caught is also a different conversation. 

I agree that they shouldn't get the same backlash.. but you keep arguing that **all** sex offenders at all should not  get backlash because they **all** change as soon as their prison sentence ends."

As I said, there is little ground to be made here. You obviously are rooted in your stance and it is a bit tiresome to not get any simple answers. You say sex and gender are separate then ask me why. You say gender is a social construct but then advocate for adhering to at least one part of that construct to form your ""identity"". You have not capitulated to a single point I've made, instead capturing lines and responding to what you think you can argue. You are not making any headway, why do you bother? I seek a logical answer and you're giving me metaphysical word salad. 

I think you probably have worn enough people down with this approach that they stop arguing with you or choose to leave it alone and that maybe equals a win. I don't know, I don't really care. It is boring and does not help me see transgenderism as anything more than an effort to solve significant mental identity issues by changing definitions to suit your vision of yourself, while not recognizing the hypocrisy of it.

I think the issue here is that you conflate sex and gender. There is no biological basis to presume your sense of self is entirely dependent on your biological sex.

SkullFumbler @ 2022-10-04 23:07:45 :

There is no biological basis to change anything about yourself to conform to a pronoun or a need for separate pronouns to begin with.

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-04 23:44:39 :

Why do you believe people conform to pronouns rather than conform pronouns to reflect their sense of self? Doesn't that necessitate that language pre-exists humans?

What separate pronoun does a Trans man need besides ""he?""

Why does a woman need to redefine herself as a man if all the traits and sense of self she has can be easily attributed to a woman in a society where there are no lables or predefined roles for each gender? What part of being a man does she attach herself to, and also what part of womanhood does she feel makes her not female? Take away the societal influence and all you have is biology. Name for me the thing(s) a woman must be to be a woman (besides ""feeling it"").

Why would anyone be labeled ""man"" or ""woman"" in such a society? There would be no trans people because no one would be prescribed gender on the basis of their sex.

&gt;What part of being a man does she attach herself to, and also what part of womanhood does she feel makes her not female?

What are the remaining distinguishable parts of being any gender that warrant classifications of gender if we are dismissing the notion that gender is reflective of certain characteristics?

&gt;Take away the societal influence and all you have is biology.

And we don't understand brain biology enough yet to be able to operationalize the ""sense of self"" into a predictable, measurable, and classifiable set of parameters. So develop the biology and maybe you will have an argument. 

&gt;Name for me the thing(s) a woman must be to be a woman (besides ""feeling it"").

That's literally it. You excluded the one and only factor in self identity. 

&gt;If you can present something not rooted in popular culture, stereotypes or perceptions of gender then you earn my little triangle thingy.

So you want me to present you a factor that determines ""what makes you you"" other than your own self determination?

Who else do you you believe is responsible for determining how you define yourself if not you?

I do not accept self identity, I'm sorry. This forum is to change my mind, and ""just because"" doesn't do it. My identity is rooted in what I actually am, not what I wish I was or would be happier being. This cultural acceptance of ""I feel so I am"" is exactly what I am discussing. What is it that one ""feels"" which specifies they are another gender? How would one even know what being another gender feels like if they have never been that gender. For that matter, how would one even know if what they feel is not tied to the gender they already are but simply a result of not being aligned with societal tropes and expectations, i.e. sexism?

Why not?

&gt;My identity is rooted in what I actually am

&gt;not what I wish I was or would be happier being.

What makes you think a trans person isn't what they are?

&gt;This cultural acceptance of ""I feel so I am"" is exactly what I am discussing.

So why do you get to decide what you are but others aren't allowed to?

&gt;What is it that one ""feels"" which specifies they are another gender?

How do you know what your gender is? Do you feel that your gender is reflective of your sex? 

&gt;how would one even know if what they feel is not tied to the gender they already are

Nothing ties you to a gender but your own understanding of yourself. There is no determining factor but you. You are simply feeling thar your gender is tied to your sex which is contradictory since you argue you shouldn't be able to have feelings like that.

&gt;they already are but simply a result of not being aligned with societal tropes and expectations, i.e. sexism?

Why is that sexism? If a woman wants to wear a dress because she likes dresses, is she a sexist?

SkullFumbler @ 2022-10-05 18:10:54 :

I appreciate your efforts, albeit somewhat purely argumentative. 
Yes, my identity is determined by those around me, has been my whole life. If from day one society said someone who looked like me, possessed the reproductive organs I do, and displayed the genetic traits I do, was considered a woman, then I would be a woman. If someone feels I am rude and lack compassion, then they would lable me an a-hole. If I use derogatory terms to reference people of color and work to hinder their progress, then society would label me a racist.

Despite what I believe about myself, the labels I wear are those which society has given. Any other ideas I have about myself are mine personally and I don't expect others to adhere to those ideas or accept them, especially if the preponderance of evidence demonstrates their labels are a better fit.

I know a popular talking point is that their is a chasm between sex and gender and I hear plenty hold to that notion, while others will admit they are tied together. For me, they are inseparable for purely utilitarian reasons. Take away sex, and it doesn't really matter what you decide you are. If none of us had a uterus or vaginas, no penis and no sperm sac, just bare nubs, we could all freely decide where we want to land. That is not reality. What I understand from this endeavor to get other viewpoints is that:

- Trans are trans because..., and that is all that matters
- What you think you are, then you are, no matter what the evidence shows
- There cannot be a connection between sex and gender because that connection further invalidates the claim
- Trans people believe they are the opposite gender despite not being able to truly know if what they feel is indicative of that gender or simply a facet of the gender they were born with
- Society must be altered to accommodate this decision, and any issue which arises from it does not matter if it does not preserve the comfort of the trans person. Even if the issue causes discomfort for everyone else.
- There is no point, without sex being involved, to pursuing transition besides personal gratification 

Anything I missed? Truly thanks.

&gt;Yes, my identity is determined by those around me, has been my whole life.

So why should others be required to reject self determinism because you choose to? Why have you chosen to reject self determinism?

&gt; If from day one society said someone who looked like me, possessed the reproductive organs I do, and displayed the genetic traits I do, was considered a woman, then I would be a woman. If someone feels I am rude and lack compassion, then they would lable me an a-hole. If I use derogatory terms to reference people of color and work to hinder their progress, then society would label me a racist.

So you accept what labels society imposes on you as your identity rather than making determining who you are based on your own sense of self? If so, why?

&gt;Any other ideas I have about myself are mine personally and I don't expect others to adhere to those ideas or accept them, especially if the preponderance of evidence demonstrates their labels are a better fit.

So why do you prefer to be told who you are rather than determining who you are?

&gt;I know a popular talking point is that their is a chasm between sex and gender and I hear plenty hold to that notion, while others will admit they are tied together.

It's a question of fact. Does being born with a penis neccesitate that you must adopt all the gendered characteristics of someone with a penis? That a man can wear a dress suggests not.

&gt;For me, they are inseparable for purely utilitarian reasons.

So you chose to believe something you know to be untrue because you would rather believe a falsehood? What is utilitarian about oppressing people for expressing self determinism?

&gt;Take away sex, and it doesn't really matter what you decide you are.

I think you accidentally found the point. Who we are isn't contingent on our sex and we should stop pretending it is because that has long been a justification to harm and oppress others.

&gt;If none of us had a uterus or vaginas, no penis and no sperm sac, just bare nubs, we could all freely decide where we want to land.

We can even if we do have those things. We just have to stop pretending our outward appearance determines our sense of self.

&gt;Trans are trans because..., and that is all that matters

What else matters? 

&gt;What you think you are, then you are, no matter what the evidence shows

What kind of evidence is relevant to an individual's sense of self other than their sense of self?

&gt;Trans people believe they are the opposite gender

This is false. Trans people believe they are a gender different from their sex.

&gt;despite not being able to truly know if what they feel is indicative of that gender or simply a facet of the gender they were born with

How do you know they don't truly know? If their gender is trans, that *is* the gender they were born with. Someone else deciding what their gender is when they are born doesn't mean that is their gender. Gender isn't determined by anyone other than an individual. A parent might choose to pretend a child has a certain gender. That doesn't make it so.

&gt;Society must be altered to accommodate this decision

Society had to be altered to end slavery, provide rights to women and gay couples. Society is in a constant state of alteration. This is no different.

&gt;Even if the issue causes discomfort for everyone else.

Marginalized groups ceasing to be oppressed has always made oppressors uncomfortable. You choose to be uncomfortable by the mere existence of others as they are. People were uncomfortable with racial integration too. What did we say to those people?

Other people being different than you doesn't harm you. If your point of view made me uncomfortable, would that justify oppressing you or does it render your position invalid?

&gt;There is no point, without sex being involved, to pursuing transition besides personal gratification

What's wrong with someone seeking self actualization when it doesn't harm you?

What do you say to the medical professionals who overwhelmingly disagree with you in that the point is to treat forms of body dysphoria?

Or do you not distinguish between treatment of an illness and personal gratification?

This has not CMV nor really provided anything except more of the same talking points. And btw, a (biological) man demanding to use the female restroom is not on par with the civil rights movement. A person born a man cannot know what being a woman is, cannot define what being a woman is and you cannot provide any evidence to support why I should believe transgenderism is anything more than a sexist mental anomaly. Interestingly, it would make more sense for someone to claim trans-race as there is actual reality of racial blends and fluidity. If all that it takes to be a woman is to believe you are a woman, then I am a woman and I say you're wrong, and furthermore I choose to continue using the men's room because my happiness - and identity - is not selfishly shielded from my community nor independent of it. And as a woman, I defy you to prove I am not. If you can't, then agree that not all trans people agree with you.

Thanks

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-06 19:23:21 :

&gt;This has not CMV nor really provided anything except more of the same talking points.

Have you considered engaging those arguments rather than dismissing them simply because you prefer to believe something else, even if you don't necessarily agree it is true?

&gt;And btw, a (biological) man demanding to use the female restroom is not on par with the civil rights movement.

Why not? Black men we barred from using certain restrooms because of their immutable characteristics. That, at least, is comparable.

&gt;A person born a man cannot know what being a woman is

So then what basis do you have to claim this is sexism if you cannot actually know?

&gt;cannot define what being a woman is

Who can?

&gt;you cannot provide any evidence to support why I should believe transgenderism is anything more than a sexist mental anomaly.

You haven't explained why you believe this. You've only explained that you want to believe this, even if it isn't true.

What evidence disputes a position that isn't predicated on evidence, but personal preference?

We know for a fact trans people have different brain chemistry and genes. We know for a fact that the notion that gender is dependent on sex is false.

This evidence isn't convincing to you because you admittedly don't rely on evidence to form your view. You instead say you hold your view because you believe it is utilitarian to adopt your position. 

&gt;Interestingly, it would make more sense for someone to claim trans-race as there is actual reality of racial blends and fluidity.

What is the actual reality of race? Race is no less a social construct than gender.

&gt;If all that it takes to be a woman is to believe you are a woman, then I am a woman and I say you're wrong,

If all it takes for one to be wrong is for another to say one is wrong, then you are wrong because I said so. 

&gt;furthermore I choose to continue using the men's room because my happiness - and identity - is not selfishly shielded from my community nor independent of it.

So you *choose* to remain closeted because of the stigma applied by your community?

I thought you had no choice? When were you given such a choice? This is a huge departure from your position. 

&gt;And as a woman, I defy you to prove I am not.

So if I can't provide evidence that you determine what your gender is, you accept that gender is determined by the individual and not by unspecified other actors?

&gt;If you can't, then agree that not all trans people agree with you.

It's seems like you very much agree with me. You went from ""I'm not allowed to determine my gender"" to ""I'm determining my own gender, so prove I can't."" Weird flex.

&gt;Any example or analogy I give to demonstrate the paradox appears to fall away from you. 

You aren't demonstrating a paradox, you are constructing one on unreasonable terms to suit your argument. We would call your example a straw man. That it totally backfired and ended up damaging your view is further evidence that your view is meritless. We can discuss how the flawed assumptions in your example brought us here, if you want.

At the end of the day, you have no reconciled the paradox that is your view in that you simultaneously assert autonomy while claiming you aren't entitled to it. That you confuse what is and what you believe *should be* is at the heart of the flaws in your view. Your concession that you hold this view not because it is true, but because you think it is utilitarian is particularly problematic in resolving the inconsistencies within.

It's especially unreasonable to demand evidence of anything to dispute a view when evidence isn't the basis of that view.

SkullFumbler @ 2022-10-06 20:05:42 :

A person cannot determine their gender - my point - and you cannot explain how I should accept, against reason, biology, and logic how anyone can claim anything for which they have zero basis other than their thoughts and feelings. A transgender person has no way of knowing if what they believe they are is actually what they are, and the vast majority of those claiming to be women demonstrate this by adhering to societal stereotypes, tropes and expectations of what society accepts as women. Gender does not exist in the mind, rather biology, and no matter how certain one may feel that they are indeed a separate gender, logically (and I suspect you won't capitulate to this reality) they cannot know for sure. You say they can because they are, I say they can't because they were not. It's an impasse we aren't going to overcome. Again, thank you for you time.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-06 20:27:39 :

&gt;A person cannot determine their gender

You just did. You provide no evidence they cannot.

&gt;how I should accept, against reason, biology, and logic how anyone can claim anything for which they have zero basis other than their thoughts and feelings.

You are rejecting reason, biology, and logic here. Gender is a social construct, to the best of our knowledge. How we, as individuals, understand our sense of self isn't an established set of principles in biology. Perhaps in the future, neurobiologists will figure it out, but that you are claiming some unspecified aspect of biology determines our gender, you are doing so because that is what you want to believe, not because evidence supports that view. In any case, that determining biological factor is likely neurobiological.

To date, you have not presented evidence that anything besides our self determinism establishes our identity. You claim someone else has control over our identity, but you don't say who and you proclaim at several points that you are making self determined choices.

&gt;A transgender person has no way of knowing if what they believe they are is actually what they are,

A cis person doesn't either. 

&gt;the vast majority of those claiming to be women demonstrate this by adhering to societal stereotypes, tropes and expectations of what society accepts as women.

In what other way would they live as women? What a constitutes a woman is an ephemeral fabrication of society. There is no singular understanding of what a woman is across or at any particular point in time. 

The only reason anyone who has ever existed is or was a woman is because they decided they were.

&gt;Gender does not exist in the mind, rather biology,

The mind is a biological computer. Anything that exists in the mind is biological. Gender is almost assuredly determined by some facet of neurobiology, we just don't know what it is yet.

&gt;no matter how certain one may feel that they are indeed a separate gender

That neccesitates that someone felt they were something else and changed their mind. Trans people are aware they are trans at the point their brains develop a sense of self at a young age.

This goes back to where gender comes from. You provide contradictory positions. First you argue that outside actors determine your gender. Then you say biology determines your gender. The totality of the evidence only shows that gender is determined by the individual, not random unspecified people and not random unspecified biological factors.

&gt;logically (and I suspect you won't capitulate to this reality) they cannot know for sure.

Why not? Do you know your gender for sure?

&gt;You say they can because they are, I say they can't because they were not.

Why is your opinion relevant to their identity? If I disagree with whatever you say your gender is, does that make me correct and you wrong simply because I disagreed? Why are you the arbiter of someone's gender and not them?

&gt;It's an impasse we aren't going to overcome. 

I'm fairly confident we can overcome it. You've already internally contradicted yourself. It's only a matter of resolving these inconsistencies.

SkullFumbler @ 2022-10-06 22:51:28 :

Negative. Every argument you continue to conjur is based on reasons resulting from specific points you absolutely deny to be true or untrue, so not sure how you see any confidence in a resolution. Some of what you have said is absolute absurdity in my opinion, so it is difficult to envision any common ground.

I continue to assert tangible, biological differences exist which obviously determine gender, you insist thoughts are also biological since they come from a biological organ? The mind may influence a person's sexual persuasion (choice) and thus cause them to question their biology (choice), and even gives people the freedom to choose an ""identity"", but it does not govern the rudimentary biology which is clear in each person, i.e. their chromosomes, their genitalia, reproductive function and various other attributes unique to each gender. How do I know I am male? I have DNA, genitalia and physical attributes commonly found in men. See? Easy. I don't have an abstract take on any of those things. They are what they are. This is what you are trying to unravel to make room for your assertions. 

To say these things mean nothing, or are variables at best, means we start on completely different fields. I have no doubt a transperson FEELS like they don't belong in the body they were born in, but it is curious that you are unable to see the logic I am trying to work out: what part of the gender naturally assigned to you doesn't fit if there is no observable, definitive difference in genders? Why would anyone need to transition to anything unless trying to conform to an already established male/female dynamic? Why wouldn't a born man simply demonstrate all that he desires and feels without needing to worry about a separate gender ""character, and thus break the static image of manhood with this new facet?

You say you are definitely female, yet also say there is no way to determine a female (other than your own say so)... this is a paradox. You are confirming that you then also have no way to absolutely prove to even yourself that you are female, There is no specific thing you can point to which would confirm you are a woman or demonstrate you understand and know what a true woman is OTHER than simply what you believe or feel. And by choosing to subscribe to the gender opposite your biology, you are demonstrating that gender is binary. At least non-binary folk have just decided to do away with the dillemma altogether.

Of course, generally this is where ""I own my identity"" or ""because it's who I have always been"" or ""it makes me happy"" springs up. I'm perfectly fine with someone being happy. I encourage people to explore their minds and desires. I only ask - here, in this feed - for someone to explain the logic I just mentioned without trying to  beat me to death with gaslight and platitudes.

&gt;Every argument you continue to conjur is based on reasons resulting from specific points you absolutely deny to be true or untrue, so not sure how you see any confidence in a resolution.

Pizza is good. True or untrue?

What makes you think every argument can result in a conclusion of true or untrue?

&gt;Some of what you have said is absolute absurdity in my opinion, so it is difficult to envision any common ground.

*In your opinion?*

We have common ground. We both agree you have self determinism. What we have yet to agree on is that anyone else does. 

&gt;I continue to assert tangible, biological differences exist which obviously determine gender,

And you have no evidence to support that claim. You concede you believe that because you believe thinking that way is utilitarian. 

&gt;you insist thoughts are also biological since they come from a biological organ?

Thoughts are electrical impulses in our brain. Are these functions not biological? Is your brain not part of your biology?

&gt;The mind may influence a person's sexual persuasion 

What is the difference between the person and the mind? What evidence can you present that sexuality is a choice rather than an immutable characteristic?

&gt;thus cause them to question their biology (choice),

What questions of biology are being asked? Trans people aren't questioning their biology, they are rejecting the assumption that your gender is arbitrarily determined by someone else.

&gt;thus cause them to question their biology (choice), and even gives people the freedom to choose an ""identity"", but it does not govern the rudimentary biology which is clear in each person, i.e. their chromosomes, their genitalia, reproductive function and various other attributes unique to each gender.

None of those things are necessarily pertinent to each gender. Those are characteristics of sex, not gender. As you might recall, my OP was that you were simply conflating sex and gender. Sex is material to gender insofar that an individual decides it is.

You clearly don't understand the difference between gender- who you are - and sex - what you are. The link between these is purely an imposition of society- a social construct, not any sort of institution of biology. 

&gt;How do I know I am male? I have DNA, genitalia and physical attributes commonly found in men. See? Easy.

So why is that how you determined you were male? 

&gt;I don't have an abstract take on any of those things. They are what they are. This is what you are trying to unravel to make room for your assertions. 

You've just adopted a different set of abstractions. That a penis makes a man is your personal opinion. Why is that your opinion?

&gt;what part of the gender naturally assigned to you doesn't fit if there is no observable, definitive difference in genders?

Why would someone be assigned a gender if there is no difference in genders?

&gt;Why would anyone need to transition to anything unless trying to conform to an already established male/female dynamic?

Treatment of life threatening medical conditions. Transitioning exists solely because people are improperly assigned gender by others. Social Transitioning for people without dysphoria would be nonexistent if gender was not assigned, but identified by the individual. 

&gt;Why wouldn't a born man simply demonstrate all that he desires and feels without needing to worry about a separate gender ""character, and thus break the static image of manhood with this new facet?

Because there is no such thing as a born man. A person is born. What they are is up to them. They might have a penis. That does not a man make.

&gt;You say you are definitely female, yet also say there is no way to determine a female (other than your own say so)... this is a paradox.

A paradox is when two ideas cannot exist simultaneously. Can the following two ideas coexist?

1. I am a female.

2. I am a female because I decided I am a female.

Obviously yes.

It is a tautology. But, ultimately, so are many aspects of identity. Why are you a Christian? Person? Gamer? Athlete? Whether these terms apply is just a matter of someone deciding they do. 

&gt;And by choosing to subscribe to the gender opposite your biology

Again, conflating sex and gender. Gender is your biology just as much as your sex. It is how your mind relates to your body and sex. There are all kinds of people in this world. Why would you baselessly assume all of them are wired to experience identity in the exact same paradigm that you do? You can't possibly fathom all of the mind-body diversity we see throughout human experiences that one of those might be gender dysphoria?

&gt;And by choosing to subscribe to the gender opposite your biology, you are demonstrating that gender is binary.

If there are six options. I was given A. I am actually B. And other people are C-G. Does that mean there are only two manifestations of those options?

But also, being labeled a gender other than yours because someone decided your gender for you and then revealing your actual gender is an act of *conforming* to your biology. The wrong assignment of your gender was averse to your biology. And again, sex and gender are distinct. 

&gt;At least non-binary folk have just decided to do away with the dillemma altogether.

Non-binary folks typically experience gender without concern for their sex. Trans people often don't. 

&gt;I only ask - here, in this feed - for someone to explain the logic I just mentioned without trying to beat me to death with gaslight and platitudes.

These aren't platitudes. You are failing to understand that sex and gender are different. More importantly, you failing to reconcile your own contradictory position, that gender is determined by other people vs. gender is a biological phenomenon. The reason you can't reconcile these two issues is because you are not understanding that sex =/= gender.

Simple answers are for simple topics. It's even more tiresome to get no answers. What is the point of asking you questions and making arguments when you don't respond to them?

&gt;You say sex and gender are separate then ask me why.

No I didn't. I asked you why *you believe they aren't* and you refused to answer. I know why they are separate. 

&gt;You say gender is a social construct but then advocate for adhering to at least one part of that construct to form your ""identity"".

What part of this construct do I claim is a requirement of a gender identity? 

&gt;You have not capitulated to a single point I've made

You aren't making points, you are reiterating what your view is over and over. If you responded to my arguments, we'd have points to evaluate. I have nothing to capitulate to because you have not engaged with the arguments against your view. You just repeat the view. You've answered almost none of my questions. 

&gt;You are not making any headway, why do you bother?

I'm waiting for you to decide to answer an argument or explain why you won't. If you spent less time complaining about me and more answering arguments, we could have some progress.

&gt;I seek a logical answer and you're giving me metaphysical word salad. 

I've offered you nothing but logic. I dare you to point out anything metaphysical in my arguments. If you engaged my logic instead of baselessly dismissing it as supernatural you might find what you are looking for.

&gt;I think you probably have worn enough people down with this approach that they stop arguing with you or choose to leave it alone and that maybe equals a win.

There is no winning or losing here. If you think asking questions and making arguments is wearing you down, then perhaps you are not comfortable with your views being challenged? If something doesn't make sense to you, ask for clarification. If you don't want to further discuss. Then don't. But you can't expect to leave thinking your ideas have merit when you did nothing to defend them. You didn't answer questions about their logic and practice. You didn't answer arguments about their assumptions. You repeatedly ignored when I pointed out multiple times you had taken two contradictory positions. You still haven’t even mentioned that point.

How do you ignore that you've contradicted yourself and still maintain you haven't been challenged?

&gt;It is boring and does not help me see transgenderism as anything more than an effort to solve significant mental identity issues by changing definitions to suit your vision of yourself, while not recognizing the hypocrisy of it.

I'm sorry the topic is too complex to hold your interest enough for you to engage these arguments.

Definitions change all the time. It's something we do as a society to move our language closer to our reality. The reality is that we just pretended sex determined gender and language is adapting to ameliorate that oversight. You make no arguments this is hypocrisy."

Go back and look at the podcasts I mentioned. Look up the WaPo book. And absolutely take the time to actually read the thing. Stop arguing invented narratives. Being informed is better than feeling like you won	0	0	stop arguing comment					"A total compilation of the evidence obtained and shared to the American people by the Jan 6th House committee includes.

1: Over 60 lawsuits filed by Trump and lawyered by Giuliani failed to prove any fraud in the election of any kind and resulted in Rudy legally not being allowed to use the word fraud in the courtroom. Many of these suits were led by republican appointed judges. This eventually also led to Rudy losing his license to practice law.  

2: Testimony from innumerous witnesses, including a vast majority of republicans and family members as well as Trumps own DOJ, stating that Trump both knew he had lost the election and had planned in great detail that if he lost he would in fact say it was fraudulent and claim victory anyway. 

3: That over and over again the many individuals who ended up being convicted of crimes in the Jan 6th insurrection point to Trump as the instigator and motivator of their crimes.

4: Evidence proving Trump repeatedly tried to illegally cajole and manipulate governors of states into ""finding"" votes that would turn their electorates for Trump. 

5: Being linked directly to a plot that included many GOP members trying to falsify electoral college certifications illegally claiming Trump as the winner of their state.

6: Hell, at this point I feel like there is so much more proof they have uncovered that I am probably forgetting things.

I want to know with all of this proof how anyone could still think Trump won without believing certain types of Americans shouldn't have the right to vote. 

I don't want answers from someone who agrees with me but thinks they know what ""they"" could still believe. I want to hear from actual people who can justify their belief that the election was truly stolen and how it could have been stolen without that belief being motivated by a hatred for a certain set of Americans."	"Mitoza @ 2022-10-14 01:57:00 :

You have to consider the media diet of a person such as this. They are being told that the election was stolen and news channels have been invented for them to watch so that they can be shielded from any evidence that comes out against that narrative. Don't attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity.

ElephantintheRoom404 @ 2022-10-14 02:12:48 :

Yes, you agree with me and think ""they"" think like this. Also, don't attribute to stupidity what should be attributed to malice. My point is many people might be playing stupid in order to cover their hatred of ""those people."" I am looking for the person(s) who will come on here and show me HOW they believe, whether it is through stupidity, through hatred of ""those people"" or through another way I can not myself think of.

&gt;I want to know with all of this proof how anyone could still think Trump won without believing certain types of Americans shouldn't have the right to vote.

I was responding to this. Like if you found someone that believed that the election was stolen. There are a lot of people who believe the election was stolen because they don't know any better and not because they don't think some people shouldn't vote. That was the contention you laid out, not that they couldn't believe it unless they were ignorant.

--------------------------------

ElephantintheRoom404 @ 2022-10-14 02:32:31 :

This is why I want them here to speak for themselves and not have people who agree with me to speak for them. There is no way a person could come onto a public platform and be able to defend ignorance. They would have to by their nature say ""I choose to believe because I don't want to know the truth."" They would have to admit to willful ignorance in order to have a ""justifiable"" reason that isn't a hatred of ""them"" and a willful ignorance isn't justifiable...

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-14 11:13:54 :

Yo, right here. I'm your guy. I think the election was stolen but I also think it's nothing new. George W. stole one with the help of his brother in Florida. I agree that Trump is a douchebag but of course Democrats stole the election. They stole it before anyone even voted. Also, both sides cheated their asses off. The election wasn't fair is why it was stolen. That has nothing to do with me believing everyone has a right to vote. I don't get your logic.

--------------------------------

OnePunchReality @ 2022-10-14 14:53:12 :

Interesting. What was unfair about it?

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-14 22:59:05 :

Trump was a good president. He made progress. That didn't matter one bit though because the media (controlled by the left) did a hatchet a job on him 24/7 for 4 years straight. The masses, more or less, are essentially waiting to be told who to vote for. Trump was made out to be a monster. He's not one.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 00:51:24 :

Are you saying the election was stolen because your guy lost? I mean, you can build any narrative you want to defend Trump’s criticisms, but the events that get reported DID happen. Maybe you don’t want people to think negatively about things, but that isn’t a view you can control. 

So if you are saying the fact that people know and believe provable bad things about Trump, and that caused them to not vote for him, that equates to a stolen election?

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 00:53:39 :

Lol. Ok, dude. Like willfully misunderstand what I say. Whatever. You ever heard of propaganda? You ever heard of Saul Alinsky?
Don't play coy you know exactly what I'm talking about..

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 01:48:36 :

If I misunderstood you, then help me understand.   


The media reported on real Trump events. Maybe you see those events differently, or maybe you have justifications for them, but the fact is, these things happened, and the media reported on it.   


Many people would view the evidence and determine that Trump is not good for our country, and that would lead them to vote against him. Your argument, to the best I can tell, is that you think people shouldn't have voted against him, just because they don't like things about him. You like him, and wanted him to win. Other people didn't, and you take that as evidence the election was stolen. Again, if I am wrong and that isn't what you said, then clarify.   


&gt;You ever heard of propaganda? 

Yes, I have been watching it invade my country for the past 7 years. I've been hearing fake propaganda about Hillary Clinton being a child eating, murdering, criminal overlord, and that she was going to get arrested for all of these ""proven"" crimes against her. I watched while Russian trolls in St. Petersburg pumped fake news and hate mongering to millions of Americans, who didn't know how to tell the difference before they started hitting 'share'.   


I have been listening to people talk about a Biden family crime ring, where all the evidence needed to prove it just happened to appear on Rudy Giuliani's desk just weeks after he returned from Ukraine to meet with Russian agents to come up with Biden dirt. A laptop which Giuliani apparently had on his desk for months without actually releasing any of that evidence. And then now that the FBI is investigating Hunter for tax issues, and a couple of innocuous emails (with no evidence of crime) were verified, the right is pretending that was the story they meant the whole time.   


I've been watching as the country splits with a large portion believing claims of election fraud, without any evidence to support it and by disregarding all of the evidence that disproves it.   


I have definitely heard of propaganda.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 02:29:40 :

Yeah and you were paying attention when they said Trump colluded with Russia to win the election. So you know what I'm talking about. So, no, not real Trump events. No, not at all.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 02:38:49 :

I also read the entire report that outlined the connections between Russia and Trump that we call “collusion”. Mueller didn’t address collusion, because it isn’t a legal term. He wasn’t able to prove a conspiracy. 

But conspiracy and collusion are not the same thing. Collusion is a term that talks about improper or unethical connections, or two entities working together, directly or indirectly, for a fraudulent purpose. What is outlined in the Mueller Report is ABSOLUTELY the kind of collusion that was being reported since Trump first started doing it. 

All of those things the media reported on, that Trump called “fake news”, all bore out with the evidence in the Mueller Report, the Senate Intel Report on Russia, the House Intel Minority Report, the IG report, and multiple court cases.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 02:47:12 :

Lol. Now, who is twisting? No it's not collusion it's conspiracy. Whatever it was, Trump didn't do it but everyone thinks he did because of the media.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 03:41:26 :

Conspiracy has a very specific definition. Mueller wasn’t able to completely prove that standard, although he did find some evidence of it. Whether there was or wasn’t a conspiracy is unknown, but legally, the question is over. 

That specific legal term has nothing to do with what is meant by collusion. I don’t think Trump colluded with Russia because of the media. I believe it because the evidence shows it to be so. 

Honest question- please give an honest answer. Have you actually read the Mueller Report? Do you actually know what evidence he found? How about the Senate Intel report that confirms Mueller’s findings, and even goes deeper into certain areas? Have you read the House Intel Minority Report (the rebuttal of Devin Nunes’ report)? That one fills in the gap the Majority report left out, and the information missing from the majority report suggests an internal conspiracy to cover up collusion. Have you read the IG report on the Russia investigation that found the investigation was opened on the merit of the evidence, disproving your claim that none of it happened?

These things are not from the media. They are from lengthy, detailed investigations of the facts. Many of them led by Republicans. The media reported things that have later been shown to be true by these investigations. So where you are suggesting the media was wrong for reporting these things, the evidence shows they were reporting factual events that Trump just denied. 

You’ve chosen to believe Trump and not the evidence because that choice feeds your own preconceptions and biases. But I would suggest at least doing yourself a favor and seeing the evidence for yourself.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 04:40:59 :

You didn't read it either because most of it is redacted. The stuff that proves nothing happened is redacted.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 11:36:43 :

You really should read it. The things you are saying  show you have no clue what is in it. There is no real value in making things up like that, when you could just read it for yourself and be informed. 

When you say the redacted parts prove nothing happened, what are you referring to? What information do you have that supports that claim? 

Just read the report.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 11:44:29 :

I did read some and saw nothing about Trump. It was mostly stuff about that organization that had fake accounts and was recruiting people. It's redacted to almost nothing.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 13:18:38 :

Then you haven’t read it. There is no value in lying about this.

Just read volume 1.  You can skip the obstruction part, because that is a closed case.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 13:20:19 :

I'm not lying. I read some. It's almost 500 pages, I was at work.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 13:28:03 :

It sounds like you read what you wanted to. If you actually read it, you will see evidence of the multiple connections between Trump and his team and Russian operatives. You will see numerous instances where the Trump camp used Russian interference efforts to help them sway the electron. You will see multiple instances of efforts by the Trump team to solicit the kind of foreign influence Russia ultimately provided. 

If you read the Senate report, you will get confirmation of the Mueller information and additional detail regarding the coordination. 

If you read the House Minority report, you will see the extent the GOP went to cover up this activity. 

If you read the IG report, you will get confirmation that the events that led to the Russia investigation were real, and the investigation was properly predicated. 

It’s on you to be informed. The things you have said prove directly you haven’t read it. You may well have flipped through trying to find things that confirm your bias, but you clearly don’t know what is in it.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 13:30:18 :

You don't either. You're just repeating what you've been told. I can prove you haven't read it.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 13:59:13 :

How can you prove that?

FYI, I have been through the whole thing in detail multiple times. I read the text, and have the book itself at home (WaPo version). I pull the book out as a reference regularly to support discussions like this one. 

After that, I listened to the [Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/introducing-report-podcast-series-lawfare) podcast that went through it in detail, section by section. I listened to the [Asset](https://theassetpodcast.org/) podcast that focused less on the chapter by chapter of the report, and more on how the evidence ties together. Another podcast I went through is called [Mueller She Wrote](https://muellershewrote.com/), but I don’t particularly recommend it. 

In addition, I have watched every committee hearing, including the Mueller hearing. And there are a number of video series that go through the detail in focus. 

I tell you all of this, because I want you to understand that I’m not just talking from the point of someone who has just scanned the pages. When you say you can prove I haven’t read it, you have a pretty tough barrier to cross. And I look forward to hearing how you try to make this argument.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 14:07:38 :

You didn't know what I was referring to in my previous comment. That's how I know you didn't read it.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 14:16:53 :

Which comment? The one that says it is redacted to nothing? That’s false. There is more than enough unredacted material to prove the point. 

The comment where you said that the redacted part proves nothing happened? That’s false. The redacted parts, in context, likely provide more incriminating information about people involved. But even so, those parts don’t take away from what is written in the unredacted parts you are afraid to read. 

Which comment are you saying provides accurate information that I don’t know about?

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 14:20:47 :

Lol. If you read it, you'd know. You didn't read it. You may (may) have had the podcasts on in the background but that means nothing. Do you think anyone who is going to do a podcast about it actually thinks it's a load of crap? Hell no. They're doing a podcast to serve their own confirmation bias. A Washington Post book? That sounds so sketchy. You didn't read it.

--------------------------------

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 14:27:47 :

The extent you are going to in order to hide from
your lack of knowledge is incredible. 

First, the WaPo book is a print of the entire report, with a forward section from the WaPo outlining their reporting that is proved in the report. But after the forward, it is a direct reprint of the report, identical in every way to the one on the DOJ website. 

Two of the three podcasts I mentioned went through the report, line by line, and section by section.  They then spend some time discussing the context, but every inch of the report is covered. I recommend the Lawfare one, even if the book is too much for you to read. 

Regardless, this attempted distraction is not supporting your false claims. No matter how much you try to turn this around on me, you are still poorly informed, and are willfully ignorant.

--------------------------------

mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 14:31:31 :

Nah. You just think because you pretend to have read something that you're more informed than me. Youre trying to play the intellectual Superior game by pretending to be some kind of book worm and make me look stupid. But, I see you. I already proved you didn't read it anyway. Furthermore, I couldn't care less how detailed the podcasts are. They went into the podcast with their opinions already set. So those podcasts are bs."	"mrslotsfloater @ 2022-10-15 14:40:45 :

Stop pretending you read some bullshit.

jadnich @ 2022-10-15 15:48:59 :

Lol, if the best you have is “I know you are, but what am I”, I’ll leave you to it. Your ignorance is on display, and I can’t prove it any more than you are already doing yourself.  Take the time and learn something real, instead of inventing narratives that help you cope with your bad decisions.

putwat @ 2022-10-31 19:37:48 :

I think it takes more than 2 hours to have a real understanding how the economy works. Reading one or two books pop economic books does not mean you understand how the world works.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 19:42:17 :

Most of these issues are matters of opinion. Take abortion rights, for example. No research required unless you make political decisions on pragmatic bases. Is it good or bad for society to ban certain medical procedures to appease the moral desires of some? How do you make decisions generally? Based on your feelings or the weight of positive or negative factors?

Why do you need to have encyclopedic knowledge of the economy or other issues to be engaged? You, ultimately, aren't voting for any specific policy, but a representative to vote for policies on your behalf. So why not vote for an economist? Or a lawyer? Or a doctor? Someone who does have expertise?

--------------------------------

putwat @ 2022-10-31 19:49:16 :

I think making it a matter of a opinion is a bad thing. We should not vote for things because of a gut feeling but because we truly understand every part of the debate. Some peoples intuition might feel that killing a baby is immoral but I don't think these sort of intuitions are enough to be sure what you are voting for is correct.

&gt;Why do you need to have encyclopedic knowledge of the economy or other issues to be engaged? 

If I don't understand what I'm voting for what good is a voting? I could be voting for someone that will enact policies that will hurt the economy and I would have no idea. It's basically picking at random and hoping for the best. Doesn't seem like a good way to live.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 19:53:45 :

&gt;because we truly understand every part of the debate.

Can you name a single person in America who understands every part of the debate?

&gt;If I don't understand what I'm voting for what good is a voting?

To pursue your interests. Do you want to pay more or less in taxes? Do you want to have the state making personal medical decisions for you?

If your right to freedom of speech was threatened by an election, would you abstain because you haven't read every book about freedom of speech?

Do you just not care if you have rights or not? Or are you too ambivalent to vote to preserve your rights?

Whe do you know if you've done enough research to vote?

--------------------------------

putwat @ 2022-10-31 19:57:20 :

&gt; Can you name a single person in America who understands every part of the debate?

I've read some books and listened to some debates between academics and they seem to pretty much understand and know every argument and study for a specific topic. Whatever it is they specialize in.

&gt; Do you want to pay more or less in taxes? 

I have no clue. Does paying more taxes help me more than it hurts me? I'm sure you have an opinion but I have no idea if you're right or wrong. I could read some books but they will say different things. Who is right? I'm just guessing and that's not enough for me to feel confident about anything I'm voting for.

&gt;would you abstain because you haven't read every book about freedom of speech?

Is this how we should live? Just guessing because of time without truly understanding?

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 20:01:23 :

&gt;Whatever it is they specialize in.

So they know every issue or just their specialty? If the latter, how could they vote? They only know one thing and there are many other policy issues. 

&gt;Is this how we should live? Just guessing because of time without truly understanding?

Can you ever truly understand something? What is your alternative? Who can vote if no one knows everything about everything issue? Is it possible to know everything about every issue?

How should we decide once we know everything since there are typically two choices that are probably some combination of all the ""good"" policy outcomes.

--------------------------------

putwat @ 2022-10-31 20:13:03 :

I never said we had to have perfect knowledge to vote just that without dedicating a large part of your life to trying to understand these topics we are basically just voting randomly without any consideration for what is true which seems wrong to me. Especially if you act passionate and confident about these ideas that you don't even know about.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 20:15:53 :

Ok, so who can vote under these restrictions? You say there are people who know things about their specialization, but that's only one area. We don't vote for single issues. Can you demonstrate it is possible to have enough knowledge of every single area of public policy to be able to vote within your parameters? Can you name a single person you'd say is knowledgeable enough on every area to vote?

--------------------------------

putwat @ 2022-10-31 20:19:09 :

I'm not trying to make a perfect system. I'm just saying acknowledge that people are voting for things they don't understand and that I personally won't take a stance on something that I don't feel confident about.

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 20:22:09 :

I get that. I'm trying to understand what it would take for someone to be confident to vote based on your paradigm. Can you name a single person you think should be voting based on your specifications?

--------------------------------

putwat @ 2022-10-31 20:26:11 :

Someone who has actually took the time to learn arguments from both sides. Read all the data available and felt confident enough that they understood both sides. Let's say this person would be at like 70% confidence. An academic who specialized might be at like 90%. I think most people voting are at like 5% or even 1%

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 20:28:00 :

No, I mean an actual person, not a theoretical person. 

Is there a single American you can name who should vote? Can you give us one example of someone in real life who does meet this standard?

I'm trying to understand if it is even possible for anyone at all to vote under this paradigm. If you can't name a single one, how do you know it is possible?

--------------------------------

putwat @ 2022-10-31 20:37:37 :

You act like I'm saying only someone with perfect knowledge should vote. I never said that. Everyone should vote I just think most people are voting randomly based on gut feelings instead of any level of understanding. If you have 3 issues you care deeply about you should at know a little about those topic before you consider yourself confident no?

--------------------------------

Biptoslipdi @ 2022-10-31 20:40:10 :

Ok. Can you name a single person who is voting based on an adequate level of understanding?

Are you saying understanding 3 issues is sufficient to vote when your vote impacts potentially hundreds or thousands of public policy outcomes? Why is 3 enough, but not one?

--------------------------------

&gt; Can you name a single person who is voting based on an adequate level of understanding?

&gt;Why don't you answer?

Zero. If we all held ourselves to this standard, zero people would vote. I'm comfortable standing by that number since you can't name a single person who should vote based on your standards.

&gt;Does that matter?

Certainly. If our government is formed by voting for representatives, we need people to vote to have a government.

If no one should vote because they don't fully understand all the issues their representative might weigh in on, how do we have a society?

Is an ungoverned place safer and more prosperous than a governed place? Are we better off with no one voting?

At a minimum, if all the measured people are abstaining then we only have the ignorant voting. Does that make us better off?

Again you think I'm saying you need perfect knowledge. You are misunderstanding. There are levels of confidence. 0% would be someone who goes on gut instinct. 20% would be someone who watches political news. 40% would be someone who reads pop books on the topic. 60% would be someone who studies actual data and reads academics books on the topic 80% would be someone who really dedicates their free time to trying to understand the topic and 90% would be an academic who has almost full knowledge of everything within the topic.


All levels of these confidence should be able to vote in a democracy. I think without like 60% confidence your vote is without an actual understanding of the topic. Nowhere did I say you need perfect knowledge or perfect confidence. Just to put enough of an effort in to try to understand.

I don't think you can deny by voting with 0% or even something like 20% you are basically randomly voting for whatever you feel like and I don't see how you don't have a problem with this type of voting. It's like people who don't understand what some state amendment means so they just randomly vote yes or no. You see no problem with this

I have not said that. That's why I asked for an example of a sufficiently informed voter. So far, no example has been presented. I assume that means you can't think of any person who should be voting. If you don't know who an adequate voter is, how do you know one exists?

&gt; I think without like 60% confidence your vote is without an actual understanding of the topic.

Ok. How is it possible to have 60% confidence? Can you give an example?

And don't give me that 'eco-fascism' nonsense. Fascism itself is already an irrelevant ideology in contemporary times; let alone 'eco-fascism'.   


Also, isn't the left the most eugenics focused then, given that they support abortion and birth control to reduce birth rates?  


Seriously, if there is one group who is opposed to eugenics, it's religious conservatives. The right has always advocated for *increasing* birth rates.

Specifically, we are arguing whether the right *right now* is advocating for eugenics. Not even that actually, we were arguing about whether the right advocates for *reducing birth rates* for the purpose of battling overpopulation and climate change.

If we are not discussing this, then we are having two different discussions. Maybe that's why you are talking about irrelevant stuff like Nazism. I never argued that the 'right' have *never* argued for eugenics. (I would argue that Nazis weren't really 'conservative' either haha: fascists are revolutionaries with a traditionalist discourse).

That is it. If you want to have that argument, please, by all means, but it's not what I've been saying. I dont think the right is arguing for eugenics. Yet.

Studies show that Black American households have generational wealth amounting to, on average, less than $30,000. White American households have, on average, around $150,000 in generational wealth.

To me there are two possible explanations for this: one is that external factors (mainly both explicit and systemic racism) have prevented Black households from gaining wealth equivalency with white households. The other is that Black households are unwilling or unable to gain wealth due to their own inadequacies, which is of course a blatantly racist take. 

Make arguments as you will, but it seems obvious to me that if two groups have the same levels of intelligence and ambition, but one group experiences a vastly higher degree of roadblocks (black codes, Jim Crow laws, redlining, etc.) to their ambitions, you would expect that group to naturally fall behind. 

Since black households still fall behind on economic metrics, unless you subscribe to racist ideology, you have to admit that black households still feel the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, if we want these households to truly achieve economic parity, and we truly want an equitable society, those of us who have benefited from a lack of these same systemic roadblocks are responsible for directly repaying those who have been harmed."	"CrinkleLord @ 2022-12-08 05:25:29 :

Do you know what is weird... when you remove the statistical factors like 'single mothers' and you compare 'family household with 2 parents of blacks' and you compare 'family household with 2 parents of whites' 

Guess what you find?

You find that blacks aren't actually incapable of building a life at a very similar generational wealth compared to white people.  It's not equal by any means, but why would you expect it to be equal anyway.  Just because 2 numbers aren't equal doesn't mean racism happened obviously.  Black people spend money different than white people do, I don't know the reason, I doubt you do either.  But for one, black people are *overwhelmingly* over represented in purchasing luxury vehicles than white people are.  Why?  Fuck if I know... do you?

Seems to me, that you have to actually be able to answer questions like those, or you have to answer for what appears to be your racist idea that blacks are just not capable of staying together and raising children together in a family household, and spending money on luxury vehicles (which is only one example of differences).

Can you explain the answers to those things?  Or can you explain the racist idea you appear to be utilizing?

--------------------------------

stewshi @ 2022-12-08 13:53:20 :

When did the advent of single parent black households start? I bet it’s got something to do with a group of people being over policed and a certain war on drugs that heavily targeted minority communities and gave minorities harder sentences. 

As to your point on luxury’s purchases 

https://www.npr.org/2008/01/17/18176737/the-color-of-luxury-buying



So we find that there are at least 30 percent differences in conspicuous consumption across race. But then we say, if it's the case that this argument I just laid out to you is correct, we should observe precisely the same behavior within race. Which is to say suppose you ignored blacks completely, and you looked to different kinds of whites sorted by the average income of their state. What we observed is that we find precisely the same behavior just among whites as we do just among blacks. The fact that the racial difference shows up so starkly is that blacks and whites, on average, come from such dramatically different communities in terms of state wealth or state income.


People who are considered low status buy expensive thing to increase their status. Poor white peoples also do this. What you ascribed to race is a product of social class.

CrinkleLord @ 2022-12-08 16:41:03 :

Lol no it doesn’t. It says that blacks and whites on average live in such dramatically different communities and in terms of wealth and income it presents a stark contrast. 

I know comprehension is hard but what he’s saying is the conditions of black peoples are so different from those of whites that this is more pronounced in their populations. So black peoples live in deeper poverty and poorer communities so it is more noticeable.

So both poor whites and poor blacks buy luxury goods to try and improve their social status.  It’s not a race specific thing.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2022-12-17 19:04:09 :

Because you're assuming the teacher actually didn't do it. There's three possibilities

1. The teacher in fact didn't do anything and can prove it. If the student or parent is lying you can already sue for libel or slander in these situations. You have to prove it because you always have to prove somebody actually harmed you in court.
2. The teacher in fact did abuse somebody but is found not guilty because the standard for criminal guilt is very very high or the teacher didn't have the mens rea to commit the crime (hard to see how that would apply in an assault case but it could happen). The abuser then sues their victim in revenge -- a horrible miscarriage of justice. 
3. The teacher in fact didn't do anything but can't prove that. In that case they're protected from criminal consequences but probably can't win and may suffer social or economic but not criminal consequences. 

What you're saying is effectively ""I'm alright with 2 if we avoid 3."" and people who are disagreeing with you largely aren't alright with that tradeoff.

PotatoesNClay @ 2022-12-17 19:52:56 :

...OP explained it.  Are you misunderstanding intentionally?

Because making sure that number 3 never happens means that number 2 will happen a lot.  

This, honestly, is an incredibly selfish view.   Adult men are sometimes more *afraid* of false accusations because they view this as a bigger threat to *themselves*.  That doesn't mean it is even close to the biggest threat though.   Like, how many SA victims do you personally know? (I bet it is more than one, and these are just the ones you know about)  How many of them got justice (if you know more than 1, probably less than 100%).  

How many men do you know whose lives have been ruined by a truly false accusation?  It's probably 0.  (Like, don't count it if they absolutely did the thing but felt the punishment was ""unfair"".  I -unfortunately- know one dude in that category.  He spent 3 years in jail.  His life is not ruined.  He has a job, a wife and 3 kids.) 

Look man, people often do horrible things to other people.  Sometimes it's stuff that completely ruins your life (at least for a while).  Sometimes, unfortunately, they get away with it.  What you are asking for here is for women, children, and certain demographics of men that may be of higher risk to rape (a life ruining crime) to accept that they will not get justice -even more often- so that you can feel safe from the remote possibility of a false accusation and any fallout from that that.  You want a special exception carved out where the crime of falsely accusing someone has a much lower burden of proof than all other crimes.  

That is selfish as fuck and kind of disgusting.

You have a long way of saying falsely accused shouldnt worry about their lives because other people commit unrelated crimes."	"peonypegasus @ 2022-12-17 20:37:39 :

The burden of proof for defamation is also lower than the burden of proof for rape. Like let’s say there’s an equal distribution of evidence (ex. 1/100 cases have 1% proof, 50% proof, 70% proof). The burden of proof for criminal charges is “beyond reasonable doubt” so let’s say that’s like 90%. So in this model, 10% of people get convicted. That leaves 90% of people found not guilty. Then there’s the concept of the preponderance of evidence &gt;50% showing that the person was lying. Assuming the same distribution of proof as before, ranging from 0%-100%, 49 defendants would be found guilty of defamation.

OP is suggesting that, in this model, all 90 of those found not guilty should win their defamation cases and get damages from their victims.

This is true… 

But I would also argue that if you, in effect, forced punishment of either the accused or the accuser, then that threshold would be lowered (Even if the standard doesn’t change on paper, juries will be more likely to throw someone they are 80% sure committed the rape in jail rather than punish the person they are 80% sure is a victim)

This will harm innocent people on both sides, even if unevenly (I think it would be worse for rape victims, simply because there are so many more of them)."

There's an unfortunate norm within the queer community to deliberately seek out unaccepting spaces to force confrontations out of a belief that not picking fights is letting bigots win.

The point of contention seems to lie mostly here and I don't know enough about it to say anything more about it, so I'll stop arguing. It seems that other people are continuing this argument already anyway.

~~I would also have to drown you if keep disagreeing with me.~~"	13	0	stop arguing comment					"EDIT: I am editting the post now because I think what can be gleaned has mostly been gleaned by now.

In summary: I shouldn't have double-barreled my CMV - drag shows and drag storytimes should be considered separately.

Drag Storytimes: If all the sexual content has been redacted (e.g. no sexual names, no clothing that would be considered innapropriate when worn by any person when reading to children), then this is appropriate. Many people in the thread have said that drag storytimes do not have sexual content.

Drag shows: I still think drag shows targetting children are innapropriate. If a drag show existed in an environment that was not sexual and had all sexual content removed, that would be appropriate. However examples I have seen online don't support this. I also struggle to understand the reason why great efforts would be taken to make an inherently adult drag performance appropriate for kids - that would require removing the essence of the performance and to what end?

There are two examples here of what I think is innapropriate. And yes, I would think this was innapropriate if the performer wasn't a drag queen.

1. At a drag show two young children are led around a nightclub by a drag queen who directs how they should pose. The children receive dollars and cheers from the crowd as they pose. This takes place at midnight.

Lastly, thank you to those of you who responded in good faith and engaged with what I wrote and gave your knowledge and experiences.

The post is mostly downvoted which isn't very productive for a discussion and doesn't work towards a changed view. A lot of commentors are replying with comments that don't make sense, are fallacious or are imagined assumptions (apparently I am homophobic now). In an argument you can't make up what you believe I think and then argue against that. You have to argue against what I actually wrote, not an imagined opponent that is easier for you to defeat.

END EDIT 1

I do not live in the US or the UK where this seems to be a hot topic, but I do follow news/channels/political media that cover these stories. I watch content from both liberal and conservative personalities, who are at odds on this issue.

Where I live this is not a thing, and the political divisions in my country don't resemble the republican vs. democrat dynamic that exists in the US. Meaning that I don't have a horse in the game here beyond educating myself.

In my experience and to my understanding, drag and drag shows are a form of expression, art and entertainment. Drag personalities are often over the top and comical. Typically a drag persona has a sexual element, for example a 'dirty' pun as a name, exaggerated body proportions for boobs and butts, and can also have 'dirty' dialogue/stand up.

Given all of the above, drag seems like the kind of 'adult' content society considers innapropriate for young children to be exposed to, because of its sexual nature, or because it is considered too graphic. This is a cultural norm - we have age restrictions on movies, series and videogames based on their content. We wouldn't and don't bring children to nightclubs or strip clubs. We also don't talk about or do certain things in front of children for the same reason (example: after a hookup you may tell a group of friends details about having sex, but you wouldn't do this with a child because it is innapropriate).

Given the adult themes and sexual nature of drag shows, why is there an effort being made to include children in this area in the first place? It seems contradictory.

If the goal is to ensure children are exposed to ideas of gender and sexual diversity, why do this specifically with drag queens who are adult entertainers and mostly operate in adult environments such as clubs? Doesn't it make more sense to have children meet or be exposed to, for example, a gay or lesbian couple? As there is nothing sexual about meeting an individual who is queer.

If the intent is specifically to make children aware of the existence of drag culture, why not have an age-appropriate conversation about it, the same way parents have age appropriate comversations about topics that children are too young to experience first hand but can still be made aware of. 

What is the explicit benefit of children interacting with drag queens that 'overrides' the usual societal norms? We wouldn't make a similar effort to make children aware of other adult occupations such as sex work or stripping."	"h0tpie @ 2022-12-20 19:59:20 :

You don't seem to know much about what happens at these story hours. Drag queens sometimes have exaggerated body proportions, but so do cartoon characters and heroes? Pixar moms have enormous asses and kids aren't mentally disturbed by looking at Ms. Incredible at the parks. That's part of creating a character. Drag queens are people, performers, entertainers, sometimes even take on the fairy-tale princess role for a story hour and just look like over the top performers to the child. There are not adult themes in a children's presentation.

I've been to pride, drag shows for adults, and also been to LGBT affirming events for kids and they are all entirely different dependent on the context. This whole thing is a non-issue devised by conservatives to make drag queens and queer people unsafe. The explicit benefit of children interacting with drag queens is that children deserve to have a world full of different, interesting people who ignite their imagination and affirm their self esteem. I was so lucky to grow up surrounded by LGBT adults and to see queer performers as a kid to know that gender in't inherently a sexual thing.

While I agree with most of this, I think it's maybe a bit silly to pretend that the existence of these events isn't kind of looking for a fight in its own right. A fight worth having, maybe, but still.

If the situation under discussion were something like ""there is a story time event and a trans person happened to read in it"", I think that comparison would hold.

Your comparison only holds if you view drag story time as problematic. Otherwise you can say that about anything that's a bit over the top. Some people don't like clowns, but it would be weird to say that ""clowns go looking for the fight because they bring over the top makeup into the situation"".

Clowns, just like drag story time, are just looking for a fun way to entertain kids. They do the over the top thing because they think it's cool, interesting, and fun, not to be provocative.

No, it doesn't. I don't view it as problematic. I'm trans myself. All that it requires is that I recognize that other people do, and that it is fairly intentionally provoking those people into a fight.

&gt; They do the over the top thing because they think it's cool, interesting, and fun, not to be provocative.

I just don't think that's actually true. There's an unfortunate norm within the queer community to deliberately seek out unaccepting spaces to force confrontations out of a belief that not picking fights is letting bigots win.

There's not *no* truth to that, but at the same time, I do think there's room for recognizing that there's a tradeoff between ""gain in access"" and ""degree to which we make people [even wrongly] uncomfortable"". Respectability politics is a bit of a dirty word in queer circles, and I think that's a mistake - not because I think we should cease to exist for the sake of respectability, but because I think we should be keeping in mind that anti-respectability-politics behavior comes with a cost."

I don’t see anything wrong with it, ethically speaking. Every girl ive seen has spoken english, and appeared to be healthy, comfortable, and in charge of their own business. In my country human trafficking is quite rare according to statistics, so i assume i have never bought sex from a trafficked person. That’s why I’m mostly okay with what i’m doing, with some occasional, minor doubts. Im not rich and that’s why i don’t buy sex nearly as often as i would want to.

The places i don’t go to are those ”thai-massage” places. I know for a fact that i could get my dick wet in those places paying something like half of what i pay to other escorts. But i also know that the girls in those places are trafficked, more often than not. Why the police here does nothing about those places, i don’t know. Maybe it’s just legally difficult. 

Here i see where i seem to have drawn the line. Im okay with the fact that a woman is selling herself, and I’m the buyer, as long as its her decision, and the decision is not based on life and death circumstances. What then constitutes a life and death circumstance for me? Lack of security, food, shelter, basic necessities which we all need in life to survive. 

If some ice princess from Czech Republic would rather have sex with me than go to work in a factory back where she comes from, getting a salary that is indeed low but that would get her all of the basic necessities she needs, that’s fine by me. If some girl from Thailand would rather have sex with me than starve, then that’s not okay with me.

If this is acceptable in minimum wage jobs, or when buying buying and selling goods/services, why is buying sex so inherently different?

UntakenAccountName @ 2022-12-21 02:19:23 :

Wage labor has many ethical problems. There’s a reason it’s colloquially known as “wage slavery”—and two wrongs don’t make a right.  

Just because one person is forced to submit themself to a bad employment situation doesn’t mean that we should force someone else to submit to a different bad employment situation. And most wage labor has regulations and protections in place to prevent harm, sex work is inherently degrading, dehumanizing, cruel and harmful.  

How would our workplace laws even begin to regulate sex work? There’s no real way to mitigate the STD risk, there’s no real way to mitigate the PTSD risk, there’s no real way to mitigate the violence/aggression/stalking/etc risk, I mean… it’s really bad work, let’s be honest.

Already occurs and already doesn’t work because people can catch STDs/STIs in the interval. Porn has a huge problem with this exact issue.  

&gt;PTSD from consensual sex?  

So many ways this can happen. Are you seriously suggesting that people can be traumatized (even unintentionally) by consensual sex? Let’s say a sex worker is working and a client suddenly says or does something traumatic/triggering for them. Even if the client didn’t intend to cause harm, it can happen. I’m just shocked that your point here seems to be that trauma during consensual sex is an impossibility or something. Like what?

&gt;I think you are confusing illegal prostitution which is what we have now with legal prostitution.  

So stripping and dancing (etc) is legal. Why do they have stalking, assault, violence, and similar dangerous problems?

&gt;Also wait, do you think porn and stripping should be illegal?  

Stop trying to set up straw man arguments for yourself.

“And please realize that prostitution involves more vulnerability, proximity, and risk than what currently exists.”  

Pornstars are supposed to have protections to keep the industries safe. Strippers are supposed to have protections to keep the industries safe. Sex work and porn are inherently “rapey” in my honest opinion. How can you have sex with someone while knowing that they wouldn’t be doing it if they weren’t getting paid?  

As the world is right now, too much of all three of those industries look like financial coercion and physical abuse—and worse.  

The sex industry’s existence leads to human trafficking and sex crimes, mainly against poor and/or migrant women, who are largely off the radar, even in big op ed pieces and mainstream criticisms. These victims are very real and they exist in large part because of society’s acceptance of the industry. It’s not a matter of personal freedom or consenting adults  when there are hidden victims and the activity goes beyond two people’s sex lives.

UntakenAccountName @ 2022-12-22 19:20:35 :

I don’t even think that wage labor should be legal. You’re barking up the wrong tree here.  

Can people produce porn ethically: yes. Can people strip ethically: yes. Can people engage in sex work activities ethically: yes. Is it inherently rapey and problematic under our current economic and social systems: yes.  

I’m not saying that any of the things should be illegal in an absolute sense, but I am saying that how they exist today is harmful, dangerous, and inherently violent/exploitative.  

I’m all for sexual liberation, but to me that doesn’t include putting it under the yoke of money and financial control.  

I think most people grapple with these issues because they see that what’s going on is dangerous/harmful/exploitative/etc, but they have an intuitive sense that it doesn’t have to be and could exist ethically; and further, that ideals of personal liberty and freedom insist for it to one day exist in such ethical ways.  

But our current economic and social systems aren’t that utopic future, and acting like we should be reasoning from that world and supporting personal liberty/freedom while we live in a world of financial control and domination is dangerous and harmful. And even if one individual is able to ethically engage in those industries, the industries’ mainstream existence will provide a hiding place for harmful illegal and violent forms of human trafficking and sex crime.  

We make laws and policies for our world, while trying to get to a better world; we don’t make laws and policies for a utopian world and hope for the best.

&gt;Basically you have an issue against wages in general. That is what you said. And you can have that stance, but that's not the topic at hand.

I have a problem with exploitation and harm moreso. And exploitation and harm *are* the topics at hand.

I’m so done talking to you. Are you even reading my replies? Or are you just mashing out the next tirade of misspelled accusations after you skim the first sentence or two?  

To actually reply to you: We have been covering both legal and illegal industries, and my replies reflect that. And porn is very close to prostitution, of course my viewpoints on both are similar. Again, it’s the exploitation and harm that is the problem.  

&gt;With that anyone who believes that porn should be legal or anyone who believes in wages isn't going to agree with your assessment.  

That’s not true in the slightest. People can agree that current forms of both have problems, which is essentially what my argument is. I have not taken an absolutist stance, unlike yourself who seems to think that legalizing things solves all problems and stops all harm. Someone can believe that porn, stripping, sex, etc should exist (like myself) while acknowledging that current commercial forms of it today are very exploitative, harmful, dangerous, and negatively impactful, and thus should be illegal. The world doesn’t have to be this way, but due to the realities we have to live with and our exploitation-based monetary systems, we must do what we can to prevent some levels of harm. Personally, I think that sex work kills, injures, and severely harms people—and that shouldn’t be considered a radical stance because it’s true. Does it have to be this way? No. Is that the way it is? Yes. We should base our laws and regulations in the real world, not some fantasy utopia of personal freedom.

I’m honestly not sure lol. Like how much would it cost without insurance? Probably a lot of money like most things. But plan bs are like 50 bucks and most people don’t buy those with insurance anyway. Condoms are cheap tbh. Forms of birth control for women can get pricey without insurance though.

--------------------------------

saywhatiwanna13 @ 2022-12-25 23:53:02 :

Ive had 2 IUD's. The first one in 2013 cost me $1400 for the device and then about another $2800 for the appointment, procedure, doctors time and whatever other stupid charges they added. It broke me, but I had no insurance, and was a newly single mom of 2 and I knew I couldn't afford another baby even more so I made it work. I kept it in for 6 years because I couldn't afford to get it out on time. 

When I could afford to get it out, I knew I wanted it replaced. That had to be two separate appointments. The removal of the device was $800 and the other charges for the facility and doctor and an ultrasound cost me $4800. Again, there is no insurance. 

I knew I went over budget and could no longer afford to get the new replacement now. I ended up waiting a couple months, which happened to be right before I got married in 2019. Got my replacement with a discount for $1000. Facility, doctor and another ultrasound cost $4300 that time without insurance. 

After 3 months I had to have it removed in the ER. It had floated off into my uterus. That cost $11,600. 

Now, I'm 8 and a half months pregnant. I could never afford to get it replaced. I had scheduled a hysterectomy in June this year. Went in and did the blood tests the day I was supposed to get it and found out I was pregnant. R v W had just been overturned. I was 6 weeks pregnant. 

Now. I have state insurance because I can't work due to a high risk pregnancy. I also am living at the Ronald Mcdonald House next state over and will be here for a total of about 6 months because my baby has a critical heart defect. I may lose my home, everything I own and I'm in debt up to my eyeballs...but they did agree to tie my tubes when I have my son. So there's that. 


As for other forms of birth control, I've tried the pills, patches, shots and the ring. They ranged from $50 to $400 a month but that's been years ago. I stopped using those when I got my first IUD. I looked into them for when I couldn't get my replacement IUD for temporary measures but the proces had gone up and I just couldn't afford it at the time. 

Contraception is expensive. My husband and I used condoms, rhythm method and pulled out. Still ended up pregnant. 

The fact that the state is saying they don't wanna pay for birth control is 100% gonna fuck shit up. It's very targeted and everyone should be pissed. I'm sure my husband and I will find a way to make our lives go alright, but we are nearing 40, are educated and we have skills the world will always need. We can work our way back up. Other people can't.

--------------------------------

ReadItToMePyBot @ 2022-12-28 21:38:42 :

So you worked up to 120 hours a week and still couldn't afford any of the other birth control methods yet you chose to go with the most expensive option available? And then stopped using it because it was too expensive and now you're upset the government wouldn't pay for your birth control? This just doesn't sound like a rational financial decision tbh.

--------------------------------

saywhatiwanna13 @ 2022-12-29 04:15:38 :

Time is also money. Working those kinds of hours doesn't leave a lot of room for doctors appointments. Also, an IUD doesn't feel good. I needed a few days down time with the insertions and removal of each of mine. There was heavy, heavy bleeding, lots of cramping and a general feeling of just not great. It did initially cost more financially but I listed a multitude of reasons why that was the better option for me in another comment. I still believe it was the best option for both my body and my financial situation at the time. 


Now I will be looking into other options such as first getting my tubes tied following the birth of my son and then having a hysterectomy to address the medical issues of my baby maker. Those are obviously more permanent options and those are now options that are valid and attainable. 


Women's health is a serious concern in this country. I should have had a hysterectomy a long time ago. General health care is a concern, but women and minorities are a whole different ballgame. I believe that was the point of things to begin with. Things aren't making sense and now they're making it make even less sense. If medical professionals don't understand the fundamental building blocks to our care, they don't need to be eliminating care options. That includes birth control. 


We know clearly the consequences of not having easily accessible and affordable female contraceptives that are both reliable methods and safe for our bodies. That's what needs to be addressed, not taking away anything at this point. I wish we had better options, but as of yet we do not, so until then, they don't get to take what we do have. Those decisions need to be made by a patient and a doctor. Period. Not by insurance, not by legislators. Our tax dollars are there for a reason and like it or not, this very much is one of them. 


Researching other countries policies and data surrounding the issue is clear evidence to support these facts. Google is just a click away and there are numerous studies from across the globe that support cheap or free and easy to get contraceptives. It's not just about pregnancy and birth. It comes down to a general wellbeing of the entire population.

ReadItToMePyBot @ 2022-12-29 04:55:07 :

Our government is not going to make IUDs freely available. They really arent a great option and your experience with them is a perfect example of why. My wife went through a similar struggle with hers. Nothing about free IUDs is going to be seen as for the general wellbeing of the entire population especially not the cost to the taxpayers. Whether you like it or not, free access to birth control does not entitle you to the specific option that you feel is best for you especially when it comes with a price tag like IUDs do. The government (aka the people, as this is a representative democracy) is who decides if and how a program like that will be put into place. If it were to happen it would almost certainly be one of the far more affordable options that you claimed were too expensive for you to afford while also spending thousands and thousands of dollars on the alternative that failed you by leaving you unable to afford it and thus you ended up pregnant."

Lol horomonal much? You lost me at ""stop worrying about how much you're willing to pay out of your taxes so somebody else can have sex and not worry about pregnancy"". If the left had their way they would take every dollar every person in America made to attempt to cover all the social welfare programs they want covered and it still wouldn't be enough. Clearly you aren't capable of living within your means and that's exactly why you ended up pregnant. You are not entitled to other people's money to cover your preferred method of birth control when there are numerous other affordable and effective methods available. Good luck with your kid cause that's gonna be way more expensive than the 50$ a month you ""couldnt afford"" 🙃

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metzger-restaurant-cancels-reservation-for-christian-family-foundation/

The restaurant said they wouldn't serve this group because their group is anti-LGBT and anti-choice, and serving them would make a lot of their staff uncomfortable and possibly unsafe (since some of the staff is LGBT). The group reserved space at the restaurant and had their reservation pulled once the management realized who it was for.

I don't see how this is different than a bakery or photographer or caterer or wedding planner refusing to serve a gay wedding. Religion and sexual orientation are both federally protected classes, so it's illegal to put up a sign that says ""no gays allowed"" or ""we don't serve black or Mexicans here"" or ""No Catholics"". You can't do that as a business. However, as far as I know, that's not what the restaurant did, nor is it what the infamous bakery did with the gay wedding cake.

You see, that bakery would've likely had no problem serving a gay customer if they wanted a cake for their 9 year old's birthday party. Or if a gay man came in and ordered a fancy cake for his parents 30th wedding anniversary. Their objection wasn't against serving a gay man, but against making a specific product that conflicted with their beliefs.

The same is true at the VA restaurant case. That place serves Christians every day and they have no problem with people of any religious tradition. Their problem is that this specific group endorsed political and social ideology that they found abhorrent.

Not that it matters, but I personally am pro-choice and pro-LGBT, having marched in protest supporting these rights and I'm a regular donor to various political groups who support causes like this.

So I guess my point is that if a restaurant in VA can tell Christians they won't serve them because they see their particular ideology as dangerous or harmful to society, then a baker should be allowed to do the same thing. They can't refuse to serve gays, but they can decline to make a specific product if they don't feel comfortable with the product. Like that one Walmart bakery that refused to write ""Happy Birthday Adolph Hitler"" on a little boy's birthday cake (the kids name really is Adolph Hitler).

So CMV. Tell me what I'm missing here."	"junction182736 @ 2022-12-08 16:34:25 :

I'm no Christian, and I dont care if you are gay, but I have read the Bible, and the Quran for knowledge. Any LGBTQ+ trying to to say Christianity, and Islam are not inherently anti LGBTQ+ need to get real. Any modern day interpretations are just perversions of the original text.   

Must you dictate every religion? Must EVERY believe adhere to your way of life?

It works quite well in context, actually.

No.

&gt;No. The Nation-state dictates the actions of the corporations under a corporatist system through a system of central planning. That's not capitalism.  


That's a form of corporatism popular in Mussolini's Italy, but the concept predates that by thousands of years and isn't that narrow of a definition.

See how annoying that is?  See how it adds literally nothing to the conversation and only focuses on being contrarian to certain points rather than taking a person's argument as a whole, understanding it, and actually countering the argument rather than the statement?  Plus, focusing on each and every thing you disagree with without understanding how the argument is strung together leaves you looking like an idiot where you're disagreeing with a precursor to a point as if it was a point itself.  

Selective usage is good when it drives a point home, or when a specific statement embodies the crux of the argument you want to counter.  However, blanket usage of each and every statement is just exhaustive.  It adds literally zero to a conversation.  Plus, it intentionally dissembles the conversation by taking one talking point and turning them into dozens.  

From there, you just hope that a person gets lost or spends too much time combating a dozen different mini arguments rather than the actual point being made, with the belief that the loss of a specific point out of dozens invalidates an entire argument.

  
It doesn't.

Neither mercantilism nor corporatism is capitalism. Mercantilism represents a liminal point between feudalist economics and capitalist economics and would be best described as proto-capitalistic. Corporatism fails the most foundational requirement of capitalism, that being private control of capital, and is best classified as economically third positional. 

&gt;Plus, the inclusion of ""feudalism,"" which isn't even an economic system, leads me to believe that their definitions simply aren't being held to any rigorous metric.

That's not a useful statement.  Capitalism is simply too wide of a definition that encompasses way too many economic theories which can co-exists with each other.  We have not invested nearly enough time or effort into other forms of economic theory to either prove or disprove your statements.  It's like stating that the Earth is the most ideal planet for life - congrats, you have a sample of 1, and are making sweeping statements from it.

&gt;Neither mercantilism nor corporatism is capitalism

I'm sorry, but you're being hypocritical here.  You're stating that social democracies are capitalist, but yet corporatism and mercantilism aren't.  These things have never really existed in a vacuum, and the only examples of them have been within a capitalist framework.  If social democracies, where the government owns the means of production (ie, not private control of capital) of a subset of goods and services, then by your logic it should be held apart.  But for some reason, you don't do that.

By your own reasoning that social democracies are capitalist, so must these two.  You cannot have it both ways, because trying to do so is contradictory.

&gt;Feudalism is a system of political and economic organization while not solely an economic system it clearly has an economic element.

Sure?  It's not an economic model, though.  Most feudal states were, by definition, capitalistic.  Some used other economic models, but at least in Europe it was a mostly capitalistic system.

Yes.

Indeed. Mercantilism couldn't exist in a vacuum because it served as a transitional phase between feudalist economics and capitalistic economics. Corporatism couldn't exist in a vacuum since by it's very nature it must syncretize elements from both socialism and capitalism. 

&gt; and the only examples of them have been within a capitalist framework.

That's manifestly not true. 

&gt;If social democracies, where the government owns the means of production (ie, not private control of capital) of a subset of goods and services,

The government doesn't own the means of production under social democracy. 

&gt;Sure? It's not an economic model, though.

It's as much an economic model as it is a political one.

Simply trying to pick and choose sentences to rebut with a ""yes"" or a ""no"" isn't really going to cut it.  It's like ""baby's first internet argument"" level of effort, and it's not really all that good, or effective.

As far as the points I assume you're trying to make, then you seem to be making up facts to fit your argument.

First off, capitalism, as it is defined, is the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.  That, by and large, is a very broad definition.  

If you want to use the far more narrow definition of zero government oversight or control over the economy, then that becomes a far more narrow definition.  That would help some of your arguments - namely that mercantilism and corporatism aren't capitalist.  However, this would mean that, by that same logic, social democracies are not capitalistic.  If government intervention means the system isn't capitalism, then social democracies are not capitalist.

That would be a very dumb argument.  Clearly social democracies are capitalist societies.  However, by that same token, so are mercantile ones and corporatist ones.

Mercantilism is a form of economic theory that prioritizes exports over imports.  Historically, the countries that are/were mercantalistic were capitalist - individuals in those countries had ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.  The only difference here is the degree of government intervention to impose nationalistic policies limiting the types of trade possible across borders.  In short, the two are not mutually exclusive.

By the same logic, corporatism is moving the onus of governance of the economy over to trades and classes.  There is still the potential for ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit in these systems, depending on your social class.

Again, the issue here is the degree of control over the concept of capitalism.  If you allow for \*some\* control of the market, and still call it capitalism - like you do for social democracies - then you must allow for the same definition to apply elsewhere.  

For the average person in any of these economic systems, they would see relatively no difference.  They would still work.  They would make money.  They would spend that money on goods or invest it into businesses or organizations with the intent for the accumulation of wealth.  Because, at their core, these all operate on the same basic fundamental principles of capitalism.

And, finally with regards to these systems, feudalism is not an economic system.  You can keep trying to argue that it's so, but it's not.  It was a classist system.  For some classes, there was a form capitalism available to them.  For others, there weren't.  If some people being barred access to capitalism means an economy isn't capitalist, then I would argue that would eliminate a lot of things you might consider capitalist, to include the US.

You seem to be giving exceptions for one thing, but not the others.  If government intervention on capitalism makes something not-capitalist, then social democracies aren't capitalist.  If you're carving a caveat out for those, but not others, then you're being contradictory.

So, you can either continue being contradictory, or you can define the terms your working off of, as well as explicitly state the reasoning behind your arguments.  Until then, we're at an impasse.

&gt; By the same logic, corporatism is moving the onus of governance of the economy over to trades and classes. There is still the potential for ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit in these systems, depending on your social class

No. The Nation-state dictates the actions of the corporations under a corporatist system through a system of central planning. That's not capitalism. 

&gt;Again, the issue here is the degree of control over the concept of capitalism. 

The issue is that you created a definition, argued against it, then thought that somehow proved something. 

&gt;For the average person in any of these economic systems, they would see relatively no difference. 

I mean the average person under a capitalistic system wouldn't be starving so they would see that difference. 

&gt;And, finally with regards to these systems, feudalism is not an economic system.

It's a system of political and economic organization. 

&gt;For some classes, there was a form capitalism available to them. 

No. 

&gt;For others, there weren't.

For nobody there was. Capitalism didn't exist. 

&gt; If some people being barred access to capitalism means an economy isn't capitalist

Nobody had access to capitalism because it didn't exist. 

&gt;So, you can either continue being contradictory

Nothing I've said has been contradictory."	"IbnKhaldunStan @ 2023-02-05 02:57:12 :

&gt;Nah.

Stay with on this, yah. 

&gt;It works quite well in context, actually.

The context that you created it so you argue against it. 

&gt;That's a form of corporatism popular in Mussolini's Italy, but the concept predates that by thousands of years and isn't that narrow of a definition.

Nope. You don't understand economics. 

&gt;Just working with what you give me.

No, you're creating something on your own and then arguing against it. 

&gt;ummm....

You apparently don't know what the word average means. 

&gt;No...mostly just political.

No also economic. 

&gt;It most certainly did.

Nope. You again don't understand economics. 

&gt;It did.

No. 

&gt;Actually, a lot has.

No."

You clearly haven’t done any research on why trans people are trans or why they transition. Yes gender is supposed to equal sex, that is why gender dysphoria or *gender incongruence* exists. 

That happens when the brain is not the same sex as the body and makes the person believe they’re the opposite sex, because their brain is wired to expect the opposite hormones their body is providing. 

There have been multiple studies that show trans women typically have a female leaning sexed brain and that trans men typically have a male leaning sexed brain. 

Transitioning allows that feeling of dysphoria (which is a sense of wrongness) to alleviate and in some cases even completely disappear. 

I am a trans person and I do not agree with your statement, in fact I find it quite insulting. It’s a medical condition that we seek treatment for, not a mental illness. 

I will say that there is a large percentage of the trans community that believes being trans is a choice, I’m purposefully not talking about those people. I’m talking about transmedicalism.

We just want to live our lives and be happy, is that so much to ask? Are we really inconveniencing you so much by asking to change the name and pronouns you use for us? 

The suicide rate for trans people is extremely high and there are multiple sources that say so. Here’s one:

We just want to be happy man and people like you are what contributes to this suicide rate.

libertysailor @ 2023-02-18 13:14:27 :

I did. The mistake here is that it’s correlational. Female brains are different than male brains on average, but none of those differences are defining characteristics of the female sex.

It would be paramount to saying that a tall female’s height is of the male sex. Heights don’t have sexes, and height doesn’t define sex. It’s just a correlation.

There are differences in the brains of male and female people.

They’re not *categorically* different but they’re different enough that a difference can be spotted and one can tell if someone has a female or male sexed brain. That’s why I said “leaning” in my original comment.

--------------------------------

libertysailor @ 2023-02-18 13:24:31 :

That doesn’t contradict my point. Being categorical is a requirement here - if it’s merely a trend, and not a defining characteristic, then it’s not truly a “female” or “male” brain. Rather, it would be a brain that’s more similar to that typically seen in females - the difference between those two statements is subtle but crucial. Merely being similar by correlation and not by definition makes it paramount to calling someone’s height male or female. For instance, a 6’4” female would be a massive statistical anomaly, but we still would not call her height “male”, because height does not define sex.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2023-02-18 13:35:48 :

Why is being categorical a requirement? Brains are not categorical, so it doesn’t make sense to try and put them in categories. The brain being shaped more towards one sex causes dysphoria,  which is treated by transitioning. We can’t just change our brains. According to all of this we’ve established that there’s no clear cut female and male brain, so we shouldn’t use that as an excuse not to allow people treatment.

--------------------------------

libertysailor @ 2023-02-18 13:38:17 :

I think you’re assuming that I have some sort of behavioral complaint here. I am speaking of the category itself, and you just explicitly agreed with me. Brains are not categorical. They don’t have sexes. 

If transitioning makes someone happier, cool. Whatever works for them.

--------------------------------

[deleted] @ 2023-02-18 13:39:25 :

I just provided sources that say they have defined differences between sexes. They may not be 100% *categorically* sexed but they are still *leaning* towards one sex more than the other more often than not. Males tend to have one brain structure and females tend to have another.

--------------------------------

libertysailor @ 2023-02-18 13:47:57 :

I read through all 3 of those and I didn’t see a single sentence state that they define sexes. 

In any case, those sources all state one thing: that there are indisputable common differences between brains observed between members of the male and female sex. 

Yes, they are leaning towards what is typically seen in one sex vs the other. But that doesn’t make the brains have a sex themselves.

I think we fundamentally agree on the substance here, it’s more of a linguistic issue."	"libertysailor @ 2023-02-18 14:00:23 :

Making inappropriate jokes in front of kids is different to doing it on a show to which adults should know what they're getting into. Besides doing that at a school where the kids don't have a choice. No one is saying you get cancelled for making those jokes to kids, they're saying you get removed. It probably would hurt your career because this is another issue, not of people cancelling someone over being offended, but rather someone being inappropriate to children.

You seem to blatantly miss out on important details and context, if I were you I'd stop arguing because it's embarrassing to argue this way."	0	0	stop arguing comment					"I recently had a debate with someone who thought that certain things are not okay to laugh at and I completely disagree.

I think EVERYTHING can be funny if the joke it told the proper way. I would even say I’ve probably heard/seen something funny about every serious, sad, horrific and distressing subject matter.

There is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about. 

* Time &amp; place: I don’t think unsolicited jokes will be received well and that’s understandable. In passing, on the street, at work, at school or even among friends. If someone comes to a show or chooses to watch/listen to media with jokes, I think that those are the few places where *everything* is okay to joke about. Telling a sexist joke to someone while they are looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time. 


So given the proper time and place, I think everything has the green light. I am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way. I’m not saying no one will be offended, doesn’t make it less funny for some either. 

There is nuance, there is talent when it comes to jokes. Not everyone can write and or perform them as well as others.

So let’s see if you can come up with something that I have not found humorous. Give me a topic. If I’ve never heard something humorous about it, we can discuss why it isn’t okay."	"Hellioning @ 2023-03-14 04:16:49 :

Why do you think that agreeing to see a piece of media with comedy means you're supposed to be okay with seeing any sort of comedy?

People are allowed to joke about whatever they want. People are allowed to call them assholes about it.

-UnclePhil- @ 2023-03-14 04:23:54 :

You know what you are getting into. You know the risk and you came there for that. You put yourself in a situation to hear about things being poked at. I’m not saying you will find storm funny in that situation. I’m not saying you’ll personally be okay with any of it. I am saying in that situation it is simply acceptable for anything to be talked about and made light of.

Hellioning @ 2023-03-14 04:37:08 :

So if I go to a Disney movie advertised as a kids comedy movie, I don't get to complain about it making fun of, for example, the holocaust?

--------------------------------

-UnclePhil- @ 2023-03-14 04:44:08 :

1) This is a hyperbole. You just made up something ridiculous that you have absolutely no true belief it would ever happen or has happened. *”What if you went to Disney on Ice and Sebastian the Crab pulled Ariels bra up as a joke”* I can come up with absurd things too. But let me not get ahead of myself, do you fully believe that a joke like that would be made in G rated kids move? 
2) Regardless of point 1, I never said you couldn’t complain. 
3) Regardless of point 1 again, doesn’t mean it’s not okay to joke about the Holocaust (or any Genocide).

--------------------------------

Hellioning @ 2023-03-14 04:51:40 :

If you don't believe in incredibly broad statements like 'you should expect any joke when watching a comedy' then don't make them.

-UnclePhil- @ 2023-03-14 04:55:34 :

So do you truly believe subject matter like that would be placed in a kids movie blatantly? 

The movie is rated G… you do know what you’re getting in to. It’s Disney, you know what you’re getting in to. 

If you go see a comedian’s solo show you know if they are fouled mouth or clean.

What if I tomorrow call myself a comedian and convince a local school to allow me to perform for their 10-year-olds. I then show up and start cracking jokes about the Holocaust and about the Rwandan genocide.   

According to you, this is fine on my part because the school should've known what they were getting themselves into?

Dazius06 @ 2023-03-14 11:06:49 :

It wouldn't be the end of the world, you would be kicked out the moment you make your first joke and rightfully not get any pay. So what ia the problem in this scenario?

--------------------------------

NoTrollHerePls @ 2023-03-14 11:09:54 :

If kicking people out for making jokes is OK to you, then what's the problem with Netflix kicking a comedian off for making inappropriate jokes?    
Or audience members refusing to go to a certain comedian because of inappropriate jokes?     

Nobody is arresting comedians for making jokes. OP's entire argument hinges on the notion that comedians shouldn't be ""cancelled"" for making jokes. But here you are, saying it's fine to cancel me for making jokes to kids.   

So basically, you agree with me that it is fine to cancel comedians and thus you disagree with OP."
