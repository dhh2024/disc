No one's upset that someone is asking if they would swap seats. They're upset that people get indignant and rude when told no about swapping seats. A lot people think they deserve everything as long as they ask nicely. But that's just not how the world works.	61	0

Everyone’s body is different. My mom for example takes a PPI. It gave my stomach the worst pain. Imagine if someone made me take that in order to work or go see my favorite band or whatever and they likely would if it was a vaccine because I don’t have a documented allergy.

The worst part is you can’t get rid of a vaccine if you were to have a problem and if there’s a complication they’re not legally responsible 

I thought drugs were not something to take lightly like a lot of them you need a prescription and OTCs have warning labels.	2	0

But again, you're just replacing ""assault weapon"" with ""weapon that makes mass murder easy"" so is that how you define assault weapon or no? 

It either is how you define it or it's not.  If it's not, how do you personally define ""assault weapon""? 

We absolutely need to know how you define ""assault weapon"" if you're advocating banning ""assault weapons"".	1	0

If so, then I think you should take a big look in the mirror and reevaluate your politics.    
    
The US is in itself controlled by the right wing, whether they serve the presiendet or not does not change their political stance. Vietnam didn’t become capitalist when they took out the Khmer Rougue.    
   
I do know what bigotry is. What are your points that have led to you being attacked?       
   
That’s not true, the entirety of the Cold War consisted of right wing invasions and counter invasions on communist societies, which were also warring but on a lesser extent. And what’s wrong with the growth of Islam? Surely you mean the growth of radical Islam, which is the result of wars in the Middle East and the supply of terrorists such as Osama bin laden against the Soviets by the US.    
   
What you said isn’t true.
