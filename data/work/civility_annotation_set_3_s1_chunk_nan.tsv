Blood has a saturation percentage that propogates oxygen where the body needs it most... In times of stress it is mitigated from extremities to keep the brain and heart going more... Depending on how much anxiety you have you will notice pins and needles... That is the lack of oxygen in those areas... Your mind slowly over time can learn how to handle stress better and you are able to control that instinctual process... Also increasing your immune system will help your body protect itself again stress and will help prevent stress from creating a cascade effect in your body	2	0

If they got stuck somewhere in their natural environment, eventually they'd figure a way out. If they get caught in a trap, they've only got until the fisherman comes back to get out. This is also presupposing that they *want* to get out. Most traps have bait, which encourages them to stay.	2	0

That's true, yup. If you've ever heard of a PET scan, that stands for ""positron emission tomography."" The positron is the antiparticle of the electron.

Antiparticles are an important part of the Standard Model and are very well understood. They act just like regular particles, but all their properties (except mass) are the opposite. An electron has negative charge, but a positron has positive. When matter and antimatter meet, they ""annihilate"" and form radiation, usually gamma.

The real question about antimatter isn't what its properties and so on are, but why there's so much more matter than antimatter in the universe. We can explain why there should be slightly more matter than antimatter, but not the amount that we see.

&gt;So if this turns out to be true, what changes? Do we have to go back to the drawing board?

No, not really. The Standard Model still works perfectly fine in some contexts. You just have to know which model to use.

It's just like how it's perfectly fine to use Newtonian physics to predict the trajectory of a baseball. Newton certainly wasn't right about everything, but he got baseballs right, so that's still useful. Also, if I have some new idea which disagrees with what Newton says about how baseballs behave, I know my idea is wrong, so that saves me the time of exploring it further.

We already know that the Standard Model doesn't work completely. It doesn't describe gravity, for one thing, and it can't explain why neutrinos have mass (in the Standard Model they are massless, which is not true). What physicists are doing now is working out ""extensions"" to the Standard Model which introduce new particles and so on to fix its problems. Another approach is in string theory, which is sort of a different ""road"" you can take to get the same physics that the Standard Model predicts.

So if this turns out to be true, we may start working on adding a fifth force to the Standard Model, or introduce a new mechanism to one of the existing forces that we didn't think would be there.	10	0

The concern stems from a two-decade long congressionally imposed cap on federal support for graduate medical education (GME) through the Medicare program, which is the largest public contributor to GME funding for residencies. The Medicare cap effectively freezes a teaching hospitalâ€™s Medicare GME support at 1996 levels â€” despite efforts by teaching hospitals, medical schools, physicians, and the AAMC, among others, to get Congress to raise the cap to fund more graduate training slots and help meet the health needs of the U.S aging population.	14	0

You could make the argument that New World countries with large indigenous communities also have that level of diversity, but it's a lot more isolated and limited as compared to the countries of the subcontinent. Additionally I'd argue much of Africa has that too, especially since tribes with diverse cultures and languages were haphazardly split and lumped together by European colonialists.

Part of the reason it's less common now is that European countries were once linguistically and culturally diverse, but many centuries of ethnic conflicts slowly led to specific subcultures carving out their own local monopolies, and retaining complete sovereignty from one another. Whereas in the Indian subcontinent, the various cultures became connected under a single sovereign umbrella. Part of it is due to colonialism, part of it due to the fact that the Indian subcontinent is a distinct geological entity (especially due to the greater Himalayas) that made more sense to colonize as one large entity, and the British became its sole colonial rulers for most of its history (as opposed to, say, in Africa where the entire continent just got carved up separately during the colonial era).	1	0
