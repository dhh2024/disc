Most people don‚Äôt make analytical decisions when talking about their own lives and challenges.

This is kind of amusing to me, because I believe so fiercely in doing everything I can to communicate effectively. I get scientific papers back from review with a side note thanking me for making the draft manuscript readable.

But this kind of communication is an asynchronous conversation, and people speak in their own voices.

It doesn‚Äôt require policing or condescension or judgement on extra letters or syllables.You just figure it out and meet halfway. Trust me. I‚Äôm one of three people managing an online community that swells to several hundred people when we hit the on-season, and a lot of them are new to each other and from different backgrounds.

Of course there are misunderstandings. Of course there are different communication styles. There can be clashes and conflict because of this.

The vast majority of the time, it‚Äôs very easily sorted and I don‚Äôt even have to step in. When I do, I assume good faith. That‚Äôs one of our most useful rules. We have a high tolerance for diversity of views and misunderstandings‚Ä¶ and a zero tolerance for bs, whether that‚Äôs passive aggressiveness, trolling or just basic rudeness; once people have had any misinterpretations or worrisome behaviours explained, it‚Äôs almost always fine.

If you‚Äôre annoyed at encountering an acronym you‚Äôre unfamiliar with, that‚Äôs understandable enough. Anything that interrupts a reading/listening flow can be jarring.

Your discomfort doesn‚Äôt mean that expression needs to be policed. It‚Äôs a one-off, as most things like this tend to be. That‚Äôs a case where self-policing is the order of the day.

Being contemptuous of other people‚Äôs communication styles doesn‚Äôt make you smart or special.

(I‚Äôm out at this point. I feel I‚Äôve addressed my point and the importance of extending a little tolerance and grace to others, and I‚Äôm off to go get in the sea. I won‚Äôt reply further.)	3	0

Toddler crawled into bed with me some time last night. Must've had a very full diaper, cause when I woke up not only were the sheets peed on, but my top, my sports bra and on me. Thank goodness for the mattress cover saving the mattress lol

I just scooped up all the peed on stuff once she woke up, and off to the wash. 

It's just pee. Whatever. After having a kid, the ick factor of having bodily fluids, or occasionally solids, getting on you wears right off.	4	0

He should have claimed it was a finder's fee. Hell, even lie and say he was on the hook for $2k if it went south. That's a white lie that keeps the peace.

I mean I'm not a dad, but it also takes me like two seconds to see this shit coming and how easy it was to prevent it andI would think as a parent spending more time around people who act on baser emotions rather than adult logic would have a better chance of seeing what was obviously coming, but i guess not.

OP isn't an asshole, obviously, he just has a debilitating lack of EQ.	2	0
