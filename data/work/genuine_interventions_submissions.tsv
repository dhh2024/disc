It's not the (unsurprising) amount of Zimmerman supporters. It's the sheer fucking air of privilege that hangs over them. It's the fact that they're grasping at the thinnest of straws. Like they really don't understand the bigger picture. It's like they're so uncomfortable with the thought of having an actual discussion about race and how minorities are treated in this country that they vehemently deny it's existence and avoid it.

This case is about race. It was about race the moment the entire world decided to disect Travyon Martin underneath a microscope knowing damn well if some pretty white boy got killed by ""the violent"" black man (because I've had people on here actually claim that black people are genetically more violent) this would've gone a lot (faster) and easier and a black man would be sitting in a jail somewhere, not out with his daughter eating ice cream at chic-fil-a.

1. Atheism: The way science goes about disproving something is by finding evidence to the contrary. Many religions can be put down through evidence pointing otherwise but some cannot as of yet. Since all religious claims cannot be refuted it's respectful to the scientific method to not completely denounce religions plausibility.

2.Religion: There is no definitive proof of a God or supernatural force acting on the universe anywhere (no, m-theory doesn't count). That being said, faith is what allows people to hold religious beliefs. I think these people aren't being responsible to themselves because faith simply is a delusion.

Those points being stated I think holding a position of admitted ignorance is both respectful to the possibility that faith is necessary in life and the notion that delusions are not a great thing to incorporate all over your life. CMV."	73	258

Why do I hold this view: I try to make an honest effort to know what I am talking about. I previously held the opposite belief, and I had read up on the subject wanting to be better able to defend my views. I came away with the opposite conclusion. Here is why:

1) IQ is a reasonable quantification of, if not your preferred definition of ""intelligence"", then certainly what most people would call being smart. A person's IQ score is correlated with the type of life outcomes we would expect smartness to be correlated with, such as success in certain pursuits, lower likelihood of prison, and so on.

2) The relative average performance of the various racial and ethnic groups is in line with what your average klan member would have predicted, and has been extensively documented. 

3) The differences have not been mitigated by attempts to control for environmental variables such as, controling for household income, twin adoption studies, trans racial adoption studies. 

4) Serious academics risk their reputations by discussing racial differences, are especially reluctant to discuss differences in intelligence, and often have ideological reasons not to draw certain conclusions. 

5) The hypothesis described in [""Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence#.22Natural_History_of_Ashkenazi_Intelligence.22)  seems plausible, and an adapted version could be proposed to apply universally: that in a civilized society, there are opportunities for the intelligent to be more socially and reproductively successful than they might have been in a hunter-gatherer society, placing a selective pressure on intelligence. 

I don't feel that we can know what the relative intelligence of the races were prior to the advent of civilization, when they were all hunter gatherers. 

But, with respect to current populations, those that score the lowest are from groups that were late adopters of civilized society, such as Sub-Saharan Africans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.

In conclusion, I believe that when it comes to stereotypes about intelligence, where there is smoke there is fire (perhaps making an exception for the Polish). 

I would prefer that the facts not support this view, but I currently believe that they do. CMV.

UPDATE: Many contributors have discussed the IQ disparity between American Blacks and Whites, and the existence of socioeconomic factors that may explain the disparity. 

I acknowledge that this is an excellent point, but would like to point out that IQ disparities exist between groups without the unique set of circumstances that exists between American Blacks and Whites. If other ethnic/racial groups can be acknowledged in the discussion I would appreciate it.

UPDATE: I have been convinced that the jury is still out. May be true, may not be, but too early to be firm.

&amp;#8710; to /u/problygonnaregrethis

&gt; The best form of evidence would likely be precise genome mapping, in which we can both identify the direct genes that correspond to intelligence, determine that these genes are substantially more impactful than environmental, neonatal, or cultural factors, and prove that these genes fall heavily on racial and ethnic lines.
More importantly though, keep in mind that with the scientific method, the burden of proof falls on the claim. If it were theoretically impossible to ever have the evidence to make these conclusions, that doesn't mean we just default to ""Well, close enough"", it means we say ""The evidence is not there to make these conclusions, and the evidence may well be impossible because these conclusions are too broad, complex, and sweeping to ever fully prove; as such, we default to ""unproven""."	27	116

For those who aren't familiar with the term, here is [the Wikipedia article on otherkin.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin)

I believe this identification comes from one of two possibilities.

First, it might come from the person actually believing themselves to be non-human, which would be the case of having some kind of mental disorder as, differently from trans* people, identification as human or not doesn't involve any kind of sexual hormones. If the person really believes they share their body with a non-human entity, it would be the case of having a multiple personality disorder.

The second possibility would be that of the person pretending to have that other personality. This would be similar to a child having an imaginary friend and, although mostly harmless, it is nonetheless childish. If the person is faking it, though, it would be similar to a kid who lies about having something that doesn't even exist (""my cousin from japan already got me a PS5!1!!"") in order to try and make themselves special in a group."	38	36

It is taught in schools as a dark time in their country's history.  I believe slavery should be viewed in the same light here in America.  I think most people agree that slavery was wrong and is a stain on American history, but we don't really seem to act on that belief.  In Germany, if you display a Nazi flag you can be jailed and in America the same flag is met with outright disgust, in most cases. But displaying a Confederate flag, which is symbolic of slavery, is met with indifference and in some cases, joy.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qozlc/many_people_who_would_never_date_a_transgender/	"I want to preface by saying that there are many reasons why a person wouldn't want to date a trans that probably don't stem from transphobia:

-They have sexual characteristics you aren't attracted to (eg MtF has a penis, FtM has a vagina)

-They can't have kids (Though its worth noting that MtFs can save sperm)

-You don't find an individual trans person attractive (If you don't find someone attractive, then you're not prejudice for not dating them, however I do think that if you say you won't date trans people because you don't find trans people attractive then there is prejudice there, as you're judging the appearances of all trans people)

-They have a personality or characteristics that you don't like

There are a few more I'm sure but those are the main ones.

I've encountered many people who both would and would not date a transgender person. Take this situation. Lets say there is a beautiful, absolutely gorgeous post-op (meaning shes had operations and hormones to change her physical appearance to that of her preferred gender) girl. Its entirely possible that a trans girl can be absolutely gorgeous, and on top of that look 100% female with her clothes on or off. Now I've met many men who would never date this girl. I could show them a picture of said girl and they would say ""wow nice she is absolutely sexy, 10/10 would tap"". As soon as I say she is transgender, they would say that there is no way they would date or hook up with her. This is the part that I find to be transphobic, and this is no way an unusual response. 

So of course I follow up by asking why they would not date her. They say, because she used to be a guy before. I'll ask why that makes a difference and one common response is that they're not attracted to guys. But she isn't a guy. She is about as much a guy as a piece of paper is a tree. Would you not date a women who used to be utterly unattractive and unappealing? No that probably wouldn't bother you at all as long as she is attractive now and here forward. For all intents and purposes, unless you're giving her surgery you would never even figure out she was ever physically a guy on your own. It's simply completely irrelevant that she is trans. I'd say that the person's discomfort with trans people is  the actual main reason why they would dismiss her completely. Thats not enitrely unexpected though as society is very transphobic and people often make fun of those who date transgender people.

Now one thing that many people argue against me is that ""How could I be transphobic for not wanting to be with someone, I mean, I'm simply not attracted to her because I found out she is trans.If I'm not attracted to her then how is that transphobia, didn't you just say that attraction isn't representative of prejudice?"" But the reality of the situation is that they are attracted to her, they are just uncomfortable with her. That discomfort is transphobia. If that person was fully comfortable with trans people as some people are, I bet they would be perfectly fine with dating them. I've never met a person who I've felt to be open and understanding about transgender people who would also have a problem with dating a post-op transgender person for reasons other than the ones I listed at the beginning.

I've also met people who view this situation as a matter of sexual orientation. i.e. A straight guy may say that his sexual orientation is just cis girls, or a bi person might say that they are only attracted to cis people and so they wouldn't date a trans person. I think the biggest flaw with this is that sexual orientation isn't representative of who you would date. Sexual orientation is representative of who you're attracted to. If you can completely within reason fall in love with a transgender person and spend your whole life with them and never know they're trans, then how can you say that you aren't attracted to them? Even in a situation where you're dating someone for a year and then find out they're trans, its not like your sexual orientation just magically kicked in and made you unattracted to them at that point. If you were in love with them for a year and then suddenly stopped based on a fact about their past, then it's not a matter of sexual orientation.  And I'd bet that if this person was completely not transphobic, he would recognize that it changes absolutely nothing about the relationship and his only beef would be that she kept something so significant about herself from him for so long. (that being said, I'd like to point out that transgender people have a lot of reason to keep the fact that they're trans from people, even people they're dating. Thats a very tricky situation in and of itself though that I'm not going to delve into though)

And one final thing I'd like to make clear, I don't think a person is transphobic for not wanting to date transgender people. I'm saying that in many cases the reason a person wouldn't date a transgender person is transphobic.

Many people of faith claim that without religion to guide us we would have no civilization, decency, or charity to our fellow man. These claims are completely false as I believe these values are inherit to our species.

CMV	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/20lzoe/i_think_bestiality_is_morally_wrong_harmful_and/	With consent, it involves basic communication, so human language at least. So since they don't speak, and can't consent, they can't say no, so we truly don't know if they really want it. Most animals mate to reproduce, and that's their instinct. Dogs don't just randomly have sex for enjoyment, they do it to have puppies, and it applies to other animals. Someone can truly hurt an animal by having sex with them, especially if they're physically small animals. They cannot possibly understand what their owner is doing. It is completely wrong, and not good for the dog. If a dog truly doesn't want it, I think they can be traumatized. There have been documented cases where a dog was hurt, and had fear, and trust issues with men. It's just like beating a dog. Consent also implies an ability to understand the situation the being is in. It's just like a child. They truly don't understand it. If dogs that are continually raped they can show signs of trauma, like aggression, paranoia, insecurity, depression, and nightmares, in the same way they would if they were abused in other ways. Most animals do not have sex for the same way humans do. We should treat animals with some humanity, so that means not abusing them. If you would have sex with dogs, would you also think it's okay to beat them? It is also a crime in most states, and it's against the law for a reason. It's a fetish, not a sexual orientation, and it involves something harmful to another living being so therefore it is wrong.	6	152

I thought it was quite fair to the hijackers. They were portrayed as being otherwise normal human beings, in very tough circumstances, in a complex situation (I never knew that these pirates had 'bosses' so to speak). I thought the pirates were portrayed with great, and very sensitive, equanimity. They weren't portrayed as monsters, and the white crew weren't portrayed as morally superior heroes. 

The US military was portrayed as the technologically superior, faceless, heartless, precise killing machine that it is (though not always so precise, but in this instance it was). Maybe some fan-boys of military tech might get off on this, but that definitely didn't feel like the point of the movie. Captain Phillips may have been portrayed as perhaps more stoic and level-headed than maybe he was in real life, but I don't know. And that's what we expect from any protagonist.

I think it would certainly have been silly and disingenuous to portray the pirates in any different light, given the actual events, and the actual background to those events. The pirates didn't kill anybody, but they got killed and captured. How were they supposed to be portrayed? Like a modern version of Saladin and his heroes? Come on. 

Anyway, I can only concede that the movie focused more on the actual hostage taking and US military response, and not as much proportionately as the background to the pirates themselves. However, I think it provided as much background to the pirates as was necessary to the narrative to make the audience understand that these pirate guys weren't evil, but human, and there but the grace of God go you were you to be born under those circumstances."	200	157

It always made me feel like a bad person, but I will always put my company and my family's welfare over some employee's decision to get pregnant and simply force me to pay them not to come to work for two years while somehow managing with the workload she was getting paid to do, when you can simply hire a man with all the benefits without any of the troubles that employing women gives you. And that's without even opening the sexual harassment lawsuit can of worms, that although not the main reason, certainly doesn't help at all (it's not that I want to sexually harass women, it's just opening up yourself to liabilities). I also refuse to hire handicapped people for the same reason, maybe they are perfectly qualified for the job but why hire them and open myself up to many things that a regular man who is equally qualified would not give me, I don't see it.

I am not a mysoginist, or at least I don't think so, my personal secretary, the one who actually runs the fucking place, is a woman. I have no problem employing 50+ year-old qualified women, it's just that those women aren't really in the business of sending CV's anymore for important positions and people in management positions are there for being good at their jobs for years in the first place before being promoted, something women can't do. I just don't see a single reason to hire a woman over a man, and many *many* reasons not to, I believe my financial security and my company's health are far more important than social justice. I think this is a logical position to take, CMV."	148	632

I am aware that vegans claim that vegan diets are healthy, but since vegans are against any product which is produced by an animal, they don't even let their kids drink milk or eat cheese. I am all for parental rights, but a vegan diet is simply too restrictive.

Meat provides protean in much larger doses than what is found in vegan food, even dairy products have far more calcium and protein than anything vegans eat. I am fine if vegan parents want to encourage veganism, but the child should at the very least have the option to eat meat and/or dairy products. Also, eggs provide many more health benefits than vegan food.

As a final statement, I am not against a healthy diet, but children should have the option to eat meat, dairy products, and eggs rather than be forced to only eat vegan food. Also, I am fine with parents limiting portions, however as long as the parents can afford to buy meat, dairy products, and eggs, the child should have the option to eat that rather than a vegan diet.

4855832	changemyview	136614758	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/29c4me/cmvi_do_not_think_affirmative_action_is_wrong/	2014-06-28 18:27:26		YoungAthleticOne	CMV:I do not think affirmative action is wrong	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/29c4me/cmvi_do_not_think_affirmative_action_is_wrong/	"The statement ""affirmative action is wrong"" is very subjective. This can be twisted in many ways. For the purpose of intellectual honesty, we should argue whether affirmative action helps minorities more than it hurts those in the majority. We should also examine whether or not injury to the majority is such that affirmative action is unjust, regardless of its positive affect on minorities.

I would argue that though there are examples of affirmative action being injurious to the very organization employing it, there are far greater examples of affirmative action helping society overall. This may be indicative of the application of affirmative action in different settings, but the overall intent of affirmative action, as well as the primary benefits are not ""wrong"" by any measure I can think of.

Opponents make a misguided attempt to show that affirmative action is wrong based on emotional appeals, and irrelevant statements about one group that has benefited from affirmative action (blacks). They further implies those in the majority ""suffer"" from affirmative action. Opponents also imply that affirmative action is some kind of punishment against whites for having enslaved blacks. All these statements are based on a misguided interpretation of how affirmative action works, and who it benefits.

According to the National Council on State Legislatures, President John F. Kennedy first coined the term in an Executive Order urging that contractors use ""affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."" This led to the establishment of the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), and EEO policies in the workplace. Lyndon Johnson later issued his own Executive Order requiring contractors to raise their number of minority workers. Colleges and Universities later executed similar policies in recruiting in order to boost their number of minority students. (1)

The argument that simple policies somehow hurt whites as a whole is a very frivolous argument. For centuries, whites have held a monopoly on legislation, law enforcement, education, politics, finance, and land ownership. During the ""New Deal,"" according to the book ""When Affirmative Action was White,"" 65% of African Americans were denied benefits. During and after WWII, while black military members had trouble receiving even the benefits they earned like the GI Bill, recent immigrants from Eastern Europe experienced a revolutionary transformation in their citizenship status. (2)

In a country where the wealth gap is growing between whites and minorities, affirmative action is not only beneficial to all, but necessary. In 2005, whites had a median household net worth of $134,992. Hispanics had a median household net worth of $18,359, and black had a median household net worth of $12,124. Just 4 years later, white's median household net worth had fallen to $113,149. For Hispanics, it fell to $6,325, and for blacks it fell to $5,677. A third of Hispanic and black households in 2009 had a zero or negative net worth in 2009, while only 15% of blacks fit that profile. (3)

It is important to note, also, that the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action are not black, rather white women. White women, like blacks, once couldn't vote, and once were considered property. Thanks to affirmative action, the number of women (mostly white women) has grown in the following areas (and more):
"" The percentage of women architects increased from 3% to nearly 19% of the total;

"" The percentage of women doctors more than doubled from 10% to 22% of all doctors;

"" The percentage of women lawyers grew from 4% to 23% of the national total;

"" The percentage of female engineers went from less than 1% to nearly 9%;

"" The percentage of female chemists grew from 10% to 30% of all chemists; and

"" The percentage of female college faculty went from 28% to 42% of all faculty. (4)

It would seem to me that affirmative action is not ""wrong,"" rather beneficial to those it is intended to aid, and largely harmless to those who perceive it as ""wrong.""

This hides content that could otherwise be fruitful, and it also provides people with a way around having to justify their own stances.

A common argument that I've seen to this in threads is ""well if somebody is wrong, I'm just going to downvote them. They don't need any rational."" But here's the thing: it isn't up to you to determine what is wrong unless you have a reason. 

If it's something objective, ie ""In what year did X sail the Y?"", then you can correct it easily. If it's ""This should/n't be."" then there is no objective right or wrong; only your opinion. If you can't back that up, don't have one.

I would hate to live as a vegetative state, and be a burden on other people. What is the point of being alive at that point. I wouldn't be able to contribute to society in any way.

I know this seems like a ""hateful"" or ""horrible"" thing to say, but it is actually a reasonable viewpoint in my eyes.

~~But it doesn't hurt anyone if I just refer to them as 'him' or 'her', either.~~

~~They're transgender? That's nice. Is their outward appearance female? Then they are a 'she'. Male? 'He'. Are they outwardly female but want to be referred to as a male? Fine, you're a 'he', but there is no point in making up words and trying to force me to use them. I am not harming you in any way if I'm referring to you as 'him' or 'her' whilst in the presence of my friends. I'm not harming you if I refer to you as such when I'm in your presence, either.~~

~~This whole 'special snowflake who deserves special pronouns' thing has got to stop. There is no such thing as Ze, Ey, Xe or any of the other words you made up. Did you remove your genitals? Then you're genderless, which means, *out of the words that exist and are real words*, your pronoun options are 'they', 'them', 'their', 'it', 'its'' or 'it's'.~~

~~That's not discrimination, that's referencing a lack of gender without making shit up like you're writing a poorly thought out sic-fi fan-fic.~~

~~When I refer to you as 'him' or 'her', 'he' or 'she' I am not insulting you or judging you, I am just calling it as I see it. Boobs? 'Her'. Boobs &amp; beard? 'Her'. No boobs? 'Him'. No boobs, a beard and female genitals? 'Him' or 'her', those are your choices. Don't complicate an uncomplicated issue.~~

------------------

**EDIT:** Somehow I mis-worded this so poorly that it became an off topic discussion about Gender Identity. That's not the case.

What I want to know is why the pronouns Ze, Ey or Xe, etc, need to exist as gender neutral pronouns when gender neutral pronouns such as They, Them, Their, It, Its' and It's already exist. What is the point of making up a word to describe yourself when the appropriate word already exists?

Are they meant to describe different levels of gender neutrality? Does Ze mean ""A person with a woman's breasts and a man's penis""? Does Ey mean ""A person with a vagina, but no breasts""? Does Xe mean ""A person without breast, penis or vagina""? If not, what is the point of these words when the word They already described a gender neutral person?

Men shouldn't rape anyways, they say.

I would agree that men shouldn't rape, but taking precautions for your own safety is smart and necessary. I am a male, and when driving in a strange/unsafe neighborhood, I wouldn't blast music to draw attention to myself or drive an expensive car. Even though doing so wouldn't mean I would ""deserved"" to be robbed, it is important for me to minimize the risk. Similarly, one should look both ways before crossing the street. Even though hitting someone with your car is against the law, you want to minimize the risk by looking both ways to ensure safety.

When I'm at a bar, I too ensure that I am the only one who touches my drink, don't show off jewelry/watches etc. It's just common sense.

What's next, polygamy?"" were dismissed as stupid and not serious. Now that gay marriage enjoys majority support and legal momentum, a lot of the same people say stuff like ""you're right. I support polygamy too, what are you going to do about it?"" Right now, otherkin seems too ""weird"" for people to accept, but there was a time that transgender was completely marginalized as well. From a strategic standpoint, I can understand focusing on gradual progressive changes, but logically, I don't believe you can support transgender and just outright dismiss otherkin.

We know that businesses typically have to pay more taxes than the average individual (corporate tax, estate or property tax, sales tax if retail etc.). A business owner must not only pay the taxes their business but also their personal taxes such as income tax. I think lowering a combination of these taxes would generate greater income for a business owner who might otherwise lose money from having to pay his employees more. Of course now the government is generating less tax revenue but if there are more people working for a higher wage there is a lesser need for social programs and welfare. This is in addition to the more taxes that someone making a higher minimum wage would pay.

This seems to me that the justice system believe the lifes of police are more important than an innocent member of the public. I believe that if you kill a police officer, civilian, family member and so on, that you should be labelled as a murderer rather than a cop killer because that is what you are and all murderers should be treated the same, no matter what occupation the murdered person had.	795	227

Then you have the consideration that we didn't have any choice over our nationality, I was born a UK citizen, I can't legally give it up since its not possible to make yourself stateless so I fail to see the difference between this and other negative forms of pride if I am honest. 

Maybe its just me who sees things this way, I am a fairly odd one out in my family to be honest, I annoyed my parents by turning down an offer to go to the commonwealth games because of the Commonwealth's inaction on LGBT rights and all of that. Stuff like how I have no real affinity to my passport its just a travel document to me nothing more etc.

Traditionally stealing is taking from someone so that they no longer have the stolen item. This I believe is wrong. 

If I had a need for a physical item I would see what was available on the market. If nothing on the market was available at a reasonable price I might consider making it for myself. Companies who manufacture are able to mass produce goods for cheaper than an individual could because they have equipment available which would be cost prohibitive for an individual to acquire. This means that usually an item can be purchased cheaper than it could be produced at home. If I needed a new computer there is no way I could manufacture one as cheaply as easily as I could buy one so I am happy to purchase one.

I am not from the US but I know you have some very restrictive patent laws which aren’t consistent with much of world. Most places allow patents to be infringed for personal non-commercial use. I can build a Boeing 747 in my shed for personal use but I can’t burn a CD. The music industry sells CDs for a huge profit on what they actually cost to produce. Because of the huge mark-up people adopt a DIY attitude. Then rather than reduce price like another industry might, the music industry protects its sales by getting unfair laws passed forcing people to buy their product. 

Distributing music over the internet should be even cheaper than CD’s but it is still prohibitively expensive. I just opened the iTunes store on my phone and clicked the first album, Sonic Highways. $16.99 for the album or $2.19 for a single song.

The music industry has brought piracy on itself. It could have embraced the internet as a means of supplying music for a reasonable cost but it didn’t. I believe if the music industry lowered the price on music to ~ $1 per album or $0.10 per song very few people would pirate music. They would make less per download but sell much more music. It wouldn’t be worth downloading crappy unorganised bits of music mixed with malware and viruses, or spend weeks trying to find something obscure. Not to mention as people left piracy and started paying for music seeders would start to disappear. I would pay for all my music, in fact I would spend more on music than I do now, most people would.  I would be much more likely to spend money on music I hadn’t heard before or wanted to try.

I'll give you an example:


Let's say a person is completly isolated from religion, - it still exists, but he doesn't know that, nobody ever says anything about religion while near him, and he simply cannot see churches and other religious structures (suck it, this is just a made up story, you got my point).
The word ""religion"" is unknown to him and he doesn't know a single bit about religion.

This person goes through education just like any normal kid, but he is not taught of religion.
When he finishes college, somebody shows him this whole concept of ""religion"", the churches, the ritual, the culture.. But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.

I am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.

I have a few arguments to back this up.

**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**

I think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: ""Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one""?

Of course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.


**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**

Think about parenting. You wouldn't say the word ""fuck"" or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. 

**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**

Kids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?


If you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.

Let's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.

If you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.


Would it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?

The younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.

Religion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.

Minors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.


That's it. CMV.

The foundation for this belief is the more fundamental belief that government should not restrict the actions of its citizens except when those actions affect the well-being of others sufficiently to warrant such a restriction. **Note, that I am *not* interested in discussing this more fundamental belief in this CMV.** You may reject any such principle, but that is not what I'm asking you to change my view about. Instead, I'm asking you to change my view about incest in spite of such a principle (hereafter ""the harm principle"").

I believe that many people implicitly (if not explicitly) endorse the harm principle, and I believe it's a driving force behind arguments for the legalization of recreational drugs, gay marriage, and many other causes that many people regard as laudable. I also feel that the harm principle defends consenting adults from prosecution for engaging in consanguineal sexual relations with one another. However, in many places (even among developed countries), such consenting adults can be punished with lengthy jail terms or worse. Whether or not they *are* frequently punished in such a way is another question whose answer varies from place to place, but my point here is that they *can* legally be so punished.

I understand that one justification of some laws against incest is that they protect children from being molested by older relatives. If such laws are to remain, they should not preclude such relations between consenting adults, which would really just reduce them to laws prohibiting the molestation of children. Instead of having blanket incest laws that prohibit relations between consenting adults, you could simply have molestation laws that carry more severe penalties when the victim is a relative of the perpetrator.

Another common argument is that incest is more likely to produce offspring with birth defects. Some proponents of abolishing incest laws would propose that blood relatives should be allowed to engage in sexual relations but should not be allowed to conceive, but I think even this is unnecessary. It may be the case that the chance of birth defects is increased when close relatives conceive, but it is not guaranteed. Furthermore, I know of no laws (and I suspect they are rare, if they exist anywhere) that prohibit the conception of children by carriers of genetic disorders, even in those cases in which the disorder is likely (or even guaranteed) to be passed down. Even if such laws exist somewhere, I think they ought to be questioned, and if they ought to be questioned, so should any law that prohibits blood relatives from conceiving.

1 - What do feminists agree on? Even within feminism, there's such a broad spectrum of views and opinions on feminist issues that to call oneself as a simply a 'feminist' doesn't demonstrate anything except one thing. In my opinion, the core tenant of feminism is that everyone possesses equal rights - and as such, is the one, absolute trait that all feminists can claim to believe. But again, that's not really saying anything. It is possible to believe that everyone deserves equal rights whilst not being a feminist - in the same way it's possible to believe in a God or Deity whilst being irreligious.

2 - Feminist critique is ultimately useless due to it's incredible subjectivity. When feminism critiques something as sexist or misogynist, the strength of that argument relies on how well of a rhetorician the author is. Outside of very few circumstances, most scenes in literature can be argued both ways.

An example:

'Bayonetta' is a sexist character.

How could this be explored through a feminist framework? She could be seen as a character who is sexually objectified. She could be seen as a powerful women in control of her sexuality. She could be seen as merely a pawn of the player. She could be seen as the driving force of her narrative and it's most important character. She could be seen as someone who's slut shamed by certain critique. She could be seen as a stereotype for inhabiting the traditional female role of a witch. She could be seen as a re invigoration of a character archetype for how witches are presented in her mythos.

Ultimately, the strength of the argument relies on how well of a rhetorician the author is - not any sort of objective viewpoint. It's so subjective that it doesn't actually impart anything of substantial value - other than the fact that is so subjective.

3 - Growing numbers of women aren't identifying as feminist, and public opinion appears (IMO) to be slowly moving against it. When Time gave a poll on which word should be banned last year, the word feminism completely annihilated all competition - until feminists caused it to be removed. 

4 - 'Feminism' has been commercialized by sites such as Buzzfeed and Gawker, with op-editorials and clickbait articles. Furthermore, feminism nowadays is more often associated with some sort of moral outrage over some relatively unimportant issue (such as television or film), than it is with any sort of 'positive' news or change. In short, feminism and outrage culture are intricately linked.

This is not to say that I don't respect and admire feminism for what it's achieved. It is undoubtedly one of the shining moments of western civilization, and one we can hopefully share with the rest of the world. It's just unfortunate what is has transformed into in the twentieth century.

I understand that, due to health codes, many restaurants cannot allow dogs. However, I think that if a restaurant has outdoor dining and allows children, dogs should be allowed as well.

Dogs require stimulation and socialization in the same way that small children do. In many cities, it is very difficult to find places to take a dog so that they can enjoy time out of the house. Where I live, even leashed dogs are not allowed on the beaches at the public lake. My dog can't enjoy a dip in the water on a hot day, unless we hike 6 miles to a local river/waterfall in the state forest. 

I fully realize that you make sacrifices when you have a dog. It would just be nice not to choose between necessary errands (like a run to Target to get household items) and spending time with my companion. And I can't think of any truly valid reasons that he shouldn't accompany me on these errands if he is well-behaved and doesn't bother other people.

Caveats

1) In any store that has shopping carts available, the dog should be required to stay in the shopping cart inside the store. Local leash laws should also be observed at all times.

2) Dogs should, as I said, be well-behaved and quiet. If they cause a disturbance, the owner should immediately remove them.

EDIT: I've awarded some deltas, and I want to thank everybody for their replies, many of which were very eye-opening. 

Believe it or not, I realize my dog is not a child. I only made that comparison because it seems that they share some common traits which lend themselves to possible disturbances (unpredictable, have trouble communicating, are sometimes loud for seemingly no reason). I also realize that there are places where it is wholly inappropriate to take a dog. Perhaps it's just wishful thinking on my part, because I see so many businesses where dogs and humans shop &amp; eat together just fine. I'd love for it to be more common that businesses allow pets, but fully realize that it will never be universal (nor should it). 

EDIT 2: Just want to take a moment to acknowledge the major point that has (if not totally changed) swayed my view.

ALLERGIES: I truly did not realize how prevalent pet allergies are. I have met and worked with a lot of people all over the US, and I know one person with a dog allergy (and even she has to actually touch the dog to have a reaction). I also didn't realize that even trace amounts of dander in the air could cause such severe reactions. I know that pet dander is carried on the clothing of people who own pets, so it would seem that I should be causing allergic reactions all the time. Maybe I am (unknowingly). 

So I will amend my original statement to say that I think it should simply be more common that dogs are allowed in businesses and in public green spaces/beaches. (Please understand I was never saying dogs should be allowed EVERYWHERE). It looks like lots of countries and cities are very dog-friendly, and manage to be so without an outbreak of dog fights and pestilence. Europe, California, Portland OR, and Seattle WA are a few mentioned in this CMV.

There is always room for improvement. That said, I think homeschooling should be illegal (or severely restricted, i.e. tight requirements for testing, certification for the parents, standard curricula that mimics those taught in public schools) for a few reasons:

1.) From personal experience, homeschooling severely retards the growth of the homeschooled in terms of social and intellectual development.

2.) Homeschoolers do not have access to the same education as students in public school. They cannot share the same level of facilities, expertise in teaching, nor access to different  opinions (the basis of higher education) when they are homeschooled.

3.) in an age of interconnectedness, interpersonal skills are paramount. Knowledge of how to deal with people is essential in every job. Being at home interacting with a few people every day does not allow the student to learn these skills.

4.) Motivation: Homeschoolers do the work because Mom or Dad tell them to. People who go to school do not. When they get to college, and Mommy or Daddy is no longer there, which one has a higher likelihood of success?

In short, homeschooling should no longer be an option as it denies the child the basic right to an education that prepares the pupil for society. Instead, it is a breeding ground for narrow-mindedness, and limited social development. CMV reddit"	57	221	
4855832	changemyview	185574072	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/32hhvc/cmv_familial_inheritance_should_be_replaced_with/	2015-04-13 21:03:54		divinesleeper	CMV: familial inheritance should be replaced with societal inheritance	http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/32hhvc/cmv_familial_inheritance_should_be_replaced_with/	"Okay, first of all let me get this out of the way: I'm very aware that this is practically impossible to implement. I'm arguing how theoretically, *if* we could implement this, society would be far better off for it and approach a near-perfect meritocracy. The CMV concerns the system being *desirable*, for nearly everyone.

Secondly, I am far from arguing communism. As far as I'm concerned, communist markets are doomed to fail and go against human nature. Capitalism is fine.

It's familial inheritance that I argue against. Inheritance, as the root of all *unfair* inequality. Money begets money, and a wealthy inheritance can catapult a child with mediocre abilities into greater wealth. If you start out with the money needed to invest in a business, or even inherit a company itself, you'd have to be an idiot not to accumulate more. Relatively little effort is required. On the other hand, a brilliant child starting out in poverty can have its abilities go to waste, having to work multiple jobs while attending college, starting out with no capital to speak of, and struggling an entire lifetime to achieve any sort of dream. 

Familial inheritance undermines the ideal of meritocracy. On the other hand, societal inheritance *stimulates* it. By societal inheritance I mean this: capital of those who are deceased is seized by society, and used *exclusively* as a start capital for those coming into adulthood. This could be at a certain age, or something that could be requested within a certain age span (say, 18-25). The practical details can be discussed. The point is, this start capital would be exactly equal for everyone.

Naturally, the first objection to this would be that the system is bad or unfair to the wealthy of the world. But hear me out: what person, who has actually worked for their wealth, would want their child to never know the hardship such wealth warrants? Would you want your child to be spoiled and immoral, naive to how the world works, living on your work? Or would you want your child to get the same chance everyone gets and prove itself, to work for what it achieves and to actually *merit* their wealth? I'd go further, is such a way of life not indeed *preferable*, to know you've earned everything you have?

And then there is society itself to take into account. Suppose we have two societies, one operating on familial inheritance, the other a near meritocracy due to societal inheritance. The second society would, over time, evolve to be far more preferable for anyone living in it, and naturally exceed the other society in prosperity. The wealthy of the other society would *want* to live in the meritocratic society.

Two counter arguments I'm anticipating:

1. Even with an equal start capital, you don't have meritocracy. This is true. There are environmental factors, especially growing up. Eliminating that would mean eliminating familial life itself, and I'm not going to argue that that is desirable, that's a different discussion. But societal inheritance is a big step towards meritocracy, regardless.

2. An equal start capital for everyone would cause inflation. This is an argument I've seen against basic income, and while it does have some merit there, it makes no sense here. The redistributed money in basic income could be seen as ""unearned"" and elicit a collective response from the markets to readjust money value, but this is not the case for societal inheritance.

One final interesting consequence of the system is this: since more people now have possession of the money necessary to start their own business or project, some of the perceived ""merit"" of being a business owner will decrease. This also means that the demand for manual labor jobs and the employed will rise (since there are more business owners and less employed workers), and with it, the wages. The inequality in wages will more reflect the difficulty of the job (but also of course demand, ingenuity etc. Business owners will inevitably still make more, as they should). People who fail and lose their start capital will therefore still have better prospects than they would now. 

So there you have it. Societal inheritance is preferable for nearly everyone in society, except for those who want to spoil their children by working in their stead; those who wish their children unearned wealth. As I see it, it would lead to near meritocracy, and usher in higher prosperity for everyone.

In the middle east today, you have ethnic groups fighting each other that were only held together in the first place through the utter force of a tyrant prior. Now there's a power vacuum and mass fighting.

In america, we still see people say things are not equal despite multiple services that prefer people of ""minority"" status to extra privileges. Despite decades of this, there's been little improvement and people still think it's some how an issue they can solve.

Areas largely segregate themselves by population alone, going decades back even. The creations of ""Little Italy"", ""china town"" etc. are evidence of migrants typically collecting together.

As the media presents it, there's constant friction between races alone. Even some modern day speeches of saying ""color blindness is racist"" meaning, unless you give some one special treatment due to their ethnicity or race, you're scum of the earth. How does that make any sense what so ever? That's ignoring how it implies they're inherently inferior some how because they NEED the help to be equal.

It seems absolutely ridiculous that ex-wives of millionaire athletes/actors/whatever should be able to walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars just because they were used to living in luxury. So, you married your high school sweetheart-turned NHL star when you were young, forgoing college or employment? That's not the fault of the husband.

4855832	changemyview	219158085	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/3mhbgl/cmv_treating_gender_dysphoria_by_gender/	2015-09-26 16:41:45		KaleStrider	CMV: Treating Gender Dysphoria by Gender Reassignment is cruel and counterproductive.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3mhbgl/cmv_treating_gender_dysphoria_by_gender/	"Let me make my point perfectly clear right off the bat: I am not open to debate about whether gender dysphoria exists. It exists and I don't wish to debate that. I hold that it's a mental illness which does sometimes cure itself in some cases, but not all. I also hold that gender reassignment regret exists, but is rare- it is very difficult to tell how many regret their change, but reassignment surgery to their original configuration has occurred and does exist.

Gender Dysphoria should be treated as it is; except that dramatically more research should be given to finding a cure which realigns the brain to no longer experience gender dysphoria in patients whom retain their body's sexual function at birth. By granting gender reassignment research is not given into those people and we are losing potential test subjects to hopefully cure this disorder.

It is cruel to subject a person to a society which detests their existence. We should not lie about the state of the world. We are not super heroes of justice and we cannot convince everyone to not hate them. We are subjecting them to an entire world which doesn't like them. Even if we come to acceptance within the Western world there are still countries such as Russia whom would either kill them or force them into endless pain. This on it's own would not stand as a good argument, but there is an alternative: we need to treat them as mental patients, put them in institutions to ensure their survival, and try our hardest using good science (not the stupidity that was Pray the Gay away) in ways that are safe. We must not treat them as horrible human beings, but as people who are in severe pain and distress. Whom need all the help they can get: this is an argument that might convince even gay-hating-Russia to follow. With this argument we can convince the world and we can take the steps necessary to help all of them.

I will end this by giving a counter argument to a common point:

&gt; Ultimately, if an individual decides for themselves they wish to do a thing to themselves, and it causes no harm to others, then that individual should have right to act as they please. Even if it ultimately causes their death.

By this logic we should do the same for people who have suicidal thoughts. By the logic that surrounds this we should even encourage them to take their own lives like we do for transgender people to become their new gender. We know that this disorder results, or causes, changes in the brain the same as depression. By this logic we should remove suicide prevention because that would be the same as shaming gender dysphoria patients. This is horrible and cruel.

The reason that much of this argument does not apply to homosexuality is simple: there is no need to remove healthy organs in their cases (which then leads to a chance of infection and death) and there is evidence that suicide is not nearly as epidemic in their group as trans-gendered peoples.

In countries where it has not been accepted it would indeed be cruel and this argument would apply. For those countries we may still wish to gain sexual orientation alteration drugs, but here in the West it may as well be a cosmetic change.

This argument does not apply to peoples who are not born XX or XY. They are special cases and I don't hold any view concerning them.

&gt; If there was a magic pill to give these people that would solve their problems than I'd have zero problem with it, but there isn't one.

Well, lets make one.

**EDIT:** Holy crap this blew up! If I don't respond to your individual points it's because the volume of points being made is... A lot. I'm super sorry if I don't get to all of you.

**EDIT2:** I never made the statement that SRS should absolutely never be done. I'm saying that it's horrible to press people into it or to make them believe that it's a good idea in our media. I am not talking about medical personnel who actively discourage it. I'm talking about the media's favor towards it.

**EDIT3:** A Delta has been awarded against the clarification of my points in EDIT2. As medical profession at large thoroughly believe it's worth the risk you can't very well tell the media to stop saying the same.

**EDIT4:** Most posts aren't arguing against my view when it comes to the following-

&gt; we need to treat them as mental patients, put them in institutions to ensure their survival, and try our hardest using good science

It would be up to the medical practitioner which to do. In reality I made this point *horribly*. I'm talking about creating ""safety-wards"" for gender dysphoria sufferers. Places that can do both long-term and short-term aid. The reason I even mention this is because of transgender people I know in real life who... Need more help than most people admit. It would be best if they could far more easily slip out of society for a while.

Another point people aren't even arguing against my view is this- I'm not saying depression = gender dysphoria. I'm saying that both affect the brain and by the logic of the listed counterpoint you'd have to apply it. It's hypocritical thinking to try otherwise. It should not be their individual choice; that should be the choice of medical practitioners. **NOT family.**

**EDIT5:** Institution idea was shot out of the water and a Delta was awarded. Suicide rates are negligible when compared to the general population. This means that there is no reason to set up specialized safe-housing in addition to what's already done.

**EDIT6:** My head is spinning from too much debate. The only point remaining unchanged is that it shouldn't be their choice, but that of medical practitioners taking care of them. Except that then I remembered that half the US supports Hobby Lobby as it pertains to doctors. That makes supporting my position impossible.

I'm surprised no-one tried to point that out to me. I'm going to collapse now. My head is heavy. Congrats to everyone that got a Delta. Those were hard-earned because my belief was fairly solid. And to those who straw-manned my arguments to oblivion: Come on, seriously? I never said stop GRS/SRS until the pill was researched.

The only point that might be of contention is whether the pill should be taken *instead* of GRS once it's out. Options are cooler. I'm headed out. Peace.

**EDIT7:** I'm back. Ish. I took a nap. Another Delta was awarded because, honestly, expecting Russia to not horribly torture people is probably a bad idea. One that didn't really occur to me until pointed out. I also noticed that someone else deserves a Delta, but I totally completely forgot who or where. They essentially convinced me that GRS should not be phased out whatsoever unless another treatment had remarkable success and was cheaper. It was probably one of the people whom got a Delta though.

**EDIT8:** All possible Deltas are gone! All points have been rebuked and my view is fully changed.

Our modern society is toxic.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3xngng/cmv_preindustrial_societies_were_much_happier_and/	"This is a theory that i've had for a while. There is something about our society, likely a combination of several things, that causes a lot of unhappiness.

I figure it's got a lot to do with the spiritual void that was left behind when people started believing in Nihilistic spiritual concepts that they call ""atheism"", leaving a lot of people with deep existential anxiety, as well as just being unable to keep up with and cope with the immense change that our society has undertaken over the past 300 years. We're not designed for the lifestyle that modern industrialised society influences us to have.

[The one day I found proof](https://www.madinamerica.com/2014/06/living-age-melancholy-society-becomes-depressed/) and now im sure of it. The best way to find happiness is to unplug from our society as much as possible.

&gt;When an anthopologist interviewed over 2,000 Kaluli, he found that only one person exhibited the symptoms of clinical depression, despite the fact the Kaluli are plagued by high rates of infant mortality, parasitic infection, and violent death.

2. There's water which flushes down the remaining pee and dilutes it, same principle as the flush in the toilets

Specifically I mean issues such as ""cis-sexism"", ""ablesim"", ""cultural appropriation"" and the concept of various ""privileges"" which a vocal minority seem to champion. Essentially these ideas seem to originate online on sites such as Tumblr, and have gained support on some uni/college campuses particularly in the US. In my view these kind of ideas are a new form of counter culture, as people who believe in them often use rhetoric attacking the ""system"" as ""white, Cis, male supremacist"" or the like. I believe these issues are largely imaginary or are exaggerating and misrepresenting other long accepted problems such as racism. 

Also more worryingly I think these kind of ideas hold very negative consequences. For example the ideas of ""cultural appropriation"", racial based ""privileges"" and a divide between ""whites"" and ""people of colour"" essentially reintroduces the ""separate but equal"" doctrine of Jim crow times and shits on the legacy of MLK and the civil rights movement. The idea of ""safe spaces"" and ""trigger warnings"" destroys free speech and debate and creates the dangerous notion that feelings are infallible and absolute, basically making adults into babies who can't deal with criticism.


EDIT: Wow my point of view was not popular

It was unfair because I didn’t put enough time into it then expected people to understand me perfectly?  Also I’ve felt my argument has changed to some extent and my post doesnt represent that very well at all, my view hasn’t changed very much but people 75% of the time seem to want to argue points I didnt raise that are possibly more relevant to the ‘point’ I guess? I know people are going to say “ Youve changed your entire view! ” and to some extent thats correct but only because people didnt really want to have an argument about the points I raised so I had to explain the same points in over 100 replies which really takes it out of me haha . So I will try a second time




So in posting this edit a new trend has made itself apparent to me and it goes something like this:

*""Do you not agree that it in day to day life it only matters what they think of themselves? as its better and far easier to just take their word for it?*

So my simple answer to that is, no, I do not disagree with that at all as it is obviously not incorrect. I think we are having different conversations as this is not about what I think is easier or what matters more in day to day life my argument is about the intrinsic state of how things are. On one of these threads we got into a debate about the matrix in reference to this and I found it help convey what Im trying to say so I will try to sum it up here. This person said something like this to me; ""Neo only knows the matrix so in his life that is all that matters and in transgendered peoples lives they think of themselves as a different gender and thats all that matters in life"" so whilst I enjoy reading comments like these I have to constantly tell them we are having a different debate, in my view that I posed on the post Im not taking into account how Neo or Transgendered people feel because it isnt relevant as how someone feels about this doesnt influence its intrinsic state of being and that is what Im trying to get at with this post **what is the truth of the matter regardless of feelings or the ease of life.** Unlike people like to say Im open to be wrong. I will state my argument in a nutshell here :

Saying there is a notion of a psychological gender is not correct, furthermore may be fundamentally unknowable

As such its not a good idea to base your view (especially when many take their own view as fact) on something so possibly *unknowable* like gender, on testimony of the people, regardless of how many people. Just as millions could tell me they think they know what happens in the center of a black hole I will not just take their word on it without something concrete, no matter their numbers. Someone had what I would argue was a meta-argument about this post asking why its relevant, I have two answers to that.

1. This is not r/ change my relevant view

and

2.Real decisions that affect things are being made running under this assumptions, an assumption I would say is currently impossible to get to. 

 
On with the show.









So I will first start off with this, Im not at all trying to impeach on anyones freedom, if you want me to call you a man, woman, cat or duck I couldnt care less but that doesn’t mean I agree you ‘are’ in fact a man, woman, cat or duck. It reminds me of the Abraham Lincoln quote “How many legs does a dog have if you call its tail a leg? Four because calling a tail a leg doesnt mean its a leg” I will sort of sum up an encounter I had with a good person today on this thread:  Someone was asking me why I couldn’t essentially take someones word on them feeling like the opposite sex and posed me this question; “if someone were to tell you they’re happy would not believe that person?” and among my reply I said “well maybe you shouldnt”  Someone didnt really understand why I said that and asked if I could clarify and explain so heres what I came up with:

So Ill lay out a hypothetical scenario based around your question:


My friend Campbell comes to me looking visibly happy, hes smiling and is generally carrying himself in a positive way. He says to me ""Im happy""


Im obviously going to 99.99% believe him but I know for what ever reason he could be being deceptive among other things as those things he just displayed could theoretically have been done by anyone happy or sad.


Now I will give you a hypothetical scenario based on my view on transgenderism:


My friend Campbell walks up to me and says ""Hey Frank I feel like you""


Now I don't believe him at all because... what even is it to feel like me? I cant identify intrinsic things that go along with feeling like Frank.


Then Campbell says to me ""No not anything specific I just feel like like I connect with all your traits rather than my own, on every level I feel like Frank and soon I will alter my appearance to look like frank""


That makes no sense to me? if you cant identify everything that entails being frank how do you expect me to believe you feel exactly like frank? because I dont even know what feeling like frank means! and I am Frank! 

First of all I’d like to say my name isnt actually frank so no one get exited they can use that fact in aid of finding and killing me haha and I would also like to point out I understand this person doesnt represent everyone. In my original post I used the word gender very very loosely as to be honest no one had ever completely fleshed out  everything that word entails to me in reference to this sort of thing, obviously I had some kind of an understanding but in reading the hundreds of peoples comments yesterday I believe to some extent I have a pretty good understanding now, well as good as I can. Ive had a lot of different definitions on what it means to not identify as your ‘sex defined?’ gender some people say its identifying with all the roles that accompany that sex, some people said “if you think youre male, that means you are regardless of what that means” but one stood out to me, a user called Chel_of_the_sea said this
   

When I say ""I identify as a woman"", what I mean is ""I would like:


•	...to have the body characteristics typically associated with women, to the greatest degree possible. These include a particular body shape, particular hormone regime, breasts, female genitalia and reproductive organs, etc.


•	...to be treated socially, professionally, romantically, sexually, and personally, as a woman""
But it's a lot shorter to just say ""I identify as X"" when the folks around you understand what that means.


And yeah I mean if youre a man and are just saying “I indentify as a woman” because its easier to explain the things you ***want*** then fine?  but humor me if you will: imagine if the title ‘chair’ was given to an individual who wants to eat a lot of avocado, I mean yeah Id have no problem calling you a chair but that doesnt at all mean you are anything like an actual four legged wooden chair. Maybe people will say “Thats all they want you idoit! You never disagreed in the first place!” but I mean thats not entirely true for a few reasons


1.	Even when I bring this up people will disagree with me about 80% of the time 


2.	I  think there should be a better way of classifying people like this then use what I would call a  biological term.  I cant think of another word used like this to describe someones want for something and just find it odd. I know words dont need to answer to me but it just seems like homonyms are confusing enough without one word meaning something extremley straight foward and the other something so impossibly complex and philosophical about the  same sort of thing


3.	Some people have argued that a women who identifies as a man is as much of a man as me on every single 
level


Regardless of if Im missing Chel_of_the_sea’s point, many people will say I have but for the record Chel_of_the_sea Im sorry if you feel I misrepresented you but regardless it served as a good thing  to help flesh out my point.

So I imagine by now people will want me to talk about the scientific reasoning so I will. I actually noticed a trend  with the science part of the opposing argument, at first an overwhelming amount of people linked me the same two articles which absolutely killed me haha and then said these article prove they can identify a transgender brain apart from another but at the bottom of these article they both said this wasn’t the case and they may never be able to but that wasnt really important to me as there are a large amount of scientists saying the opposite so Im not saying ones right but how can I pick one or the other? So at one point everyone started changing and raising the arguably better point “Transgender brains and bodies are more similar to there chosen gender and they exhibit different qualities such as more estrogen and what not.” and gave me examples where people display different sex chromosomes than xx and xy. So I actually enjoyed reading these comments and other comments where they brought up other cases where people were born with defects affecting their sex chromosomes are interesting and I mean without saying the maybe abhorrent “well they arent male or female” I dont really know what to say? Same with people born with both genitalia, I mean in the cases where its objectively extremely unclear what sex to classify someone as I dont know. I guess you could compare this to one of Einsteins most famous theory's breaking down at the center of a black hole, in my mind it doesn't necessarily mean my view is fundamentally incorrect rather I dont know as its maybe somewhat unknowable. As for the similarities in the brain and estrogen levels and what not I liked when people would bring these up because I was getting in a rut of people asking the same questions so subsequently I had to give the same answers, so it was nice to really have to think. In my mind that arguments sounds like this


 “if you were to put a rotor and life jackets on a car can you call it a boat?”


 I know I’m vastly over simplifying it but more estrogen seems to me like it would raise the odds of someone thinking theyre the female gender but that doesnt change their classification for me, as for the brain similarities I mean I would honestly love someone to show me a study showing otherwise but from what I’ve read the similarities are extremely minor and somewhat infrequent so it falls under the previous estrogen and boat thing. Maybe it makes someone more prone to think theyre the opposite sex but I dont think that fundamentally changes what I would classify them as.

As for my Guesses about the subconscious internal reasons why one would say they are transgendered, I actually wasn’t even  going to put that in there at all because I dont really care about it, as theyre just observations that dont really mean anything, I put that in there to preemptively combat comments asking about it. Some argued its necessary to my point and why could I not come up with a reason for older people, I mean is it ***actually*** important in this situation?  I think not, I thought of it as an ‘additive’ of sorts?  I think this is a different debate in it self.

As for the people asking if its legal for me to breed and stuff of that nature I mean theres nothing I can do about you people who leave those comments, they dont hurt my feelings or anything but its sort of dragging down everyone arguing on your side, I dont think they want to be associated with people who say stuff like this, this sort of goes with everyone leaving these comments that end with some sort of dig on my education and stuff like that, I mean who knows maybe they do like it but Im just saying in my experience it always annoys me when my argument gets dragged down by people saying things like that. Actually just a side note, that also goes for people saying hate speech about transgendered people as well, there are places to do that and its certainly not here.

I'm not saying that this type of activity isn't a problem in itself, but rather it's not nearly as widespread as so many people make it seem.

I think similar types of activity has more or less, [always](http://time.com/4110570/1970-2015-campus-protest-politics/) happened(in modern history), but now, there's 20 million college students, and everyone has a near-perfect quality video camera in their pocket on them at all times that they can turn on within literally seconds - so there's a virtually non-ending supply of anecdotal evidence to 'prove' this problem.  If 100,000 college students across the country acted like this, it's still only about 1% of college students - and again, I don't think the number is even remotely close to that high.

And on a personal level, I just graduated from college last week from a liberal east coast school and this 'sjw' illiberalism on college campuses that everyone talks about, was virtually non-existant.  To the extent that it did, it didn't influence basically anyones lives.  it was a 15,000 person campus, and there was a 'safe space' in the library during finals week that people in theory could go to to get away from finals stress for a little bit.  I don't know anyone that went, and probably in total about 30 people went.  These people were commonly referred to as 'bluehairs' as a joke, but at the end of the day, they were just a social group that minded their own business. "	106	132

I am not saying that blacks are responsible for any of that, I just think that they are in the unfortunate situation where they must change their own culture in order to improve their lives.

The following is a list of things I feel blacks must change that white people cannot change.

- The fact that 72% of black families are living in a single parent household. 
   
- Black people are committing a significantly higher amount of violent crime than all other races in America.  Fixing this will lead to less police brutality, and will make non-blacks more sympathetic to the unfair police brutality that blacks ~do~ experience.

- Black men need to stop being so chauvinistic and homophobic.  I know black men who are ridiculed and even assaulted for being homosexual.
  


I realize that this sounds harsh and if i said anything that sounds unreasonable please inform me, I do want to understand these issues and if I say anything is bigoted or ignorant I would like to be corrected.  Again, I am not trying to excuse white people or shift the blame onto the victim.  Sorry for all the typos, I am too tired to proofread this.

EDIT:  View definitely changed quite a bit.  I still think there is much that needs to be changed with the culture itself but I have a new appreciation for how complex that this issue is and awareness of how much can be done by the police and society as a whole.  I'll have to sleep on this for a while, thank you all for the comments and feel free to continue posting.

Things like opposition to gay marriage (""defending traditional marriage"") are offshoots of these ideas.

The problem with that is that society (at least, for the past few hundred years) becomes less bigoted and more tolerant over time (abolition, women's suffrage, civil rights, gay marriage acceptance, etc). So how can an ideal of ""return to traditional values"" not be a bigoted idea, since values in the past were significantly more bigoted than values today?

This is not about fiscal or political conservatism, nor is it about any specific group or organization that supports/claims to support social conservatism. I'll CMV if someone shows that (a) I've misunderstood what social conservatism is, or (b) enough socially conservative views are non-bigoted that it is possible to properly practice this ideology without bigotry. Or if someone effectively counters all of my arguments in a way I'm not anticipating.

Chemical reactions proceed in entirely predictable ways; physical objects move and react to each other in entirely predictable ways; energy is transmitted and affects matter in entirely predictable ways.

The last and weakest hope for the existence of free will is the subatomic particle which behaves in ways we are currently unable to predict.  However, in the past we were unable to predict many things that we now can, and I believe the same will eventually be proved for even those things which currently puzzle us the most.  Unfortunately for those who believe in free will, there is no evidence at the moment that the behavior of those subatomic particles have any affect on the behavior of whole atoms or molecules, thus they likely have no effect on the brain.

You may feel you are in control of your actions, but even you can find a causal link for all of them.  For example, in order to prove me wrong, you decide to demonstrate a random act that has no reason or rhyme to it.  However, your doing so was prompted by exposure to this idea, which I was prompted to write here because I wasn't finding any topics I wanted to chime in on, which in turn was prompted by my exhaustion with arguing about feminism, etc, etc, ad infinitum.

Many people object to this idea because it annihilates current ideas about personal responsibility and justice.  However, a justice system that removes bad actors from society, or attempts to rehabilitate them, still works from a standpoint of harm prevention and general utilitarianism.  Do those bad actors *deserve* their punishment?  No, not by most people's operating definition of ""deserve"".  However, incapacitating them insofar as their ability to do harm still serves the public good.

In summary, if you reject the ability to break natural laws (i.e. magic), then you must also reject free will."	8	154

According to it's advocates, the Hard Problem presents a major challenge to certain suppositions about the power of science to answer important questions about consciousness. According to it's detractors, the Hard Problem is a contrived non-problem conjured out of semantics and a poor understanding of the brain. Here, I will argue that the Hard problem is a legitimate challenge; Accounts that ignore it are doomed to fail.

I. A Brief Exposition.

Imagine you are laying on a green lawn one September afternoon. It is a windy but pleasant day, and you take advantage of the last of Indian summer, soaking up the long rays of the sun. If you can cut past my dime-store writing, you can surely place yourself in this scene. You feel the warmth of the Sun, the gentle push and pull of the breeze, the rough sod poking through the soft fibers of your t-shirt.

The Hard Problem centers around the qualitative features of scenes like this. On one hand, there are physical features that ground the quantitative facts about what's happening. Facts about astronomy ground facts about the changing seasons, facts about meteorology ground facts about the weather, facts about plant biology ground the difference between the plant fibers in the grass and the fibers in the cotton t-shirt, and so on. On the other hand, there seem to be distinctive properties that accompany the perception of these grounding fact. There is a way the sun feels to us, a way the breeze sounds, a way the texture of the grass feels compared to the texture of the shirt, etc.

In short, the Hard Problem of Consciousness is identifying the important features of ""What is it like to..."" questions: questions admitting qualitative answers. The ""Easy"" Problem of Consciousness is identifying the important features of ""When does/ How does..."" questions: questions admitting quantitative answers.
The Hard Problem poses a challenge for sciencistic and physicalist accounts of consciousness, since both insist on only appealing to the resources of scientific materialism. Given that the scientific method address questions from a quantitative perspective, it isn't clear that science directly answers qualitative questions about the subjective features of perception. Prima Facie, it seems like answering questions about when something occurs or how something occurs leaves questions about what something is like to experience open for further investigation.

II. A Brief Rebuttal

I'm not personally convinced that this line of thinking amounts to an iron-clad argument against physicalism. There are a lot of under-laying assumptions that can be challenged: the relationship between primary and secondary qualities, the issue of nominalism vs platonism, etc. However, in my experience, responses to the Hard Problem typically fall under two categories.

First, many people insist that indulging the Hard Problem amounts to begging the question against materialism. According to this response asking specifically about qualitative features gives the (misleading) impression that there are strictly mental features in the first place. However, physicalism is the position that all mental features are reducible to physical features. Therefore, the terms of the Hard Problem are biased. There is no burden to answer the Hard Problem, since the game is rigged.

Second, many people insist that they don't understand what people are talking about when people talk about qualitative features. According to this response, the physicalist literally doesn't understand what people are talking about with all of this ""What is it like.."" talk. Since these features are supposedly only accessible from a first-person perspective and there supposedly unable to be explained in quantitative terms, there is no way to 'let them in' on the secret.

I think both of these response are weak and the rest of this post will be dedicated to answering these challenges.

III. A Taxonomy

I propose that we consider questions concerning experience along two distinctions. I won't insist that these categories are mutually exclusive, but I believe these distinctions represent the opposition of two conceptual poles.

First, let's consider questions by contrasting public questions from private questions. Public questions are accessible from an unlimited number of new perspectives while private questions are accessible from a finite number of perspectives. At one extreme, this implies that some questions are relative to just one perspective, while at the other end some questions open to anyone.

Second, let's consider questions by contrasting questions about whether something exists with questions about what things would obtain given that something exists. Let's call the first kind of questions assertive, since answers to these questions assert the existence, (or non-existence), of something. Likewise, let's call the second kind speculative, since answers to these questions speculate what would happen if something existed.
With these distinctions, I think it is possible to phrase the Hard Problem in a way that doesn't beg the question and makes contents of qualitative features more apparent.

IV. The Argument

Rather than assuming that qualitative features admit a unique category of analysis, let's try to pin down how they fit into this scheme.

Are qualitative questions Public and Assertive? This seems unlikely to me. Just consider the case of optical illusions. Let's say I see a dress as white and gold while everyone else sees it properly as blue and black. When I discover that the dress is really blue and black, I may still see the dress as white and gold. Despite the fact that other people can correct me and there is an objective fact to the matter, I can maintain the perception of the illusion. Therefore, questions of qualitative experience don't seem directly related to this kind of question. Facts about the existence of something don't fix facts about the perception of existence.

Are qualitative questions Private and Speculative? This also seems unlike to me. While this doesn't run aground on the publicity issue, it seems like we don't need to speculate about the state of our own consciousness. We don't need to suppose what it would be like to feel hungry when we haven't eaten all day. We are intimately acquainted with our own hunger. While this category might admit questions about other minds, it seems to miss the mark in terms of questions about our own subjective experience.

Are qualitative questions Public and Speculative? Again, this doesn't look promising. It runs afoul of the two previous problems by being public and speculative. Furthermore, the most paradigmatic example of this kind of question would be the questions of mathematics, (given that math is about applying public rules in light of given axioms). The contrast between subjective experience and cold reason may be a trope, but I think reasonable people would reject the kind of rationalism that places the two in the same basket.

Are qualitative questions Private and Assertive? To me, this is our best bet. It doesn't suffer from the first two problems and seems reasonable enough. It certainly seems like my perceptions can only be experienced by me or things very much like me, (implying privacy) and that my perceptions are presented to us as opposed to being considered as possible things by us, (implying assertion).

Unfortunately, scientific materialism only deals in public questions. If a question can't be answered in terms of repeatable observations, then it isn't scientific. Therefore, science isn't in the business of answering Private Assertive questions. Furthermore, as stated above, deductive reasoning seems inappropriate for describing felt experience. This implies that a priori 'sciences', like math and logic, aren't in the business of answering Private Assertive questions either.

All together, this gets us the same result as the naive version of the Hard Problem without begging the question against physicalism. Furthermore, the categorization here provides more than just bare reference. Rather than just 'pointing' to these properties, I give a clear definition of what exactly is being referred to. The physicalist must either provide a sophisticated account of the relationship between these categories that explains away some of these problems, accept robust phenomenological properties, or take the eliminitivist position and reject consciousness all together.

Satanism is a religion, and if you respect all religions, that inherently must include satanism. And this means that in any circumstance where it would be appropriate to, for example, say ""god bless"" or promote Christian imagery (besides churches or other places of worship, of course, where it is reasonable to only be promoting that particular religion), it must be equally acceptable to say ""hail Satan"" as well. Either that, or all religions should be equally silenced, but that would be just as unfair as well as oppressive to all religious people. 

Edit: since people don't get it apparently, ""respect all religions"" is a commonly used phrase regarding non discrimination against religions. 

Also, pastafarianism is irrelevant. Wether or not it is a religion changes nothing about satanism. So you can cut that out too. "	497	496

What I mean by this is, when a child is conceived whether intended or not the father is put in an awkward situation. My view is that if the father would like to legally disown the child before the 24 week abortion period have passed, he should be allowed to do so. This would except him from being forced to pay child support if the mother decides to keep the child, as well as dissociate himself entirely with the child. In the case that the father wants to keep the child but the mother does not, she could conduct this same procedure, and instead of being forced into abortion could simply pass the child to the father upon birth.

There of course are some flaws in this view but I believe overall it is better than the current system. It should also be noted that I am not some male rights activist trying to help deadbeat dads weasel out of child support. This system is a tool to help children being born who should have been aborted.


EDIT: Great responses reading through them now my opinion is very mixed but I'll try to respond in defense of this view regardless.

I do not have an issue with people disagreeing with him. However, I am a very opinionated person myself and I engage these people on facebook when I disagree with what they are saying. For example, today (and the inspiration for this post) a friend of mine posted a screenshot of a conversation which boiled down to this:

Women are expected to change for men. If a man wants kids and a woman doesn't, the woman is expected to have kids. Man wants X, woman wants Y, man gets X.

I pointed out that men go through this too. I pointed out other inequalities that men experience. I was disregarded as an asshole, as someone who didn't have sympathy for my friend who went through this experience, and as someone who just wanted to hurt people to get his point across.

It didn't matter to her that I felt like my sex was being marginalized by petty nonsense - I pointed out that men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide. I pointed out that men are 3 times more likely to be assaulted in public. I pointed out that men receive longer prison sentences for the same crime, and I pointed out that male domestic abuse victims are not taken seriously. I even provided studies and sources for all of these statistics. None of that mattered. I was an asshole for doing exactly the same thing she did: pointing out an experience that my sex has to go through. Her post was celebrated, my rebuttal was admonished.

My feelings didn't matter, and they never have. That was just one example. It doesn't matter to her, or to society at large that these inequalities against men exist. There are no mens-rights-activists in office, or if there are, they are making their activism public. Yet feminism is still regarded as a proud label and no woman in office would dare deny being a feminist.

I also think the same about people who oppose free speech advocates objections to encroachments on free speech on the grounds that 'it only applies to government interference'.If the best justification you can find for suppressing free intercourse is that it technically not covered, this is a pretty poverty stricken basis to object with.

Free Speech is an open philosophical debate about the place,limits and substance of free speech within a society..it is not just a textbook technical definition.The legal definition which differs from place to place is the current state of the deadlock and official consensus but in any given society there are significant minorities who want to expand or clamp down completely on free speech.

There are lots of reasons to find the desire to suppress free expression of thought objectionable even if plausibly moral reasons are given for doing so:

1.Clampdowns always ultimately impact the powerless and minorities more

2.Clampdowns are almost always turned directly on minorities as soon as possible

3.The ability to even articulate the objections above and the ones to follow are obstructed or made impossible by restrictions

4.The premise of 'unacceptable thoughts' is a recipe for generating dishonesty, even in otherwise decent people

5.Explicit refusal to tolerate unpopular views creates backlashes that usually become conservative and reactionary

6.A narrow technical understanding and application of free speech is not supportive of the entailing principles..truth,truth to power, probity of institutional power, expression of psychological and cultural diversity etc

First of all, I've never properly visited the middle east and my knowledge of Iran is limited, so I'd love to be proven wrong on any of my points. From asking some friends and family and looking around a little on the web, it's my understanding that I will be expected to wear clothes outside of my comfort zone (covering my legs/head in the heat does not sound fun), will not be able to hug/kiss my boyfriend in public without potentially offending locals (not that I'll particularly want to but i would like the choice to do so without having to worry about doing so without thinking) and may get treated in a way different to what I am used to simply because I am a woman. 

My motive for not going is fed both by a morality point of view (I strongly disagree with the way women are still not seen as equals and by visting the country and funding them via tourism I am somehow endorsing this) and from a comfort point of view (I want to relax on holiday and don't want to have to worry about whether what I'm doing or saying is upsetting people).

So, to me it just seems wrong to not tell the person your actual sex before engaging in intimacy.  If I identify as a straight man, and you present yourself as a straight woman, but you were born a man, it seems very deceitful to not tell me that before we make out or have sex.  You are not respecting my sexual preferences and, more or less, ""tricking"" me into having sex with a biological male.  

But I'm having a lot of trouble analogizing this.  If I'm exclusively attracted to redheads, and I have sex with you because you have red hair, but I later find out you colored your hair and are actually brunette, that doesn't seem like a big deal.  I don't think you should be required to tell me you died your hair before we make out.  

If I'm attracted only to beautiful people and I find out you were ugly and had plastic surgery to make yourself beautiful, that doesn't seem like a big deal either.

But the transgender thing just feels different to me and I'm having trouble articulating exactly why.  Obviously, if the point of the sex is procreation it becomes a big deal, but if it's just for fun, how is it any different from not disclosing died hair or plastic surgery?  

I think it would be wrong not to disclose a sex change operation.  I think there is something fundamental about being gay/bi/straight and you are being deceitful by not disclosing your actual sex.

Change my view.

EDIT:  I gotta go.  I'll check back in tomorrow (or, if I have time, later tonight).

A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack. Removing a smartphone component and replacing it with wireless earbuds that are much easier to misplace, AND requiring the user to purchase a separate lightning-to-3.5mm adapter that costs $10 and is described as ""fragile"" and ""poorly made"". One could say that this is intentional and forces the user to spend more money to replace these parts once they break or are lost. 

Now let's look at the software. Mac OS is exclusive to Apple products, which forces me to pick up one of their $2000+ Macbooks if I want to even touch their operating system. People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows, but having used Windows, OS X, and Linux, I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers, Linux is superior, with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.

Compatibility between hardware and software is also an issue. Apple has specifically designed it such that their devices will only function with THEIR equipment. Want to add some songs to your iPhone? Better open up iTunes! Need a new cable? Time to go the Apple Store!

But people will still buy it, because it's Apple, after all. They want to walk around with their fancy white earbuds and their Apple-branded bottles and T-shirts. The company has done such a great job at establishing their brand image over the last few decades that they can send out overpriced, mediocre products and still make money. People are so distracted by the brand that they fail to see this. Apple knows that they will always have dedicated consumers who throw money at them, and as a result, they no longer feel the need to innovate when they can recycle the same concepts year after year. 

EDIT: After reading some responses, probably the one that changed my view the most was that if a person sees an item as being valuable, they are justified in spending money on it. In this case, the demand for an Apple product is not so much the brand image as it is the perceived uses of the product from the perspective of that person. Therefore it is not ""overpriced"" if people *are* willing to pay that much for it. 

Anyway, these comments have provided some new perspective for me. I probably won't get through all the responses but you can consider my view at least somewhat changed. :)

In response, there have been pro-Islam rallies and other people supporting Islam. Regarding religious beliefs, my personal view is to let people believe what they want as long as they aren't hurting others. 

Anyway, one thing that confuses me is that some of the people supporting Islam were claiming that opposing Islam makes somebody racist. Some believe that criticising the beliefs of Islam, the ideas of Islam, etc. (not criticising a person based on their race, colour of their skin etc.) is racist. I don't understand that logic, because Islam is a religion, not a race. 

Not to mention, if someone opposes other religions, for example Christianity or Buddhism, they aren't told they're racist, so why can people say if you oppose Islam you are racist? 

If anyone can help me gain perspective of this argument that opposing Islam is racist, I'd really appreciate it. "	109	108	
4855832	changemyview	447208136	https://www.reddit.com//r/changemyview/comments/7e9808/cmv_bitcoins_price_is_unrelated_to_its/	2017-11-20 14:30:49		VladMolina	CMV: Bitcoin's price is unrelated to its fundamental value	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7e9808/cmv_bitcoins_price_is_unrelated_to_its/	"Bitcoin is currently trading at $8145.  At the beginning of the year it was around $1000, at the beginning of 2016 it was about $500, and of course a few years ago it was around $13.

It is unclear to mean how I could quantify the intrinsic value of a bitcoin, even within a huge range, like say an order of magnitude.  Should its value be closer to $1,000/BTC or $10,000/BTC?  I have little way to tell.

One tie into fundamentals is the cost of mining bitcoin.  However, apparently [hobby mining has been reasonably profitable at least since BTC was around $2500](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-surge-is-making-hobby-mining-profitable-again/).  Besides being empirically refuted, there are other reasons to doubt this method of estimating bitcoin value.  First, the creation cost of a bitcoin only says something about a ceiling on its value -- if it costs more than that amount, it ought to entice people to start mining bitcoins, adding to bitcoin supply and reducing prices, but if bitcoin prices slip below this value there is no market mechanism to bring them higher.  Even as a ceiling, it is still flawed: buying bitcoin miners upfront is an investment with obvious risks, so your expected profit from mining would need to be a pretty high rate of return at current prices to heavily increase the rate of mining.  Also, the fact that eventually there is an absolute cap on outstanding bitcoins implies that this price enforcing mechanism has an expiration date.

So what we are left with is an open market for bitcoins trading in US Dollars, which certainly shows the clearing level in supply vs demand today.  But an answer that references supply and demand will not change my view.  When I say fundamental value, I mean something independent of the current price and the price history.  I'm looking for an indicator that would tell me today that bitcoin is way too cheap if its current price was $100 and $100 was the all time record high, and that would tell me that bitcoin was trading way too expensive if its current price was $100,000 and it had been at $10,000 a year ago, and $5000 a year before that etc.

P.S. -- Only tangentially related to this point, I also see bitcoin as having questionable qualitative fundamentals as a currency.  Currencies can be evaluated based on their usefulness as a store of value or medium of exchange.  Bitcoin's exchange rate versus other currencies is extremely volatile, undermining the idea that it is a secure store of value -- its value could be doubled or halved in a matter of weeks.  As a medium of exchange, I cannot use it most places I transact in dollars.  Even where it can be used, the transaction process is for the vendor to convert the dollar price of goods to Bitcoins at the current exchange rate, and exchange your bitcoins into dollars as soon as the transaction takes place.  So its value as a medium of exchange is derivative from dollars too.

PPS -- This problem does not apply to international fiat currencies to the same degree, because of international trade.  The spot exchange rate of two national currencies is a supply/demand equilibrium, just like bitcoin.  However, if US Dollars suddenly only bought half as many Euros as they used to, US demand for goods made in the EU would fall, because those goods would suddenly cost more USD.  Meanwhile Europe would have higher demand for suddenly cheap-in-EUR US-made goods.  The US would build a big trade surplus with Europe.  As goods flow from US to EUR, capital used to purchase those goods would flow from EUR into USD.  That flow drives up the spot price of USD/EUR, enforcing a return to an equilibrium range of exchange rates.  This works for international currencies because there are huge numbers of people who make all their purchases in USD and never in EUR, are always paid in USD and never in EUR, and don't have the easy option to switch purchasing currencies at a whim.  This set of conditions does not apply to any cryptocurrency: there is no sizable community of people whose income and expenses are all in bitcoins.

edit: I see many similar threads on the subreddit.  I am not arguing that bitcoin is a bubble.  I am specifying a contrast I see with other currency (foreign exchange) markets.  I am making some arguments about mining as a price mechanism that I don't see elsewhere.  The answers on the other threads I read did not address these points in conjunction, nor did they change my view."	31	37

This provides a competitive advantage to men, and those who change gender retain some of this advantage. I don't believe allowing athletes who have become female to compete at a high level is fair on their competition. 
The current system allows athletes to begin competing as female once they have achieved a certain testosterone level, but this is not fully understood, and people like Laurel Hubbard (nz weightlifter who used to compete as a man) benefit from their years of training as men.

I honestly think that this idea springs from a failure on the part of the educational system to explain how democratic societies work.

I can only talk about the education I had, so I think it's appropiate to point a few details. I'm from Argentina, where the Ministery of Education dictates what topics should be adressed during our 6 years of secondary school. From years 2-5 we have a subject called Citizen and Ethical Formation which focuses on teaching human rights, forms of discrimination, how the constitution and our goverment works, etc. 

So, one of the big points we are taught when it comes to taxation is that it is necesary for a society to function, a country can **not** rely solely on it's industry and exports to mantain a good level of life for its citizens.

To me, this idea that taxation is theft shows how little people understand about societies and how they function, but there may be a detail I'm missing, like political leaning or personal prejudice.

Anyway, I would like to hear specially from any American that thinks this way, almost every time I read about this argument it seems to come from our neighbours up north."	1	0

Essentially by telling people they fundamentally are, or should be, different, a wedge is driven between seeing everyone as equally valuable members of society. 

Either A: You're white, and if you don't outperform peers of color then you're failing because you had a head start and still aren't winning the race. (Racist because it implies white people should be better at X given thing  than people of color. And therefore in a transitive way, people of color should be worse than you be default unless you aren't living up to your potential.)

Or B: If you are a person of color, your equally skilled white coworker had an advantage and is thus lazier than you, and you are a harder worker/better person. (Racist because it assigns higher value to one race over another. Namely ""People of color are harder workers than white people, categorically, all other things held constant."")

My personal position is that we should assess people's skills and capabilities in the moment, and not make assumptions based on the way they were born. Crazy right? But maybe I'm totally off base. "	241	296

When you're in a relationship, and you split up, you normally divide things by who it belongs to, even if there is a major difference or similarity in income. I bought the TV, I should keep the TV. You bought the couch, you should keep the couch.

This suddenly change when you enter marriage. The division is now 50/50, even though the contribution could be 90/10.

I come from en economic background, so I just see it as asset placement. The one who contributed the most, should have the most in a settlement.

I know there is such a thing as an enabler. If one partner allows the other partner to work more or be more effective, this can contribute to the overall utility of the home. I.e. the example of the 60's family where there is a houseworking woman and a working man. The woman does all the work at home, so the man can focuses on his work, bringing home income. However this model can't be accurately projected into the present world, where both men and women work equally and split house chores.

So I would find it completely valid if a woman, on average over the period of the marriage, contributed double what her husband did, she should receive double the amount of assets as him. The same goes the other way around.

Take an example of a firm on a stock market. There are 100 contributors to the firm (100 shareholders), 90 of these hold a total value of 9% of the firm i.e. 0.1% each. The remaining 10 hold a total value of 91% of the firm i.e. 9.1% each. If the firm closes down, the assets of the firm shouldn't be split in 100 equal parts. No, it should be split by contribution to the firm. The same goes if the firm produces a dividend, the dividend should be split according to contribution and not equally. This is also how firms legally work.

By splitting it equally it removes the incentive to invest more, why should I invest more than the bare minimum if I'm only able to receive the average under all circumstances?

Now take this back into the relationship, if my spouse produces x amount of income and ""invest"" it into our shared life (Contribution), why should I invest 2x or 100x? I know it's an extreme example, but it gets the point across. Only if I know that I can keep the difference, I have an incentive to invest. Everything else is irrational.

Please take in mind that I'm not up for the ""You bought this, you keep this"" mentality in a marriage, since you could have split your income in-equally i.e. I buy groceries for the month, and you buy the table and chairs we need. If one only buys all the necessary items like food and general supplies, this should be seen just as much of a contribution as buying a table and chairs, under the assumptions that these equal in cost. I'm only focusing on contribution.

As I said, I've not taken any sociologic or politologic assumptions into my thoughts, only the economical aspect.

Hope you can help me out here. I've presented my views to friends and family over the years and most of them sees this as greed or like I have egotistic views. I simply can't see why I should contribute with twice as much as my spouse and expect to share equally. Or how I cannot feel guilty by contributing half as much as my spouse and expect to receive equally. 

This is clearly hypothetical."	88	142

If a man transitions to a woman, and competes in their division, despite potential hormone treatments he may still have an unfair advantage. Conversely, if a woman transitions to a man with testosterone treatments, but laws are in place blocking competition with other divisions, the woman will essentially be doping in her league. While it does restrict opportunities for transgender athletes, it does more harm for their competition, in both cases. Seems like a lose-lose situation, but restricting transgender athletes to intramural or lower divisions may be the best solution. Change my view, or provide insight.

While I agree with banning autistic and retarded since they are often used by the right as insults, I don't agree with banning stupid or dumb.

My reasoning for this is that words like autistic very clearly refer to a specific group of people, and as such, they're slurs. The n-word is only used in reference to black people. That's why it is a slur. As I see it, words are only slurs if they can only be applied to certain individuals based on bodily characteristics. If I were to call someone an ass, that's not a slur because it can be applied to anyone, regardless of their abilities, race, or gender. Stupid and dumb both imply that someone is less mentally capable than someone else, however the context for the words are usually much different and only apply to specific moments. People apply those words to individual actions, like 'wow, that was a dumb thing to do' and other times will call someone stupid because of an action they performed, such as with 'that person is stupid as all hell' (after seeing them run in front of traffic, or something). 

Furthermore, retard and autist are both shortened version of retarded and autistic, and both of these words refer to people with different developmental traits. They are used outside of insults to literally refer to people medically. Stupid and dumb, however, aren't attached to any sort of medical condition. They aren't shortened versions of 'stupidation' or 'dumbtism', they're their own words that refer, generally, to doing something irrationally. Often times, they are interchangeable with words like silly, though they carry a slightly different meaning, which is why they are used.

I'm a socialist, and I agree with ableism in general. The purpose of this post isn't to try and convince me that ableism is or is not a real issue, or that I should avoid all ableist words and phrases. I'm asking other leftists why stupid and dumb specifically should be used when, as I see it, they are usually harmless and aren't used to demean specific groups of people.

For any democratic system, any bill or local decision should be able to be vetoed out by the citizens of the state/city/county/etc

#Why:

In local level, this can easily be used to prevent corruption inside city planning and construction work. It also gives citizen more power and choice: The citizen can veto more factories and apartments from being planned.

In bigger picture, this rule change can prevent anything from EU restrictions (if even by forcing the country's representitives to vote certain way) and prevent laws the main populus heavily disagrees with.

#How:

When a certain amount of the populus, from 30-10% sign up a veto petition, the law change cannot pass until the poll is done. All citizen (depending on the should be able to vote ""yes"" or ""no vote"" (not sure if there should be ""no"" vote) in the local poll stations. The votes then choose if the decision is vetoed or not. In most ideal world, this vote should also include a checkbox to impeach the politician(s) who ran the bill in the goverment, to prevent trying to get the decision through multiple times and give incentive not to go test your luck as politician.

Of course, this veto should not be able to be used against emergency powers or anything of such magnitude, for obvious reasons.

EDIT: I would also add taxes to the list of things that can't be vetoed.

EDIT: The 30% might be too small amount for local elections. A big union of workers could easily overturn any law that hurts them, especially if most workers are in that field.

*Q: “In tennis, should women earn as much as men?”*

*Nadal: “It’s a comparison we shouldn’t even make. Female models earn more than male models and nobody says anything. Why? Because they have a larger following. In tennis too, who gathers a larger audience earns more”.*

This is an English translation of a statement printed in an Italian language magazine for an interview that probably happened in Spanish, so it's quite possible his actual statement was not the same.

To me, this statement makes perfect sense. If Maria Sharapova or Serena Williams attract more viewers (or are able to sell more expensive tickets) than Andy Murray, they should get more money \- no question about it. To me it seems like feminists want to push for equality in places where they are at a disadvantage, but want to do nothing about situations where they are at an advantage, are likely to be paid more, or are more likely to be hired in the first place (models, porn stars, massage therapists, hospitality industry jobs, and so on).

But some feminists I follow, whose views I otherwise respect, are unhappy with the statement without specifying any valid reason.

I'd love to hear the other side of the story on this one.

***Edit***: this blew up way beyond my ability to handle all your replies! The only consensus seems to be that the quote, in isolation, is not wrong, but the broader issue of gender pay gap is anything but this simple.

I'm not here to change what people think about me I'm here cause I want you to change my mind about PC gaming. That said let's begin.

I don't think consoles are better than PC. I know that PC is ""objectively better"" However I hate that even though PC is better I still can't have my cake and eat it too. I just ~~hate~~ abhor it's disadvantages with purple passion and red fury. My first problem is digital games. Digital PC games have made physical games on all platforms an endangered species. Why? Because of convenience. Progress for the sake of convenience instead of quality is stupid. I'm an audiophile, videophile, archivist, and preservationist. One of the things AA and AAA developers do to digital games is compress audio, video, and other data so that you can fit more than 10 games on hard drive or solid state drive. I think that's BS, if a game is 50 gigs it should stay 50 gigs, if a game is over 100 gigs it should stay over 100 gigs. I want no worse than ""good"" not ""decent"" ""good."" I still buy CD's, records, laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-Ray. I watch and play most of my classic movies and games on CRTs. I even get movies on VHS and betamax. Analog audio and video has always sounded and looked better unless you're listing to FLAC or watching it on a DCP. That last one is only better if the film it was shot on was 35mm instead of 605 or 70mm. You also can't collect PC games. They don't appreciate in value, you can't display them beyond small ass digital cover art, they don't have rarity Worst of all you don't even own them thanks to DRM. They are horrible for archiving and preservation too because you don't actually own them. And don't say ""you don't own physical games because of IP laws..."" Wrong I don't own the game but I do own the copy of my game and that can't be revoked. Using flat DVD cases I can also store more AA and AAA games in my broom closet than on a 2 TB hardrive or solid state drive. Out of 10000 games on Steam only \~200 are DRM free. Also, don't direct me to GOG. Most of those games are indie shovelware and super-weeb games that haven't been patched since Barbie's last square meal. No rarity, no value, no ownership, no display, no deal.

Second thing I hate, the prices. You can say that they are cheaper in the long run but that depends on how you buy. I'm poor, I live in the slums of Sector 5. Some out in the cosmos, be it God, Mother Nature, or a conscious manifestation of the universe wants me to be poor. To stick it to them, I spend all extra expenditures on things that increase my net-worth. People on r/pcmasterrace say settle for decent, cheap, or low-end parts and upgrade as I go along. By the time it takes me to do that I could spend all the time it takes me to build a high end gaming rig I could be picking and repairing, or collecting books, movies, games and other media. Spending 6\~12 months working on building a PC is a stupid $#!+ hobby because it would decrease my net-worth while I'm doing it and the profits I get from the after wouldn't be enough to compensate (I'm not happy unless profits are at least 10&amp;#37; higher than what I spent). If I'm buying a PC it's going to be high end, it's going to last me a decade or more, and I'm going to buy it all at once. The tower and part's inside over $1000 USD give or take inflation. I only want the fastest ports and buses, the fastest and most powerful processors, and the highest amount of RAM and writable memory. It also needs a Blu-Ray drive. A good monitor will be $100\~200 USD, a gaming mouse and key board plus other peripherals will cost me 30$ each, and I'd get warranties because If a single thing breaks I'm getting it replaced or every cent refunded. Yes I am the kind of person who cares more about his net worth as a financial statistic than my sentimental worth as a person. I also think that if PC is objectively the best platform than I am ethically entitled to the best experience. Also I don't care if PC games **can** be cheaper thanks to steam and GOG. I hate Valve's business practices, and I don't want to wait 6 months to 5 years for the price to be marked down or it becomes DRM free on GOG. I play games when they are relevant, classic or retro, or when I'm interested. Speaking of which I don't play indie games unless the devs or pubs spend at least $100K on marketing.

Third thing I hate is the lack of portability. Don't bring up GPD Win because it's an unergonomic mess, and don't bring up laptops because they are way too expensive for what they are worth. I love all my handheld consoles. My game gear, my GBA, my 3DS, My PSP, my PS Vita, and my Neo Geo Pocket Color. I need something ergonomic that I can take out of my pocket, turn on, and play. You can't do that with a laptop of any size. A laptop is something I'd take with me to work or school and play on when I have free time. I know I said quality over convenience but the latter still matters and a laptop isn't convenient at all.

EDIT: I should make clear. I know that handheld gaming devices will most likely never be the same caliber as PCs and home consoles so I'm willing to make a compromise for them since the portability outweighs the disadvantage."	0	59

I think one of the top posts of all time there is some guy who took a picture of a white person drinking out of a gallon of water and said something like ""Look at this guy. Stupid white people."" 


To me racism is racism. Do people think because white people have historically been terrible to black peoplepr that some white people are racist that it justifies racism against them? That's not going to fix anything. Two wrongs don't make a right, it's that simple.

This provides a powerful incentive to a CEO to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. The downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low-skill workers, with CEOs making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage. Therefore, I think that as well as being tied to stock, CEO salary should also be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers	1974	1636

Natural law as a philosophy doesn't make sense except when examined through religious glasses. How can you deserve something naturally for being born?

* There's no agreement over what natural rights are, which weakens the case for them existing. Often life and liberty are the main rights called natural, but even they clash in almost every aspect that can be named.

* Many actions preformed by humans in the past and present are seen or can be seen to violate natural rights, but were/are perfectly acceptable in their society. This goes against the idea that anyone can understand them with reason.

* Many parameters outside a person's control dictate their ability to cash in on their rights. Country of birth, socioeconomic status and more can (and often do) determine not only what you do with your life, but also what you *can* do with your life. I don't think you can call it a natural right if you can never fulfill it; if you've never had it, you didn't get it from nature.

My main thought - you can't see natural rights in existence, you can only see human-given rights. The only reason to believe you have any right is if you believe in a deity or religion that claims you have them. Belief in natural rights is exactly that - belief.

More often than not they hide behind the guise of “Freethought” and often view themselves as superior. They belittle and bully Christians all while shaming Christians for the doing the same things. Atheists will shove their beliefs and their science down the throats of anyone they believe to be religious or even on the fence.

No one on late night TV is getting laughs with witty defenses of Trump or Mitch McConnell. When someone does make a funny and insightful joke at the expense of a Democrat, that person is usually a liberal themselves, as some brands of humor are reflective and self-deprecating, and because their fellow liberals are also capable of some of the same hypocrisy and idiocy as conservatives. 

Jim Jefferies got famous off the back of a bit skewering the second amendment, and I’ve personally witnessed conservatives laughing at and enjoying parts of it. I’m not aware of anyone who hilariously defended unfettered gun rights. 

Even the political cartoons and memes on the right suck. It’s all just simplistic “ha-ha, those liberals are easily triggered by our beliefs” circle-jerking, or else it’s just blunt cruelty. 

Am I missing something? Is there a secret world of conservative hilarity out there?

Awarded a delta for the first person who brought up Tim Allen and Roseanne. They are valid responses given the wording of my OP, but not what I’m looking for in terms of actually changing my view. What I’m looking for are examples of people who can deliver compelling and funny conservative political commentary to a mass-media audience. Tim Allen and Roseanne played conservative-leaning characters to match many of their conservative ideals, but in my opinion their shows were ultimately about coming to terms with a liberal reality. I’m looking for a conservative equivalent to Stewart, Colbert, Meyers, etc, who can provide funny content for a mainstream audience that works as a defense of their politics. The Blue Collar Comedy tour was also mentioned: I’m not disputing that conservatives can be funny when talking about other things. But when it comes to politics specifically, they seem to either fall flat (Steven Crowder) or avoid trying in the first place (Blue Collar comics)."	209	863

Then, despite not knowing with 100% certainty whether what’s inside you is a human life, you decide to roll the dice and believe that it’s not. You then proceed with the possibility of murdering a human because you think it’s “probably” not. How is that not reckless?

In matters of life and death, shouldn’t we always play it safe? Shouldn’t saving a human life take precedence over avoiding inconvenience? I think people should do what they want with their body except for when what they do with their body results in murder. It’s about priorities.

It's hard to be a minority. Really, really hard. This is something I am unwilling to debate, and will not change my mind on this matter. I have suffered a great deal of racism and prejudice in my life just because I look different than most people, even if I'm not considered by admissions officers as ""aggrieved"" enough to deserve a leg up. Because of this, I know what it's like to face discrimination as a person of color.

But two wrongs do not make a right. Dr. Martin Luther King dreamed of a country where his children would not be judged ""by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character"". This is what I believe America should stand for, whether it comes to pursuing job opportunities, making use of the financial system, and, also, applying to college. This, in my opinion, is non-negotiable, regardless of any ""good"" that this could have on society.

And this is precisely why I have been so conflicted on this matter. Affirmative action has done a lot to benefit African Americans, Latino Americans, and women in this country. And having a diverse set of people on campus certainly has its benefits. I am willing to acknowledge both of these. But with all of the admissions scandals that have come to light in the last few months, as well as the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard, I am beginning to lose my sense of compliance with the system.

Take this for example. An admissions officer at Harvard made the following note on an Asian-American applicant: ""Oh, typical Asian student. Wants to be a doctor. Nothing special here."" And then these people turn around and say ""oh, we take all aspects of an applicant's profile into account"". They are lying through their teeth. Shame on that officer. I am sick of seeing so many of my friends and family face so much discrimination due to something that is out of their control. We work so hard in life to succeed, yet we are punished for being ourselves. It's time to draw a line in the sand.

My viewpoint is as follows. Under no circumstances, whatsoever, should colleges take race into account when choosing to or not to admit a student. Nothing should compromise racial discrimination when it comes to college admissions. If this negatively affects other minorities, tough shit. If this decreases the racial diversity of college campuses, tough shit. If this means that college campuses will be filled with a bunch of ""typical Asians that want to be doctors"", fucking deal with it.

Please, someone, give me a convincing argument to think otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your contributions. I'd like to ""mass response"" with my opinions on some of the more-discussed topics:

* Eliminating legacy admissions: I'm with this 100%. Statistically, it might even completely solve the problem without anyone suffering discrimination, even white people. This, in my view, is probably the best solution right now.
* Making up for centuries of discrimination: Doesn't matter. The people in the present did not contribute to the wrongdoings of their ancestors. It's difficult because the people that need to be held accountable are dead, but this doesn't mean we discriminate back against people who weren't even born yet.
* Why Asians outperform other races: Has almost nothing to do with culture, and mostly everything to do with immigration patterns.
* Affirmative action levels the playing field: So does abolishing legacy admissions. So does improving public education. So does getting rid of gerrymandering and racist zoning laws. There are plenty of ways to solve a complex problem, so a lack of creativity is no excuse for injustice.
* It’s not about disadvantaging Asians, it’s about giving an advantage: college admissions is a zero sum game, since there are a limited number of seats. This means that you can’t lift one group up without disadvantaging another.
* It's okay to disadvantage some people because they still benefit from their ancestors' actions: No it's not. It's not their fault.

EDIT 2: You have changed my mind. Kudos to [Andoverian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Andoverian) and [photobummer](https://www.reddit.com/user/photobummer) for the ""proof by contradiction"". Good job.

A bit more about my background, first of all. I'm a grad student in Electrical Engineering that's taken plenty of machine learning and artificial intelligence classes. One of the things that we talk about a lot is that AI, while it seems like it would be more impartial than humans, is not. It is completely dependent on data collected by humans, and humans are biased. In fact, they're even worse than humans, since for the most part they lack the capacity to have self-awareness that humans do.

I mentioned this in one of the comments below, and the ones that I just shouted out pointed out that this is precisely the reason why we need affirmative action. Because humans are biased, and bias needs to be monitored. This really connects the question at hand with something that I've spent a lot of time studying, which is why this realization has hit me so hard. Perhaps I'm blaming the wrong mechanism. After all, **what I'm really angry about is that Asian and Indian Americans are being discriminated against**. But this is happening because affirmative action is being used against us, not for us. I believe that affirmative action should be used to remind admissions officers that it's not okay to reject an Indian student on as blatantly shallow of a basis of ""being a typical Indian"".

Here's my revised thesis: **Affirmative action itself is not the problem - it's that it is not being used to combat biases against Asians and Indians.**

Thank you to every single one of you who contributed. I've responded to many of you as I could the past day, and have given deltas to those who gave arguments that genuinely gave me an interesting, unique, and convincing perspective, but I am going to leave this case to rest for now. I'm still passionate about discrimination and how it plays out with affirmative action, and perhaps someday I'll make another CMV regarding how Asians and Indians are treated in college admissions. Until then, though, I'm happy that we were all able to have this discussion."	3524	949

The current methods of action being taken by game developers and automated systems it to mute or ban any players that say anything considered to be offensive by their standards. Muted players are either temporarily or permanently unable to say anything to others after their punishment, and banned players are actually prevented from playing the game.

&amp;nbsp;

I am strongly against this. I believe that they should drop these punishments and instead allow for players to exercise greater control over what content they wish to see. Many games already allow for players to block communications from other people, and this could easily be expanded: any players that are constantly reported or flagged for offensive behavior could be assigned a label as being toxic and players would then have the option to automatically mute communication from these ""toxic"" players, while still allowing others to speak with them by default.

&amp;nbsp;

I believe that people should be allowed to say what they want to say, and, in many cases of video games, players only act toxic to blow off steam, mess around, or get a rile out of others - not to demonstrate true racist/sexist/offensive beliefs or ruin the enjoyment of the game for others. The game should be played how people want to play it and restricting players from launching their favorite game or enjoying all its features because of something they said is bullshit; furthermore, I don't think creating standards for what communication is allowed is okay, because it is all up to a matter of personal preference on what is acceptable and unacceptable to say.

No matter what actions a person takes you can always make the claim that they are simply pretending to not be racist. 

So, all it takes is a single racist act to prove that someone is racist. I hold this view because I have been unable to find a single racist comment or act despite searching for days. I have asked many people. They often say that they can’t remember or that they don’t want to misquote him and so they say nothing.

I only need one single racist comment or act from Donald trump in order to change my view. 

The act or comment must be discriminatory and must be directed either at a specific race, and/or must be discriminatory and be directed at a specific person based on the belief that one race or more races are superior to another race or more races.

This is much different from the post that was made about a month ago with the title “Donald trump is a racist”, because with this it will actually be possible to change my view.

Edit: I’m honestly trying really hard to find just one thing. While I’m waiting for someone here to change my view I will continue looking for evidence myself.

Edit: you can’t prove he is racist by simply saying that everyone is racist. You can only guarantee that someone is racist by pointing to a specific action or comment of theirs. I acknowledge that everyone has bias and prejudices, but not everyone is racist.

Edit: I’m gonna try my best to respond to all of these, be patient.

Edit: it’s possible for people to change over time, so only example from after he became president."	0	212

The earth is being absolutely fucked by humans and there’s nothing you, as an individual, can do to prevent this. No, buying organic food or going vegan won’t stop the cruel torture of animals across the world, let alone put a dent in the demand for their meat. No, buying an electric car won’t stop pollution because the amount of pollution you were giving off is &lt;0.00001% of the total pollution being squirted out into the world. 

Switching to these environally-friendly lifestyles may seem like a noble thing to do and indeed it does have optimism for the future, but realistically it won’t accomplish anything. 

My opinion further expanded: I believe The only way true change will occur is if a mass social media controversy/movement occurs that single-handedly forces x industry/government to change their ways to accommodate the uproar. And the odds of that occurring, let alone the odds of them actually giving in to such demands, is very unlikely.

It would make drunk driving nearly impossible.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/eentgu/cmv_ignition_interlock_devices_should_be_required/	"An ignition interlock is a device that requires a driver to blow into a built-in breathalyzer before the car will start.  They also require the driver to blow into it at random intervals while driving.  This is to ensure that the driver didn't just have someone else blow into it to start the car and then drive away drunk.  They are typically installed on the cars of people who have received multiple DUIs, but I can't see any reason why they aren't mandatory on every vehicle.  Having this as a requirement would practically eliminate drunk driving.  Let me address some potential counterpoints in advance:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **It would drive up the cost of cars.**  Yes, it would but we all agreed that seat belts need to be mandatory in vehicles since they save lives.  This increases the overall cost of cars, but it's worth it.  The same can be said for airbags or any other mandatory safety device that has been added to cars over the years.  Also, most new cars have a ton of superfluous safety features that won't help much if you are driving drunk or someone who is drunk crashes into you.  Why not add a feature that will actually make a huge difference?
2. **People would find a way around it.**  Yeah, sure people will try to hack them and bypass them, but that's not really a good reason not to do it.  A lot of drunk driving is not premeditated, so most people would not bother messing with theirs.  Also, a cop during any traffic stop would be able to check if the device has been tampered with and could issue a ticket for having an altered device.
3. **Periodically blowing into a device is distracting and dangerous.**  Yeah, maybe, but driving drunk is way more dangerous, and I think you're gonna have a really hard time arguing that this distraction would cause more harm than drunk driving currently causes.
4. **It infringes on personal freedom.**  Drunk driving is illegal.  You do not have the freedom to drive drunk, so no freedom is being taken away.
5. **What about all the cars already on the road?**  Here is how I'm envisioning the rollout of this policy.  A law is passed that requires all new cars produced from 2022 on to be outfitted with an ignition interlock.  This gives manufacturers time to add this feature to the production process.  All title transfers from 2025 on must show proof of the installation of an ignition interlock to be approved.  This gives consumers 5 years to get one installed on their car.  All state inspections (required for title transfer in the US) and all vehicle emissions inspections will require the presence of a functioning ignition interlock in order to pass.
6. **But that will make buying even a used car more expensive.**  Technically it will make selling a car more expensive.  When you sell a car, you have to make sure that all safety features are working anyway.  For example, in order to transfer a vehicle title, the seller must make sure that the vehicle can pass a state inspection which checks for things like cracks in the windshield, problems with the airbags, etc.  If the vehicle fails the inspection, the seller must repair the part that caused the failure to pass the test before they can sell the car.  In a decade or so almost all cars on the road would be fitted with ignition interlock devices, and drunk driving would be nearly impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  I'm getting a lot of comments regarding point #3 where people seem to think that periodically blowing into this device is going to cause more deaths than drunk driving currently does.  Sorry, but no way.  Drunk driving kills about 29 people every day in the US\*.  Distracted driving (which includes taking your eyes off the road, taking your hands off the wheel, or even taking your mind off driving) accounts for about 9 deaths every day in the US\*\*.  So, I think that periodically blowing into a device while driving would account for less than 9 deaths per day, while mandatory use of an ignition interlock would decrease daily drunk driving deaths significantly.  

Though I have given out some deltas for good points and obstacles to my plan that have pointed out, my view remains unchanged as none of them seem insurmountable or prohibitive.

Or even that his rough treatment was racially motivated. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the way the police treated him was correct or proper conduct. However, to insinuate that his unfortunate death is due to racism and not at all because of George Floyd's own actions is ignorant and disingenuous. The man was a career criminal. He was high on meth, phentynol, and had also robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint. When he was arrested, instead of obeying and complying like a normal person, he behaved like a man on drugs (which he was) and tried to fight against the officers and run away. None of this would have happened if he had simply accepted his arrest like a normal person. 

People are dying and businesses are being destroyed in these protests for what? To honor a scum bag by all accounts, who may not have deserved to die, but pretty much caused his own demise. Regardless of skin color, if you behave the way George did when under arrest, you will be treated with force. Race had little if anything to do with his arrest.

It infuriates me that no one even talks about the innocent men and women killed in these riots such as Officer David Dorn who was killed im the line of duty, yet they are immortalizing a career criminal in the media.

George Floyd's Death is being used as a political tool to push an agenda and perpetuate the belief that most/all white cops are racist, when in fact the VAST MAJORITY are good cops.

EDIT: I want to clarify that IMO George Floyd's death was UNJUSTIFIED and the Officer involved definitely behaved inappropriately. I am simply fed up with the portrayal that George's death was entirely racially motivated and not at all caused at least in part by his own criminality.

EDIT 2: I agree that attacking George Floyd's character and giving the perception that I believe his death was justified due to this was a mistake and have changed my mind about this. The reason I brought up his character (or rather lack thereof), is because it annoys me that the media is portraying him as a saint and ignores all the innocent deaths caused by the protests. These innocent deaths IMO deserve far more attention and remembrance than the likes of George Floyd's."	2	124	0.52

And in addition, I've seen conservatives oppose the ability for government to be involved in funding birth-control methods and also support the reason Supreme Court decision to let employers opt-out of purchasing birth control for their employees under the Affordable Care Act

Yet I'm confused why conservative people and Pro-Lifers arent more pro-contraception? The reality of the situation is two-fold:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A lot of younger people in serious relationships (but not married) are probably the people that have the majority of sex. These are two people that are already dating, already comfortable with each other, possibly living in an apartment, and having sex very regularly.
2. More casual, first-time hook-ups, use Condoms. Condoms (arguably the highest effective-to-cost ratio of any contraception method) are not 100% reliable, even with perfect use.

By accepting these premises, it's easy to imagine that people in the first category don't want to use condoms because A. It's a very high expense given the amount of sexual-activity B. They're more comfortable with each other, have been dating for a while and don't have to worry about STDs. Then, it would stand to reason, they that would pursue other methods of Birth Control that are more difficult to access than condoms. These methods, such as the Pill, IUD, and the Patch are more expensive and sometimes require doctors visit and non-insurance-covered payments.

In category 2, Pro-Lifers should be advocating for people to double-up on methods of contraception. However, in that case, they should probably advocate for the usage of the most effective and most convenient methods to be used, in which case they should be politically aligned with movements trying to make access to other birth control methods easier.

In conclusion, pointing to ""Condoms"" as a 100% effective and extremely convenient way of contraception is unrealistic given A. The characteristics of where the majority of sex happens and the context B. The actual raw percentage effectiveness condoms have. Therefore, Pro-Lifers should be on the frontlines, trying to argue for more funding of Birth Control method research, funding to make access to alternative and more effective methods of Birth Control easier to access, and finally, more effective sex-education to make people aware of which methods are the most effective at reducing pregnancy.

TLDR: If you accept the premise that a large, large people are going to have sex before marriage, and you think abortion is murder, then you should advocate for extremely convenient access to more effective forms of birth control to prevent the pregnancy in the first place. Not just point to Condoms and say problem solved.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: People are asking for me to clarify my definition of pro-contraception and I think that is totally fair. By pro-contraception I mean less in the boat of:

""I tolerate the existence and ability for people to purchase...""

And more in the boat with, to quote someone from the comments:

""I think hormonal birth control and IUDs should be subsidized and considered part of all insurance plans, possibly condoms as well.""

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are making arguments about how it is *possible* for people to be Pro-Life and Anti-Contraception at the same time.

I don't particularly like throwing away swaths of arguments as bad faith, but the arguments for the EC are so thin that it's hard to see supporting it as anything other than a shrewd political ploy. Here are my main reasons for supporting a popular vote rather than the EC.

1. In general, popular sovereignty is good.  It should take very powerful considerations to take elections out of the hands of the people.  I don't feel the need to argue for a popular vote system because it's so clearly the best option for a nation that claims to be Democratic. You can say the whole Republic/Democracy thing and I super-duper don't care. I know we are a Republic.  I passed high school civics.  We could have a popular vote system that chooses the executive and still be a Republic.  The EC is *almost* a popular vote system the way it operates now.  It's given the same result as a popular vote system 91% of the time.  The times that it hasn't have been random, close elections.
2. ""One person, one vote"" is a valuable principle, and we should strive to live up to it.  Simple arithmetic can show that a voter in Wyoming has around 3 times more influence on the EC than a voter in California.  This wouldn't be true if it wasn't for the appropriations act in the 1920's, which capped the number of people in the House of Representatives at 435.  In the EC as it was designed, California would have many more electoral votes now, and the gap between Wyoming and Cali wouldn't be nearly as large.
3. There is no fundamental value in giving rural America an outsized say in elections.  I've often heard that the EC was created to protect rural interests.  This isn't true, but even if it was, I don't see the value in giving small states more influence.  This is where I developed the idea that most of the arguments are in bad faith.  Particularly because the current kind of inequality we have now in the EC was never intended by the founders.   If you are supporting the EC just because it favors rural areas, and you also know rural areas tend to vote red, then you just have that position for partisan reasons.
4. The ""elector"" system is very dumb and bad.  Do we really want 538 people that we've never heard of to get the ability to overturn an election?  This isn't a group of able statesmen, the electors are largely partisan figures.  In most states, you don't even see that you are voting for an elector instead of for a candidate for president.  These are elected officials only in the most vague sense of the term.  The idea that this ceremonial body is some kind of safe-guard is laughable.
5. The concept of ""swing states"" is bad for democracy.  Focusing on groups of swing voters in 5/6 states leads to undue attention and money being used to persuade smaller groups of voters. It also creates a sense of votes being worthless. I was a Democrat in a deep red state for a long time, and it felt like my vote didn't matter because my state was going to go red anyway.  And that's going to be true for most voters, apart from the 5/6 swing states that are uncertain on election day.  It's hard to know if that is pushing turnout down, but it certainly isn't having a positive effect.
6. The EC makes elections less secure.  Instead of a popular vote system where it would take a hue effort to change enough votes to make a difference, rigging state elections in swing states could have a huge impact.  The targets for interference are clear, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida could be changed with relatively small numbers of votes.  This also makes voter suppression a tactic that can work on a national scale, if applied in the correct states.

EDIT: 

Alright, I need to get to my actual work-job instead of rage-posting about the electoral college. I've enjoyed reading everyone's responses and appreciate your participation. Some final responses to some underlying points I've seen:

1. Lots of people saying I just hate the EC because of Trump. I have literally hated the electoral college since I learned about it in the 6th grade. For me, this isn't (fully) partisan. I absolutely would still be against the electoral college if a Democrat won the EC and a Republican won the popular vote. I know you may I'm lying, and I grant that this isn't something I can really prove, but it's true. Feel free to hold me to it if that ever happens. My position is currently, and always has been, the person who gets more votes should be president.
2. The historic context of the electoral college, while important to understanding the institution, has an outsized influence on how we talk about presidential elections. I would much rather look forward to a better system than opine about how wise the system set up in 1787 was. The founders were smart, smarter than me. But we have 350 years of hindsight of how this system practically works, which is very valuable.
3. I was wrong to say all defenses of the EC were bad faith or partisan, I see that now. I still believe a portion of defenses are, but there are exceptions. The fact that most discussions of the EC happen just after a close election give all discussions surrounding the issue a hyper-partisan tone, but that doesn't have to be the rule.
4. If you think farmers are worth more to the country because they're farmers, I have some news to you about who was doing the farming in 1787. It wasn't the voters, I can tell you that much.
5. I'm sorry if I appeared brusque or unappreciative of your comments, this thread got way more attention than I expected. I'm re-reading my responses now and there's absolutely some wording choices I'd change, but I was in a hurry.

A lot of people have said I am like the character Moss (for the uninitiated [https://imgur.com/gallery/k12ft](https://imgur.com/gallery/k12ft) ).  I have thought a few times about going to a fancy dress party as him, but this would mean I would want to ""brown face"" to complete the look (the actor Richard Ayoade is half Nigerian).  I have never done this and am likely never going to as it is perceived as racist/insensitive and I am happy to not offend.

I understand that white people used to blackface to unfavourably portray black people in theatre before black people were allowed to work etc. - I understand that going as a Minstrel to fancy dress is not on because of the connotations it carries. However, if it fits with a character that you admire and want to celebrate then there should not be any resistance.  I don't understand where the sensitivity comes from and I think the white wash (no pun intended) no-black face, ever, rule is draconian.

Things that may be useful to point out:

\- This question is not about ""***MY RIGHT***"" to be able to don brown face if I want - honestly it does not affect my life. I just don't necessarily agree with the whole premise.

\- Yes, I could go without the brown face and make it work, but it would just look like me in some funny trousers and I like to go all in with fancy dress.

I think the idea that capitalism gives more people opportunity is a joke. In fact, it's crazy how people who believe in capitalism argue both that ""everyone has the American Dream"" while also supporting the idea of a hierarchy and the elite wealthy.

Some people even go so far as to say it is worth sacrificing social services for a large number of people in exchange for the infinitesimally small chance that you could become incredibly wealthy. As someone who truly believes in the equality of all peoole, I find this so hard to wrap my head around.

Here are some of my personal opinions on capitalism: It encourages people to undermine and take advantage of others, it institutes a zero sum game in which someone must lose for you to win and true capitalism makes money the ultimate arbiter of morality.

Here is some background on me: Both of my parents are white. One of my parents went from sewing their clothes out of dirty rags poor to upper middle class. At some point in their life they were making enough money to be considered a 1%, but just barely.

My other parent was raised in a middle class household and remained middle class.
Politically, I'm a socialist. I don't care much about how you think it would be difficult to pull off.

In fact, if anyone wants to make comments about how hard it would be to run a socialist government without corruption, you're going to have to defend the disgusting corruption (monopolies, bribes, organized crime) involved in a capitalist society that people don't seem to have a huge deal wifh.

Anyway, I know a lot of people say that capitalism has helped them. I am open to the idea that maybe it really could bring the most prosperity to the most people and perhaps it was just America that fucked it up so badly. I'm open to it. That's why I'm here anyway, so if i could find some rational capitalist supporters who aren't going to irrationally fear socialism then please respond to this post."	0	125	0.45

A fetus might not be called a human being because there's no heartbeat, or because there's no pain receptors, or later in pregnancy they're still not a human because they're still not self-sufficient, etc. I am not concerned with the **true answer** to this argument because there isn't one - it's philosophy along the lines of personal identity. Philosophy is unfalsifiable and unprovable logic, so there is no scientifically precise answer to when a fetus becomes a person.

Having said that, the mother then deserves a large degree of freedom, being the person to actually carry the fetus. Arguing over the philosophy of when a human life starts is just a distracting talking point because whether or not a fetus is a person, the mother still has to endure pregnancy. It's her burden, thus it should be a no-brainer to grant her the freedom to choose the fate of her ambiguously human offspring.

Since 1973, there have been more than 170 people completely exonerated from all Death Sentence related charges. There have been approximately 18 people executed and later found to have likely been innocent. This information has been a huge determination factor in my current opinion.

Hey, I hope this is allowed, but I wanted to clarify some things if that's okay!

First of all I want to thank all of you for your responses. 99% of you were  really patient and not mean at all, which I really appreciate.

A question I've been asked frequently is ""Have you ever been attracted to at least one?"" and my answer is an honest no.

After many of your comments, I've decided to look inside myself more. I believe 2 of you (maybe more, I'm sorry if I'm wrong!) suggested that maybe this has come from a bad upbringing with my father or other black men, and I've come to the conclusion that I think that may be the case.

While I fortunately have an excellent relationship with both of my parents, I *did* have a traumatic event involving black men. Two of them had stalked me. Now, at first I didn't want to say this could be the case. Because I'm also a CSA trafficking survivor, and the person who did that to me was white and I haven't lost my attraction to white men. And I was also raped on a separate occasion by a Hispanic man, and that hasn't changed my attraction to them, either. Both of those things are infinitely worse than being stalked, even though it doesn't invalidate how violated I felt. But maybe the stalking situation hurt me more somehow. Maybe somewhere inside myself I felt betrayed because they're the same race as me, and I grew up being taught that we're supposed to stick together and that black men are supposed to care for their women. My parents always warned me about white men. They never told me that a black man would be capable of hurting me. That's not their fault, but just something I realized and maybe that affected me as well.

I think that ultimately, even before what happened to me, I hadn't *yet* found a black guy I was personally attracted to, but I wasn't closed off to the idea that it would happen. But maybe that traumatic event affected me more than I realized and shattered the chances of that happening for whatever reason.

Anyway, I know how horrible and hypocritical this probably all sounds, but I hope everyone understands me more. I am still open to continuing the discussion!

*Also if I haven't replied to anyone, please don't worry because I will! I'll be going through all of the comments again today, awarding deltas, and responding to anyone I haven't yet. These are a LOT more comments that I'm used to and a little harder than I thought*

**END OF UPDATE**

This just popped into my head recently, but it's something that's been in the back of my mind for a while. If it matters/for context, I am a black woman and I am not attracted to black men and can't see myself ever being with one. I have a preference for white and hispanic men. It isn't something I actively chose and I didn't just wake up one day and say ""Hmm, I think I'll decide to only like white men from now on!"" 

However, I know that there's this whole thing about how it's racist to either not like someone because of their race *or* to be attracted to someone because of their race, because then it's ""fetishizing""! However, this same logic doesn't seem to apply to the LGBT community. Meaning that the general consensus is that you can't choose which gender you're attracted to. If that's the case, how is it not that you just can't choose who you're attracted to *period*?

Now, I may be coming across as an ignorant asshole here, but I truly don't really understand why this is so. If it's racist for me to not be attracted to guys of my own race (or others), why is it then not ""sexist"" if I was only attracted to the same gender? I really don't think that anyone can choose who they're attracted to, so I don't see why or how it can be construed as racist when being a racist is typically a conscious effort. I don't think any one race is superior to another. I'm not antagonistic towards people of a certain race. But I have been called racist and a race traitor several times because of my preferences."	227	551	0.83

Warren, AOC, Sanders, etc shouldn't be championing it.	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lmpmwb/cmv_canceling_student_loan_debt_is_not_a/	"Hey peeps. I'm a progressive voter who supported Ilhan Omar and Elizabeth Warren (I'm in MN). I have a masters degree and about $20K in student loan debt. However I don't understand why canceling student loan debt is a progressive policy that is being championed by the likes of Warren, Bernie, AOC, and others. Change my view that this is a policy that won't address underlying issues with student debt but it will further divide class lines.

I understand that total student loan debt (&gt;$1.5 trillion) has now surpassed total credit card debt (&lt;$1trillion) to become the second largest form of debt in America (after mortgages). I acknowledge that's a concern. This has been driven by increases in the costs of higher education, increased/eliminated caps on borrowing for students and parents, the rise in for-profit colleges, the increasing number of people attaining college and especially graduate school, and more.

However, only about 1 in 8 Americans has student loan debt and the average amount is about $32K. While I understand that some people drop out of college and get the debt without the benefit, that is not emblematic of people who have student loan debt in general...an individuals who graduate college tend to make significantly more than those who don't (\~$75K/year vs $45K/year). Additionally there are income-based repayment plans for student loans that are an option which tie your repayment to your discretionary income and forgive anything you have left after a set number of years. Why should we cancel, on average, $30K in student loan debt for citizens who make, on average $30K more per year than non-college graduates?

So, again, why is canceling student loan debt seen as a progressive policy being championed by the likes of Warren and Bernie and AOC, etc?

Someone change my view that it would be more progressive and effective strategy to:

1. Address underlying issues causing the increase in student loan debt. Simply canceling student loan debt simply resets our debt back towards zero but then it will start accumulating all over again. Congress needs to address how we got in this situation.
2. Give every American a big ol' check. If someone wants to spend their big bailout on paying off a bunch of student loan debt, that's their prerogative. And if I want to spend it paying down credit card debt first, that's my choice based on my biggest need. And if a low income family wants to use it to buy a car to have reliable transportation to a better job, that's their opportunity to get ahead.

If we could lift every American out of poverty and provide universal healthcare and check a whole lot of other boxes then I'd be all for moving down the list to eventually forgiving student loans...but I don't understand or support why it's an issue that is getting so much attention now.

Forgiving student loans will disproportionately help middle and upper class Americans while providing no benefit to our most impoverished and marginalized citizens, and it will do nothing to address the systemic issues that created the debt in the first place. Change my view."	394	290	0.8

It seems to me that if stereotypes about gender like ""boys wear shorts, play video games, and wrestle"" and ""girls wear skirts, put on makeup, and dance"" didn't exist, there wouldn't be a need for the trans movement. If we just let people like what they like, do what they want, and dress how they want, like we should, then there wouldn't be a reason for people to feel like they were born the wrong gender.

Basically, I think that if men could really wear dresses and makeup without being thought of as weird or some kind of drag queen attraction, there wouldn't be as many, or any, male to female trans, and hormonal/surgical transitions wouldn't be a thing.

Many Muhammad apologists try to say she was actually much older and the Hadiths in question can't be trusted since they aren't ""the word of Allah"".. even though many are first hand accounts of the girl herself. By following the logic that the hadiths can't be trusted  then we would have little to no knowledge of Muhammad himself and also getting rid of the hadiths turns the Quran into mound of disconnected contextless writings. The Hadith's in question :

* Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13) Sahih Bukhari 8:73:151
* 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old. Sahih Muslim 8:3311
* A’ishah said : I used to play with dolls. Sometimes the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered upon me when the girls were with me. When he came in, they went out, and when he went out, they came in."" Sunan Abu Dawud 4913 (Ahmad Hasan Ref)
* It was narrated that 'Aishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."" (Sahih) Sunan an-Nasa'i 4:26:3380
* It was narrated that 'Aishah said: ""I used to play with dolls when I was with the Messenger of Allah, and he used to bring my friends to me to play with me."" (Sahih) Sunan Ibn Majah 3:9:198
* Aisha said she was nine years old when the act of consummation took place and she had her dolls with her. Mishkat al-Masabih, Vol. 2, p 77

Many defenders also like to point to the context at the time being normal for child brides to take place. Agreed! It was! However again he is a prophet and he is the most moral of all men, there is no way to in todays day and age give him a pass and say its ok to that he only be held to the standards of the society around him at the time, He was founding an entire religion, he was a ""holy man"" so he should be rightly held to a higher standard, to which he has failed.

Now I've seen this question answered many times and seen many of the common responses, but I haven't seen people or articles adequitely respond to these kinds of points, so I'd like to know why my way of thinking is wrong, flawed.

1. Student debt will help price control universities

a. Once we forgive student loans, and have the US government pay for it, colleges will now be incentivized to jack up their prices, hoping that the US government will bail out students again. The astronomical prices of universities are forced by supply and demand, and while the situation does suck, they are interested in maximizing profit. And if they get a free 50k per student, what's stopping them from boosting their prices to 100k per student, hoping that the government forgives it and pays it to the university? The current policy propsed under Biden does not try to address this issue, and I think it will be extremely difficult to enact bills on the federal level to try to fix this. 

 2. Student debt cancellation will boost the economy

a. Forgiving debt in general will boost the economy so that people will spend. If this is the case, why can't we forgive credit card debt? The average monthly mortgage payment is 1017$, why can't we forgive that? I'm simply stating that it's impractical to forgive those kinds of debts because they will have a negative impact of price gouging like point 1, plus people naturally agree that if you borrow 30,000$ to buy a car, you should pay it back. So why is student loan forgiveness the exception?

3. Everyone who doesn't agree is a selfish asshole

a. I really don't agree with this talking point. You can't simply name-call people who have genuine concerns over this. Some people who genuinely gave up possible career paths in college because it was too expensive, or sacrificed years of their early adulthood have vices with the policy, and it's not productive to simply hurl insults at them. I'm for other government incentives such as increased minimum wage, guaranteed community college, but this is a policy that I believe is a bit too radical for my tastes. My point in bringing this up is that if you can explain why people against student loan forgiveness is morally wrong, I will try to understand. 

4. Once this is an option, people will be more open to pursuing passions. 

a. If this were the case, why would anyone try to pursue degrees in engineering, computer science, Law, or medicine. I understand that some people genuinely enjoy these career paths, but I know an overwhelming majority of people who are pursuing these majors because of the income, and that they need to get their money's worth for hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Due to supply and demand, we'd have a lot more art or film students because those majors are enjoyable, but a lot fewer scientists and engineers despite a growing demand for them, and that would undoubtedly have a negative impact on US growth."	1	104	0.51

I want to start off by saying I do not think the girl with down syndrome should be excluded from the yearbook photo for her perspective squad. If she didn't make varsity and was on the backup squad then her photo should be on the squad that her skills allowed her to participate at. Which it seems is what happened from the article. But if she couldn't do the moves required to be varsity or on any squad then they gave her a nice photo to keep for memories and published the varsity only photo. 

But the author goes on to describe his special needs son and how he was ""discriminated"" against. Like being in choir but he likes to dance and move around while the choir that practiced hard to create a show for their families has the spotlight stolen by a distraction. He says they allowed him on stage for a couple of songs but then he was told to come off stage. Which seems completely reasonable. At some point the show should be about the kids that have practiced for months and not the disabled kid dancing with a choir in the background. When are the able bodied kid's parents allowed to snap their photos for their memories if your son is not participating in line with everyone else? He even goes on to say his son is a non speaking autistic boy so he literally could not participate correctly and they still included him in a program about singing. He also states his sons dancing is a delight to all the audience members and only the teacher saw a problem with it. What a big assumption. 

He also implies disabled children should be allowed to compete in competitive sports. So how does that go? Hey we are putting in our disabled kid as defensive line can you tell everyone not to try their best so we can give him some feel good memories? Hey we are putting our disabled kid in as pitcher because he really likes throwing the ball can you not smash a homer on him? At what point is hindering 60 other people's time so that your child can be in the spotlight enough?

My daughter currently has 3 disabled children in her 8th grade classes. She says you can tell right away because they have a helper with them at all times and her classes are being constantly disrupted by the special needs kid's. She has had her hair pulled by a disabled kid. Saw two disabled kids stabbing each other with pencils to the point a resource officer had to be stationed in her math class the remainder of the year. And even has one disabled kid who soils himself and doesn't shower in 3 of her classes which heavily disrupts her ability to learn. 


I believe inclusion ends where other kids progress and hard work is being undermined. The people with disabled children seem not to care about the disruptions as long as their child gets to pretend they are normal; while my daughter has to compete in the real world where her grades and extracurriculars matter for her future. Does hurting 26 other kids future outweigh helping one disabled kid do slightly better in class? I do not believe so. 

My mom, aunt and cousin have been teaching for 20 years or more each and all of them say that teaching with 29 kids and 1 or 2 disabled kids is damn near impossible. The normal class was already challenging. Now tell kids that they have one period  to take a test while one kid screams every couple of minutes and is actively fighting his para. Tell the kids they have to get over the unrelenting smell of teenage bo and poop in their pants and just focus on taking their itbs test.

Its not ableist to exclude disruptive kids from what an entire group is doing if they cannot participate properly. Its disableist to believe that your special needs child trumps everyone else's experiences and hardwork because you think they deserve it regardless of those other children and their parents feelings."	4551	1000	0.89

That said, I have a pretty privileged background and none of these issues have impacted my life directly, so I will definitely have pretty big gaps in my understanding. I have made what I think is an honest effort to understand both sides of this debate (which seems to have been set off by a couple recent reddit/twitter posts and the Oli London video), and I feel like I'm reaching a completely different conclusion to the people close to me (and online) that I tend to agree with, so I want to challenge my thinking.

In general I am 100% fine with people being cisgender, transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid, transsexual, or whatever else as long as they are doing it in good faith.\* Not everybody thinks this way, obviously, so we have this big cultural change underway as people come to grips with gender identity.  Big cultural shifts tend to create really challenging social/cultural knock-on effects. In my mind, this question about racial identity and being transracial is one of them. I don't think there are easy answers for a lot of these questions, but I think we owe it to eachother to listen, explore, communicate, and compromise. The conversations that I've seen so far on the topic of racial identity are far from honest, with arguments like: ""Gender dysphoria is a part of psychology \[and racial dysphoria isn't\]""[0](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3daui1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (Gender dysphoria wasn't either, 50 years ago); ""Culture and heritage however is lived through communities. It can be  appropriated and abused. A white British person claiming to be  trans-Korean diminishes the experiences and burdens of actual Korean people and communities.""[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called_it/h3dc4wt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (Gender has a massive cultural component), ""Race and Ethnicity is Rooted in Ancestry… You Can’t Just Pick and Choose"" [2](https://medium.com/verve-up/transracial-is-not-the-new-transgender-why-race-and-gender-are-not-synonymous-b2c688ef0fae) (sounds a lot like the 'gender is rooted in biology' argument to me) and ""We also think that, as a result of this asymmetry, transgender identities deserve social uptake and so-called “transracial”  identifications as Black almost always do not. (We leave space for  unique circumstances in which someone who has deeply invested in a Black community and been forthcoming about their racial history is nevertheless accepted within that community as Black.)""[3](http://bostonreview.net/race-philosophy-religion-gender-sexuality/robin-dembroff-dee-payton-why-we-shouldnt-compare)[4](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp) (there's obviously massive differences, but this argument isn't fundamentally different to arguing that trans women aren't women because they haven't grown up having periods, experiencing sexism, etc).

Setting aside (for now) the existing use of 'transracial' used in the context of adopted children raised outside of their biological parents' ethnic/racial cultures, I think that being transracial is similar in a lot of ways to being transgender or transexual, and I don't see how that de-legitimizes either of those things. I think there's a lot of fear on the left that this comparison makes the transgender/transsexual struggle look somehow ridiculous or absurd by association [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/o9svvj/called\_it/) and I guess I can see why people might think that, but it feels like either an unhelpful gut reaction, or (being a bit pessimistic) an overly political/strategic reaction which looks a lot like [throwing the ladder down](https://thomasnastcartoons.com/2015/01/06/throwing-down-the-ladder-by-which-they-rose-23-july-1870/). Every new cultural idea is uncomfortable at first, but we don't know if it has any merit if we don't explore it in good faith. I think it's also a missed opportunity to better understand trans/identity in general

As for the other (original) definition of transracial -- adopted children raised outside their biological parents' culture/race -- I think it's a really interesting bridge between transsexual identity politics and transracial (the other/new definition) identity politics, because there are hundreds of thousands of cases of transracial adoption, and I'm sure we could learn a lot about culture and identity if we asked them about it.  I expect some of these children experience very real, very complicated dysphoria \[citation needed, obviously\].

I don't know if the likes of Rachel Dolezal, Oli London, Ja Du, Ekundayo, etc are charlatans or people in genuine turmoil deserving of, if not our sympathy, at least our patience. What I do know is that this kind of tectonic cultural shift has happened enough times throughout history that I think I want to hedge my bets and at least be kind.

Edit: I'm adding this to clarify my title/view because I think there's some ambiguity and this more succinctly captures the view I want challenged (thanks /u/Rufus_Reddit)

&gt; It seems like what you're looking for is some kind of salient difference
that justifies having one attitude about trans-gender and another
attitude about trans-racial identity. In other words, you're looking
for something that somehow makes it ""right"" to push for transgender
rights and recognition, but that isn't readily paralleled when when we
look at trans-racial issues instead.

Edit 2: I've stopped being able to keep up with speed of the discussion, but I'm doing my best. I've saved threads that I want to respond to and will try to get to all of them eventually. Thanks everyone for investing so much time trying to help me learn.

Edit 3: I only mentioned specific transracial people because they've been driving the conversation by being very public. I have to assume that if there are transracial people out there (and I believe there are) they just want to lead happy (and most likely private) lives free from ridicule.


\*Quick aside:  I don't say ""as long as it isn't hurting anyone"" because I've observed that change hurts, and a lot of people are experiencing real pain caused by this big cultural shift in favor of trans rights and that's unavoidable. However, I think there will always be charlatans out there who take advantage of the opportunity that any big disruption creates, so that's why I say 'in good faith'. You can pick your example of this, from people 'playing the race card' to children setting their screen names to 'Connecting...' to get out of zoom/skype classes during a pandemic.

I am also not arguing that capitalism is the best /worst economic system out there. 

What I am arguing is that a core aspect of capitalism makes it less effective at producing quality goods and services than an economic system without this aspect.

The reason why I believe this is due to a quirk in human nature. Humans have both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. It has also been shown that when someone is intrinsically motivated to accomplish something giving them extrinsic motivation can have negative impacts on their performance ([Source 1](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/teachereducationx92x1/chapter/incentive-theory-of-motivation-and-intrinsic-vs-extrinsic-motivation/), [Source 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect)). This is not always the case though because extrinsic motivation can make people accomplish repetitive and non-creative tasks faster ([Source 3](https://fs.blog/2016/08/daniel-pink-two-types-of-motivation/)). 

Since a core aspect of capitalism is that we give someone a stand-in for the value ( money ) they contributed to society (some would argue that we give even less) that then causes that person to become more functionally fixed and less creative which, I am willing to argue, reduces the quality of the goods and services that we create. This is ok for some jobs but I am also willing to argue that a majority of the jobs that go into developing new goods and services should require creativity and adaptability.

EDIT: 
Change my mind partially, Abortion in the first trimester is properly fine if necessary considering the fetus doesn’t feel pain and is mostly not human. Obviously I still recommend not getting abortion and explore other options but it’s just my advise and up to the person and I obviously want to reduce the numbers like anyone else. I’m going to reduce my reply’s and start focusing on other stuff.

The post:

Let’s start from where I am coming from. I grew up religious but don’t believe it anymore. I disagree with conditioning a person from a young age to believe a certain way as well as the homophobia. I don’t believe in overall wrong/right but reasoning with society to a overall good. 

I still find abortion to be a wrong as I would find murder to be wrong. 

I care more about the abortion issue then the euthanasia issue because it isn’t old people possibly wanting to be killed/suicide but innocent people.

In my country of New Zealand ~20% of baby are aborted. 

I think the Hyde law is a reasonable law. I think abortion should be allow in cases of rape/incest or cause the woman complications.

A lot of abortions are related to the baby possibly having mental issues or the parents not being able to look after the child.

To shows the problems of abortion, you could just look at when it goes wrong. Serial killer Dr Gosnell who crimes are so horrible, I wouldn’t even look up unless you really want to know. Is just the tip of the iceberg for allowing abortion in a society. Do we really want to have a society where this is promoted.

I do believe people should be allow to do what they want, the problem here is that it’s another person inside of them and they are effecting there rights to life.

If I wanted to murder someone, society would say do what you want but don’t effect anyone else. So I wouldn’t be allowed, it’s the same for abortion.

I’ll try my best to change my mind, my opinion on this is pretty set in stone but it would be interesting to here other peoples opinion on it."	0	126	0.35

They want to infringe on my freedoms, and I am the Hero who will stand up for what's right."" That ""standing by the river of truth and saying 'no, you move'"" thing is a massive part of conservative identity. This narrative of tyrants and heroic rebels is at their heart.

The vaccine mandate played right into that narrative: that fit perfectly with their story of tyrants and rebels. People who do take the vaccine do it reluctantly, feeling forced and threatened with losing their jobs, while those few still refusing are held up as heroes. 

And it didn't even work, at least so far - the US is behind Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and many more. As it turns out, feeding right into people's narratives of victimhood is...not a great plan.

""But we need to get people vaccinated! How else will you do it except forcing them!""

Well the French have a solution: defuse the narrative.

See, the French also have a MASSIVE antivaxx movement. Distrust of governments and Big Pharma is rampant with giant chunks of the population believing in homeopathy and distrusting vaccines, both on the right and the left. A vaccine mandate would have led to country-wide demonstrations. 

Instead, the government said ""you don't HAVE to get a vaccine. But if you want to travel, go to cinemas, restaurants, etc, you need either a negative test, or a vaccine"".

Why was that brilliant? Because it defused the narrative. A relative of mine is an massive conspiracy theorist - antivaxx, climate skeptic, the works. But they wanted to go to concerts, and couldn't be bothered to do the tests every time, so...they got jabbed. 

See how that defuses their whole thing? No one forced them, they just had to admit that they liked their comfort and convenience more than their professed principles. And now France, the home of antivaxx nutjobs, has a higher vaccination rate than even the UK and Germany!

That's how you get antivaxxers to drop their pretenses, you don't play into their story, you sidestep it. And it demonstrably works. Yes, I know the majority of people approve of the mandate, but that's very much not the point - you can keep all those people on board and get more people vaccinated without giving your opponents ammunition, with cleverer more subtle governance tools. Instead of going with the clever subtle solution they went in with the hammer, and the blowback is going to hurt."	2968	2092	0.83

While many people call the USSR/China to be ""not socialism"", IMO the founding principles and ideas that drove the Russian Revolution and the Cultural Revolution are generally socialist, and a large swath of people generally believed and popularly supported in the ideals -- at least initially.

My argument is that ""hatred of the rich"" is a unifying element of nearly all socialist movements, and many socialist movements accrue critical mass most easily by fanning the population's hatred of the rich. Even though not everyone in a socialist movement may agree on exactly on how to implement a socialist state after the revolution, everyone agrees that the downfall of the rich must happen *now*.

And that's precisely what happened in the communist revolutions.

The rich were evicted from power / persecuted / jailed, but the movements largely fall apart due to a lack of universal consensus on how to implement a socialist state. Initial popular support crumbles after the 'enemies' are removed, and resentment rises against the controlling group because most people don't get exactly the kind of socialism that they wanted. The revolution deviates from the original vision due to practical reasons and it becomes a perversion of what most people would consider ""socialism"" in its purist form.

I genuinely think this is probably what would happen to most major socialists movements, particularly those that are driven by hatred of the rich. Even if a movement claims that it does not hate the rich, this notion sort of occurs incidentally by the nature of socialism itself (whether by the rhetoric used or other features of campaigning for socialism), and it's the most salient and popular feature of the ideology.

I think if socialism remotely has a chance to work, I think it should be primarily motivated by a communal desire and widespread cultural values to help the poor. Rather than investing energy into 1% protests (which IMO is strictly all about hating the rich; everyone including people at the 51% percentile should be actively helping the poor), we should proactively be pooling resources into community chests and and community organizations to help the least fortunate members of their own communities. We should be encouraging people regardless of their level of income (whether you are at the 30th percentile or the 75th percentile) to volunteer and contribute to helping the lowest percentile."	526	430	0.75

Since their parents make the vast majority of nurturing decisions for them (like what to eat and what to drink) their medical issues are very unlikely to be their fault.

I can't seem to understand why people feel the need to be called they/them for instance. Or identifying yourself as ""another gender"" than male or female.

I fully understand and respect if someone wants to change their gender from the one they're born as. So I can understand why a man would want to be referred to as a woman or vice-versa. In that case there's a mismatch between your ""brain's sex"" and your genitalia (from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong). So for instance your brain is biologically female, but you have a penis. As such it makes sense to me why someone would want to be recognized by the ""sex of their brain"" rather than the genitalia they have.

But if someone doesn't know whether or not they identify as male or female, or feel like they're a little bit of both, why not just refer to yourself as whichever sex you have?

I understand that there's an idea of what a man/woman should be in society and you might not want to categorize into one of those. But I (and it seems like most people today) think you shouldn't have to fit into those norms to be considered a man or a woman, your biological sex or sexual identity is what matters.

I mean, wanting to wear a skirt as a man doesn't mean you can't call yourself male. Likewise, being a tomboyish woman doesn't mean you can't call yourself female. If there's no mismatch between your brain and sex, why feel the need to be addressed as something other than your sex?"	519	399	0.8

However when it comes to monuments and symbolism I believe they should be preserved 

First off many people claim these statues were built to intimidate black people with the fact that most statues were not built until the 1900s. However I believe this is nonsense when you think of it logically. First off traditionally there were very few monuments built immediately after a person’s death. The Washington monument started construction 50 years after his death, the Jefferson monument 100 years after, even the Lincoln memorial was not built until 1914 50 years after his death, and around the time when most confederate statues went up. Makes you wonder why there are not charts showing union monuments going up

So the fact it took 50 years for statues for confederates to come up is nothing unusual. It also makes sense economically as it took 30 years for the south to recover after the war, and even the rest of the country

On top of that if the south wanted to intimidate black people why not build statues of the KKK and slaves being whipped? Black schools were horribly underfunded so how would most african americans know about generals and politicians like Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis? This also contradicts the lost cause narrative that southern states rewrote history books to whitewash the confederacy meaning these symbols are meant to intimidate black people while denying slavery or claiming slavery was not that bad? Was the south a blatantly racist society promoting white supremacy or a society denying its racism?

As for the flag itself first off the rectangular “confederate” flag was used in the civil war despite what many people say. It was originally designed by William P. Miles though it had just 7 stars instead of 13 and it was rectangular but rejected from being the national flag however it would be used by several battalions and a square version most famously used by Robert Lee. And as for its use by the KKK it wasn’t until after WWII when they appropriated it due to the association of the STATES RIGHTS PARTY or the Dixiecrats. However i don’t think that makes it a hate symbol nor does it mean anyone who uses it is a racist 

The fact is this. The statues were built to commemorate the civil war and recognize those who died during the war. There simply is no good reason to remove these statues or symbols. If someone personally thinks it’s hateful then that’s their problem. And if we are getting rid of every flag associated with the confederacy [then france better change their flag soon](https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/bonham/bonham--flags_of_louisiana_files/800px-Flag_of_Louisiana_(January_1861).svg.png)"	0	126	0.36

I totally get venting about a date gone wrong, or posting about not meeting someone who fits their standards, but how are people expecting to find a relationship with such a consistent negative mindset? 

Like many who post there, I also personally aim for having a partner that is socioeconomically equal to or higher than me, I work hard, have a good education, and can hold my own, I need a partner who can do the same for themselves. Doesn’t matter if they work construction or if they’re a professional streamer or what have you, I just aim for people who are doing /something/. The ridiculous standards on FDS are a little wack.

The downfall of the sub is they’re consistently crapping on dudes who they deem ‘below them’ for myriad reasons that don’t make much sense. If it’s not a good fit, move on, that’s someone else’s future spouse, so don’t stress about it. They tout themselves as having high standards, when in reality many posters just want someone to be ‘chivalrous’ and pay their way.

\-Where is the illegalization or excessive taxation of empty sugar foods and beverages?

\-Where is the subsidization of healthy foods?  
\-Where is the social stigma around junk foods?

If you are for shaming unvaccinated individuals, while 4.5 times as many people die annually, year after year, from reducible causes that go unaddressed, then I ask you to turn to your loved ones who suffer from heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and any other ailment correlated to high sugar diets, artificial / processed food products, and unhealthy lifestyles. I ask you to consider shaming them for not living healthier lives and passing on better habits to the next generation (affecting others besides themselves). I ask you to consider shaming them for tying up our medical resources - especially during this pandemic when we could have used more beds for Covid patients.

I, for one, do not support shaming anyone for their decisions. I don't support forcing them to do what they don't want in order to ""unburden resources"". And let the above facts demonstrate that we never once care to ""protect the community"" until politicians with an agenda socially engineer us to do otherwise.

The rise of urbanization, where people are moving out of rural areas and into urban areas/cities, has pretty much been a continual trend since the dawn of civilization. As the US population growth slows and there’s less population growth to go around, the cities are still growing while the rural areas are losing their populations. 

https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-population-change-by-county-2010-2018/

We saw the implications of this in the 2020 presidential election, where Georgia and Arizona voted for Biden over Trump. They had been slowly veering left for decades, but the rapid growth of Phoenix and Atlanta finally overpowered the collective voting power of the rural areas this last election. Most cities in the world vote heavily liberal (I don’t know exactly why, maybe that’s a minor hole in my argument) but again, don’t see why this would turn around and if those are the areas with population growth, then you can see how the balance of power between cities and rural areas will increasingly favor Democrats in other states like Texas going forward. 

The second trend is demographic diversification. The largest voting block for republicans (older whites) is dying out, their descendants skew liberal, and even if they weren’t, their share of the US electorate is shrinking as the minority population rises (particularly Hispanics). This trend is further enforced by low fertility rates within the US, while immigration (of which the majority is non-white) is increasingly relied upon for continued population growth. Minority voting blocks have voted pretty consistently liberal in US elections, most notably in California, where the rising Hispanic population turned it from a tilt-red state to a solidly blue one. Demographic shifts have likewise turned other former swing states blue, such as Colorado and Virginia. I am aware that there are some exceptions to this (notably Florida’a Cuban population voting conservative) but I’d counter that even within that edge case the younger Cubans appear to be more liberal as well. Virtually every single minority group votes liberal outside of the aforementioned edge case voted liberal. 

I see no reason why these trends will not continue, and so long as they do, it seems like the republicans are destined to eventually lose Texas as they did California, at which point they will become unviable to win presidencies. Democrats can use this political leverage to increase voting rights and immigration, further increasing their likelihood to win future elections. They will simply cease to have political relevance unless they make major policy changes and basically undergo a realignment."	0	112	0.18

That being the case,  a lot of saliva and time and effort are spent on trying to define what they ACTUALLY mean, but that discussion seems to be not of a philosophical/inquisitive nature, but more often than not, serve a function to define who's the ingroup and who's the out group. 

Those kinds of very common discussions seem to both polarize debate (edited out ""discussion"" just to not repeat myself) and be a fruit of polarization, and a polarization that doesn't lead to actual societal or political change. 

We're not discussing solutions when we're discussing who are the actual bona fide leftists. While we do that, the world burns.

Gender is not fluid in my opinion, I do support the transgender community and LGBTQ as a whole (I am bi) but I don’t know why one needs to be called they/them and gets triggered when someone makes a mistake. If you do identify as non-binary, why do you feel the need to be called they/them? genuinely curious. Don’t you get frustrated when someone makes a mistake? Where are some people so forceful? Those with a strong “stance” are not trying to understand other’s thoughts and perspective because our own selfishness as humans want to be a “strong individual” and this makes us only limited to what we want see/hear. We are restricting ourselves to open about whatever topics so we lose the numbers of “communities” we can be in. It’s almost like we have selective mutism, only hearing,seeing what we want to. 

I guess we are divided as a nation to extreme political ideals, or philosophy. 

Which results to in this “modern psychology” the diagnosis that helps then find a community, no matter what gender, political ideals. They want labels because they want to feel connected and these labels will help them feel more untied. We want to feel empathy for them and also except them to for us which further leads to a “connection” created. Don’t people always tell you in this psychiatry “you are not alone”? Yet they expect us to be individuals. I think this makes us so subjective that we can’t see the objective view and understand other perspectives. After all, what humans want is connections, empathy and love in my opinion. Mental health diagnosis can help one heal to understand themselves better through symptoms but I don’t think medication helps and therapy only helps which a suited therapist (which is very hard to find)

EDIT
extra thoughts from my dear childhood friend 

“What you’ve said is spot on, the lack of genuine connections is the most pressing social issue that our generation faces. Access to the internet and social media allows a paradox to form where we are seemingly the most connected generation yet the most lonely generation. 

Identity politics is a plague imo, because people will flock to find as many identities and hide behind them (intersectionality). People will showcase their external identity rather than showcasing their character. “

EDIT
point of this post 
My point is not to minimize people’s need to get diagnosis but rather why some people would want to seek a community through diagnosis

EDIT 
Regarding the non-binary issue, my stance is non-binary rights are not trans rights. If you want to CMV, please use logic rather than emotion.

EDIT
I am going to bed, also please stop making assumption and CMV on what I actually said. Stop assuming I “implied” something what is is not something I said. It is a form of gaslighting. Also, comparing gender and sexuality is not the same. Medication can work for some, but rather finding the therapist for you should be promoted. Focus on the root for the problem and trauma is my opinion.

EDIT 
I am beginning to understand the perspectives of non-binary people more in a spiritual view. After all, spirituality can not really be explained with logics. If you know something is out there? You know. However, not many can grasp the concept of spiritual awakening and I am still not in favor of the pronouns they/them which comes from my own bias of limited experience with non-binary people but I am beginning to accept their community more. Maybe in the future I will be open for they/them pronouns but honestly the comments really forced me to believe more strongly on why I am against in. However, I think moving to a more progressive place like California which  I plan to do to continue my studies will change my perspective rather than staying in a conservative country as Korea. To non-binary people, I apologize for my lack of understanding towards you guys but I am learning and even though my stance won’t change this quickly, I will learn and I hope I can hopefully learn to respect your pronouns. I am only human after all, I am not perfect and can not please everyone. Oh my god I want to sleep 3:22AM rn. Thank you for this opportunity. I plan on taking gender studies class to understand you guys more. I would like to stop the non-binary discussions and move on to how I think diagnosis can build a sense of acceptance and community. Even if you try to CMV on this, I don’t think it can be achieve right now with my limited experiences with actual non-binary people. I will not be replying to non-binary comments anymore.

Further EDIT:
 I was tired, I tried to fight people with logic rather than emotions to check my own bias but I think those who identify as non-binary felt triggered. My whole goal is to help people reach their spiritual awakening but also this is hasty cuz spirituality is hard to understand with logical reasoning. Actually it’s mostly all fallacies but it makes sense to such a “logical”person like myself. On the other hand I am extremely a hypersensitivity person so interesting…"	30	178	0.57

**The cornerstone of conflict (primarily in the scope of things we would debate with ""words rather than swords, but might prevent a lot of sword fighting anyways"") in our society is that we lack the ability to communicate effectively (quick, all encompassing, and devoid of differing interpretations) since we are all silos of cognition and experience, even when members of groups.** A parable that strongly reflects my view would be the Blind Men and the Elephant. Without the ability to communicate more effectively, we have to resort to swords more than words to arrive at conflict resolution.

Why I want my view changed: I want a better world. I see many debates over ""controversies"" as unproductive and psychologically harmful to multiple sides of the debate. If we have the ability to create problems, I would like to think we could solve them too. Part of this is that people modify the definitions of words to suit their purpose (this is a universal thing, not a one side of the debate or the other thing). Another part of this is the inability to conceptualize an experience they are lacking. Enough of the right kind of communication should be able to provide the necessary conceptualization and integrated experience for the receiver. I would like to say that I readily conceptualize the multiple angles to most debates and appreciate the experience and see roads forward and that I also have experiences that can be difficult to communicate to others and get them to appreciate in the way that I do.

Assumptions and/or Assertions (none of which I have tested, all of which is informed by ingesting information and attempting to simulate it in my mind, and reside in the realm of my opinion and worldview) in unfortunately no particular order:

1. Every human has a wholly unique inner life. This inner life is informed by by predisposition, development, environment, experience, and education. Communication to this inner life is an imperfect process as we learn relations between objects, phenomena, and ""vocabulary"" in reality or the shared space of an outer life. Reality ""portals"" of communication include all of your senses and the appropriate corresponding experience to that sense.
2. You build ""shortcuts"" to interface with reality as best as you can.
3. We in general have an ability to simulate portions of reality in our minds (a quick and dirty one would be the fact that we dream) and how that might relate back to our own experience. For example, I hurt myself and grimaced my face in pain. I saw someone grimace their face, so they must be in pain. This is a form of non-verbal communication that we would refer to as empathy.
4. Other important facets of communication may include, but is not limited to, intangible concepts like respect, trust, attention, creativity, sense of humor, etc.
5. Communication means the sending and receiving of a signal. If the signal is not received, communication did not occur.
6. Lines of communication can be damaged or absent and are demonstrative of failure to communicate abstract concepts when seemingly simple concepts may be difficult with a specific avenue (a difficult but seemingly simple concept to explain would be color, especially to someone who has never seen it, or to attempt to explain and evoke in the mind a color that does not ""exist to us"")
7. Established vocabulary does not immediately queue up the same image for every individual even within the same language or cultural group. For example, in the United States, if say ""Think about (A)pple,"" how many iterations of, extrapolations from, and in what order would you visualize different ""definitions"" of (A)pple? Examples might include: Red Delicious Apple, A Golden Delicious Apple, a large technology corporation, a fruit from a religious story about a woman in a garden, ""A is for Apple,"" ""Apples to Apples,"" that would be a good Wordle Word, etc. so on and so forth. This may be an avenue to attempt a ""test.""
8. The described ""Apple"" phenomenon happens to a variable extent with all words.
9. We are constantly bombarded with communicative signals that may provoke different neurological response, such as ""freezing"" a certain ""range of definitions"" for a given word.
10. Communicating using a ""different meaning"" than held in the state from #9 may be considered a form of neurological assault
11. New definitions of words are best acquired through experience and/or satisfaction of mental  evidence requirements
12. Definition may be interpreted as the belief in what something is
13. Humans are limited in their ability to disseminate information from their minds (as a metaphor, the hands and mouth are a funnel against the very large tank of the mind and information is the water attempting to flow through the funnel).
14. Technology to date does not allow for the 100% conversion of ""thought"" to a digestible format
15. This notion extends to artistic execution and consumption of art (Two people may take away a different message from the same piece of art, even if they are genetic twins raised in the same household)
16. If we could ""relay"" our full mindset (intent, emotions, feelings, sensations, mental imagery, evocations (how I'm expressing how one's mind reacts upon hearing a word or description), and corporealizations (how I'm expressing how mentally held concepts are communicated) to another it would be far easier for them to ""co-adopt our viewpoint"" and integrate it into their mindset and beliefs to remove barriers of communication and reach nuanced conclusions
17. Most spontaneous ""abstract in concept"" communication occurs ""on the fly"" in words.
18. I consider conflict and competition to be separate if not parallel components of the human condition

Original Post:

As someone who enjoys debate or challenging my beliefs and worldviews, I feel I see a universal source of conflict is semantics (word choice, ""commonly accepted"" descriptive short cuts, too little detail, too much detail, chosen definitions, agenda based definitions, self-manifested definitions, etc.) and that we are fundamentally ill suited to productively resolve conflict due to our inability to communicate effectively and/or sadly even agree what a word means. Basically the parable of the ""Blind Men and the Elephant"" applies to quite literally everything we as ""conscious people"" experience. As a disclaimer: my entire objective is to dissect focuses and definitions, and if something is construed as offensive or taking a side on a controversial issue is not the intent or purpose of this view.

A simple example that I'll end up convoluting excessively: ""A glass filled halfway with water."" It's easy to visualize on your kitchen counter or desk (there may even be one there).

Now describe it to someone else: Is the glass half full or half empty? Is it half full of air or is it half empty of water? Is the glass full of air and water? Is the glass empty of oil? Is the glass filled to it's halfway point in terms of volume or in terms of distance from its base or its top? What if the water in the glass is it actually 99.9% H2O, .01% Sodium, Chloride, Fluoride and Calcium Ions, .09% Bacteria and the air is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% Carbon Dioxide, etc. and is that by molecules or volumetric occupation? Is the glass clear or opaque? Is it colorful? Does it have a handle? Is it short and stout or tall and thin? Is it a functional cylinder or a tornado glass? How about a full bait and switch since this has all been relayed through text: What if the ""glass filled halfway with water"" is actually a fishbowl with a little goldfish swimming about over his little blue rocks and plastic treasure chest?

Now which description of ""A glass filled halfway with water"" is the truth and which statement is a lie and where is the cutoff or accommodation for intent and/or background? Everything said is at very least ""mostly"" true, but it may not be all encompassing, or it might not focus on what was important or the more favored description, or it might depend on the person describing it. Certainly a glassblower and a marine biologist might begin at different points in their emphasis. The chemist might begin elsewhere. Or they might start at the same point because of their culture, but what if they are part of different cultures/upbringings/politics? A child might emphasize how empty the ""glass bowl"" is of other fish for their goldfish to be friends with and the parent might admonish the child for keeping the water level too low for the goldfish to thrive. To what end is it reasonable to agree or disagree on each observers' unique experience?

Even a picture or video could invite endless criticism and misinterpretation: What kind of liquid is it? Is it CGI? Is it an artistic but physical recreation (robot fish and refraction of a second solid within the glass to give the impression of liquid).

Take transgenderism (this is not an agenda post on this issue itself, just a focus on linguistic choices and limitations and conveyance of viewpoints):

We as a society literally argue about what linguistic shortcut we use to refer to someone in the third person. Obviously everyone in the debate, for or against, a member of the community or not, is a member of the human condition. Each debate seemingly boils down to: what is gender? Is it ""biological sex?"" Is it a reference to a cultural presentation of Femininity vs. Masculinity? Is it our inherent level of empathy? Hair length? Use of makeup? Hormone levels? Physical vs. social aggressiveness? Is it whether our torso is more ""Hourglass"" or ""Dorito?""  Is it based on the cut and/or color of clothes we wear? Is it based on what we like to do, feel the need to do, or others expect us to do? Does it have anything to do with the general appearance of breasts under clothing or a bulge in the crotch region of pants. Does it relate to who we would be attracted to or who we would desire to be attracted to us? Where does each participant in the disagreement's definition begin and end?

Surely if the emotions, feelings, sensations, mental imagery, evocations (how I'm expressing how one's mind reacts upon hearing a word or description), and corporealizations (how I'm expressing how mentally held concepts are communicated) related to the debate could be relayed between the conflicting parties, understanding, respect, and trust could and would be readily reached.  Outside of this described ""telepathic empathy,"" how do we effectively convey meaning as words, art, policy, and violence seemingly have not ""settled the matter"" for everyone on hotly debated topics.

I realize a simple explanation could be the willful manipulation by invested entities to alter word definitions to their purpose, but I feel that may be an exacerbation of the issue (since it is an easily attackable vulnerability of human to human communication), rather than its origin.

A burdensome counter (takes time and resources and may no longer be referable to as ""communication"") to ineffective communication would be a combination of the scientific method (constantly testing assumptions) and replication of experiences (so that a belief may become tangibly recreated in a different mind, which may be an innate trait of highly empathetic individuals, which most people are not, and may lead to the wrong conclusions and expanding the divide).

As a curiosity as to how other species are able to communicate, things like ""sonar imaging"" [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3346588/What-dolphins-REALLY-Stunning-image-shows-diver-eyes-mammal-reveals-animals-send-images-water-other.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3346588/What-dolphins-REALLY-Stunning-image-shows-diver-eyes-mammal-reveals-animals-send-images-water-other.html) and something as mundane as pheromones (which I realize people have, it's just not something that seems very powerful for us) seem more effective then words if short of ""telepathic empathy.""

Edit 1: My apologies, but I think I needed to establish more context, as the ""conflict"" I'm primarily referring to is the kind of conflict you would read on this very /subreddit as an example or people would organize politically around.

I wholesale agree that resources are foundational source of conflict, but would propose that much of conflict today around resources are about managing and distributing currently abundant resources along lines that could be ""softened, changed, or erased"" if we could ""beam the contents of our mind"" into another's ""mind.""

Edit 2:

Really should of said ""A Major Cornerstone..."" to save me a lot of headache, lol xP

Though mentioned, I wish to emphasize: certain aspects of the human condition I would consider a fundamental part of how we communicate. A major aspect would be ""Empathy."" Empathy serves as a vehicle for us to interpret communicative signals from others that allow us to make assumptions based on our experiences about those signals and perhaps attempt to act on them in a ""positive manner."" Lack of empathy is a communications failure on this avenue (defining lack of empathy as inability to recognize signals or if recognized, don't respond to them appropriately).

Avenues of communication that fail quickly could be explaining empathetic recognition to those on the autistic spectrum or explaining appropriate empathetic responses to a sociopath.

Another difficult line of expression would be explaining color to a blind person or imaging a color that does not exist.

This would be emblematic of difficulty discussing experienced concepts from person to person."	11	72	0.69

Both right and left can be fascist because both can subjugate the individual to group values (and often do).	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t2ru6g/cmv_definition_of_fascism_is_being_used/	"fascism: [a political philosophy, that exalts \[the group\] above the individual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism)

socialism: [collective or governmental ownership](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism)

capitalism: [system characterized by private ... ownership](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism)

Fascism is on a spectrum. Direct democracy based on libertarian values is the least fascist because it  exalts nothing over the individual. You can't have representative democracy without some fascism. And if you go full-blown ethnostate \[right wing\] or ecostate \[left wing\] you are at the same place on the fascism scale. Complete subjugation of the individual to group values.

It is interesting to contrast the Websters definition with the wikipedia definition of fascism. Webster's viewpoint is over centuries and is more objective, while wikipedia's is over a MUCH shorter period and shows just the prevailing zeitgeist understanding.

The left no longer think they are on the fascist spectrum because they have turned the word into a pejorative.

Edit: Better definition of fascism by Griffith. Thanks iwfan53. ""\[F\]ascism is best defined as a  revolutionary form of nationalism, one that sets out to be a political,  social and ethical revolution, welding the ‘people’ into a dynamic  national community under new elites infused with heroic values. The core  myth that inspires this project is that only a populist, trans-class  movement of purifying, cathartic national rebirth (palingenesis) can  stem the tide of decadence"" This definition emphasizes the WELDING/CONCENTRATING-OF-POWER of people together, without right or left interpretation, except the traditionalist aspect which is not necessary in my interpretation.

edit: My evolving current working definition is ""fascism is the quasi-religious concentration of power by adherents in one leader, which may have traditionalist foundations and may have authoritarian outcomes."" The defining aspect is the leadership not the leaders marketing. **The reason phds have such a hard time defining it, is because the political power is so concentrated the leaders whims become war banners, and fleeting thoughts become construction projects. They expect consistency where there is none.** Authoritarian leadership is on a sliding scale depending on the zeal of the followers with fascism being the maximal case. The zeal acts as a power and stability multiplier.

I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT FASCISM BEING LEFT AND RIGHT EQUALLY:

Thanks St33lbutcher. ""The Capitalist class will always align themselves with the fascists because they can keep their property if the fascists take power, but they can't if the socialists do."" I would add, they MIGHT keep their property with a fascist leader.

Thanks iwfan53 for helping me realize that the left ideal is leaderless, so not compatible with fascism. However the implementation of the left still could be fascist if there is leader worship and the leader doesn't step down. Also thanks for helping me refine my working definition of fascism distinguishing it from just authoritarianism.

I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT FASCISM BEING INCORRECTLY USED (sort of):

Thanks CrimsonHartless for giving examples of other leader worship, and context of false labeling eg Tankies (just because someone says they are a thing doesn't make it so). I see better why fascism is currently being used with a heavy emphasis on historical context.

Thanks I\_am\_the\_night you helped me see that the current definitions are still helpful (but overemphasized) beyond the first part of the definition I posted.

DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND ON:

The left and the right are vulnerable to cults of leadership, violation of human dignity and autonomy and need to take steps to reduce hyperbole in regards to name calling. The new civil war doesn't need to happen. Even the worst person in the world deserves respect if they don't violate human dignity or autonomy.

WHAT I LEARNED:

Fascism and how it has been implemented are two different things, and fascism is unique in the level of willing concentration of power in a single individual which borders on the religious and **can be thought of as voluntary monarchy for the ingroup**. Thanks to CutieHeartgoddess for helping me appreciate the importance of balancing a definition from both critics and supporters. The supporters may be wrong but critics may be more objective.

Thanks to [ImaginaryInsect1275](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t2ru6g/cmv_definition_of_fascism_is_being_used/hyoq433/) for showing the **utter mess defining fascism is**, and helping me realize that **fascism is not a new thing it is a very old thing** with updated reasons to join the ingroup. Also thanks to memelord2022 for showing the fickle nature of fascist propaganda/marketing. Also thanks to iwfan53 for helping me see the important of the current syncretic view of fascism which helps outline the existence of idiosyncratic philosophies, which are not remarkable in and of themselves. 

In regards to the left / right spectrum, the [Nolan Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart) is quite helpful. But according to my view, **fascism could be anywhere on the chart because once you choose your fascist leader, he takes you  where he wants to go, not where he told you he would go. This explains why fascism is so idiosyncratic and hard to define.**

Thanks to LucidMetal for suggesting to read Umberto Eco's essay on fascism, and emphasizing its importance. Unfortunately it was problematic. 8/14 of his points can be summarized as [""people need stories/lies,  people need to be kept under control, and you always need an enemy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/t2ru6g/comment/hyxbxo9/) which is not insightful/unique and only reinforced my view that the leader worship aspect (6/14) is way more important to understanding fascism than any of the other ideas surrounding it.

**The fascist leads the out-group by fear, and the in-group by love.** The transition between out-group to in-group would necessarily involve humiliation and subjugation. With late night speeches, Stockholm syndrome, mass entrainment, and public acts of submission as tools to inspire trust from leader to in-group and love from in-group to leader.

\--- This whole post aside, I don't think anything keeps the left from having hierarchies and out-groups. They have disgust reflex that can be manipulated. Much of their egalitarian vision is just in-group marketing. Politicians will say anything, egalitarian or not, to gain power"	1684	703	0.77

When debating with someone, you are trying to convince them that your point of view is correct. This requires a lot of understanding on both sides. When I see people screaming ""my body, my choice"" I despair at the self-rightousness and lack of empathy for the other side. That's not to say that this doesn't happen in both directions.

For most people using this argument, they do not see the fetus as a baby and therefore attribute no human rights to it. But the people that they're arguing against DO see the fetus as a human. My sister is religious, she sees every human life as a gift from God in his own image. Try to imagine how precious a thing that is to someone who genuinely believes it. It seems so strange to me to be yelling at someone that it's your body, so it's fine to kill a baby. I know that isn't how you or I see it, but that's what it looks like from a pro-life perspective. It's the kind of argument that brutal slave owners would use to justify beating their slaves given that they own them. So this argument is not going to convince anyone for your case, when what you really disagree on is the moral value of the fetus.

Can a conjoined twin kill its twin with the defence ""it's my body, my choice""? Of course not, because the human right to ""do what you want with your property"" is superseded by the human right to live.

I don't actually think that there's much chance of convincing someone of the opposite opinion to yours with regards to abortion. I'm just a bit sick of the villification that I see all over reddit of people with opposing views without any attempt to see the problem from their angle.

Unfortunately, of the 675+ comments this post received, the reasonable people made about 5 of them. The majority of people who I interacted with all mentioned that they had low self esteem, low confidence, and faced bullying in there lives. They appear to be using the NB identity to hide from their insecurities and blame them on society. They were unable to define their identity and frequently contradicted themselves and each other. Their arguments were disjointed, and generally focused on twisting the words from my arguments while avoiding the actual questions. How can you expect people to believe and to conform to your identity when it immediately crumbles under any criticism or skepticism? Your identity is not immediately valid because you claim it to be, and you are an asshole if you expect people, especially strangers to just trust you without explanation. Im sorry to the agender people and emo kids out there, you’re much more valid than most of the people who tried to argue with me today.

So non-binary people claim that they are neither man nor woman, but something in between. “Gender expression” is very important to them. But what is gender expression? As far as I can tell, it’s just the clothes that they wear, their haircut, and some other accessories. These are all very superficial things. 

However, these fashion choices all point towards the same look. You know the type, neon hair, baggy clothes, usually a decent amount of piercings. It’s a specific enough style that you can pinpoint a non-binary person when you see one. You can also tell whether they’re a man or a woman. 

I can’t help but draw parallels to the scene kid phase of the 2000’s. A specific style that is a similar style regardless of gender. The swooping hair, black clothes, studded leather accessories. Once again, these are all very superficial, yet it was crucial to their identity at the time. 

They felt like outcasts and they formed an identity around their peers who also felt like outcasts. Remember that common phrase used to mock scene kids? “It’s not a phase mom!!!”. Seems like that phrase very much applies to the talking points non-binary people take now. 

The most grounded explanation for the validity of being non-binary is that we’ve found evidence of seemingly non-binary or trans people in ancient civilization. Most prominently, the “Two-spirited” identity found in Native Americans. 

But just because there’s remnants of it in older civilizations does not make it valid. Mayans cut people’s hearts out to appease the sun gods; native north/South Americans don’t exactly have a history of being pure and humanitarian, nor an advanced understatement of science.

There’s more I could say, but I’ll wrap it up here. I do not hate non-binary people, I just don’t believe they have some kind of magical exemption from the human binary. I think they are attracted to the fashion of it. As far as I can tell, non-binary is the modern day emo. If you want to be referred to as “they” that’s fine and I will do that for you. But pronouns are not an accessory that you can change when you feel like it. You can’t create your own, and you can’t expect people to abandon a lifetime use of a minor, unconscious part of the English language.

I’m pretty set in this belief, but I am genuinely curious if anybody has evidence to the contrary. If this truly runs deeper than fashion, and isn’t “just a phase”, I’d truly love to see it. But as it stands, I believe it’s a fashion trend that trailed behind the transgender movement to avoid criticism."	1110	801	0.73

This isnt just one internet post I see it everywhere it's the reason behind the groomer nonsense and the don't say gay bill, the idea that speaking about these things is inherently sexual. 

The biggest issue I find is that largely this logic is withheld from heterosexual things libs of tik tok will upload a video of a teacher saying they're gay to their students is horrific but they'd never upload a video of a teacher saying they were getting married to their students, or a video of a clearly pregnant teacher even though those things both imply sex just as much as a gay teacher would. Everyone wants to ban gay representation in kids movies but would never do the same for families even though a family directly needs sex to exist. 

Largely the idea only seems to be homophobia repackaged for the modern day."	902	1400	0.75

I’m from Bolivia. I’ve never been in the US but reading why they say they are going downhill makes me think they have no clue what they talk about.


First they complain about their gender ideologies saying they don’t get enough respect. But still you can sue, you can do something about it. Here justice system doesn’t even work so can’t sue and specially not for something like that. Gay people get zero respect and they can be discriminated against. Trans people are almost non existent. The LGBT community is seen as a joke.



They complain about the government and they may be corrupt, but not like ours. The government officials have illegal parties with narcos (recorded) and they protect the biggest cocaine labs in the Chapare. If you dare try say something you risk getting thrown in jail, killed or drown with internal taxes that come out of nowhere. Where in the US have you seen politicians partying with narcos? They can do whatever they want and no one can say other wise. 



Poverty is another one. A poor person from here is not the same as a poor person from the US. The minimal salary here is 2000bs which is less than 300$. You don’t see ‘poor’ people with Iphones and cars. They have to ration everything if they want to eat along with paying everything else.


Here education (unless you were in a private school) is terrible and they fill you with political lies. The books are about our ex-president and they have festivities only for the current political party. Since kids they brainwash them. Would you say it is possible to do the same in the US? I don’t think so. People would complain and riot. The media would talk about it. Again you can do something about it. 



The justice system is non existent. The winner is the one who has more money. All the judges are bought and if you try to do it the right way, you lose the trial. 


Basically all public services have to be bought if you want them to work. Police, health care and schools. I’m having a hard time seeing how the US could be comparable to my country in any aspect."	4022	807	0.89

I think that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is being empowered by the shitty state of human mind in the 21st century, especially the late 2010s and the 2020s decade. 

The primary contributing factor I think is pop culture. In our culture, music, movies, etc. there is frequently imagery of idols who are to be believed and followed at every step. And it's getting worse over time with crap like TikTok and corporate greed of increasingly tighter community guidelines of every website. You know who else is such an idol? Putin. No wonder people idolize crappy politicians if their own media surrounding promotes making an idol for oneself (not being xtian here, just making a statement). 

I think that this is the ""frog boiling"" paradigm. There are plenty of microscopic events which while inconsequential, eventually accumulate to make humans gradually dumber and more degraded.

So, here we are, end disclaimer.* 

We need to stop the “tough on crime” mantra in the US. 

It is far too common on Reddit to see people cheering on vigilante justice of accused criminals being beaten, murdered, raped in prison, you name it. 

It would seem people are forgetting why “innocent until proven guilty” and “when you have served your time, your punishment has been exacted” are principles we have built our society on to begin with.

**Society is more dangerous for everyone when we lose our humanity.** Violent criminals will never peacefully surrender, if they know society will spare them absolutely no second thought as they wither away or get murdered in prison. 

What keeps so many criminals surrendering peacefully is the social contract: You surrender and turn yourself in, and we will punish you in appropriate - but not excessive - measure, and your life will be better than one on the run.

**If we break that contract or fail to uphold our end**, less criminals will ultimately surrender, and those who are on the run will have nothing to lose and be much, much more dangerous.

I despise child molesters as much as the next guy, **but please stop advocating for their rape and lifelong abuse**, which only pushes potential child molesters towards not coming forwards, hiding even better, never seeking treatment for their sick thoughts, etc. 

I despise murderers too, but I’m not willing to put society at risk to make an example of them.

And **all of this** is without even mentioning another massive problem: The absolutely ridiculous amount of innocent people in prison due to plea deals and bad prosecutors, **whom you are inadvertently advocating for the assault, abuse, and death of as well.**

The most common counter-argument I hear is “this is ignoring the plight and needs of the victims.” 

I fundamentally don’t believe this. I don’t believe all victims are unequivocally out for revenge and lose all reflection and nuance when victims of a crime. I’ve been a victim of a crime a couple of times now - I still keep my rational brain around. 

Victims should have an interest in **as few people being victims of the same crime in the future as possible**. This is accomplished by combatting rising crime rates and recidivism.

Guess what has imperially proven itself the best way to do that? 

Through prison systems that focus on rehabilitation and well prepared re-entry into society, not draconian punitive laws and beating up the sex offender in your neighborhood with bats after he came back from his 25 year prison sentence.

I understand the drive to exact justice on some of the people we hear about every day **but the urge and advocating for vigilante violence has to end.**

You’re making society more dangerous under the guise of being “tough on crime” and it’s such an own goal.

We need to be better.

EDIT:

Just to define what I mean by “tough on crime,” I will paste a previous comment here for context:

When I talk about being tough on crime, I’m talking about the specific policies which, in political science, have come to be associated with the term:

•	⁠Mandatory minimums, relatively lax approaches to crimes committed in gen.pop. in prisons.

•	⁠Capital punishment.

•	⁠The notion that getting beaten or raped in prison is part of your punishment and just in some abstract sense, sometimes even funny (“that rapist better not drop the soap in the showers, I doubt anybody is gonna come to his rescue” as if rape is somehow funny now because the shoe is on the other foot)

•	⁠A lifelong sex offender registry which notifies your neighbors and - not that I think any part of the sex offender registry should exist outside of police databases, but to make matters worse - won’t even tell them if you’re on it for urinating in public or for violating a child, because apparently that’s a violation of your privacy, but somehow notifying your neighbors in the first place is not? What!?

•	⁠Broken windows policing, stop and frisk, red-lining, the 1994 crime bill, the cash for kids shit, etcetera, etcetera,  which disproportionally criminalizes marginalized people for minor non-violent crimes and drags them into the cycle of recidivism somehow being okay.

•	⁠The idea that prison cells should be cold and horrible places rather than examples of the life inmates could have if they would break the cycle.

•	⁠The idea that education, job training, and access to news and media is somehow a waste or a privilege to inmates rather than a natural part of rehabilitating someone and pushing them towards a legal, fulfilling life rather than back into the cycle.

•	⁠and on and on and on.

I don’t mean we should pursue or investigate crime less, or certain crimes less, or ignore white collar crime (which you’re right, we absolutely should massively increase enforcement on), but that we should get rid of policies which criminalize people, trap them in cycles of recidivism, and foster apathy through subhuman living conditions which the system then justifies to them, causing inmates and ex-cons to further alienate themselves from society.

Many of these suits were led by republican appointed judges. This eventually also led to Rudy losing his license to practice law.  

2: Testimony from innumerous witnesses, including a vast majority of republicans and family members as well as Trumps own DOJ, stating that Trump both knew he had lost the election and had planned in great detail that if he lost he would in fact say it was fraudulent and claim victory anyway. 

3: That over and over again the many individuals who ended up being convicted of crimes in the Jan 6th insurrection point to Trump as the instigator and motivator of their crimes.

Studies show that Black American households have generational wealth amounting to, on average, less than $30,000. White American households have, on average, around $150,000 in generational wealth.

To me there are two possible explanations for this: one is that external factors (mainly both explicit and systemic racism) have prevented Black households from gaining wealth equivalency with white households. The other is that Black households are unwilling or unable to gain wealth due to their own inadequacies, which is of course a blatantly racist take. 

Make arguments as you will, but it seems obvious to me that if two groups have the same levels of intelligence and ambition, but one group experiences a vastly higher degree of roadblocks (black codes, Jim Crow laws, redlining, etc.) to their ambitions, you would expect that group to naturally fall behind. 

Since black households still fall behind on economic metrics, unless you subscribe to racist ideology, you have to admit that black households still feel the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, if we want these households to truly achieve economic parity, and we truly want an equitable society, those of us who have benefited from a lack of these same systemic roadblocks are responsible for directly repaying those who have been harmed."	4	398	0.52

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metzger-restaurant-cancels-reservation-for-christian-family-foundation/

The restaurant said they wouldn't serve this group because their group is anti-LGBT and anti-choice, and serving them would make a lot of their staff uncomfortable and possibly unsafe (since some of the staff is LGBT). The group reserved space at the restaurant and had their reservation pulled once the management realized who it was for.

I don't see how this is different than a bakery or photographer or caterer or wedding planner refusing to serve a gay wedding. Religion and sexual orientation are both federally protected classes, so it's illegal to put up a sign that says ""no gays allowed"" or ""we don't serve black or Mexicans here"" or ""No Catholics"". You can't do that as a business. However, as far as I know, that's not what the restaurant did, nor is it what the infamous bakery did with the gay wedding cake.

You see, that bakery would've likely had no problem serving a gay customer if they wanted a cake for their 9 year old's birthday party. Or if a gay man came in and ordered a fancy cake for his parents 30th wedding anniversary. Their objection wasn't against serving a gay man, but against making a specific product that conflicted with their beliefs.

The same is true at the VA restaurant case. That place serves Christians every day and they have no problem with people of any religious tradition. Their problem is that this specific group endorsed political and social ideology that they found abhorrent.

Not that it matters, but I personally am pro-choice and pro-LGBT, having marched in protest supporting these rights and I'm a regular donor to various political groups who support causes like this.

So I guess my point is that if a restaurant in VA can tell Christians they won't serve them because they see their particular ideology as dangerous or harmful to society, then a baker should be allowed to do the same thing. They can't refuse to serve gays, but they can decline to make a specific product if they don't feel comfortable with the product. Like that one Walmart bakery that refused to write ""Happy Birthday Adolph Hitler"" on a little boy's birthday cake (the kids name really is Adolph Hitler).

So CMV. Tell me what I'm missing here."	176	807	0.7
