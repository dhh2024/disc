Religions usually also require loads of money so they cannot be seen as separate matters.

Plus no Christian person who thinks God created all resources for humans could accept the second principle that has that producersist and reciprocal emphasis that attempts to justify producerism without the calculability of just deseert.

In the U.S. generally, almost 8% of all bridges are structurally deficient and, more alarming, about ONE THIRD of bridges need repair or replacement, including one third of interstate bridges. If that doesn’t sound like a crisis, consider this: to fix only those bridges that are structurally deficient (ignoring the other repair/replace, at great risk), it would take almost 70 years and 54 billion dollars. Of course, in that time, imagine how many will be further damaged. (See the following, though many sources exist: https://artbabridgereport.org/)

We have an infrastructure CRISIS. It isn’t politically sexy and the problems are mostly invisible (for now). Add in the cost and labor, and it is easy to see why those in charge turn a blind eye. It is almost guaranteed that there will be catastrophic failure of multiple bridges before anyone is motivated to act.

You get MoM basically to get more headshots off. This also involves you actually leaving the lane and killing heroes. While its not such a bad idea, you're just delaying your more important items (in my humble opinion). 

I prefer to go Treads &gt; Aquilla &gt; Maelstorm. People say that you get Phase on him so that you can reposition yourself easily, but I prefer to ability to tread switch to get that extra Assassinate off or the extra tankiness and attack speed. Aquilla is a great early game item that allows you to stay in lane with its regen and solves your crap base damage. Maelstrom procs help you farm as well and can be upgraded to a Mjolnir later on which is way more relevant.

I get Blink sometimes but I find its too gimmicky for me. Yes its great and all for escaping, but that is provided you see them before they're on you. "	1	0	164	2	False	True
