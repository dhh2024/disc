Depending on how the therapist interprets it they could simply worry that you would regardless of your stated intent.

When you say that they won't put you in jail, you're wrong. You could go to jail. You definitely won't stay there, but they could certainly put you there. Like they say, you can beat the ticket, but not the ride.	3	0

There was a bar near me that did that, so I started experimenting. Brie also works well if you like a mushroom onion swiss burger (instead of the swiss).

Another good one for variety is Boursin. It's more of a flavored cream cheese. Very tasty when you want to put lots of salad on your burger.	1	0

If you bring up a point you have to prove it right or wrong. You can't just bring something up and say 'that might be true' that's true about everything. There might be aliens. There might be a giant space whale moving towards earth right now. Theres no argument there and it makes your POV look very weak. Look up Russell teapot theory. Its exactly what I'm talking about. 	-2	1
