&gt;It is a side that is discussed constantly on Reddit.

Despite common belief here, Reddit isn't exactly the real world. A small sub that discusses a various topic can hardly be considered anything meaningful to the overall discussion.	5	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

There seems to be something in our (recent) culture that makes people feel that everything is about me-me-ME! I honestly do not remember anything like this from my youth, about 30 years ago, except from particularly sensitive individuals, that were never taken seriously.

I watched most of the comet landing livestream from ESA, and when Matt Taylor took the stage in his outrageously tacky shirt, I laughed out loud. The impression I got was of someone who was overjoyed and exhilarated to be part of a success, and who dressed for the occasion by choosing to express exactly that kind of giddy happiness, he felt.

Little did I know that his shirt was terribly offensive to women. You'd think, that being a woman myself, I would have caught on, but I needed Twitter to tell me, the day after.

Sorry for being so dense - as dense, it seems, as the other woman who designed the shirt. She must be having a good laugh over how stupid she's been. I'm kidding of course!

Obviously, only Matt Taylor knows for sure why he shose to wear the shirt. My impression - as stated earlier, is simply that he likes it, and it's funny. A very innocent reason really... And what I hate most is to see someone lose their innocence. That's what we had to look at next - a grown man, a brilliant scientist, crying in public, not just - I hope - because he was devastated over the pain he caused feminazis worldwide, but also for his lost innocence. I mean it must be pretty tough waking up one morning to discover that you've been an insensitive misogynist pig your whole life, and you didn't even know it.

This whole affair is symptomatic of the new state of things: People take something out of context, then add their own. The infamous shirt was superimposed on the insecurities and sense of entitlement of certain women, and he became a male chauvenist, the same way that, to some people, I'm a racist simply because I'm white, ignorant and arrogant because I'm old, and shallow and humorless because I'm female. This is how we're labeled before people even ask us.

The worst thing about it all is the disservice done to womankind. Men who are *actually* insensitive misogynist pigs are lapping this up, feeling justified in thinking that women are shallow beings who only care about fashion statements. It's true, we did take a giant leap backwards, but not because of one guys choice of shirt.	93	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

If you’re in professional company, table manners serve a purpose to show that you know when NOT to be casual and that you are taking appearance and decorum seriously.  This can demonstrate that you’re capable of maintaining a professional attitude in other situations, like in a career.

That’s merely circumstantial. If that guy was black, and this white girl followed him and said “nigga” would this change anything? Would the crowed still give her a pass for saying “nigga”? No, they wouldn’t. So that fact doesn’t really matter. 


&gt;He then invited a different girl on stage, also non-~~white~~black, and expected her to do the same. 

The onus should be on Kendrick to make sure she knew what was expected of her. That’s a part where he handled it poorly. He shouldn’t have left it up to chance and just hoped she’d censor her self like the person before her. If the person before her didn’t censor himself the same thing would have happened. 



&gt;Kendrick was a moron, an asshole etc. for this. 

That’s just their opinion and it’s a fair one. 

People can think he’s an moron or asshole for allowing a white person to come on stage in front of thousands of people to sing a song that says “nigga” over 20 times. He has a responsibility to look out for his fans, especially the ones he personally thrusts into lime light. 

That conversation about censoring herself should have happened *BEFORE* any white or non-black person came on stage. 	7	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

As a solution to that, we allow defendants to argue in court that they are not guilty for that reason.

But my point is that there is a lot of change that has happened in the last 60 years without being directly related to conflict. Even though I agree about the point that these changes were inspired in part by the second world war, a) how many generations later does it have to be before we can look at things on their own merits and b) why have not the rest of the mass horrors of human history translated into social change if, as you are positing, violence is the proximate cause of political change? Most of human history has had brutal wars and most of them have not resulted in social change.

Second, what are your goalposts, exactly? Are you arguing that violence increases possible change? to which I would say, yeah, probably, though using Egypt instead of Tunisia as our Arab Spring example shows that change can be negative, and did not lead to an increase of freedom. Are you arguing that violence is a necessary ingredient? to which I would say, well, every peaceful nonviolent protest that DID result in change disproves this assertion, and even if you set a very restrictive bar on ""violence"" you would still be able to find examples. Are you arguing that violence is the most effective means of eliciting change? To that i would say, well, you have plenty examples of how violence begets violence (most civil wars, which in my research do not usually come out the other side with positive social change, they come out the other side traumatized and with one group dominating and then later cracking down on dissent) and violent protests that are unsuccessful because they engendered a crackdown. I would have to look into the research to have a more comprehensive answer, but again, you will likely have a mixed bag of successes and failures with different degrees of peacefulness and violence and in the end so much of conflict is context dependent.

As an aside, you cited slavery as an example of change brought about by conflict, namely the civil war - there is more to the world than only the US. slavery was progressively and gradually abolished through nonviolent legislation pretty much everywhere except the southern united states- it was  abolished in britain in 1833 without violence, as it was in the northern colonies without violence starting in 1775, etc, any ways there is a huge list here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom). 

As a last thought, consider this that in the first time in history, over the last century or so, we are for the first time having the greatest opportunity of alternatives to violence in the sense of having a plurality of democratic countries (woth varying degrees of quality or democratic-ness), rather than monarchies, feudal systems, etc. of our past. So while the democratic or legislative approach might still be finding its sea legs, it may be the ""best route"" if we have a longer time period to compare to the thousands of years of might-makes-right-and-all-dissent-is-crushed. There is a thing called the democratic peace theory which holds that no democratic country will/does/has waged war on another (obviously the relevant question is ""what defines a democracy""), which would then mean that something about democracies has an effect of limiting violence, allegedly because there are other means (legislation, negotiation) to resolve disputes. I'm not 100% behind this one as an infallible law, but it will be interesting to see how it holds up as the number and quality of democracies increases.	1	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

I hope that you're right and they won't attempt to impeach without having the senate votes. But didn't some democratic house members already bring articles of impeachment forward last year, which was largely a symbolic gesture? I still feel like voting him out in 2020 and then indicting him before the statute of limitations expires would be the clearest path to justice . In a perfect world, impeachment would be the starting point to holding him responsible. Once he's out of office, lawsuits would be able to progress and lead to indictments. I feel like some democrats see impeachment as ""the final nail in the coffin"" though, but in reality, the chances of a pardon from Pence are too high for impeachment to have any lasting consequences in my opinion	1	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

I have not been raped personally, but I have had someone threaten to rape me. And it makes a difference.

Rape and other sexual violence pretty commonly leaves the survivors with PTSD. People with PTSD commonly have flashbacks and increased symptoms anytime they're in situations thst remind them of the trauma that caused PTSD in the first place. 

Which is why when the GM of the game I was in started describing a pretty brutal date rape scenario, I went quiet. I was quiet because I was freezing up due to PTSD. I was having flash backs and on the verge of a panic attack. 

I ended up not sleeping that night in favor of crying. 

Yes the fact that you're much more likely to deal with a rape survivor than a stabbing survivor does change how you should approach things.	4	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

&gt; I believe in free-market capitalism with few regulations. 

Free-market capitalism works for some things most of the time, like consumer items, but everything needs some kind of regulation. Our food supply works well in a mostly free market, except that it's a good idea to have safety regulations. Consumer electronics work very well in a mostly free market, but they need to not explode, burn up, emit dangerous or disruptive radiation. There should also be some way to recycle them.

But free markets have little foresight. A free market approach to a pandemic results in a lot of death before action is taken. People have foresight, and can act in ways free markets cannot. For example South Korea used government action to nip Covid19 in the bud, and they haven't suffered economically nearly as much as the US has, and will.

&gt; I believe that if you have a penis, you should go to either the men's room or the family bathroom. 

How are you going to enforce that?

&gt; I believe that illegal immigrants should apply for citizenship or get kicked out because they don't pay taxes and hurt the American workers' salary. With that said though, there should be an easier way to apply for citizenship. 

Back before 1965 (I think), there was a guest worker program where Mexicans could come work the fields seasonally and then go back home when the work was done. Then a law was passed against that, and many decided to stay here illegally rather than go back home and never be admitted to the US again. Since they stayed, and since the US had made it impossible to freely pass over the border for work, others came to the US illegally too, because there was a lot of money to be made.

&gt; Socialism would work for a few years until the point where nobody would want to be rich anymore because the government would take away all of their money. 

I don't know what your idea of socialism is, but most Social Democrat countries are doing well, and have been for a long time. [McDonald’s Workers in Denmark Pity Us](http://archive.is/e18MW):

&gt; Danes haven’t built a “socialist” country. Just one that works.

&gt; The golden age of American capitalism, from 1945 to 1980, was a period of high tax rates (up to 91 percent for the very wealthy), strong labor unions and huge initiatives, such as the G.I. Bill of Rights to help disadvantaged (albeit mostly white) Americans. This was a period of rapid growth in which income inequality declined — and in some ways it looked like today’s Denmark.

&gt; One Republican strategy this year has been to demonize Democrats as socialists who would destroy the economy. Trump warns that Democrats “want to model America’s economy after Venezuela.”
Well, no. In fact, what liberal Democrats have in mind is a step in the direction of the Nordic model found in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland. But paradoxically, while Americans on both left and right often think of Scandinavia as quasi-socialist, Scandinavians flinch at that characterization. They see themselves as simply pursuing market economies, just with higher taxes and greater social benefits than the United States.	0	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

What are you going to do when the fossil fuel reserves in your state dry up? The nation? The continent? Even if we don’t factor in climate change from fossil fuels, it’s a lot better to not be dependent on them, otherwise when we run out, we will inevitably descend into chaos as thousands like you will now be without you, and given how many firearms the US has....

What if I convinced you that Nuclear was not only the better of the two for the environment, but also safer than fossil fuels? Most modern reactor incidents are actually relatively harmless (3 mile island leaked less radiation than the screen you’re reading this from), but improperly managed colliery tips are an avalanche waiting to happen (such as the Aberfan coal tip disaster).	2	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset

You're confusing sex and gender. Biologically deals with sex, not gender. Biologically, your sex is male if you have a Y chromosome. Your gender relates to how you identify in conforming to social norms on masculinity/femininity. Even using current biotechnology, it is impossible to change your sex once you are born, because it is built into your DNA. This is why transgenders don't change their sex, they change their gender. Hence the name trans 'gender'.

Gender: either the male or female division of a species, especially as differentiated by social and cultural roles and behavior.

Sex and gender aren't the same thing: that's why we have 2 different words for such. Your sex is a biological term dealt with in the **natural sciences**. Your sex is completely determined by your [allosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome)  and once you are born it is not possible to change your sex because it is built into your DNA. If you have a Y chromosome your sex is male and if you have no Y chromosomes your sex is female. This is just simple biology (sex identification), but isn't directly tied to gender.

Your gender is a social concept dealt with in the **human sciences**. It refers to how you conform to cultural norms revolving around the behaviors and attitudes tied to masculinity/femininity. See the definition above.

One is dealt  with in the human sciences (gender) and one's dealt with in the natural sciences (sex). No matter what your views on transgenderism are, what  you said was simply using these terms incorrectly.

Also, the phenomenon of being displeased with the gender identity typically associated with that of your biological sex is called [gender dysphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria). According to wiki:

&gt;**Gender dysphoria** (**GD**) is the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) and their [sex assigned at birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment).	3	0	data_driven_civil_discourse_subset
