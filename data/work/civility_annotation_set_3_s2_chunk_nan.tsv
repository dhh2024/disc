It's a bummer he missed their first time in Tokyo. The stage was quite small but still felt empty without him. Fingers crossed for a next time with everyone!	1	0

Seriously? The context is the same, and they're completely opposite statements. I feel like you're backpedaling here.

&gt; It was when they were compiling it that they had to decide which ones to include and which ones not to.

Like I said, they haven't ""disavowed"" a canonical book in over a thousand years. This feels like backpedaling too, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Will you at least concede that the church would not, under almost any circumstances, disavow any book in the canon today?
