Giving her a piece of heirloom jewelry from his family is showing her sheâ€™s important. Thatâ€™s saying he wants her to be a part of his family. It also shows trust because he is giving something that is part of his history and he is entrusting her with it. 

She doesnâ€™t have to explain anything, she doesnâ€™t have to tell anyone sheâ€™s engaged until she gets the ring they shop together for. She can simply say they are going to go pick out rings next weekend.",0,0

He should have claimed it was a finder's fee. Hell, even lie and say he was on the hook for $2k if it went south. That's a white lie that keeps the peace.

I mean I'm not a dad, but it also takes me like two seconds to see this shit coming and how easy it was to prevent it andI would think as a parent spending more time around people who act on baser emotions rather than adult logic would have a better chance of seeing what was obviously coming, but i guess not.

OP is making it out that it's a 2 hour easy train journey. I know London really well, I reckon I could maybe make the journey in 3 hours if all factors were perfect. But I know these stations/exits/entrances and would run for the connection. I'd hate to have to do that with luggage after a long flight too. Giving yourself a comfortable buffer will make it more like 3.5 hours via trains. 

In fairness, the GF really should have got a connecting flight to further up north in the UK. Best case scenario, she's saving Â£20 for a further 3.5 hours of travel if she pre-books a cheap train fare and researches the route ahead of time.",79,0
